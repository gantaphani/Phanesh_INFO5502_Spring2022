donald barbe,after unsuccessfully seeking habeas corpus relief under in the northern district of west virginia,appeals from the district court september dismissal of his petition.barbe was convicted in in the circuit court of ohio county,west virginia,of eight counts of incest,sexual assault,and sexual abuse by a custodian,for offenses involving his granddaughter and one other victim barbe was subsequently denied state habeas corpus relief.in his federal habeas corpus petition,barbe contended,inter alia,that he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel in his state trial,and his sixth amendment confrontation right was contravened when the state circuit court limited his of a prosecution expert.the confrontation issue arose from the circuit court application of west virginia rape shield law,and the circuit court ruling precluded barbe from examining the expert concerning sexual abuse by other men 
although the district court rejected barbe claims on these two issues,it granted him a certificate of appealability on each of them.as explained below,barbe was not denied the effective assistance of counsel.his sixth amendment confrontation right was indisputably contravened,however,by the state circuit court application of a per se rule restricting of the prosecution expert under the state rape shield ruling in conflict with what we term the principle established by the supreme court of the united states.see michigan lucas,d recognizing that,rather than adopting per se rule for precluding evidence under rape shield statute,state courts must determine,on basis,whether exclusionary rule is arbitrary or disproportionate to the state legitimate interests quoting rock arkansas,d.because the circuit court sixth amendment error had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury verdict as to the offenses involving,we are constrained to deem him entitled to some habeas corpus relief.we therefore affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for the issuance of a writ that is consistent herewith.
on september,a grand jury in ohio county,west virginia,returned a indictment against barbe.the indictment included multiple charges relating to three victims involving victim,three counts of sexual assault,three counts of incest,and three counts of sexual abuse by a custodian counts one through nine involving victim,two counts of sexual assault counts ten and eleven and,involving victim,six counts of sexual abuse counts twelve through seventeen.at trial in the state circuit court in december,who was then eighteen years old,testified that barbe,her maternal grandfather,had sexually abused her about a hundred times or more when she was between the ages of four and twelve and residing with barbe and other family members.on,admitted making a pretrial statement to her mother concerning the matter,in which she repudiated her earlier sexual abuse accusations against barbe.she also admitted initiating a meeting with barbe defense counsel,during which she executed an affidavit swearing that barbe had never sexually abused or inappropriately touched her.then asserted at trial that she was testifying truthfully to the jury about her sexual abuse by barbe,and that she had said otherwise on tape and by affidavit in hopes of making the state criminal case go away,because she did not want to have her grandfather go to jail,her family to hurt anymore,or for them to blame her for what barbe did to her.id.at 
after testified,the prosecution called its expert,ruth ann anderson,a licensed clinical counselor,for opinion evidence in the area of counseling,specifically with regard to adults who have been sexually abused as children.on direct examination,anderson testified for the prosecution that she had met with eleven times over a period and,in those meetings,had related three separate incidents of sexual abuse involving barbe.id.at.based on symptoms exhibited at these meetings,anderson opined that had in fact been sexually abused as a child because she fit the diagnostic criteria for stress disorder.in anderson view,very strongly fit that criteria.id.at.the defense then sought to anderson about sexual abuse by men other than that might have caused her psychological profile.before anderson responded to the defense inquiry,the prosecution objected.
in the ensuing bench conference,the defense advised the state circuit court that it had been informed by barbe that had previously accused two other men of sexually abusing her.the defense further advised the circuit court that there were witnesses the hallway outside the testify,based on personal knowledge,about sexual abuse accusations against those men the prosecution argued that the defense was precluded by west virginia rape shield law from questioning the prosecution expert about alleged sexual abuse by other men.see.evid.a the prosecution relied in this regard on the legal principle established by state quinn,at concluding that,absent showing of falsity,alleged victim statements about sexual abuse by others constitutes inadmissable evidence under rape shield law.the prosecution asserted that the sole exception to the quinn principle could be satisfied only if barbe first demonstrated a strong probability that sexual abuse accusations against other men were false.
in response,the defense acknowledged that it could not rely on the falsity exception to the quinn principle,as it wanted to demonstrate that had in fact been sexually abused by other men.the defense sought to show that such not abuse by the predicate for psychological profile.accordingly,instead of relying on the falsity exception to the quinn principle,the defense essentially argued for an additional exception to that principle,asserting that quinn never anticipated us being gagged while an expert says that a victim exhibits all the classic signs of being sexually abused.the defense also contended that barbe would not be accorded a fair trial if he was precluded from presenting evidence of sexual abuse accusations against other men,as an alternative explanation for her psychological profile 
unpersuaded by the defense contentions,the state circuit court ruled that the defense proposed line of inquiry into sexual abuse accusations was barred by the west virginia rape shield law the rape shield ruling.the circuit court made the rape shield ruling on the premise that the defense had neither sought to prove,nor proven,that such accusations were was necessary to rely on the falsity exception to the quinn principle.in such circumstances,as the circuit court saw it,the rape shield statute applies,period.as a result of the rape shield ruling,the defense had to proceed with its of the prosecution expert without inquiring into the possibility that psychological profile was predicated on sexual abuse perpetrated by men other than barbe 
the jury ultimately convicted barbe of six offenses involving counts two,three,five,six,eight,and nine,plus both offenses involving counts ten and eleven.barbe was acquitted on the three remaining charges involving,and all six charges involving on january,the state circuit court sentenced barbe,who was then years old,to imprisonment for not less than nor more than years on july,barbe,through his trial counsel,filed a petition for a direct appeal to the supreme court of appeals of west virginia.in his petition,barbe presented several contentions of error,including the contention that,by its rape shield ruling,the circuit court misapplied the state rape shield law to prohibit the defense from raising sexual abuse accusations against other men during of the prosecution expert.on february,the supreme court summarily denied barbe petition for appeal,with two of the five justices of the court voting to grant the petition.see state barbe,
thereafter,barbe filed a series of habeas corpus petitions and appeals in the state and federal courts.throughout these proceedings,he has consistently and steadfastly asserted that the trial court rape shield ruling contravened his sixth amendment confrontation right.see const.amend vi in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.although he explicitly invoked the principle by name only in this appeal,he previously raised essentially the same proposition,relying on state authorities.as explained above,under the principle,a state court can not impose a per se rule for disallowing evidence under a rape shield law rather,it must determine,on a basis,whether the exclusionary rule is arbitrary or disproportionate to the state legitimate interests.michigan lucas,d quoting rock arkansas,d.
on february,barbe filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus relief in the state circuit court in which he had been tried,seeking the appointment of counsel and contending,inter alia,that his trial had been constitutionally impaired by the circuit court erroneous rape shield ruling.with respect to that ruling,barbe petition asserted violations of his rights to a fair trial,the effective assistance of counsel,and to be confronted with the witnesses against him,all under the fifth,sixth,and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the united states,as well as similar provisions of the constitution of west virginia.on august,the circuit court,acting as the state habeas court,denied barbe pro se petition without either appointing counsel or conducting a hearing.see barbe painter,slip op.at.with respect to the rape shield ruling,the circuit court concluded that,to the extent barbe was merely relitigating an evidentiary question that has been previously addressed,he was barred under the doctrine of res judicata from obtaining habeas corpus relief.id.at.the circuit court further rejected the notion that its rape shield ruling yielded any constitutional violations,specifically addressing what it termed claims of c ineffective assistance of counsel,id.at,and of failure to permit questions on resulting in manifest abuse or injustice under prior state decisions,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the circuit court did not explicitly address barbe assertion that his confrontation both the sixth amendment and its state constitutional also been contravened.
in october,barbe filed a petition for appeal in the state supreme court concerning the circuit court denial of his pro se habeas corpus petition.thereafter,on january,the supreme court granted limited relief,directing that barbe be awarded a hearing on his habeas corpus petition,and that counsel be appointed to represent him.see barbe coleman.
in an amended petition for state habeas corpus relief filed in the state circuit court by barbe new lawyer on september,barbe outlined ten different ways in which his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective,including,but not limited to,counsel performance with respect to the rape shield ruling.barbe also asserted,inter alia,that the circuit court had erred in making that ruling at trial.in a memorandum of law supporting his amended habeas corpus petition,filed february,barbe specified that his sixth amendment confrontation right was contravened by the rape shield ruling.barbe contended that the circuit court should have balanced his sixth amendment confrontation right against right to privacy and,upon doing so,allowed him to the prosecution expert about sexual abuse accusations against other men.among other authorities,barbe relied on state green,in which the state supreme court recognized that m ost rape shield statutes that have been judicially examined though not that of west virginia provide for balancing sixth amendment claims against a victim privacy rights.barbe observed that the state legislature had not heeded the green court advice to amend section to explicitly provide for such a balancing during in camera proceedings,see green,at,but that west virginia rule of evidence a was later adopted to allow for certain evidence of a sexual offense victim prior sexual conduct where the court determines at a hearing out of the presence of the jury that such evidence is specifically related to the act or acts for which the defendant is charged and is necessary to prevent manifest injustice.see supra note explaining that west virginia rape shield law in current form is comprised of both statute,and evidence rule.evid.a barbe further observed that the state supreme court had since invoked rule a in state quinn the very case relied on by the circuit court for its rape shield ruling to provide an example of when a true sexual abuse allegation against someone other than the defendant may be admissible under the rape shield law i f the causation of the alleged enlargement of the victim vaginal area had been an issue at trial,the defendant proposed use of evidence of the victim sexual conduct might not have been prohibited by our rape shield the evidence were offered to rebut the inference that the defendant conduct had caused the alleged enlargement.quinn,at.according to barbe,the quinn court example is analogous to his case,and the rape shield ruling was thus manifestly unjust under rule a,and violative of his sixth amendment confrontation right 
at the time barbe filed his february,memorandum of law in support of his amended habeas corpus petition,the state circuit court had already conducted,on december,the supreme hearing.thereafter,in a opinion dated april,the circuit court summarily denied barbe request for habeas corpus relief and dismissed his amended petition,stating that the petition is without merit,and further is not deserving of a hearing.barbe painter,slip op.at,
as a result,barbe filed his third petition for appeal in the state supreme court,again asserting,inter alia,that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective and his sixth amendment confrontation right was contravened by the rape shield ruling.on february,the supreme court denied this petition for appeal,declining to accord appellate review to the issues sought to be presented.see barbe painter,
on may,barbe filed his federal habeas corpus petition,pursuant to,in the northern district of west virginia.in the district court,barbe once again proceeding pro se presented six grounds for relief,including that he was denied his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel in his state trial the ineffective assistance issue and his sixth amendment confrontation right was contravened by the state circuit court rape shield ruling the confrontation issue.with respect to the confrontation issue,barbe relied on many of the same authorities relied on in support of his amended state habeas west virginia rule of evidence a and the state supreme court decisions in state green and state the proposition that a trial court must balance the defendant sixth amendment confrontation right against the victim right to privacy in assessing rape shield law issues.the federal magistrate judge reviewed and assessed barbe claims and,on july,filed a comprehensive report denying a hearing and recommending that barbe petition be denied and dismissed with prejudice.see barbe mcbride.july.
barbe then filed objections to the magistrate judge report,and,on september,the district court filed the order from which this appeal arises,adopting the recommendations of the report and dismissing barbe petition with prejudice.see barbe mcbride.thereafter,on october,barbe filed a pro se application with the district court for a certificate of appealability coa,pursuant to c.on august,the court granted barbe a coa on both of the claims presented ineffective assistance issue and the confrontation issue.in awarding the coa,the court explained that,even though it had denied relief on these two issues,they could nonetheless be deemed debatable by reasonable jurists.see slack mcdaniel,d where a district court has rejected a petitioner constitutional claims on the merits,the showing required to satisfy c is straightforward the petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.
this court received notification of the coa and barbe appeal on september,and we appointed counsel to represent him on february.in his formal opening brief,barbe specifically invoked the supreme court decisions in rock and lucas with respect to the confrontation issue,contending,inter alia,that u nder clear united states supreme court case law,per se exclusions under state rape shield statutes are impermissible.state courts must make a determination of whether statutory restrictions are arbitrary or disproportionate to the purpose they are designed to serve.br.of appellant.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to and.
we review de novo a district court denial of federal habeas corpus relief on the basis of a state court record.see tucker ozmint,cir.having now conducted such review,we affirm the district court with respect to its denial of relief on the ineffective assistance issue we deem the confrontation issue,however,to be a more troubling and serious constitutional problem,and we thus dedicate the remainder of our decision to it.based on the following assessment,we vacate the district court disposition of the confrontation issue in part,and remand for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus that is consistent herewith.
we begin our assessment of the confrontation issue by identifying the appropriate parameters of such review.importantly,in considering federal habeas corpus issues involving state evidentiary rulings,we do not sit to review the admissibility of evidence under state law unless erroneous evidentiary rulings were so extreme as to result in a denial of a constitutionally fair proceeding.burket angelone,cir.it is only in circumstances impugning fundamental fairness or infringing specific constitutional protections that a federal question is presented.spencer murray,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also estelle mcguire,d explaining that,i n conducting habeas review,a federal court is limited to deciding whether a conviction violated the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.in light of these limitations on the scope of our inquiry,we confine our consideration of the confrontation issue to the question of whether the rape shield ruling contravened barbe sixth amendment confrontation right,without examining such issues as whether the state circuit court properly interpreted the west virginia rape shield law itself.
moreover,we observe the state circuit court as the final state court to fully consider barbe habeas corpus claims failed to provide an explicit explanation for its denial of relief on the confrontation issue in its opinions of august,and april,collectively,the state court decision it did adjudicate the confrontation issue on the merits.see weeks angelone,cir recognizing that state habeas court may adjudicate claim on merits but give no indication of how it reached its decision.accordingly,the state court decision is entitled to deference pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.see d see also fisher lee,cir observing that i f the claim was properly presented to the state court and the state court adjudicated it,the deferential standard of review set forth in d applies.
aedpa instructs us to utilize a analysis to assess whether barbe is entitled to federal habeas corpus relief on the confrontation issue.under the first step of the aedpa analysis,we may award relief only if a the state court adjudication of the issue on its merits resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or b the adjudication resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.and,even if error is identified,habeas corpus relief can only be granted,under the second step of the aedpa analysis,if the error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brecht abrahamson,d internal quotation marks omitted see also delaware van arsdall,d fullwood lee,cir.we now turn to and conduct our aedpa analysis of the confrontation issue.
under the first step of the aedpa analysis,we may award federal habeas corpus relief to barbe only if,inter alia,the state circuit court adjudication of the confrontation issue on its merits resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.as the supreme court has explained,a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the court arrives at a conclusion opposite that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of federal law if the court correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of the particular case,or if the court is unreasonable in refusing to extend the governing legal principle to a context in which the principle should have controlled.conaway polk,cir internal quotation marks omitted.stated simply,a federal habeas court making the unreasonable application inquiry should ask whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.williams,at.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the state court decision involves an objectively unreasonable application of federal law,in that the state circuit court either correctly identifie d the governing legal rule,the principle but applie d it unreasonably to the facts,or was unreasonable in refusing to extend the governing legal principle to a context in which it should have controlled.conaway,at internal quotation marks omitted.because of the sparse and cryptic nature of the circuit court explanation for its denial of habeas corpus relief,we are uncertain if the circuit court failed to assess whether the rape shield law was arbitrary or disproportionate to the state legitimate interests in the circumstances of barbe case,or if it made the relevant assessment and decided against barbe.indeed,the court failed to identify or discuss a single state or federal legal authority including rock or lucas with particular respect to barbe contention that the rape shield ruling contravened his sixth amendment confrontation right.in any event,either of these alternative bases for the state court decision amounts to an objectively unreasonable application of federal law.
by its rape shield ruling at barbe trial,the state circuit court prohibited the defense from the prosecution expert about sexual abuse accusations against men other than barbe.the defense had sought to demonstrate that sexual abuse by other men was the predicate for her psychological profile as a victim of child sexual abuse.the defense contended that,if it was prohibited from questioning the expert about sexual abuse accusations against others,barbe would not be accorded a fair trial.the circuit court sustained the prosecution objection to the defense proposed line of inquiry,however,on the ground that it was barred by the west virginia rape shield law.more particularly,the circuit court,in making the rape shield ruling,purported to rely solely on state quinn.see,concluding that,absent showing of falsity,alleged victim statements about sexual abuse by others constitutes inadmissible evidence under rape shield law.because barbe was not relying on the falsity exception to the quinn principle,the circuit court concluded,applying a per se exclusionary rule,that the rape shield statute applies,period.
as background on quinn,the defendant on trial for sexual misconduct toward a child by a been prohibited from about her statements that she had been sexually abused by persons other than quinn.see at quinn sought to demonstrate that sexual abuse allegations against others were false and,thus,constituted evidence that was also lying about him.see id.at.quinn reasoned that,because statements were false,they were not evidence of sexual conduct within the protection of the state rape shield law.see also supra note quoting relevant provisions of rape shield law and explaining that,in current form,law is comprised of both statute,and evidence rule.evid.a.as the state supreme court observed,however,the rape shield law applied to statements to the extent that the statements were true.id.at.the supreme court then held that,to avoid the exclusion of such statements under the rape shield law,the defendant must establish to the satisfaction of the trial judge outside of the presence of the jury that there is a strong probability that the alleged victim other statements are false.id.at.and,the supreme court concluded that quinn proffer to the trial court fell far short of showing a strong probability that statements were false.id.at.
here,the state circuit court,in making its rape shield ruling,apparently interpreted quinn to stand for the proposition that all true sexual abuse allegations made by a victim against someone other than the defendant are inadmissible under the rape shield,that the rape shield statute applies,period.as relevant to the limited confrontation issue before us,barbe contended in his pro se state habeas corpus petition that the rape shield ruling contravened his sixth amendment confrontation right.and,he expounded on this contention in the memorandum of law supporting his amended state petition,asserting therein with citation to state authorities that the circuit court should have balanced his sixth amendment confrontation right against right to privacy.nevertheless,the state circuit court denied barbe habeas corpus relief on the confrontation issue without explicitly addressing its merits in either of the two opinions comprising the state court decision to which we give deference august,opinion denying barbe pro se state habeas corpus petition,and the april,opinion dismissing his amended state petition.indeed,the court failed to identify or discuss a single state or federal legal authority including rock or lucas with particular respect to barbe contention that the rape shield ruling contravened his sixth amendment confrontation right 
upon investigation,the state circuit its role as the trial court and the state habeas have readily discovered the principle as developed and discussed in rock and lucas,as well as a myriad of other federal and state cases advancing the same legal principle.indeed,the principle was extensively discussed in quinn haynes,cir,where we assessed on federal habeas corpus review the sixth amendment claim in state quinn,the very decision underlying the rape shield ruling.our quinn decision issued after barbe december trial,but before he filed his initial state habeas corpus petition in february.
in rock,decided in,the supreme court assessed whether a per se evidentiary rule excluding testimony refreshed by hypnosis contravened the petitioner right to testify on her own behalf as a defendant in a criminal case.see rock arkansas,d.the court observed that when a state rule of evidence conflicts with the right to present witnesses,the rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice,but must meet the fundamental standards of due process.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the court concluded that,i n applying its evidentiary rules a state must evaluate whether the interests served by a rule justify the limitation imposed on the defendant constitutional right to testify.id.at.importantly,the restrictions imposed may not be arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.id.
four years later,in,the supreme court specifically extended its holding in rock to rape shield issues,by way of its decision in michigan lucas,d.in lucas,the court vacated a michigan ruling that a requirement in the state rape shield statute was always unconstitutional when used to bar the admission of evidence concerning earlier sexual conduct involving a rape victim and the accused.id.at.in so doing,the court recognized that the rape shield statute unquestionably implicates the sixth amendment,in that,t o the extent that it operates to prevent a criminal defendant from presenting relevant evidence,the defendant ability to confront adverse witnesses and present a defense is diminished.id.at.the court further observed,however,that t his does not necessarily render the statute unconstitutional,because sixth amendment rights may,in appropriate cases,bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.id.internal quotation marks omitted.invoking rock,the court continued that r estrictions on a criminal defendant rights to confront adverse witnesses and to present evidence may not be arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.id.at.quoting rock,at.thus,the court rejected the use of any per se evidence rule favoring either the prosecution or the defense,and specified that a state court must determine,on a basis,whether application of the rule is arbitrary or disproportionate to the state legitimate interests.id.quoting rock,at.
in our subsequent decision in quinn haynes,we assessed,on federal habeas corpus review,whether the west virginia supreme court exclusion,in state quinn,of evidence proffered to impeach victim contravened quinn sixth amendment confrontation right.in making our assessment,we recognized and carefully explained that the principle constitutes clearly established federal law.see at t he supreme court has established an analytical framework that courts should use when evaluating confrontation clause challenges based upon the exclusion of evidence,requiring them to determine whether the rule relied upon for the exclusion of evidence is arbitrary or disproportionate to the state legitimate interests.citing lucas,at.rock,at.we further recognized that 
i f the state supreme court holding in state quinn under west virginia rape shield law is arbitrary or disproportionate to the interests the rape shield law was designed to serve,the state supreme court applied federal law in an objectively unreasonable way when it limited quinn presentation of impeachment evidence regarding other allegations of sexual assault.
id.at.we then concluded that the state supreme court exclusion of quinn proffered impeachment evidence was neither arbitrary nor disproportionate to the state legitimate interests underlying its implementation of its rape shield law,and,thus,that the state supreme court did not unreasonably apply federal law when it applied the state rape shield law to limit quinn proffered impeachment evidence.id.at.in short,we assessed the rape shield ruling at issue under the principle,and concluded that,in the circumstances presented,the ruling was neither arbitrary nor disproportionate to the state interests.
one of our sister circuits recently had occasion to evaluate and apply such an approach to a rape shield issue in a federal habeas corpus case.in white coplan,the first circuit,applying aedpa principles,reviewed a trial court decision to bar white,who was accused of sexual assault,from offering evidence that his alleged victim had previously made similar accusations against other evidence of a reasonable probability of the falsity of the other on a rape shield law similar to west virginia.see,cir.relying on rock and lucas,the first circuit concluded that these decisions,clear although general,call for a balancing of interests depending on the circumstances of the case.id.the court of appeals also explained that,even if a state rule of exclusion is generally defensible,it can be applied in an unconstitutional manner to a particular set of facts.id.finally,it recognized that white sixth amendment confrontation right had been contravened at trial,because the state court failure to admit the excluded evidence was an unreasonable application of the controlling principle.id.at.
we now reiterate that the principle constitutes clearly established federal law determined by the supreme court of the united states.the principle clearly mandates that a state court,in ruling on the admissibility of evidence under a rape shield law,must eschew the application of any per se rule in favor of a assessment of whether the relevant exclusionary rule is arbitrary or disproportionate to the state legitimate interests.lucas,at.quoting rock,at.
in making the rape shield ruling at trial,the state circuit court contravened the principle.that is,the circuit court applied a per se exclusionary rule,premised on its conclusion that,because barbe was not relying on the falsity exception to the rape shield law recognized in state quinn,the rape shield statute applies,period.as the supreme court explained in lucas,a court adoption and application of a per se exclusionary consideration of the specific facts of the case,and absent an appropriate assessment of the legitimate competing interests of the accused and the error.see lucas,at.in the state habeas proceedings,barbe adequately presented this contention to the state circuit court.although the issue was then squarely before the circuit court,it failed to conduct the appropriate assessment or,alternatively,failed to explain how it had made the assessment and nonetheless ruled that applying the rape shield law in barbe case was neither arbitrary nor disproportionate to the state legitimate interests.in either event,the state court decision involves an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
we premise our conclusion on several relevant factors that a court should consider in conducting the assessment the strength vel non of the state interests that weigh against admission of the excluded evidence,see chambers mississippi,d the importance of the excluded evidence to the presentation of an effective defense,see davis alaska,d and the scope of the evidence ban being applied against the accused,see delaware van arsdall,d.these factors,derived from controlling supreme court precedent,were aggregated for purposes of the principle in the first circuit white decision.see white,at we examine these factors in conducting our assessment of barbe confrontation issue.
first,with respect to the strength vel non of the state interests that weigh against admission of the evidence barbe sought to utilize,the state indisputably possessed a legitimate interest in having its rape shield law enforced.see white,at citing chambers,at.as judge williams explained in our quinn decision,t he supreme court has recognized that a state has a valid interest in protecting victims of sexual abuse from needless harassment,humiliation,and unnecessary invasions of privacy.quinn haynes,at quoting lucas,at.additionally,a state rape shield law properly serves to encourage the victims of sexual misconduct to institute and participate in legal proceedings against sexual offenders.see.advisory committee note.
second,we must evaluate the importance of the banned evidence to barbe presentation of an effective defense.see davis,at.the supreme court has consistently characterized sixth amendment guarantees in strong terms the rights to confront and witnesses and to call witnesses in one own behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.chambers mississippi,d see also davis,at.the sixth amendment to the constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to be confronted with the witnesses against him.internal quotation marks omitted.
in this matter,barbe effort to the prosecution expert concerning sexual abuse by others was crucial to his presentation of an effective defense.when the expert testified,the defense had already impeached testimony with her previous conflicting versions of her own story,showing that she was a confessed liar.as noted earlier,initially accused barbe of sexually assaulting her,then made a tape recording and executed an affidavit swearing that he had never sexually abused her.thereafter asserted at trial that both her tape recording and affidavit were false and that barbe had,in fact,sexually abused her.to bolster credibility,the prosecution presented its expert,who opined that exhibited the psychological profile of an adult who had been sexually abused as a child,and also testified that had related to her at least three incidents of sexual abuse involving barbe.that testimony,if left uncontradicted and unimpeached,corroborated the trial testimony of and created the sole logical inference that her psychological profile resulted from abuse by barbe.
thus,barbe trial defense on the entirely logical and permissible to show that was not a credible witness,and that her sexual abuse by other men had caused her psychological profile.when the state circuit court barred barbe from questioning the prosecution expert concerning abuse by others,its rape shield ruling undercut and effectively scuttled his defense on the offenses.the jury was thus left with only one permissible psychological profile resulted from her abuse by barbe,and that barbe,consequently,was guilty of having abused 
finally,under supreme court precedent,see van arsdall,at,we must consider the scope of the evidentiary ban invoked against barbe.after the direct testimony of the prosecution expert,barbe was barred by the rape shield ruling from any concerning sexual abuse by other men.as explained above,the of the expert concerning sexual abuse by others was essential to barbe presentation of an effective defense,in that it was his only means to demonstrate an alternative explanation for psychological profile and,thus,the only way to rebut the inference created by the expert testimony.accordingly,although the rape shield ruling only limited barbe of the expert,its scope prevented barbe from presenting his defense on the offenses.
having conducted the assessment,we are thus constrained to conclude that application of the west virginia rape shield law at barbe trial was disproportionate to the state interests in having the law applied.barbe defense was critically impaired by the rape shield ruling and,in these circumstances,the ruling indisputably contravened his sixth amendment confrontation right.the state circuit court,as the state habeas court,thus unreasonably applied federal law by failing to extend the principle to barbe sixth amendment confrontation claim,or,alternatively,by applying that principle but ruling against barbe 
in light of the foregoing,we are obliged to turn to the second step of the aedpa assessment of whether the state circuit court sixth amendment error in the rape shield ruling had a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict.under aedpa,we are not entitled to award relief to a habeas corpus petitioner unless the error of which he complains resulted in,as the supreme court has explained,a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brecht,at.if we are in grave doubt concerning the effect of such a constitutional error,the habeas petitioner is entitled to prevail.fullwood,at.such a grave doubt exists when,in the relevant circumstances,the question is so evenly balanced that the reviewing court finds itself in virtual equipose on the harmlessness issue.id.barbe contends that the sixth amendment error in this case had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury verdict with respect to all of his convictions.we will,in that regard,first address the offenses involving,and then turn to those involving 
as related above,barbe was indicted for sexually abusing three victims,and he was convicted on two offenses involving and six involving,but was acquitted on all six charges involving and three of those involving thus,although the evidence may have established a pattern of abusive behavior by barbe,a reasonable doubt was nevertheless recognized by his trial jury with respect to nine of the offenses alleged in the indictment.as the record reflects,was the key witness against barbe on nine of the seventeen charges.and,importantly,she gave contradictory and conflicting versions of her story on multiple occasions.first,these proceedings began when accused barbe of sexual abuse.then,prior to trial,made a statement,and executed an affidavit,attesting that barbe had never sexually abused her at all.she thereafter changed her testimony again,asserting to the jury at trial that barbe had in fact sexually abused her when she was a child 
in order to deal with the multiple versions of story,the prosecution utilized its expert evidence to corroborate trial testimony and thus buttress the allegation that barbe had indeed sexually abused her.barbe defense
