robert lookingbill appeals the dismissal,as under the limitations period established by the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d,of his petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus we affirm.
lookingbill was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence on april,and denied rehearing on june.the conviction became final on september,on expiration of the period during which he could have applied for writ of certiorari.on november,counsel was appointed to represent him during his state habeas proceedings,and he filed an application for a state writ of habeas corpus on april.on march,the texas court of criminal appeals denied his state habeas petition,and on march he moved for reconsideration of that denial 
lookingbill filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis ifp and a motion for appointment of federal habeas counsel on may.the trial court set his execution for march.on december,the texas court of criminal appeals sent a letter to the presiding judge of the district court indicating that the court had denied the motion for reconsideration without written order.the letter was filed in the district court on december.
on february,lookingbill filed an affidavit in support of his motion to proceed ifp the following day,the federal district court granted ifp status,appointed federal habeas counsel,and granted a stay of execution.
lookingbill filed a petition for federal writ of habeas corpus on july.the state moved for summary judgment,averring that the federal petition was under d.lookingbill asserted that the petition was timely filed and that,even if it was not,equitable tolling excused him.the district court entered summary judgment,then granted lookingbill a certificate of appealability coa on the limitations and tolling issues.
lookingbill argues that the district court erred in holding that his federal habeas petition was not filed within aedpa limitations period.we review de novo the denial of a federal habeas petition on procedural grounds.emerson johnson,cir johnson cain,cir.the aedpa statute of limitations applies to all habeas petitions filed after the act effective date april.kiser johnson,cir.lookingbill murder conviction became final before april.thus,absent any tolling,he had until april,to file an application for federal habeas relief.smith ward,cir flanagan johnson,cir.
the parties stipulated,however,that the aedpa limitations period began to run on november,when lookingbill was appointed state habeas counsel and that the limitations period ran for days from the appointment of state habeas counsel to the filing of the state habeas petition.the limitations period was tolled between april,when lookingbill filed his state habeas petition,and march,when the court of criminal appeals denied the state habeas petition.because lookingbill filed his federal habeas petition on july,it was untimely under d unless the limitations periods was further tolled.
lookingbill argues that two additional events should have tolled the running of limitations.the first was his filing of a motion to reconsider the denial of his state habeas petition the second was his motion for appointment of federal habeas counsel.
lookingbill claims that the motion to reconsider the denial of his state habeas petition was a properly filed application for state or other collateral review that tolled the limitations period from the date he filed the motion to reconsider the denial of state habeas relief to december.this circuit,like most,holds that a properly filed application is one submitted according to the state procedural requirements villegas johnson,cir quoting lovasz vaughn,cir.we interpret the words properly filed narrowly.williams cain,cir villegas,at w e ought not assume an overly broad meaning of properly filed.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,a properly filed application must meet all procedural requirements.galindo johnson,d.if there is an exception to an applicable procedural requirement,and a petition fits within that exception,the petition is properly filed.smith,at.
rule d,plainly prohibits the filing of motions for rehearing in habeas cases a motion for rehearing an order that denies habeas corpus relief under code of criminal procedure,articles and,may not be filed.id.nonetheless,t he court may on its own initiative reconsider the case.id.relying on that rule,the district court reasoned that this discretion was insufficient to make lookingbill petition properly filed.that judgment was correct under fifth circuit precedent when the district court wrote the opinion.
after the district court issued its opinion,however,we decided emerson,which followed the reasoning of artuz bennett,d,and held that,given artuz and texas case law allowing habeas petitioners to file suggestions or motions for reconsideration,aedpa statute of limitations is tolled during the period in which a texas habeas petitioner has filed such a motion.id.at.the court in emerson cited three court of criminal appeals cases in which a texas court had entertained a motion for reconsideration the tolling lasts only as long as the texas courts take to resolve the motion or suggestion for reconsideration.id.
after the parties had filed their briefs in the instant matter,we decided melancon kaylo,cir,holding that the clock should not start running again between the date of the state trial court disposition of a state habeas petition and the petitioner timely filing for direct review at the next level.id.at.accordingly,under emerson and melancon,lookingbill motion to reconsider tolled the running of limitations from march to december.
in a supplemental letter brief lookingbill argues that the district court should have tolled the limitations period until the day after the state district court filed the court of criminal appeals letter if we tolled the deadline until december,lookingbill coa would be timely.
section d tolls the time limit for state applications that are pending.d.in emerson,at,we considered how long a motion for reconsideration tolls aedpa time limit under d.we held that tolling lasts only as long as the texas courts take to resolve the motion or suggestion for reconsideration.our limited holding reflected a serious concern about tolling the deadline for motions for reconsideration filed with the court of criminal appeals absent a timeline for filing and deciding motions for reconsideration,aedpa time limit could toll indefinitely.
the court of criminal appeals resolve d the motion as soon as it decided it and issued the december letter.filing the letter ruling with the trial court did nothing to advance or dispose of lookingbill case the motion for reconsideration did not continue to pend between the court of criminal appeals ruling and the filing of the letter.further tolling would not encourage lookingbill diligently to exhaust state remedies after the court of criminal appeals decision,he had nothing left to do in state court requiring the court of criminal appeals to take further steps after its ruling would only frustrate our attempt in emerson to cabin the tolling period.
lookingbill argues that we should apply texas mailbox rule to toll limitations for three days past when the letter was mailed.first,even if we tolled the deadline for three days,lookingbill coa would be untimely.second,although we are sensitive to state law when determining whether a motion is still pending,federal law still determines the time limits under aedpa 
federal courts interpret the federal time period as running from the event described rather than from receipt of notice for example,in spencer sutton,cir,the court reversed a district court for tolling under aedpa where the petitioner had only one day after the state actual denial to file a federal petition,reasoning that aedpa period suffices,even considering the time it takes for notice to travel through the mails.id.
lookingbill does not point to any other provision of state law to argue that his habeas petition is pending.this makes good sense.no other provision of texas law applies texas law bars filing the motion we are considering.d.in emerson,at,we agreed to toll the aedpa deadline because the court of criminal appeals had in fact considered motions for reconsideration.
trying,as does the dissent,to graft the generic texas rules of criminal,civil,and appellate procedure onto a discretionary motion that texas courts consistently refuse to recognize would be quite challenging despite several opportunities for supplemental briefing,lookingbill did not raise any of the state law arguments that the dissent makes for tolling the deadline past december.
where a habeas petitioner fails to brief an argument adequately,we consider it waived we think it especially unwise to interpret the texas statutes and rules of procedure identified by the dissent,without the benefit of briefing,while relying only on the text of the statutes and rules.then to apply those statutes and rules to a motion that the texas rules expressly forbid risks mangling state law beyond recognition.
circuit precedent requires us to establish a rule that corresponds to when the court of criminal appeals actually disposed of the motion for reconsideration.based on the arguments raised in this appeal,we conclude that the court did so in its letter of december.
because the state court denied the motion for reconsideration on that date,the remaining days expired on july.lookingbill filed his application on july,making it four days late.thus,he can not argue,based solely on emerson,that his federal habeas petition was timely filed.
lookingbill argues,though,that his motion for appointment of federal habeas counsel tolled limitations from may,the date of the motion,to february,when he was appointed federal habeas counsel.he cites numerous cases demonstrating the importance of the right to counsel.he has not,however,cited any case in which a motion for appointment of counsel tolled limitations.a habeas petition is pending only after a petition for a writ of habeas corpus itself is filed.williams cain,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the filing of the federal habeas of a motion for appointment of limitations lookingbill motion for appointment of federal habeas counsel did not toll limitations,so his federal petition was under d.
lookingbill argues that equitable tolling should excuse him from aedpa limitations period.we review a denial of equitable tolling only for abuse of discretion.molo johnson,cir fisher johnson,cir,cert.denied,d.
aedpa limitations period is subject to equitable tolling and is not a jurisdictional bar.davis johnson,cir.therefore,a court may toll the limitations period in rare and exceptional circumstances.id.emphasis added.such circumstances would exist,for example,if the plaintiff was actively misled by the defendant about the cause of action or was prevented in some extraordinary way from asserting his rights.coleman johnson,cir quoting rashidi am.president lines,cir.but,a garden variety claim of excusable neglect by the petitioner does not support equitable tolling.rashidi,at quoting irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d.
lookingbill argues that we should grant equitable tolling for four reasons.first,he claims that he was unduly burdened by not having federal habeas counsel appointed until february.lookingbill,however,did not address this issue in his brief to the district court.that failure constitutes a waiver on appeal dowthitt johnson,cir,cert.denied,d johnson puckett,cir.
second,lookingbill claims that the lack of federal habeas counsel prevented him from filing a federal habeas petition.as the district court pointed out,however,lookingbill was quite aware of the limitations period and could have filed a pro se skeletal petition during the pendency of his motion for appointment of federal habeas counsel.he did not.consequently,he can not succeed on this claim 
third,lookingbill claims that we should apply equitable tolling because his federal habeas counsel was overburdened by a busy docket.he argues that failure to provide equitable tolling would violate the fifth,sixth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments.lookingbill has cited no fifth circuit precedent to support this claim.additionally,as the district court pointed out,operating under time constraints on federal cases is not unusual.thus,we decline to apply equitable tolling just because a lawyer is busy.lookingbill federal habeas counsel had sufficient time to file a federal habeas petition within the limits established by d but did not do so.consequently,this claim fails.
most recently,in his letter brief,lookingbill argues that we should equitably toll the statute because he missed the deadline by only four days.in past cases,we have focused on the reasons for missing the deadline rather than on the magnitude of the tardiness at the margins,all statutes of limitations and filing deadlines appear arbitrary.aedpa relies on precise filing deadlines to trigger specific accrual and tolling provisions.adjusting the deadlines by only a few days in both state and federal courts would make navigating aedpa timetable impossible.such laxity would reduce predictability and would prevent us from treating the similarly situated equally.we consistently have denied tolling even where the petition was only a few days late 
overall,lookingbill arguments for equitable tolling constitute garden variety claim s of excusable neglect.rashidi,at.because there are no rare and exceptional circumstances,davis,at,the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to apply equitable tolling.
all pending motions are denied.
i respectfully dissent.
section d of title,supp.iv provides that the time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.a one year period of limitation applies to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.d.this case presents three questions whether federal courts are required to apply state law in determining whether an application for state postconviction relief is pending within the meaning of this provision if so,whether under texas law the petitioner application for state review was pending at least until written notice was filed in the state district court on december,announcing the final denial of petitioner motion for rehearing by that appellate court and,alternatively,whether the statute of limitations was equitably tolled because petitioner federal habeas petition in this death penalty case was filed untimely due solely to the incompetence and gross neglect of his federal court appointed counsel.each question should be answered in the affirmative,making lookingbill petition for relief timely filed.
the majority erroneously denies lookingbill relief,however,because it mistakenly assumes that it is not required to apply the meaning of state law exceeds its jurisdiction by deciding this case according to federal common law rules of its own unauthorized creation and,in the alternative,fails to recognize that the statute of limitations was equitably tolled.
federal courts are required to apply governing state procedural law in determining whether an application for state relief is properly filed or is pending within the meaning of d.in construing that provision,the supreme court,in artuz bennett,d,held that an application is properly filed when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable state laws and rules governing filings.similarly,this court and other federal circuits have held that a petition is pending from the time it is first filed until finally disposed of and further appellate review is unavailable under the particular state procedures.
despite the controlling precedents of the supreme court and this court,the majority claims that c ircuit precedent requires us to establish a federal common law rule that corresponds to when the texas court of criminal appeals actually disposed of the motion for reconsideration rather than risk mangling state law beyond recognition.without further explanation,the majority then concludes that,under its bright line rule,the state motion for rec
