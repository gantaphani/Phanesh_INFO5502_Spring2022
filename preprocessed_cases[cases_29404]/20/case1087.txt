nanon williams appeals the denial of his habeas petition under,following his capital murder conviction in texas state court.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse and remand to the district court for a full evidentiary hearing on the ineffective assistance of counsel claims on which the certificate of appealability was granted.
factual background 
a.the murder trial 
in,a jury convicted williams of capital murder and sentenced him to death the facts underlying williams conviction are disputed,but we can discern a basic outline of those facts from the state court record.on may,williams,his friend vaal guevara,and guevara friend elaine winn,went to adonius collier apartment to arrange a drug transaction.collier,his friend ammade rasul,and rasul girlfriend,stephanie anderson,met with williams,guevara,and winn.they agreed to complete the transaction at a nearby park.the participants all went to the park in several vehicles.the government alleged at trial that williams carried a caliber pistol and a shotgun hidden in his clothing while guevara carried a caliber pistol.upon arriving at the park,williams,guevara,rasul,and collier went into the woods to conduct the drug transaction.the remaining participants stayed in the cars.
during the course of the drug transaction,gunfire erupted.rasul testified that williams shot him once in the face with the pistol and that he suffered a bullet wound in the foot as he ran toward the parking lot.forensic testimony proffered at trial linked the bullet from rasul foot to williams caliber pistol.rasul and anderson sought medical attention for rasul injuries,and anderson reported the shooting to a houston police officer.thereafter,the police investigated the park and found collier dead body.collier had suffered a shotgun wound to the head.the medical examiners who performed collier autopsy recovered some shotgun pellets from collier cranial cavity and a spent and mutilated bullet,which was marked as.winn,anderson,and another person,identified at trial only as xavier,were present at the park,but the only potential eyewitnesses to the shooting were collier the deceased,rasul,guevara,and williams.williams did not testify.thus,the only eyewitness testimony at trial came from rasul and guevara.
rasul testified that after williams shot him,he ran.while running,rasul heard more shots including,apparently,the shot to his foot.because rasul ran before collier was shot,while guevara stayed behind,guevera story and its credibility were very important.guevara initially testified that he did not fire his gun at all.later,guevara testified that he fired his gun in the direction of collier but did not strike him.guevara then testified that he ran after rasul.he stated that he never actually saw williams shoot collier,but he heard shotgun fire and saw collier feet twitching.guevara also said that he heard williams say no more witnesses before hearing the shotgun fire.
the objective evidence in the case consisted of expert testimony about the ammunition recovered from collier head and the cause of collier death.the assistant medical examiner for harris county,brown,performed the autopsy.brown testified that the shotgun pellets killed collier and that collier was still alive when shot with the shotgun.he based this conclusion on the fact that there was a red margin around collier bullet wound.according to brown,this red margin indicated blood pressure at the time the wound was inflicted.brown did not find any evidence of during the autopsy and could not account for its presence,but he admitted that collier could have been shot with a bullet before the shotgun blast and that the shotgun blast could have then obliterated evidence of a prior bullet wound.
the other expert was a houston police department criminalist,robert baldwin,who specifically testified that the bullet came from a caliber pistol like the one witnesses claimed williams had carried and not from a caliber pistol like the one guevara admitted to carrying.baldwin admitted that he failed to test fire the pistols,but testified unequivocally that his analysis was correct.
williams trial counsel,loretta muldrow,never sought an independent ballistics test or an independent autopsy or examination of the pathology report.even after learning that baldwin had not test fired the pistols in his examination of the ballistics evidence,muldrow still did not request a continuance to have an independent expert further examine this evidence.consequently,baldwin unrebutted testimony buttressed and gave credibility to guevara testimony that he was not collier killer.indeed,throughout the state case,notably in closing argument,the prosecutor made much of the fact that the jury did not need to decide which shot killed collier because the objective evidence showed that all shots came from firearms attributable to williams,not to guevara.
b.the state habeas proceeding 
on direct appeal,williams conviction and sentence were affirmed.in connection with the habeas proceedings,the state trial court ordered the release of guevara caliber pistol and the ballistics evidence.before turning that evidence over,the harris county district attorney office retested the ballistics evidence.in so doing,it determined that had,in fact,been fired by guevara caliber pistol in direct contradiction to baldwin trial testimony.williams used this information as a foundation for several claims in his habeas proceeding.because the certificate of appealability was granted only on the ineffective assistance of counsel claims we focus on the evidence only as it relates to those issues.
in the state habeas proceeding,williams presented baldwin recantation of his trial testimony.baldwin admitted that the bullet came from guevara gun.to complement baldwin recantation,williams also presented an affidavit from ronald singer,chief criminologist with the tarrant county medical examiner office,whom williams retained to independently test the ballistics evidence.singer opined that collier had suffered two wounds to the head,one inflicted by a caliber weapon and one inflicted by a shotgun.according to singer,the shotgun wound could have obliterated the smaller wound if the smaller wound had been inflicted first.singer further stated that the bullet recovered from rasul foot had not been fired from the same weapon as.he opined that,even in its damaged state,and the caliber bullet taken from rasul foot were easily distinguishable,particularly with the aid of a comparison microscope.singer believed that a competent examiner should have had no problem discerning the difference and that baldwin trial testimony at best demonstrates extreme carelessness on his part and at worst calls into question his expertise.in addition to baldwin recantation and singer testimony,williams presented affidavits from two jurors stating that they would have voted differently had they known of the correct ballistics evidence.
williams also submitted an affidavit from andrew krouse,deputy chief medical examiner in tarrant county,whom he hired to examine the autopsy evidence and trial testimony.krouse indicated that the pistol wound from guevara gun alone carried a high probability of fatality for collier.he disagreed with brown trial testimony about the significance of the red margin around collier bullet wound.krouse testified that it was impossible to state with certainty the order in which the two firearm wounds were inflicted or that the shotgun wound was the cause of death.while krouse believed that both wounds should have been listed as causes of death,he also believed that there was a likelihood that was the cause of collier death.
finally,williams submitted trial counsel muldrow affidavit indicating that she should have sought funding for independent experts,particularly a ballistics expert.she opined that had she done so,she would have found a winning defense.
the state trial court granted an evidentiary hearing.singer testified consistently with his affidavit.muldrow indicated that she had viewed the theory that some one else shot collier and killed him as a viable defense,but one unsupported by evidence at trial.she admitted that her deci
