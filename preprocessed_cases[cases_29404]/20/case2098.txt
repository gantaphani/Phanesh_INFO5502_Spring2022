on april,michael newell filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus under.the district court dismissed the petition as untimely,or alternatively for lack of merit,and newell appeals.we vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
in newell was convicted in the superior court of knox county,indiana,of dealing cocaine,and was sentenced to years imprisonment.the evidence at trial had showed that an individual named fred wells,driving one of newell vehicles,met police officer richard mcgee and confidential informant brad foote at a quickstop gas station in vincennes,indiana,where he sold mcgee a bag of cocaine for.mcgee testified that when he asked whether the substance was newell stuff,wells replied,yea,i just came from there.

brad okay,it be all right,bye.
the audiotape and transcript of this conversation,together with the testimony of officers mcgee and holt,were apparently the only pieces of evidence linking newell to the charged transaction.neither wells nor foote testified at newell trial.
on april,newell through his attorney filed his first petition,in which he principally alleges that the state violated brady maryland,d,by concealing pretrial communications that took place between prosecutor lee hoefling and wells.to support his claim,newell presented the transcript of a deposition taken from wells on may,during which wells testified that,before newell trial date,wells met with prosecutor hoefling and officers holt and mcgee and told them that the cocaine he sold mcgee did not belong to newell but instead to an individual named doug jackson.wells further testified in his deposition that he told hoefling that he would not testify against newell.hoefling then allegedly proposed the following deal if wells took the stand at newell trial and refused to testify on fifth amendment grounds,wells would receive only six years for the cocaine charge pending against him.wells accepted this agreement,which was communicated to him by his lawyer,and invoked his fifth amendment rights,first at a pretrial deposition scheduled by newell trial attorney and then again at newell trial.he later received a six year sentence,but not for the drug charge wells stated in his deposition that,had he testified at trial,he would have denied having told mcgee that the cocaine was newell.
according to newell petition,prosecutor hoefling failed to disclose any of the above information,not even in response to discovery requests that would have required its production.newell petition further claims that hoefling affirmatively concealed the existence of wells cooperation agreement,going so far as to cause the records of the knox superior court division to reflect the state objection to wells motion for bond reduction which was granted when,in fact,the state had affirmatively agreed to his release on the date of his cooperation.moreover,newell claims,hoefling told the jury during his opening statement that he had subpoenaed wells but could not predict whether he would testify,and argued that the statement submitted through mcgee testimony was not hearsay because wells was under subpoena,there by implying that he believed wells would testify and be subject to.newell also alleges that hoefling pointed out in his closing argument that newell did not challenge wells statement despite the fact that wells himself had not testified and that,by virtue of the state actions,newell was deprived of his opportunity to challenge that statement by.
newell petition raises a second brady argument that hoefling concealed evidence of the state agreement with foote governing his activities as a confidential informant.newell elaborated on this claim in additional pleadings before the district court,alleging that foote absence at trial was in part the result of the state assistance and that the state had the ability to locate foote at all times.hoefling,however,allegedly told the jury during his opening statement that an individual named david schlomer had threatened foote,and later elicited testimony to the effect that schlomer was a friend of newell.newell contends that the implication of hoefling statements was that newell had participated in the transmission of threats to brad foote and,thereby,contributed to his absence at trial.but,according to newell,a t the time he gave his opening statement,hoefling had no basis for asserting that foote had been threatened by anyone including schlomer and,in fact,no such threats were made.
on december,the district court,at newell request,dismissed his petition without prejudice on the ground that he had presented a mixed petition in the sense that some of his habeas claims have been exhausted in the indiana courts,while other claims are now being litigated in the indiana courts through a successive petition for relief.more precisely,newell had pending a motion for leave to file a successive state petition.judgment was entered on january.
on september,the indiana appeals court denied newell motion for leave to file a successive petition,stating that having examined the petitioner petition for successive post conviction relief the court finds that the petition conclusively shows that the petitioner is entitled to no relief.over two months later,on november,newell returned to federal court and moved to redocket his petition for writ of habeas corpus,amending said petition only insofar as the petition contains references to the procedural status and disposition of his petition for successive post conviction relief before the indiana court of appeals.on november the district court granted the motion and ordered that the judgment entered on the clerk docket on january,is vacated and the clerk shall reopen the action on the docket.
after further proceedings,however,the district court determined that newell amended petition was untimely and accordingly dismissed the case with prejudice.the court first reasoned that newell original filing on april,missed the cutoff date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa by one day.alternatively,the court held that,even if newell original petition was timely,his amended one was not because it could not relate back to the earlier filing date.the court also purported to reach the merits of the case and held that irrespective of untimeliness newell was not entitled to relief because the decisions of the indiana court of principally its decision affirming the trial court denial of newell first petition for relief reasonably applies the law and principles applicable to newell claims as established by the supreme court of the united states.in january this court granted a certificate of appealability on three issues whether aedpa grace period ended on april or april,whether the district court erred in dismissing newell original petition and whether his amended petition relates back to the earlier filing date and whether newell constitutional rights were violated by the prosecutor misconduct.
ii.discussion 
timeliness 
aedpa imposes a statute of limitations on habeas corpus petitions brought by state prisoners,d,but for prisoners whose convictions became final prior to aedpa enactment on april,there was a grace period in which to file.lindh murphy,cir,rev on other grounds,d.in holding that newell original filing on april,was untimely,the district court relied on the following language from lindh,at w e do not doubt that the supreme court would give a plaintiff who files after the enactment of aedpa a reasonable time to get litigation underway r eliance interests lead us to conclude that no collateral attack filed by april,may be dismissed under d.later cases in this and other circuits have also assumed,where the date was not critical,that april,was the end of aedpa grace period,jones bertrand,cir united states,cir guenther holt,cir brown angelone,cir burns morton,cir calderon dist.court for the cent.dist.of,cir,overruled on other grounds by cir united states simmonds,cir.
notwithstanding lindh,however,whether aedpa grace period ended on april or april,is still an open question in this circuit.as we observed in united states marcello,cir,the issue in lindh as well as in cases from our sister circuits proposing april,as the cutoff date was not whether the deadline should be april,or april,but rather whether prisoners whose judgments of conviction had been finalized well before the new law date of enactment should be allowed to seek collateral relief at all.none of these cases discussed the rationale for setting april instead of april as the deadline.our statement in lindh that the grace period ended on april,was therefore dictum and does not control our decision today.
the general rule for computing time limitations in federal courts is federal rule of civil procedure a,which excludes from the computation the day of the act,event,or default from which the designated period of time begins to run.in marcello we applied this rule to,to para,which provides that the limitations period for federal prisoners will run in some cases from the date on which the judgment of conviction became held that,for defendants who try unsuccessfully to take their case to the supreme court,the time limit begins to run the day after the court denies certiorari,thereby giving defendants until the close of business on the anniversary date of the denial to file their habeas motion.marcello,at accord bronaugh ohio,cir.we have applied rule a to calculate other statutory time limits,tribue united states,cir federal tort claims act pearson furnco constr,cir title vii,and in marcello we hinted that it should determine aedpa cutoff date as well.marcello,at.we now expressly hold what was implied in marcello rule a applies to the computation of aedpa grace period,and so any habeas corpus petition filed on or before april,is timely.this step will bring us in line with every other circuit that has directly addressed the applicability of rule a in this context.patterson stewart,cir hernandez caldwell,cir gould jackson,wl,at cir,precedential under sixth circuit rule g rogers united states,cir moore united states,cir flanagan johnson,cir mickens united states,cir see also united states cicero,adopting april,as cutoff date without expressly discussing application of rule a towns united states,cir same.
but this does not end the timeliness inquiry.anticipating that reasonable jurists might differ as to whether aedpa cutoff date was april or april,the district court went on to hold that,even if newell original petition was timely,his amended petition filed on november,was not.the district court seemed to proceed along the following analysis assuming the original petition was timely,its filing tolled the statute of limitations from the filing date april,to the dismissal date december,the statute was running again from the dismissal date to the filing date of the amended petition november,newell motion for leave to file a successive petition was not a properly filed application within the meaning of d,see tinker hanks,cir,vacated by,d,reinstated by cir newell amended petition therefore did not relate back to the date of the original filing because to hold otherwise would permit a person in newell position to circumvent the reasoning of tinker and even if newell original petition were deemed to have been stayed rather than dismissed,his rearrival in the case more than sixty days after the state court denied his motion for leave to file a successive petition was impermissible.
there are several problems with this analysis.first,the district court mistakenly assumes that the filing of a case stops the running of the statute of limitations even if that case is later dismissed without prejudice.elmore henderson,cir if a case is dismissed without prejudice,the statute of limitations is deemed to have continued running from whenever the cause of action accrued,without interruption by the filing of that case.the district court analysis also incorrectly employs relation back principles rather than tolling principles.the court proceeds along the assumption that newell original petition was dismissed,but if that is the case,the relation back doctrine simply does not apply.neverson bissonnette,cir relation back doctrine inapplicable where dismissal of initial habeas corpus petition left nothing for the new petition to relate back to see also marsh soares,cir collecting cases.rather,if newell first petition was dismissed,the court should have utilized tolling principles,as discussed generally in tinker,at.
but these errors are of little import.the crucial flaw in the decision is the district court not recalling that,in its november,order,it already had vacated the judgment dismissing newell original petition and allowed the amended petition to be redocketed under the same cause number.and though the state argued at oral argument that the district court abused its discretion in vacating its earlier dismissal,we conclude that the court decision was entirely proper.when dismissing newell first petition,the district court did not have the benefit of our decisions in freeman page,cir,and tinker,at,which suggest that the federal action should have been stayed,not dismissed,while the indiana court ruled on newell pending motion.see also neverson,at zarvela artuz,cir post gilmore,cir.by vacating the dismissal,the district court effectively converted it into a stay this could not have been an abuse of discretion because we now know that staying the action was the right step to take in the first place.
because newell initial filing was,in effect,never dismissed,the tolling principles discussed in tinker are inapplicable.rather,we are left with a much simplified situation newell filed his original petition on april,and with leave of the district court amended that petition on november.the only question then is whether the amended petition which supersedes the first,kelley crosfield catalysts,cir relates back to the initial filing date.see.c.
rule c permits relation back where the claims in an amended pleading are based on the same core of facts advanced in the original.bularz prudential ins.of,cir.here,newell amended petition is substantively identical to his only change reflecting the disposition of his therefore falls within the scope of the rule.see bcs fin.united states,cir amendments that merely correct technical deficiencies in earlier pleading meet the rule c test and will relate back charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed same.granted,we have not yet decided whether rule c applies to habeas corpus proceedings.we see no reason,however,why it should not apply.rule of the rules governing section cases in the united states district courts provides that t he federal rules of civil procedure,to the extent that they are not inconsistent with these rules,may be applied,when appropriate,to petitions filed under these rules.the rules do not consider whether an amended petition can relate back to the filing date of the original rule c of the rules therefore governs.see johnson united states,cir because the rules governing section proceedings do not address amend
