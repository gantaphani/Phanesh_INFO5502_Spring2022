stephen toliver was convicted by a jury of intentional homicide as a party to a crime,in violation of sections and of the wisconsin statutes.toliver was sentenced to life in prison.after exhausting his state remedies,he filed in the district court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.see.the district court denied relief,and toliver timely appealed to this court.
for the reasons set forth in this opinion,the judgment of the district court is reversed,and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
backgrounda.the facts and toliver criminal trial 
toliver state conviction arose out of the murder of tina rogers.in,toliver and his brother,oliver toliver,were living with commosie thompson,foster and tina rogers.thompson was selling drugs out of the residence and discovered that in drug proceeds was missing.thompson told toliver,who had been serving as thompson drug courier,about the missing money.toliver informed thompson that rogers had taken it.
toliver then told his brother oliver to strap up both men grabbed firearms and went looking for rogers,ex.at.both foster and thompson testified that,from their observations that evening,they did not believe that toliver or oliver intended to harm rogers upon finding her.toliver testified that he had told oliver to strap up because their house had been shot up several weeks after rogers had moved into the house and they suspected that rogers boyfriend,whom toliver believed to be violent,had been involved in the shooting,ex.at.
upon finding rogers,toliver and oliver brought her back to the residence upon their arrival,thompson,corey henry,darian robinson and foster were present.once inside,toliver began questioning and arguing with rogers about the missing money rogers denied taking it.foster testified that oliver,who had a handgun in his hand,went over to toliver,who also was holding a firearm,and whispered something.toliver then began yelling at rogers toliver then tossed his shotgun next to thompson and told him to shoot whomever he thought had stolen the money including toliver himself thompson did not respond,and toliver picked up the shotgun.
at this point,oliver moved aggressively toward rogers,but toliver pushed him away.henry testified that toliver had told oliver to chill out and sit down,ex.at.toliver then asked thompson what he intended to do.thompson responded,whatever is clever,ex.at.robinson testified that toliver had asked thompson whether he was sure.thompson testified that toliver then had stepped back.oliver then got up and shot rogers once in the forehead at pointblank range.
what toliver said next remained in dispute at trial.thompson and robinson each testified that they heard toliver say some variation of k ill that bitch,kill her,ex.at,ex.at.foster testified that,after hearing the first gunshot,she reentered the room and saw both toliver and oliver standing by rogers,who was slumped on the floor bleeding profusely oliver had his gun pointed at rogers head.foster testified that she then heard toliver say,shoot the bitch,ex.at.toliver,however,testified at trial that he had said,you done killed the bitch,ex.at.after toliver comment,oliver again shot rogers in the head.
wisconsin state court and district court proceedings 
on january,stephen toliver was convicted by a jury in the milwaukee county circuit court of intentional homicide as a party to a crime,in violation of sections and of the wisconsin statutes.the court sentenced him to life imprisonment.after sentencing,toliver filed a pro se appeal.
on direct appeal to the court of appeals of wisconsin,toliver brought,inter alia,a sufficiency of the evidence claim.toliver argued that the evidence against him was circumstantial and insufficient.the wisconsin appellate court rejected this characterization of the evidence,explaining that 
w e need not belabor the facts further to determine that they overwhelmingly establish that stephen instigated the homicide,enlisted his brother oliver assistance,and intended to cause rogers death.although oliver immediately caused rogers death,it was stephen who intentionally directed it and assisted in it.
stephen argues that the evidence was circumstantial.it was not.four eyewitnesses testified to rogers bloody and merciless murder at the hands of the tolivers.
state toliver,at.may,ex.c.the wisconsin appellate court also stated the facts overwhelmingly establish toliver culpability,indeed his leadership,for this savage murder.four eyewitnesses evidence,the murder weapon and toliver shotgun,the wrappings for rogers body and a plethora of other evidence were presented or described to the jury.id.at.the court affirmed toliver conviction.
one judge concurred in the court judgment but did not join in the reasoning of the majority in all respects.id.at.although he did not state whether he agreed with the majority characterization of the evidence against toliver,the concurring judge noted,on several issues,i am troubled by the way in which the majority seems to ignore or inadequately address toliver arguments.id.
after the supreme court of wisconsin denied toliver petition for review,he proceeded under,and exhausted,his wisconsin state habeas remedies.
toliver then filed a habeas petition under in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin.on november,the district court granted conditionally toliver petition on the ground that he had been deprived of his right to counsel during his pro se direct criminal appeal in wisconsin state court.wisconsin ex rel.toliver mccaughtry,d.the district court ordered that toliver be released or that the state court permit him to refile his direct appeal with the assistance of counsel.
the state chose the latter course,and toliver,represented by counsel,consequently returned to the state trial court as part of his reinstated direct appeal toliver contended,inter alia,that his trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance of counsel and that the prosecution had failed to disclose exculpatory evidence.
with respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim,toliver submitted affidavits from angeal toliver and harvey toliver.the affidavits,which we describe in more detail below,disclosed that these two individuals had offered to testify on toliver behalf.according to toliver,the testimony offered in the affidavits tended to show that oliver had acted alone when he shot rogers and that toliver did not otherwise intentionally aid and abet oliver murder of rogers.toliver argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call angeal toliver to testify during his criminal trial and,in the case of harvey toliver,for failing to interview him.
with respect to the exculpatory evidence claim,toliver submitted an affidavit from cornell smith.the affidavit,which we also discuss in more detail below,disclosed the existence of a letter that smith claims to have sent to toliver prosecutor prior to the criminal trial.according to the affidavit,the letter that smith allegedly had sent to the prosecutor disclosed statements that also tended to show that oliver had acted alone when he shot rogers and that toliver had attempted to dissuade oliver from killing rogers.toliver argued that smith letter constituted exculpatory evidence that was not,but should have been,disclosed to him prior to trial.
the state trial court denied toliver motion,and he appealed these two issues,among others,to the court of appeals of wisconsin.the court of appeals of wisconsin,as discussed in more detail below,affirmed toliver conviction as well as the trial court denial of relief.state toliver,wl,hereinafter toliver ii.the court held that the evidence against toliver was overwhelming and that,therefore,there was no reasonable probability of a different result had toliver counsel called angeal toliver and harvey toliver to testify or had the contents of smith letter been disclosed to toliver defense counsel.
toliver then filed another habeas petition under in the eastern district of wisconsin.the district court denied that petition on january.toliver timely filed a notice of appeal and requested from the district court a certificate of appealability.on april,the district court granted toliver request for a certificate of appealability coa on four of the six issues that he raised before that court.after studying the briefs and the record and after oral argument,we granted a coa on the remaining two issues.see c.both the state and toliver subsequently submitted supplemental briefs.
discussiona.habeas corpus standards of review 
we review de novo the district court denial of a habeas petition.daniels knight,cir.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,we may grant habeas relief only if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,d.
to grant habeas relief under the contrary to clause,we must find that the state court reached a result opposite to that reached by the supreme court on materially indistinguishable facts.see terry williams taylor,d jackson miller,cir.to warrant relief under the unreasonable application clause,a habeas petitioner must show that the state court decision unreasonably extended a clearly established supreme court precedent to a context where it should not have applied or unreasonably refused to extend such a precedent to a context where it should have applied.jackson,at.furthermore,the state court decision must be both incorrect and unreasonable.washington smith,cir see also terry williams,at.the state court factual findings are presumed correct this presumption can be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.see e cockrell,d see also barrow uchtman,cir.
ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
toliver submits that he was deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel and that,in holding otherwise,the court of appeals of wisconsin unreasonably applied strickland washington,d.in connection with his motion,toliver submitted two from angeal toliver and another from harvey that each affiant would have testified on toliver behalf.we turn to the substance of those affidavits.
angeal toliver affidavit recounts a conversation that she had with toliver mother and foster,who had been present in the house during rogers murder and testified against toliver.toliver mother and angeal asked foster what had happened on the evening of the rogers murder.foster told them that toliver had nothing to do with rogers murder.that evening,foster explained that she was in her bedroom when she heard a gunshot she then yelled toliver name and looked out her bedroom door.at that point,foster saw toliver trying to wrestle a gun away from oliver and heard toliver exclaim,y ou shot the bitch,or something like that,ex.at.oliver then shot rogers again,after which toliver succeeded in wrestling the gun away from oliver.foster explained that the reason that she had not told the police this was because the police had threatened to charge her.angeal affidavit concludes by stating that she had explained all of this to toliver trial counsel and that he had told her that he was placing her on toliver witness list.angeal,however,was never called to testify.
harvey toliver affidavit relates a conversation that he had with the toliver brothers after the rogers murder.while the toliver brothers were driving harvey home,harvey asked them why the police were questioning them about the rogers murder.toliver immediately said,b ecause this crazy nigger,meaning oliver,killed her,ex.at.harvey inquired as to oliver motive in killing rogers.according to harvey,oliver said,b ecause she was a dope feined sic bitch and deserved to die.id.toliver then became upset and responded by telling oliver,y ou should have killed her because it was any of our business if this woman did or did steal commosie dope and money,it was your business.id.oliver stated that rogers had made him angry when she laughed after commosie asked her if she stole his money,so he shot the bitch and he said he did like her anyway.id.harvey affidavit continues to explain that toliver told oliver that he was not going to take the blame for him and that if they got arrested that oliver would have to take his own weight because he,toliver,will tell the police the truth about what happened.id.oliver stated that he would accept that if it came to that and he would confess to what he did because he would let his brother,toliver,take the blame for what he had done.id.toliver then expressed regret at having helped oliver move rogers body and said it was stupid on his part.id.
harvey affidavit then recounts how toliver had called harvey from a county jail and had explained that oliver had confessed to the murder but then had claimed that the confession had been coerced.toliver asked harvey if he would be willing to speak with toliver counsel and relate the conversation that he had had with the toliver brothers.harvey affidavit states that he expressed some reluctance about taking sides between the two brothers,but he ultimately told toliver that he would speak to toliver counsel if it became necessary.toliver told harvey that he should expect to hear from his counsel soon.the affidavit explains that toliver counsel never contacted harvey.
on direct review,the court of appeals of wisconsin rejected on the merits toliver ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the appellate court correctly identified the supreme court decision in strickland as governing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.under strickland,a defendant must prove that his lawyer fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.in this case,the appellate court dismissed toliver strickland claim on the prejudice prong,without addressing the deficient performance prong.
as for angeal statement,the court noted that toliver argued that the statement would have impeached foster testimony that toliver said shoot the bitch.toliver ii,wl,at.the court,however,concluded that no prejudice could have resulted from trial counsel failure to call her because the statement qualifier,or something like that,would not have resolved the conflict between the two versions of toliver statement.id.the court did not discuss the remainder of the statements contained in the affidavit.
as to harvey statement,the court similarly found that no prejudice resulted from the failure to interview or to call him.despite noting that harvey toliver testimony could have established that oliver had his own reasons for shooting rogers,the court held that it would not have reduced stephen participation in the homicide.id.at.the court concluded for the abundant reasons we have recited,stephen took several direct and powerful actions that were substantial factors in causing rogers death,regardless of the personal animus oliver may have felt that led him to pull the trigger.thus,any failure to call harvey toliver to testify was not prejudicial.id.
the district court concluded that the wisconsin appellate court application of strickland had not been unreasonable.the district court stated as the court of appeals previously explained,toliver did,in fact,take several direct and powerful actions that were substantial factors in causing rogers death based on the foregoing,this court can not conclude that the state court determination that toliver was not prejudiced by his trial counsel failure to call angeal toliver and harvey toliver is contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established supreme court precedent.at quoting toliver ii,wl,at.
toliver contends that the court of appeals of wisconsin unreasonably applied the strickland standard in rejecting his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.toliver argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance because counsel failed to call angeal to testify and also failed to interview or call harvey.toliver contends that the testimony of these two witnesses would have aided significantly his defense.angeal testimony would have contradicted foster trial testimony that toliver directed oliver to shoot rogers,and harvey testimony would have established that oliver had his own reasons for killing rogers.toliver contends that the wisconsin court application of the strickland test was objectively unreasonable.
the state contends that the wisconsin appellate court reasonably concluded that angeal toliver testimony would have been inconsequential to stephen toliver trial and that harvey toliver testimony would not have reduced or lessened stephen participation in tina rogers killing.appellee br.at.it contends that the state court strickland analysis was within the range of defensible positions.id.citing mendiola schomig,cir.
a state habeas petitioner seeking relief based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel faces a substantial burden.under strickland,a defendant must prove that his lawyer fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.a reasonable probability is defined as a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.strickland builds in an element of deference to counsel choices in conducting the litigation,we have explained,and section d adds a layer of respect for a state court application of the legal standard.holman gilmore,cir.thus,under aedpa,a habeas petitioner must show that the state court application of strickland was both incorrect and is,lying well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.raygoza hulick,cir quoting hardaway young,cir.
we turn to toliver argument that his trial counsel fell below an objective standard of first prong of the strickland test.
the court of appeals of wisconsin did not engage in an analysis of the first prong of strickland,which asks whether counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.as a result,federal review of this issue is not circumscribed by a state court conclusion,and our review is de novo.wiggins smith,d.
it is well established that trial counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigation unnecessary.strickland,at.stanley bartley,cir.after conducting an investigation or making a reasonable decision that investigation is unnecessary,counsel may make a legitimate strategic decision not to call a witness if he makes a determination that the testimony the witness would give might on balance harm rather than help the defendant.foster schomig,cir quoting hall washington,cir.
at this point in the litigation,the state position is that the state courts were correct in determining that the second prong of the strickland test had not been met because the requisite degree of prejudice had not been shown.therefore,it does not address whether the performance of toliver counsel was constitutionally adequate.
nothing in the record before us suggests how angeal toliver and harvey toliver testimony could have harmed toliver defense.on this record,the only reason that we can discern for not calling angeal and harvey was their relationship with toliver and the resulting possibility of bias.harvey is toliver cousin and angeal is his wife and the mother of his children.consequently,the jury might have dismissed their testimony.nevertheless,given the nature of toliver defense,which we discuss in more detail below,and the probative and corroborative testimony that angeal and harvey would have provided,these witnesses possible bias does not provide a basis for counsel failure to call them.see,united states ex rel.hampton leibach,cir noting,in a case in which eyewitness testimony was critical,that bias certainly is a circumstance that a factfinder would consider in weighing the witness credibility,but it is not so impeaching that one can wholly discount the import of their testimony and the effect that it might have had on a jury.even more fundamentally,counsel could not have made a reasonable strategic decision not to call harvey without interviewing him in order to evaluate his proposed testimony,his credibility or his demeanor.see davis lambert,cir washington smith,cir see also strickland,at.angeal and harvey testimony provided unique information,available from no other witnesses,that was corroborative of toliver claim that he had not urged oliver to kill rogers but actually had attempted to dissuade him from doing so.
consequently,on the record as presently constituted,it appears that the performance of toliver trial counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.as we discuss later,this first prong of the strickland test must be addressed more extensively by the district court on remand.
in this case,the wisconsin appellate court correctly identified strickland as governing the determination of whether toliver had received ineffective assistance of counsel.its analysis of strickland prejudice prong,however,fell outside the bounds of objective reasonableness.
in regard to the prejudice that resulted from counsel failure to call angeal and to interview and call harvey,the court of appeals of wisconsin failed to apprehend the nature of toliver defense.it therefore failed to assess how their testimony might have enhanced the possibility of that defense succeeding.
toliver does not dispute that he and oliver armed themselves prior to going out to search for rogers,that he and oliver brought her back to the house at thompson request or that he was present when oliver shot rogers.he does maintain,however,that his role in the events that led to rogers murder ought to be characterized differently.more specifically,toliver submits that there is limited evidence supporting the conclusion that he directed or encouraged oliver to shoot rogers or otherwise intentionally aided and abetted in oliver murder of rogers.he points out that he was the one who pushed away oliver,his brother and the shooter,when oliver moved aggressively toward rogers and that he told oliver to calm down.toliver also attempted,as he portrays the facts,to diffuse the situation by tossing his weapon to thompson and inviting him to shoot anyone,even toliver,who thompson believed had taken from the stash shoot me or whoever you think stole the money,ex.at.he also claims to have pointed out to thompson that rogers status as a cocaine user did not necessarily make her the thief.finally,he contends that his exclamation after oliver shot rogers was not one of encouragement but of anger or surprise.
the combination of angeal and harvey testimony no doubt would have enhanced significantly the chances of the jury accepting toliver characterization of the facts,thereby affording toliver a reasonable probability of a different result at trial.see stanley,at goodman bertrand,cir noting the importance of analyzing the synergistic prejudicial effect of counsel multiple failings.had harvey testified to oliver statements that he oliver had shot rogers because he disliked her and because she had made him angry when she laughed after commosie had asked her if she had stolen from the stash,the jury would have been able to evaluate more accurately the dynamics of the very fluid and volatile situation in that house,as well as the motivations of the dramatis personae.although the wisconsin appellate court conceded that harvey toliver testimony could have established that oliver had his own reasons for shooting rogers,it nevertheless concluded that this testimony would have made no difference because toliver took several direct and powerful actions that were substantial factors in causing rogers death,regardless of the personal animus that oliver may have felt that led him to pull the trigger.toliver ii,wl,at.this brief conclusion significantly understates the importance,for purposes of toliver defense,of establishing that oliver had an intense dislike for rogers and therefore his own reasons for shooting her contrary to the wishes of toliver.lesko owens,cir it is generally recognized that evidence of motive may be probative of specific intent.indeed,the wisconsin appellate court conclusion wholly ignores toliver defense and the weakness of the state evidence with respect to whether toliver intentionally aided and abetted in rogers murder.
the court of appeals of wisconsin summarily dismissed angeal affidavit because foster statement that toliver exclaimed you shot the bitch was qualified by or something like that.toliver ii,wl,at.angeal testimony,however,would have served to impeach foster trial testimony,which was that toliver had said shoot the bitch,ex.at.it would have indicated that foster herself was uncertain about exactly what toliver had exclaimed after oliver shot rogers exactly what toliver exclaimed after oliver fired the first shot is a critical point bearing on his intent,especially given that numerous witnesses,including the state witnesses,testified that,moments earlier,toliver had pushed oliver away and told him to calm down when oliver moved aggressively toward rogers.
two of the state witnesses,moreover,testified that,from their observations inside the house,they did not believe that either toliver or oliver intended to harm rogers upon bringing her back to the house,ex.at testimony of thompson stating that he thought that toliver and oliver simply were going to scare rogers for purposes of getting her to tell the truth about who had stolen from the stash,ex.at,testimony of foster testifying that she expected that the men were going to have an argument with rogers about whether she had stolen the money but that she did not expect rogers to be harmed.this testimony,combined with angeal testimony impeaching foster testimony incriminating toliver,suggests that toliver had no intention of aiding and abetting in rogers murder and might even suggest that toliver was attempting to protect rogers from oliver.
furthermore,the wisconsin appellate court ignored another extremely probative portion of angeal affidavit that foster had seen toliver attempting to wrestle the gun away from oliver immediately after oliver first shot rogers but before oliver shot rogers the second time.this testimony is inconsistent with foster testimony at trial in which she indicated that toliver simply was standing near rogers after the first shot.had the jury heard that toliver had attempted to take the gun away from oliver,it might well have believed toliver testimony that he had exclaimed you shot the bitch in surprise or anger.indeed,the jury also might well have concluded that,when oliver shot rogers,he acted not only alone but against the wishes of toliver.accordingly,we believe that the combination of angeal and harvey testimony could have created a significant doubt as to whether toliver,despite his prominence that night,intentionally aided and abetted in the murder of rogers.
the wisconsin courts,on direct appeal and on the reinstated direct appeal,consistently have characterized the evidence against toliver as overwhelming.the evidence undoubtedly establishes that toliver played some role in the events that led to rogers murder.to convict him for intentional homicide,however,the state had the burden of proving that toliver intentionally aided and abetted in rogers murder.on this element,it would be difficult to characterize the state evidence as anything near overwhelming.viewed in this light,counsel double failure to call angeal to testify and to interview or call harvey was prejudicial.given the weakness of the state evidence on intent,there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of toliver trial would have been different.see strickland,at.
we also believe that the wisconsin appellate court brief and cursory analysis of strickland prejudice prong was not only incorrect,but unreasonable.as we have discussed,the wisconsin appellate court considered angeal and harvey testimony in isolation,and it failed to evaluate angeal and harvey testimony in light of toliver defense and the nature of the state case against him.see hampton,at concluding that a state court application of strickland prejudice prong was unreasonable because the state court had turned a blind eye to the nature of the state case.although the appellate court recognized that harvey testimony would have affected the jury evaluation of oliver motivation in shooting rogers,the court failed to consider the implications of this observation within the context of toliver defense as well as the weakness of the state evidence with respect to whether toliver intentionally aided and abetted in rogers murder.
brady claim 
toliver submits that he was deprived of his right to due process of law when the wisconsin court failed to grant him a new trial in light of the prosecutor failure to disclose to him the cornell smith letter that the prosecutor allegedly had received prior to toliver trial.in the affidavit submitted with toliver motion,smith alleged that he had written a letter to toliver prosecutor dated june.in this letter,smith had asked the prosecutor to speak with another prosecutor in another county in support of smith attempt to obtain favorable treatment with respect to charges then pending against him in that county.in return,smith offered to testify in the pending proceedings against toliver and to relate the substance of a telephone conversation in which thompson and henry had related their versions of the events that ended with the death of tina rogers.
after summarizing the substance of smith affidavit and the decisions of the wisconsin appellate court and the district court,we shall turn to toliver arguments.
according to smith affidavit,during that telephone conversation,thompson related that he had thought that rogers had stolen some of his money and cocaine.because of this suspicion,the affidavit continued,toliver and others had tracked down rogers and brought her back to the house.once back at the house,thompson asked rogers why she had stolen from his stash.rogers replied by laughing.at that point,oliver became angry over rogers reaction to the accusation and attempted to take hostile action against her.toliver,however,pushed him back and told him to back off or chill out,ex.at.smith affidavit continues by relating that thompson told him that oliver did not like rogers because she was usually high on cocaine and had denied oliver sexual advances.henry confirmed thompson statements,the affidavit asserts,by yelling in the background.
smith affidavit continues by recounting that,after describing oliver burst of anger toward rogers,thompson further described how toliver had told him that rogers did not steal from the stash even though she was an addict.after these statements in defense of rogers,toliver threw his weapon to thompson and told him to shoot whomever he believed had taken from the stash shoot me or whoever you think stole it,id.all of a sudden,there was a shot,not from toliver weapon but from oliver gun.toliver then grabbed at oliver and yelled you killed the bitch.id.thompson,along with others,ran from the house.
henry then got back on the phone,recounts the affidavit.smith asked him why toliver had been charged if oliver had done the shooting.henry replied that the prosecutor wanted to prosecute both toliver and his brother oliver for the shooting and that smith and henry had been told that they would be charged with murder if they did not cooperate.the day after the shooting,thompson had spoken with his mother who told him to keep quiet.
the affidavit concluded by recounting that the prosecutor had replied to smith letter the prosecutor had stated that he could not help smith with respect to his prosecution in another county and that smith information did not shed any new light on the pending case against toliver.
the court of appeals of wisconsin acknowledged that the suppression of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.toliver ii,wl,at quoting brady maryland,d.the appellate court also acknowledged that this duty applies to impeachment,as well as exculpatory,evidence.id.citing strickler greene,d.finally,the court noted that such evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability tha
