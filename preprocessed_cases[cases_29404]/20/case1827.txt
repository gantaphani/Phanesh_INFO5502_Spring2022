background 
in dennis emerson and richard jackson,his brother,robbed robert ray and ray girlfriend,delinda byrd,at gunpoint.emerson and jackson then tied the victims hands and feet,and emerson stabbed ray twice in the chest with a pair of scissors.ray survived by playing dead.according to ray testimony,emerson then approached byrd and brought his hands down upon her body in a stabbing motion.because ray was playing dead,he did not look directly at the strike and therefore did not actually see emerson stab byrd.emerson and jackson then left the room and set fire to the building as they fled.ray escaped,but byrd died from a stab wound.emerson was charged with the murder of byrd,attempted murder of ray,armed robbery of both victims,and arson.
this case arrives here with a long and complicated history in state and federal courts,most of which is not relevant to this appeal emerson was convicted in illinois state court of murder,attempted murder,and armed robbery,and he was sentenced to death.see people emerson,cert.denied,d.emerson later petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under based on a sentencing issue.the federal district court granted the petition and required resentencing.united states ex rel.emerson gramley,aff,cir.
the circuit court of cook county held a new sentencing hearing,which forms the basis of this appeal.the hearing focused on whether the state could prove a particular aggravating in the course of armed robbery.emerson counsel maintained during closing argument that emerson was ineligible for the death penalty because the state failed to prove that emerson actually struck the fatal blow that led to delinda byrd death.the court instructed the jury in relevant part 
before emerson may be found eligible for a death sentence under the law,the state must prove the following propositions 
first that emerson was years old or older at the time of the commission of the murder and 
second that the following statutory aggravating factor exists 
the murdered person was killed in the course of another felony if 
the murdered person was actually killed by emerson and 
in performing the acts which caused the death of the murdered person,emerson acted with the intent to kill the murdered person or with the knowledge that his acts created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to the murdered person and 
the other felony was armed robbery.
if you find from your consideration of all the evidence that the first and second propositions have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt,then emerson is eligible for a death sentence.
if you can not unanimously find that both the first and second propositions have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt,then emerson is not eligible for a death sentence.
during deliberations the jury sent a note to the judge asking,do we unconditionally accept the previous judgments of guilty for murder,attempted murder and two counts of armed robbery as fact when evaluating this case or can we apply reasonable doubt to the prior guilty verdicts the court asked the parties for input on how it should respond.defense counsel suggested that the jury be instructed as follows you are required to deliberate solely based on the evidence you have heard in this case in accordance with my instructions.the state proposed you have evidence before you that emerson has been convicted of armed robbery,attempted murder and murder.you are to consider that evidence in the eligibility phase.the judge instead instructed the jury you have received the evidence and jury instructions.please continue to deliberate.neither side objected to this instruction.after further deliberation,the jury returned a finding that emerson was eligible for the death penalty,and the court imposed the death sentence.
on direct appeal emerson,represented by his sentencing counsel,argued that the sentencing court erred by not answering the jury question.he claimed that there was a strong likelihood that the jury failed to make its own determination at eligibility as to whether defendant had actually killed byrd because it assumed that this issue had already been determined at trial.people emerson.affirming emerson death sentence,the supreme court of illinois held that emerson waived this argument by failing to object to the court response or offer a substantively different proposal.specifically,the supreme court stated,w e are unable to discern any significant difference between the answer suggested by defense counsel and the answer the circuit court provided to the jury.id.
emerson then sought postconviction relief in illinois courts,claiming ineffective assistance of counsel the illinois appellate court analyzed emerson claim under the standard set forth in strickland washington,d.the court held that counsel was not ineffective in suggesting that the judge instruct the jury to continue to deliberate based on the court original instructions,and that in any event,there is no reasonable probability that,absent his counsel errors,defendant would not have been sentenced to death.the court therefore affirmed emerson sentence.the illinois supreme court denied leave to appeal.
emerson then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under,which the district court denied.analyzing emerson claim under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,d,the district court held that the illinois appellate court judgment was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,strickland.emerson appealed.
ii.discussion 
emerson is not entitled to federal habeas relief under aedpa unless he shows that the illinois appellate court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court applies a rule different from the governing law set forth in supreme court cases,or if it decides a case differently than the supreme court has done on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.bell cone,d.a court decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal principle from supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case.id.for emerson to prevail on this latter prong,he must show that the illinois appellate court decision was so erroneous as to be objectively unreasonable.badelle correll,cir.in other words,the court decision must l ie well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.hardaway young,cir.
emerson claim is controlled by clearly established federal law,namely,the legal principles set forth in strickland washington.strickland familiar process for determining whether a counsel assistance fell below sixth amendment standards is as follows 
first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.unless a defendant makes both showings,it can not be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the re
