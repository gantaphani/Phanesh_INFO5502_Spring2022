the texas department of criminal justice tdcj appeals the district court grant of michael joseph fuhrman petition for writ of habeas corpus,which alleged that fuhrman was being held in custody in contravention of texas dna statute.the tdcj contends that the district court grant is barred by the law of the case doctrine and the mandate rule.furthermore,the district court erred by failing to defer to the state reasonable interpretation of the statute at issue.because we agree that the grant of habeas corpus relief was error,we reverse and render judgment for the tdcj.
michael joseph fuhrman pled guilty to the felony of burglary of a building with intent to commit theft.on november,fuhrman was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment in the tdcj by the judicial district court of harris county,texas no direct appeal was taken.
in,texas enacted its dna testing statute.see.gov t code ann.the statute provided that the tdcj was to take dna specimens from inmates who had been convicted of certain crimes,including those convicted of burglary of a habitation with intent to commit a felony other than theft.gov t code ann.a.penal code ann.d.the relevant section of the statute was amended in to include second degree burglary of a habitation as a qualifying offense.gov t code ann.a.penal code ann.c.
on september,the tdcj first attempted to take fuhrman dna sample.fuhrman refused to comply.the tdcj cited as the qualifying offense a georgia conviction of burglary of a habitation to which fuhrman had admitted on his travel card.as a result of his refusal,and after disciplinary proceedings,fuhrman was punished by revoking his credits.this revocation changed fuhrman projected mandatory supervised release date.this pattern between fuhrman and the tdcj repeated itself over and over again.fuhrman filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus,which was denied by the texas court of criminal appeals without written order on march.fuhrman filed second and third applications,which were ultimately denied by the texas court of criminal appeals respectively,on february,without written order,and on april,without written order on the findings of the trial court without a hearing.
on may,fuhrman filed an application for writ of habeas corpus under in the united states district court for the northern district of texas,which ordered it transferred to the united states district court for the western district of texas on may.fuhrman raised ten claims.on january,the district court denied fuhrman federal application,stating that his claims all lacked merit.
fuhrman sought a certificate of appealability coa from this court.on july,this court granted fuhrman a coa on certain issues,vacated the district court judgment,and remanded for a definitive finding whether fuhrman lost credits in any disciplinary cases other than for refusing to submit a dna specimen.fuhrman cockrell,cir.we instructed that if the district court should find that fuhrman had lost such credits,the district court should 
order the respondent to brief the issues whether furhman sic is eligible for release to mandatory supervision and whether his forfeiture of credits contravenes d provision that a n inmate may not be held past a statutory release date if the inmate fails or refuses to provide a blood sample,and,if so,whether there are constitutional implications necessitating habeas relief.
id.this court additionally held that there is no indication that the georgia offense of burglary of a habitation was not a dna eligible offense,given that it involved conduct punishable under texas penal code c,which provides that the crime of burglary is a felony of the second degree if committed in a habitation.id.quoting.penal code ann.c vernon.
after our remand,the district court issued its reply to remand order granting movant relief and a final judgment granting relief on january.the court held that fuhrman lost a total of credits solely based on his refusal to submit to dna testing.the court further held that fuhrman was eligible for mandatory supervised release,and that the tdcj was in violation of.gov t code ann.d,which forbids holding a prisoner past his statutory release date for failure to submit to dna testing.last,the district court ruled that fuhrman georgia burglary conviction did not,absent more,place him within the scope of texas dna statute.
the tdcj filed a rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment,contending that fuhrman is subject to the texas dna statute.the tdcj further argued that forfeiting fuhrman credits did not implicate due process rights because the term statutory release date,as used in d,did not equate to a mandatory supervised release date.on february,the district court denied the motion,finding that the georgia burglary conviction the conviction relied on by the state did not make fuhrman eligible for dna testing,and that statutory release date means the date at which an inmate can be released taking into account his good time credits.
the tdcj timely appeals the final judgment and the order denying respondent emergency motion under rule e.
the tdcj argues that the district court failed to properly respect the law of the case doctrine and the mandate rule when it decided that fuhrman georgia conviction was not a qualifying offense for purposes of the texas dna statute.we agree.
the law of the case doctrine provides that an issue of law or fact decided on appeal may not be reexamined either by the district court on remand or by the appellate court on a subsequent appeal.united states becerra,cir quoting.cent.gulf int l paper,cir.exceptions to the law of the case doctrine allow reexamination only if i the evidence on a subsequent trial was substantially different,ii controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of the law applicable to such issues,or iii the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.becerra,at quoting.commc ns,jones,cir.the principles surrounding the law of the case doctrine apply equally to the mandate rule,which is but a specific application of the general doctrine of law of the case.united states lee,cir.absent exceptional circumstances,the mandate rule compels compliance on remand with the dictates of a superior court and forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court.see also becerra,at the mandate rule is a corollary of the law of the case doctrine providing that a lower court on remand must implement both the letter and the spirit of the appellate court mandate,and may not disregard the explicit directives of that court.alteration in original quoting johnson uncle ben,cir.the district court is not free to deviate from the appellate court mandate.becerra,at quoting barber int l of boilermakers,cir.the district court may only deviate from the mandate if one of the exceptions to the law of the case doctrine applies.becerra,at.
this court mandated that the district court examine limited specific issues,none of which involved a determination regarding the georgia conviction.we remanded for a definitive finding whether fuhrman lost credits in any disciplinary cases other than for refusing to submit a dna specimen.fuhrman.at.we further directed that should the district court find that fuhrman had lost certain credits,the district court should 
order the respondent to brief the issues whether furhman sic is eligible for release to mandatory supervision and whether his forfeiture of credits contravenes d provision that a n inmate may not be held past a statutory release date if the inmate fails or refuses to provide a blood sample,and,if so,whether there are constitutional implications necessitating habeas relief.
id.further,this court stated that there is no indication that the georgia offense of burglary of a habitation was not a offense,given that it involved conduct punishable under texas penal code c,which provides that the crime of burglary is a felony of the second degree if committed in a habitation.id.thus,the district court determination that fuhrman georgia conviction was not a offense was clearly a deviation from the specifics of this court mandate,and it also improperly reexamined
