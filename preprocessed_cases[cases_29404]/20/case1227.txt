factual and procedural background 
in,a texas jury convicted saldano of capital murder.during the punishment phase of saldano trial,the collin county district attorney district attorney called walter quijano,a psychologist,to testify as an expert witness.quijano provided the jury with a list of unweighted factors that he advised the jury to use in evaluating saldano future dangerousness.one of the factors was race.as to this factor,quijano stated that saldano was hispanic,pointed out that hispanics were in the texas prison system,and opined that there was a correlation between race and ethnicity and future dangerousness.during closing arguments,the district attorney reminded the jury to consider the factors laid out by quijano when assessing saldano future dangerousness.saldano did not object either to quijano testimony or to the district attorney reference to it during his closing argument instead,he met quijano testimony through and the presentation of a rebuttal witness.
after hearing all the evidence,the jury found that there was a probability that saldano would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.in addition,the jury found insufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant life imprisonment rather than the death penalty.consequently,the trial judge sentenced saldano to death.
saldano appealed directly to the texas court of criminal appeals,claiming that he had been denied due process of law because his race and ethnicity were improperly used to support a finding of future dangerousness during the punishment phase of his trial.the district attorney argued that,because saldano did not object to quijano testimony,saldano claim was procedurally barred by texas contemporaneous objection rule.the court of criminal appeals affirmed saldano conviction and sentence,after finding that saldano claim was,indeed,procedurally barred.
the united states supreme court granted certiorari.before the supreme court,the attorney general of the state of texas assumed representation of the state the attorney general confessed error in saldano sentencing and declined to raise saldano procedural default as a defense.the supreme court vacated the judgment against saldano and remanded to the court of criminal appeals of texas for further consideration in light of the confession of error.saldano texas,d

saldano subsequently petitioned the united states district court for the eastern district of texas for a writ of habeas corpus.the attorney doug dretke,in his official capacity as director of the texas department of criminal justice,institutional error and waived saldano procedural default.the district attorney filed an application to intervene as of right to oppose saldano petition on and grounds.the district court held that the doctrine prevented it from considering the merits of the district attorney application for intervention 
the district attorney appealed.in saldano,cir,we held that the district court erred in finding that the district attorney application for intervention presented it with a political question.therefore,we reversed the district court order and remanded the district attorney application to the district court for disposition on the merits.id.
on remand,the district court denied the district attorney application for intervention and granted saldano petition for a writ of habeas corpus.saldano cockrell,d.the district attorney appeals both the order denying his application for intervention and the judgment granting saldano petition for a writ of habeas corpus.director dretke did not appeal the district court judgment,but he did file a brief in opposition to the district attorney appeal.
ii.intervention 
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a district court decision to deny an application for intervention under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.sierra club espy,cir james moore et,moore federal practice b,at to ed.describing circuit split 
intervention as of right 
intervention as of right under rule a is proper when 
the motion to intervene is timely the potential intervener asserts an interest that is related to the property or transaction that forms the basis of the controversy in the case into which she seeks to intervene the disposition of that case may impair or impede the potential intervener ability to protect her interest and the existing parties do not adequately represent the potential intervener interest.
doe glickman,cir.the district attorney claims that he meets all four of rule a requirements.the district court,however,ruled that the district attorney did not meet the second requirement for intervention because he had failed to establish that his direct,substantial,legally protectable interests would be impaired or impeded by the disposition of th e case in his absence as a party.saldano,d at.we agree.
to meet the second requirement for rule a intervention,a potential intervenor must demonstrate that he has an interest that is related to the property or transaction that forms the basis of the controversy.doe,at.not any interest,however,is sufficient the interest must be direct,substantial,and legally protectable.id.at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.we have explained that the interest must be one which the substantive law recognizes as belonging to or being owned by the applicant.new orleans pub,united gas pipe line,cir en banc.in addition,the intervenor should be the real party in interest regarding his claim.id.
in this suit against director dretke,the real party in interest is the state of texas.see diamond charles,d a suit against a state officer in his official capacity is,of course,a suit against the state.and,although the district attorney claims to have the authority to act as the state representative in this case,state law provides otherwise.under texas law,a district attorney duties and responsibilities are defined by statute.state allen.texas law does not grant district attorneys the authority to represent either state officials,such as director dretke,or the state in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.see crim.proc.ann.vernon supp.outlining the duties of district attorneys instead,as the district attorney concedes,texas law gives the attorney general the authority to represent director dretke and the state in suits such as this.see sierra club city of san antonio,cir under texas law,the attorney general enjoys an exclusive right to represent state agencies other attorneys who may be permitted to assist the attorney general are subordinate to his authority.league of united latin am.citizens,council clements,cir en banc the attorney general may represent state officials in their official capacities.
furthermore,since the attorney general is properly representing the state in this case,texas law does not permit the district attorney to assume representation of the state as well.under texas law,either the attorney general or a county or district attorney may represent the state in a particular situation,but these are the only choices,whichever official represents the state exercises exclusive authority and if services of other lawyers are utilized,they must be in subordination to his authority.hill.water quality,writ ref saldano,at t he state has only one interest in a criminal case,and the state can be represented by only one attorney in making such decisions as whether to seek review and whether to confess error.as the texa
