indiana prisoner raymond powell is trying to mount a collateral attack under on his conviction for attempted murder.the underlying constitutional issue he would like to raise is a due process challenge to the jury instructions that the trial court gave.before we can reach that question,however,there is an antecedent procedural problem whether powell petition was filed beyond the time period permitted by federal law.see d.the district court concluded that it was indeed,and dismissed the petition on that ground.this court certified for appeal both the timeliness question and the due process argument.we now affirm the dismissal of the petition as untimely.
applying the required presumption that the state supreme court correctly recited the facts,see e,we learn that the following events led to powell conviction.on february,a verbal altercation between aaron jones and james wright outside an apartment complex escalated into gunfire.see powell state.when the shooting stopped,jones was injured and his friend,marquise mcvea,was dead.id.jones identified wright,powell,and a third man as the shooters.id.
powell was charged with both the murder of mcvea and the attempted murder of jones.at powell trial,jones testifying for the state reported that the events unfolded quickly.according to jones,after he exchanged words with wright,wright opened fire on him.mcvea turned and ran across the street,and jones saw powell shooting straight ahead at mcvea.jones acknowledged that mcvea had gone to his nearby truck and pocketed a handgun just before the mel√©e started,but he insisted that mcvea never drew the weapon.powell,at.importantly,jones denied that he himself was armed.id.
throughout the proceedings,the state relied on two alternative theories in support of the attempted murder charge first,that powell tried to shoot jones himself,or second,that he was responsible as the accomplice of wright,the actual shooter.at the close of the evidence,when the judge instructed the jury on the accomplice theory,he failed to state that a defendant can not be found guilty of attempted murder based on the acts of another without proof that he himself formulated a specific intent to kill the victim.moreover,in returning its verdict,the jury was not required to reveal which of the state two theories it had accepted.the verdict said only that powell was guilty of the murder of marquise mcvea and the attempted murder of aaron jones.the court sentenced powell to consecutive terms of years for the murder of mcvea and years for the attempted murder of jones.
while powell direct appeal to the state supreme court was pending,the state disclosed to the trial court that jones had testified in a wholly unrelated trial that he did have a gun on his person on the day of the shooting but that he did not draw the weapon.powell,at.based on this allegedly newly discovered evidence,powell filed a motion whose legal nature was somewhat ambiguous.it was captioned as a petition,but it was then identified in the first paragraph as a belated motion to correct errors arising from new evidence of jones perjury.after allowing the motion to be filed and holding a hearing to consider it,the trial court denied powell request for a new trial.id.powell appeal from this ruling was then consolidated with his direct appeal and presented directly to the supreme court of indiana.id.at see.app.a.the state supreme court affirmed the trial court judgment on july.powell,at.
a few months later,in a letter written in october,powell counsel informed him of the state supreme court decision and offered her view of the next steps available to powell.counsel first explained i f you wish to further pursue your case,you need to file for permission to file successive petition for relief.you file this with the court of appeals.the letter then went on to tell powell of the time limit for filing a petition for federal habeas corpus relief.counsel added that filing a state petition would toll that period.
despite counsel instruction to seek authorization to proceed from the state appellate court,on march,powell filed a postconviction petition directly in the trial court,challenging among other issues the trial court failure to address the element of specific intent to kill in the attempted murder instruction that set forth the theory of accomplice liability.in response to powell request for counsel,the postconviction court appointed a state public defender.after the state answered powell petition on april,the postconviction court set a schedule for discovery.powell attorney then requested an indefinite stay of the proceedings,explaining that his office required him to work on cases in order of their filing dates,and he had numerous clients with filing dates earlier than powell.the postconviction court granted the motion.
counsel then gave powell the bad news that his case was on hold until i can get to it which will be awhile since i have at least unreviewed cases ahead of you.powell concluded that he had to take the initiative,and so in october,he filed a pro se motion seeking access to transcripts from his trial.after learning of powell motion,counsel asked whether powell wished him to withdraw his appearance.powell chose to continue with counsel.in the months that followed,with his petition still stayed,powell wrote to counsel several times about his case.counsel responded each time that he still had other cases to work on before he could review powell.
counsel never got to powell case on his own.instead,two years after granting the indefinite stay,the postconviction court requested status reports on the case from the parties.in response,the state moved to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction,asserting for the first time that the captioned petition that powell had filed while his direct appeal was pending counted as a first postconviction petition.if that was correct,then under indiana law,the pending case was an unauthorized successive petition because powell had never sought and received permission to file it from the state appellate court.see.see smith walls,cir tinker hanks,cir.counsel for powell conceded that the state was correct accordingly,the postconviction court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction on june.by now almost three years had passed since the state supreme court affirmed powell convictions.powell responded with a late request to the state appellate court for permission to file a successive postconviction petition raising the claim,but his application was denied on november,with the explanation that he failed to establish a reasonable possibility that he is entitled to postconviction relief.
on december,powell filed a pro se petition.in that petition,he asserted that the document he filed during his pending direct appeal was as the text indicated a belated motion to correct errors,which is permitted by,and not a first postconviction petition as the caption suggested.if it was the former,powell argued,his march petition should not have been dismissed as a successive effort at postconviction relief.the district court appointed counsel.powell new lawyer conceded that powell federal petition was technically untimely because,as the state insisted,the march submission was indeed a second postconviction petition that had not been properly filed under state law and thus did not toll the federal statute of limitations.see d.counsel argued nevertheless that powell circumstances warranted equitable tolling for several reasons trial counsel ambiguous instructions that filing a postconviction petition would toll the federal time period the state public defender negligence in permitting the march petition to languish and the failure of both the state and the postconviction court to notice the apparent jurisdictional problem with his march petition earlier.the district court concluded that equitable tolling did not apply and denied powell petition as untimely.
powell convictions became final on october,after he chose not to petition the supreme court for a writ of certiorari.see anderson litscher,cir.from that point,powell had one year to file a petition,unless something occurred to toll that period.see d
