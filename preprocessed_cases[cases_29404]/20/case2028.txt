when frederick jackson told the detective questioning him that he wanted a lawyer right now,the detective responded that he could not accommodate jackson request and that he would have to end the interview.the detective statement to jackson was,at the very least,misleading under wisconsin law public defenders are available to suspects in custody on an emergency basis.after his conversation with the detective,jackson waived his miranda rights and confessed.he later moved to suppress his confession,arguing that his waiver was not voluntary due to the detective misstatement of wisconsin law.the wisconsin trial and appellate courts found no miranda violation,and jackson filed a writ of habeas corpus,which the district court granted.we find that the detective failure to follow state law does not give rise to habeas relief and the wisconsin appellate court decision was not objectively unreasonable in light of the supreme court decision in duckworth eagan,d.although we share many of the district court concerns about jackson waiver of his miranda rights,we find that the district court exceeded the limits imposed on federal habeas review,and we therefore reverse its grant of jackson petition.

ii.analysis 
the scope of our review of the wisconsin court of appeals decision is strictly limited by the standard for habeas corpus cases promulgated by congress in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.under the relevant provisions of the aedpa,an application for a writ of habeas corpus may not be granted unless adjudication of the claim in state court resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.jackson does not suggest that the decision of the wisconsin appellate court was contrary to clearly established federal law,but instead contends that it unreasonably applied clearly established federal law to his case.this is a difficult standard to meet unreasonable means something like lying well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.hardaway young,cir.we have held that under this criterion,habeas relief should not be granted if the state court decision can be said to be one of several outcomes.boss pierce,cir.indeed,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must be objectively unreasonable.lockyer andrade,d quoting williams taylor,d.
