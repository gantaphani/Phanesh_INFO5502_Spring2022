ahmed ali petitions for review from the board of immigration appeals bia final decision ordering him removed to his native somalia.he also appeals from an order of the united states district court for the northern district of illinois denying his habeas corpus petition in which he challenged his prolonged preremoval detention.the government released ali from custody shortly before this case was argued,so the habeas detention challenge is moot and we review only the decision of the bia ordering his removal to somalia.for the reasons that follow,we deny the petition for review with respect to the bia denial of waiver of inadmissibility,asylum,and withholding of removal.we grant the petition with respect to the bia denial of deferral of removal under the convention against torture cat and remand that claim for further proceedings.
background 
ali was born in in baidoa,somalia,to a family belonging to the minority rahanweyn clan and the digil subclan.since the collapse of its central government in,somalia has been afflicted by interclan and intraclan warfare.state dep t country reports on human rights practices somalia.the state department country report specifically highlights deadly infighting among subfactions of the rahanweyn resistance army in the southern regions of bay and bakool.ali hometown of baidoa is located in the bay region.
according to the uncontradicted testimony of said samatar,a professor of african history at rutgers university who gave his expert opinion at ali immigration hearing,if ali were returned to the areas of somalia controlled by his rahanweyn clan,he would face immediate and present danger because the region is in dispute by two factions of the rahanweyn.by immediate and present danger he meant ali was likely to be beaten and robbed and,in many places,would also be targeted for death.samatar indicated ali would likely be singled out to be beaten,robbed,or killed because he would be perceived as wealthy after spending time in the united states and because of the intricacy of his lineage.regarding this latter point,he described persistent feuds between subfactions of the rahanweyn based on lineage,and testified that the infighting among the rahanweyn depends on your clan lineage.samatar testified that ali would fare no better in another part of somalia not controlled by the rahanweyn.in regions,he said,ali would be targeted by members of the local dominant clan because of his status as a rahanweyn.
shortly after the outbreak of violence in,two of ali brothers were by a stray bullet,the other by street gangs.in warlords from the dominant hawiye clan who were affiliated with the united somali congress usc invaded baidoa.usc soldiers shot at ali on two or three occasions,and he describes constantly running from the usc military as a teenager.hawiye militiamen subjected him to several beatings.in,when ali was sixteen years old,usc soldiers raided the ali family home in baidoa and attempted to rape ali older sister.when she resisted,they killed her.both the attempted rape and murder happened in front of ali.
soon after his sister murder,ali and the rest of his family fled to a town near the border.there they again experienced persecution,this time at the hands of the darod clan.the rahanweyn were easily identified by the darods because they spoke a different dialect.in one incident,a member of the darod militia demanded that ali put his penis into an exhaust pipe ali refused and was beaten.he understood this kind of abuse as an attempt to humiliate the members of minority clans like the rahanweyn.
in ali and his family fled to kenya,and in the united states admitted them as refugees.ali settled in madison,wisconsin,with one of his sisters his parents moved to minnesota.he worked a variety of jobs in madison and attended the madison area technical college.even after moving to madison,however,ali suffered nightmares about the atrocities he witnessed and experienced in somalia,especially his sister murder.he says the nightmares caused him to develop a drinking problem and to struggle with depression and insomnia.
ali was involved in a string of altercations in madison,starting with an incident in april where he accepted a ride in a car from three men and a woman.they drove him to a park in madison,beat him up,and hit him with a beer bottle.his lip was cut and he received medical treatment at a hospital.two months later ali crossed paths with one of the men from the april incident.they started to fight,the police responded,and both ali and the other man were cited for disorderly conduct.
then,on june,ali got into yet another fight with the same man when he spotted him on state street in downtown madison.ali gave the following statement to police officers investigating the incident if someone does something to you,you do forget.i knew it was a mistake and i went after him and i punched him first and he put me on the ground and that when i got the knot on my head and it was an eye for an eye yesterday.during this altercation,ali produced a instrument and cut the other man about the face,chest,hand,shoulder,and back,saying,i gon na kill you all.
ali was arrested and charged in dane county circuit court with substantial battery with intent to cause substantial bodily harm by using a dangerous weapon in violation of sections and of the wisconsin statutes.he was released on his own recognizance on condition that he not return to the vicinity of state street where the june fight occurred.ali violated this condition by going to state says he was there to catch a bus to he was again arrested and released.during this period of release,ali was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder caused by his experiences in somalia.
ali pleaded no contest to the felony charge of substantial battery with a dangerous weapon and was placed on probation for seven years and ordered to serve an term of incarceration in the local work release facility.ali completed his term in june and was turned over to federal immigration authorities who initiated removal proceedings against him because of his felony battery conviction.
ali conceded removability on account of his conviction,but sought relief from removal in the form of a waiver of inadmissibility,asylum,withholding of removal,and deferral of removal under the cat.after years of administrative proceedings,the bia ultimately denied all of ali claims for relief.the bia applied the standard set forth in matter of jean,wl,to deny ali a waiver of inadmissibility because he committed a violent crime and had not shown an exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.citing ali conviction for substantial battery with a dangerous weapon,the bia also found him ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal because he had committed a particularly serious crime.finally,the bia refused to grant ali deferral of removal under the cat because it concluded he had not shown he would more likely than not suffer torture if returned to somalia.ali petitioned this court for review.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions 
the government first challenges our jurisdiction to consider the bia discretionary decisions denying waiver of inadmissibility and finding ali ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.section a b generally deprives courts of jurisdiction to review discretionary denials of immigration relief,and a c strips courts of jurisdiction to review final removal orders against aliens who are removable by reason of having committed certain crimes.a b,c.but there is an exception for constitutional claims and questions of law the statute provides that neither subparagraph b or c of a precludes judicial review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.a d sokolov gonzales,cir.
so while we lack jurisdiction to review the attorney general exercise of discretion to grant or deny relief to an alien or,more commonly,the discretionary decision of the bia acting on the attorney general behalf,we retain jurisdiction to examine whether the correct legal standard was applied to the alien claim for relief.see jean gonzales,cir.accordingly,we proceed to ali argument that the bia evaluated his claims using improper legal standards.
matter of jean standard 
an alien who commits a crime of moral turpitude generally may not be admitted to the united states a a i i.but congress has given the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security permissive discretion to waive a refugee inadmissibility for humanitarian purposes,to assure family unity,or when it is otherwise in the public interest.c.in matter of jean,wl,the attorney general declined to waive inadmissibility for a haitian refugee who pleaded guilty to manslaughter after beating and shaking a old child to death.matter of jean,at.the attorney general articulated a heightened standard for waiving the inadmissibility of refugees who have been convicted of violent or dangerous crimes.under the matter of jean standard,aliens convicted of violent or dangerous criminal acts will not be allowed to adjust their status under c except in extraordinary circumstances,such as those involving national security or foreign policy considerations,or cases in which an alien clearly demonstrates that the denial of status adjustment would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.matter of jean,at.
ali argues that the heightened standard established in matter of jean for waiving the inadmissibility of refugees who commit violent crimes is inconsistent with and unauthorized by c.he contends the bia should have evaluated his request for a waiver of inadmissibility by looking at the totality of the circumstances in his case,including his family experiences in somalia,his posttraumatic stress disorder,his victim previous attack against him,and his ties to family in the united states.he asserts that c spells out a test for inadmissibility waivers that the bia was required to follow.
we think ali reads too much into the statute and overstates the scope of the matter of jean standard.first,c does not contain a test,nor does it direct the attorney general to conduct a totality of the circumstances analysis when deciding whether to grant an inadmissibility waiver.the statute says the attorney general or secretary of homeland security may waive a refugee inadmissibility for humanitarian purposes,to assure family unity,or when it is otherwise in the public interest.c emphasis added.nowhere does the statute require the attorney general to waive any refugee inadmissibility the language is completely permissive,giving the attorney general the discretion to decide on a basis whether to grant relief for any of the three listed reasons.
after we heard oral argument in this case,two other federal courts of appeals considered similar challenges to the matter of jean standard and rejected them in published opinions.in the first of these decisions,gonzales,cir,the ninth circuit observed that the attorney general possesses broad discretion to grant or deny waivers and may establish general standards governing the exercise of such discretion as long as these standards are rationally related to the statutory scheme.id.at quoting ins,cir.the court approved matter of jean heightened waiver standard for refugees who commit violent crimes because it found the standard was rationally related to the national immigration policy of not admitting aliens who would be a danger to society,at.
the fifth circuit reached the same conclusion in jean gonzales,at.this was petitioner jean appeal from the attorney general decision in matter of jean.jean argued,as ali does here,that the attorney general heightened standard for refugees who commit violent crimes was not authorized by c.the fifth circuit disagreed because the attorney general did not add a class of aliens to those who are statutorily inadmissible for waiver,nor did he instruct the bia to ignore statutory considerations of family unity,humanitarian concerns,and public interest.jean,at citing togbah ashcroft,cir unpublished.because matter of jean heightened waiver standard for violent criminal refugees was rational and connected to the statutory scheme,the fifth circuit held the attorney general permissibly exercised the broad discretion conferred upon him by c.id.
we agree with our sister circuits that the attorney general did not exceed his statutory authority when he articulated the heightened waiver standard in matter of jean.the matter of jean standard is not like the regulation successfully challenged in succar ashcroft,cir,a case on which ali relies.succar held that where a lists categories of aliens who may apply to the attorney general for a discretionary adjustment of immigration status,the attorney the exercise of that not promulgate a regulation that effectively amends the statute by completely barring subcategories of aliens from applying for adjustment.succar,at.the court found such a regulation would contradict the statute because a did not give the attorney general the discretion to decide who could apply for adjustment,it only gave him the discretion to decide who should be granted adjustment.id.at.
but in matter of jean the attorney general did not categorically exclude violent or dangerous criminal refugees from applying for an inadmissibility waiver,nor from being granted such a waiver.matter of jean simply says the attorney general will,in the exercise of his statutorily conferred discretion,require a more compelling showing of hardship from refugees who make themselves inadmissible by committing violent crimes.jean,at.succar itself spells out this distinction congress eligibility determinations do not limit the considerations that may guide the attorney general in exercising his discretion to determine who,among those eligible,will be accorded grace.succar,at quotation marks and citations omitted.see also jean,at t he attorney general did not add a class of aliens to those who are statutorily inadmissible for waiver he left open the possibility that even the most violent and dangerous immigrants could be granted relief in an appropriate case.the attorney general acted within the discretion conferred by c when he established the heightened waiver standard for violent or dangerous criminal refugees in matter of jean.
c.a particularly serious crime 
ali next argues that the bia erred when it found he committed a particularly serious crime,a finding that made him ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.the immigration statutes give the attorney extension,the to determine whether aliens are eligible to receive asylum and withholding of removal.b a ii and b b ii as we have noted,courts generally lack jurisdiction to review the attorney general discretionary immigration decisions,but a d authorizes us to address the questions of law raised by ali challenge to the bia finding that he committed a particularly serious crime.
ali appeal presents questions of law because he challenges the bia interpretation of the term particularly serious crime in the asylum and withholding statutes.he argues that the plain language of those statutes should have precluded the bia from holding that his conviction for substantial battery with a dangerous weapon constituted a particularly serious crime.where,as here,we are asked to review an agency construction of the statute which it administers,we apply the principles of deference described in chevron natural resources,defense council,d.ins,d quoting chevron,at.
if the statute at issue speaks clearly and directly to the question at hand,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.but when the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.an agency interpretation of an ambiguous statute may be permissible even if it differs from the construction the reviewing court would have given the statute if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.id.at.we give considerable weight to an executive department construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer,id.at,and deference to
