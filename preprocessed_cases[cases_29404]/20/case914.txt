on rehearing 
carl stephen moseley was convicted by a north carolina jury of the capital murder of deborah henley and sentenced to death.after unsuccessfully challenging his conviction and sentence on direct appeal and in state proceedings,moseley filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.see west.the district court denied relief.we granted a certificate of appealability,pursuant to c west,to consider a claim raised by moseley under brady maryland,d.because the north carolina supreme court disposition of moseley brady claim was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by united states supreme court precedents,we now affirm.
deborah henley was a petite woman with a speech impediment who lived with her mother in the old town section of,north carolina.on thursday evening,july,henley sister dropped her off at the sro club,a local dance club in.according to her mother,henley had approximately eight dollars with her when she left for the club.
appellant carl moseley and two of his friends,travis key and tony casstevens,also frequented the sro club and were there that evening.moseley and key had spent most of the day together and had thoroughly washed key car,inside and out.moseley then borrowed key car to go home and get ready to go to the club.key later rode to the club with another friend,where he met moseley and casstevens about 
when the club closed at approximately,henley went outside and asked duane shouse for a ride home,but he was unable to help her.an employee of the club offered to let henley use the telephone,but henley declined.according to several witnesses,henley was instead telling patrons that she would pay for a ride home.moseley,key,and casstevens were also outside the club at the time.key saw henley talking to shouse and,later,to moseley.a few minutes later,moseley approached key and asked to borrow key car to take henley home.moseley told key that henley had offered to pay him for the ride and that he would split the money with key.key initially resisted,but finally agreed.key and casstevens saw henley get into key car with moseley and drive away at approximately henley never arrived home.
key and casstevens stayed behind at the club to wait for moseley to return with key vehicle.based upon where moseley said henley lived,they expected moseley to return in approximately to minutes.when moseley did not return for more than an hour,the two men left the club in cassteven vehicle.as they were driving,they saw moseley coming towards them in key vehicle.moseley was alone.both vehicles pulled over and the men got out.when key asked moseley where he had been,moseley told the men that the damn bitch did live where she said she did.moseley told the men that she lived on the other side of king,north carolina,presumably to explain his delay.that statement was untrue,but even if it had been true,the additional distance did not explain the inordinate delay in moseley return.in addition,moseley told the men that henley did not have any money.a law enforcement officer who happened by the area witnessed the three men standing beside the road and briefly stopped to ask if there was a problem.after taking moseley home,key returned to his home and went to bed.the next morning,key noticed a small amount of dirt and weeds on the floorboard of the driver side of his vehicle.as noted previously,key car had been thoroughly washed just before moseley drove it to the sro club the previous evening.
on friday evening,tommy beroth,a property owner in a rural area of forsyth county,discovered henley body partially hidden under cut corn stalks in his cornfield.the cornfield was approximately five miles and a drive from the sro club and within one mile of henley home.there was testimony that moseley had travelled the roads near the cornfield in the past and,therefore,was presumably familiar with them.henley was completely naked,and her clothing was never found.she had been brutally beaten about the head,face,neck,chest,and abdomen,sexually assaulted with a blunt instrument,stabbed twelve times in the chest,tortured by means of two long incisions on her chest and two more across her neck,and manually strangled.a single dark hair was found underneath one of her fingernails.there was no spermatozoa or semen detected.
the following day,moseley called both casstevens and key and asked them not to tell anyone that he had been at the sro club on thursday night because he was on probation and was not supposed to be drinking alcohol in such environments.key and casstevens,however,had been to clubs with moseley before and moseley had never previously made such a request.when casstevens pointed out to moseley that his name would be on the sheets at the sro club,moseley told casstevens that he had gone to nancy bolt house that evening and that she would be his alibi 
aware by that time of rumors that a woman had disappeared from the sro club on thursday night,casstevens and key contacted the police.the police obtained search warrants and retrieved the clothing that moseley was wearing that evening at the sro club,as well as two among his possessions.traces of blood were present on moseley boots,shirt,and jeans,indicating secondary transfer or spattering,but the quantities were insufficient to determine the origin.a pathologist testified that the size and shape of the wounds inflicted on henley were consistent with the two knives seized by authorities.although there was conflicting testimony from moseley soil expert,the state soil analyst found the soil on moseley boots to be consistent with soil samples taken from the crime scene.
during the trial,the prosecution was allowed to present evidence of moseley alleged involvement in the similar rape and murder of dorothy woods johnson,whose body was found in adjoining stokes county,north carolina,approximately three months before henley was murdered.
dorothy johnson was also last seen alive at the sro club.she was years old,petite,and also suffered from a speech impediment.on the evening of april,she drove to the sro club where she met her friend sherry hoss and hoss,dexter mabe.during the evening,two witnesses at the club saw johnson dancing and talking with moseley,whose name appeared on the sro club sheets.moseley was wearing a cowboy hat and dark jeans.hoss and mabe left the club around and walked to a nearby motel where they stayed for the remainder of the night.johnson was still at the sro club when they left.
johnson nude body was later found in a rural area called friendship forest.she had multiple blunt force injuries to her head,neck,chest,abdomen,and body,and had been sexually assaulted.spermatozoa and semen were present on vaginal and rectal smears.the semen was estimated to have been deposited within twelve hours of johnson death.johnson had a single black hair underneath one of her fingernails.johnson car and her purse were left at the sro club.pam james,a former girlfriend of moseley,testified that she and moseley would sometimes drive to the friendship forest area,near where johnson body was found,to have sexual relations.a resident of the area,and acquaintance of moseley and james,testified that moseley had once questioned her and her husband about their property and remarked that it would be a good place to leave a body because it would take days before it would be found.
during the initial investigation of johnson murder,law enforcement identified dexter mabe,daniel cannaday,and several other men as possible suspects.mabe had dark hair,was dating hoss at the time of the murder,was present at the sro club that night,and had been involved in disagreements with johnson about his relationship with hoss in the past.cannaday was johnson former boyfriend and was known to have been possessive and jealous of johnson before he ended his relationship with her.however,both men were ultimately eliminated as suspects.dna samples obtained from both men did not match the dna samples retrieved from johnson body and each man had provided an alibi for the evening.
the dna profile from semen found in johnson did,however,match moseley dna profile,which was obtained after key and casstevens alerted authorities that henley had left the sro club with moseley on the night henley was murdered.as noted previously,moseley was seen dancing and talking to johnson on the night of johnson murder.according to michael budzynski,of the dna unit of the state bureau of investigation,the chance that moseley was not the donor of the semen found in johnson was approximately one in million.
there were striking and obvious similarities between the murders of johnson and henley,indicating a common killer.johnson and henley were both last seen alive at or leaving the sro club.henley was with moseley when she left the sro club and johnson was seen in the company of moseley near the time of her disappearance.the women were of similar age and had small physical builds.henley was years old,approximately tall,and weighed approximately pounds.johnson was years old,approximately tall,and weighed approximately pounds.and,both women suffered from speech impediments.
the nature and extent of the victims injuries and the causes of their deaths were also similar.as discussed in more detail below,both women sustained multiple blunt force injuries to their head,neck,chest,abdomen,and body,and had defensive injuries.both women had also been sexually assaulted with a foreign object,tortured,and strangled.in addition,both women were found completely naked in rural areas where moseley was known to have traveled.both women had dirt around their fingernails,both were barefoot,and both had dirt on the soles of their feet.an fbi witness testified that the signature to each crime was murderer inflicted far more injuries to the victims than necessary to cause death and employed multiple means of death,any one of which would have been alone sufficient.
the evidence regarding johnson murder was admitted in the henley murder trial pursuant to rule b to show identity of the perpetrator,the existence of a similar modus operandi,intent,and design.see,rule b evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts may be admissible for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake,entrapment or accident.clearly,there was evidence from which the jury could find that the murders were committed by the same person.moseley offered no evidence that excluded him as the murderer of either woman,arguing primarily that the dna evidence was not reliable and that,even if it was,it only proved that moseley had sexual relations with johnson in the hours immediately prior to her death.he argued that the killer was an unknown man.
moseley was ultimately convicted by the jury of the murder of henley,and the capital sentencing hearing commenced.as additional evidence in support of a prior felony conviction aggravator,the state presented evidence of a conviction of moseley for assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury and the attempted rape of laura fletcher.fletcher met moseley in june and agreed to go for a ride with him.moseley drove fletcher to a secluded road in a rural area and began to kiss and touch her.when fletcher resisted,moseley took a gun from the glove box and ordered her to completely disrobe.moseley also completely disrobed and ordered fletcher to perform oral sex.when she refused,moseley grabbed her head and attempted to force compliance.when she again pulled away,moseley pointed the gun at fletcher head.a struggle ensued and the gun went off,injuring fletcher hand.after she was injured,moseley took fletcher home but,anticipating that she would contact the police and despite the fact that he had already told her his real name,gave her a false name in the hopes that she would report the latter instead.
in mitigation,moseley called a former teacher,who testified as to moseley good performance as a school bus driver,and several family members and friends,who attested to a good,loving home environment and a personal character on the part of moseley that was,in their opinion,inconsistent with his having committed such an egregious crime.
at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing,the jury recommended a sentence of death,based upon the following aggravating circumstances that moseley had a previous felony conviction involving the use or threat of violence that the murder was committed while moseley was engaged in the commission of rape or a sex offense and that the murder was especially heinous,atrocious,or cruel.the only mitigating circumstance found by one or more jurors was that moseley was cooperative during his arrest and provided assistance to law enforcement during the search of his bedroom.the north carolina supreme court affirmed the conviction and imposition of the death sentence,and the united states supreme court denied certiorari.see state moseley,cert.denied,d.
moseley initiated state proceedings in april,by filing a motion for appropriate relief mar with the state court.the mar was initially denied without a hearing,and the north carolina supreme court denied certiorari.however,in november,the north carolina supreme court remanded the case for reconsideration of the mar in light of a change in state law governing capital cases in proceedings,which entitled moseley to discovery.see.f moseley subsequently filed an amended mar,raising,inter alia,a claim that discovery had produced a number of documents from the johnson murder investigation that had not been produced to the defense in the henley murder trial,in violation of the state obligation under brady maryland.
in october,the state mar court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the claims and heard testimony from many of the witnesses who were interviewed during the johnson murder investigation.on march,the state mar court denied all claims.the north carolina supreme court denied certiorari,as did the united states supreme court.
in the meantime,moseley initiated federal habeas proceedings by the filing of his petition,but the matter was held in abeyance to allow moseley to pursue discovery in the remanded state mar proceedings.after the state denied his mar request,moseley returned to the district court with an amended habeas petition as well.the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the amended petition be denied.the district court agreed and issued an opinion denying relief.the district court also denied moseley rule e motion.we subsequently granted a certificate of appealability to consider moseley brady claim.
in brady maryland,the supreme court ruled that the prosecution failure to disclose evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.at.in order to prevail on a brady claim,the accused must prove that the undisclosed evidence was favorable to him,either because it was exculpatory or had impeaching value that the state had the materials and failed to disclose them,either willfully or inadvertently and that the evidence was material to the defense,prejudice must have ensued.strickler greene,d.
brady requirement of materiality has particular significance in this case.supreme court precedent does not automatically require a new trial whenever a combing of the prosecutors files after the trial has disclosed evidence possibly useful to the defense but not likely to have changed the verdict.united states bagley,d internal quotation marks omitted.rather,evidence is material and prejudice ensues for purposes of the brady inquiry only if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.bagley,at.the touchstone of materiality is a reasonable probability of a different result,and the adjective is important.the question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,but whether in its absence he received a fair trial,understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.kyles whitley,d.a constitutional error occurs,and the conviction must be reversed,only if the evidence is material in the sense that its suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.bagley,at.finally,the materiality of suppressed evidence is considered collectively,not item by item.kyles,at.the court may consider directly any adverse effect that the prosecutor failure to respond might have had on the preparation or presentation of the defendant case and should assess the possibility that such effect might have occurred in light of the totality of the circumstances and with an awareness of the difficulty of reconstructing in a proceeding the course that the defense and the trial would have taken had full disclosure been made.bagley,at.
on appeal from federal habeas review of a state capital murder conviction,we review the district court denial of relief on the basis of the state court record de novo.see tucker ozmint,cir.however,because the state court adjudicated moseley brady claim on the merits,we review the matter in light of the limits on federal habeas review of a state conviction that are imposed by d.when a habeas petitioner constitutional claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings,we may not grant relief unless the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d d.
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law under d where it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by the united states supreme court,williams taylor,d,or confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from that precedent,id.at.a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from the supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case.id.at.the standard is quite deferential.the state court application of clearly established federal law must be objectively unreasonable,and a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.robinson polk,cir quoting williams,at.furthermore,the state court need not cite relevant supreme court decisions or even be aware of them.see id.at.when assessing the reasonableness of the state court application of federal law,we review the result that the state court reached,not whether its decision was well reasoned.id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the specific brady claim presented by moseley to the state court.after moseley was granted discovery in the state mar proceedings,he learned that the stokes county authorities investigating the johnson murder failed to provide the forsyth county prosecutor with several documents from their investigative file.in particular,there were a number of documents generated in the early phases of the johnson murder investigation which led to the initial identification of daniel cannaday and dexter mabe among others as potential suspects,but which had not been included in the files produced to forysth county.moseley argues that,had he been privy to these additional documents at the time,there is a reasonable probability that he could have successfully pursued and presented an argument that either cannaday or mabe was henley killer and,thereby,that the result of his trial for the murder of henley would have been different 
we begin with the evidence that moseley contends implicates cannaday as johnson murderer,which we consider in conjunction with the evidence regarding cannaday that was produced to moseley and that he contends could have been developed had full disclosure taken place.
immediately after johnson body was found,the investigating law enforcement officers interviewed edward moore,an forsyth county police officer who was working at the sro club the evening that johnson disappeared,and shannon jarrell hill,who was a patron of the club that evening.summaries of the interviews were prepared,but portions of them were not included in the stokes county materials forwarded to forsyth county.
according to the summaries,moore told the officers that he saw johnson walking outside the sro club at approximately,with a white male,approximately tall,pounds,with dark brown hair and a medium build,wearing a cowboy hat,blue jeans,a light plaid shirt,and brown loafer shoes with shoe strings.moore had never seen the man before.within a few days,moore was shown a photographic that included photographs of dexter mabe the photograph and daniel cannaday the photograph,but not moseley who had not yet been identified as a suspect.according to the summaries,moore identified,with n o doubt,the photograph of the lineup as the one depicting the man walking with johnson.at the state mar hearing,however,moore was not so definitive in his identification.he testified that he initially picked two and three from the photographic lineup,but stuck with three.and moore was never asked to confirm or deny the officer n o doubt notation.moore further testified that he was about ten feet away from the man and was only able to see his profile,the cowboy hat,and part of his face.he also testified that,when he was shown a picture of moseley for the first time in,he found the resemblance between moseley and cannaday to be uncanny.in moore own words,they looked the same.
hill told the officers that she saw johnson slow dancing in the sro club with a white male,approximately pounds,with sandy brown hair,at approximately on the night johnson disappeared.however,she described the dress of the man quite differently from or tan dress pants,an shirt,and tan dress shoes.according to the police summary,when hill was shown the photographic lineup,she told the police that numbers three and four from the lineup look ed familiar and that number three look ed like the guy that was dancing with johnson.hill did not testify at the evidentiary hearing and appears to have never been shown a photograph of moseley.
also undisclosed to moseley was a letter written by johnson to cannaday the week before her murder,as well as summaries of police interviews of two friends and coworkers of johnson.in the letter,johnson wrote that she still wanted to marry cannaday but knew he intended to marry someone else.she also wrote that she was seeing other men.she mentioned that cannaday had asked to talk to her during the upcoming weekend,but told him that if she did not hear from him,she would know that he wanted to be with his new girlfriend.debra wells,johnson coworker,told police that someone named danny called for johnson at work the friday before her murder and that johnson told her that the man wanted to start dating her again.shirley brim jones,a friend and coworker of johnson,told the police that cannaday was possessive of johnson when they were dating,but confirmed that cannaday had ended the relationship because johnson suffered from emotional problems.
finally,cannaday criminal record was not disclosed to the defense.it contains a charge of attempted rape in that was dropped and an acquittal for a charge of assault the same year.
according to the state mar court,the police interview summaries of cannaday,margaret sisk a waitress in a restaurant that cannaday and johnson sometimes visited,and three patrons of the club that night were disclosed to the defense prior to the henley trial.sisk told officers that cannaday seemed jealous of johnson when they were together and that johnson would act differently when she was with cannaday.sisk was unable to testify at the evidentiary hearing because of health problems.the three patrons of the club identified cannaday and others in the photographic lineup as persons who had been to the sro club in the past,but they were unable to place cannaday at the club or with johnson on the night of the murder.
cannaday,who was also interviewed early in the johnson murder investigation,confirmed that he had ended his relationship with johnson months before the murder because of her mood swings.he admitted that he had called johnson the week before her death to ask her about an anonymous call his father received from a woman claiming to be pregnant with cannaday child.cannaday thought that johnson might have made the call in an effort to reunite with him.however,johnson denied making the call and,consistent with her letter,told cannaday that she was seeing another man.cannaday denied calling johnson on the day she was killed and said that he had never been to the sro club he told the police that he was with his new girlfriend,sue peck,the evening of johnson murder.he also volunteered to submit to a polygraph examination and blood test.as noted previously,cannaday was eliminated as a suspect after his dna failed to match the dna found on johnson body.
neither the state nor the defense interviewed sue peck during the investigation of johnson murder.when located for the state evidentiary hearing nearly ten years later,peck confirmed that she was in a relationship with cannaday at the time and that they were together on the evening of johnson murder.however,she testified that she left cannaday at his father house around or on the evening of johnson murder,approximately an hour and fifteen minutes away from.according to peck,cannaday did not have a car but would have had access to his father car.cannaday was present and available to testify at the state mar hearing,but moseley did not call him as a witness to confirm or deny the statements he had made to the police.
moseley also contends that he was prejudiced by the state failure to disclose evidence allegedly implicating dexter mabe as johnson murderer.specifically,moseley points to the letter johnson wrote to cannaday as well as a missing portion of the jones interview,both of which recount that mabe had threatened johnson in the past for interfering in mabe relationship with hoss.in addition,mark lamb,a patron at the sro club on the night of johnson murder,told investigators that he saw johnson arguing with mabe.when lamb asked johnson about the argument,johnson said that mabe thought she was interfering in his relationship with his girlfriend.at the evidentiary hearing,lamb testified that johnson initially seemed a bit upset over it but it kind of blew away after a couple of minutes and did seem to result in very much.moseley also points to police records indicating a number of charges and convictions against mabe for angry or assaultive behavior and a criminal investigation report regarding a previous altercation between mabe,hoss,and johnson,including allegations that mabe had assaulted the women.
when mabe was interviewed by law enforcement officers,he confirmed that he was at the sro club that evening with hoss and johnson and that he and johnson argued at one point about his relationship with hoss.however,he told the officers that he and hoss left the club before johnson and spent the rest of the evening together in a nearby hotel.mabe also agreed to a polygraph examination and gave blood and hair samples for comparison purposes.like cannaday,he was eliminated as a suspect after his dna did not match the semen found in johnson body.
at the state mar hearing,hoss confirmed the acrimonious relationship between mabe and johnson,as well as the argument that evening.however,she testified that she and mabe whom she was no longer seeing at the time of the hearing left the club somewhere between and and were together for the rest of the night,thus confirming mabe alibi 
moseley claims that,when considered in conjunction with the evidence that was disclosed to him at the time of his trial,he has proven that the state nondisclosure prejudiced him in his defense to the henley murder.more specifically,he argues that he has demonstrated a reasonable probability that he could have pursued and presented a successful argument that either cannaday or mabe was henley killer and,thereby,created enough doubt to obtain an acquittal or to mitigate against the death sentence.like the district court,however,we can not say that the state mar court decision rejecting moseley claim was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,the due process principles of brady and its progeny.
first,the evidence implicating moseley as henley murderer was independently strong.henley body was found in a rural area,five miles and nine minutes from the sro club,within one mile of henley home,and in a place known to have been traveled by moseley in the past.there was eyewitness testimony from key and casstevens,moseley friends who accompanied him to the sro club that evening,that moseley borrowed key car at approximately to drive henley home from the club and that henley and moseley left in the vehicle shortly thereafter.thus,moseley was the last person seen with henley,who never arrived home.moseley took more than twice as long as expected to return to the club with key vehicle,where key and casstevens were waiting for him.when moseley finally did meet up with key and casstevens,who had left the club in casstevens vehicle after tiring of the wait,moseley falsely told them that the bitch lived farther away than she had said presumably to justify the delay in returning and had no money which was apparently true.then,after the rumor broke that a woman had disappeared from the sro club that night,moseley telephoned key and casstevens and asked them to lie and say that moseley had not been at the club.while moseley claimed that this was because he was on probation,both key and casstevens had frequented clubs with moseley before and moseley had never previously made such a request.
the physical evidence also pointed to moseley guilt.although key and moseley had washed key car just prior to going to the sro club the evening of the murder,key found dirt and weeds in the driver side floorboard of the car when moseley returned the car to him.moseley boots,which casstevens testified were clean at the sro club,had dirt on them when the police seized them from moseley residence,and the state soil expert testified that the soil on the boots was consistent with the soil in the field where henley body was found.also,moseley boots,pants,and shirt had traces of blood on them indicating a spatter or secondary transfer that the prosecution persuasively argued could have been picked up when moseley,unclothed during the assault and murder,put his clothing back on after cleaning himself with the victim clothing.
second,the evidence implicating moseley as johnson rapist and murderer was independently strong.eyewitness testimony placed moseley and johnson at the sro club on the night of the murder dancing and talking together at various times.johnson never returned home that night and was found raped and murdered,also in a rural area known to moseley.and,of course,evidence of the semen found in johnson body matched the dna samples obtained from moseley.
finally,as noted by the state mar court,the evidence that the same person raped and murdered both henley and johnson,and that that person was moseley,was compelling.patrick lantz,the pathologist who performed the autopsy on johnson body,compared the injuries suffered by johnson and by henley.in addition to noting their similar physical features,age,and disabilities,lantz testified as to the striking similarities in the injuries inflicted upon both women.specifically,
the faces of both women showed multiple blunt force injuries.both suffered numerous bruises around the forehead with bleeding in the soft tissue around the eyes.there were contusions to the sides of their heads,cheeks and particularly their ears.both women had bruising or hemorrhaging in their neck areas,demonstrating the similarity of strangulation.they both had abrasions and bruising to their jaws and chins.they had both suffered curvilinear pattern injuries to the back left side of their heads.both women had defensive bruising to
