in,petitioner robert bugh was convicted of rape in carroll county,ohio.in,bugh filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,alleging that the trial court admission of hearsay evidence violated his confrontation rights that the admission of prior bad acts evidence violated his due process right to a fair trial and that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance.the district court ultimately denied the petition,and bugh now appeals.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
in early january,bugh daughter,robin,told her mother,carolyn,that bugh had sexually molested her.bugh was indicted and tried before a jury on november and,on one count of rape,in violation of ohio revised code a b.he was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than ten,nor more than,years.bugh filed an appeal at the state level,raising five assignments of error,three of which are currently at issue in this appeal.the seventh appellate district of ohio affirmed bugh conviction and sentence on march.see state bugh,carroll app,wl,unreported.thereafter,bugh sought discretionary review in both the ohio supreme court and the united states supreme court.both requests were denied.see bugh ohio,d state bugh,ohio.
on october,bugh filed a habeas petition in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio,raising three grounds for relief.first,bugh alleged that the admission of the hearsay statements of robin through four adult witnesses violated his rights under the confrontation clause.second,bugh alleged that the admission of testimony concerning prior acts of molestation allegedly committed by bugh denied him a fair trial in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.the third ground for habeas relief was the alleged denial of effective assistance of counsel at trial in violation of the sixth amendment.the district court assigned the case to a magistrate judge,who,on february,recommended the denial of bugh petition.bugh filed objections to the magistrate judge report.on august,the district court heard oral argument on the claims involving the hearsay testimony and other acts evidence.
on november,the district court issued an opinion and order,denying bugh habeas relief on the claims concerning the hearsay testimony and the admission of prior bad acts evidence.the district court also rejected most of bugh arguments concerning the ineffective assistance of counsel claim,but ordered an evidentiary hearing to determine whether trial counsel had strategic reasons for failing to obtain an independent mental health examination of robin.following an evidentiary hearing on december,magistrate judge george limbert issued a report in which he recommended the denial of bugh ineffective assistance of counsel claim.on march,the district court issued its opinion and order,adopting magistrate judge limbert report and recommendation.
the district court issued a certificate of appealability as to three issues whether bugh federal constitutional rights were violated by the introduction of other acts testimony,by the introduction of hearsay testimony,or by the failure of his counsel to move for an independent psychological examination of the victim.on october,this court denied bugh application for a partial certificate of appealability as to the remaining issues.

standard of review 
in an appeal of a habeas proceeding,we review the legal conclusions of the district court de novo and its factual findings for clear error.taylor withrow,cir miller francis,cir.when the district court relies on a transcript from the petitioner state trial and makes no independent determinations of fact,we review the district court factual findings de novo,as well.withrow,at.
habeas standards and the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act 
because bugh habeas petition was filed on october,it is subject to the provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,which became effective on april.see lindh murphy,d harpster ohio,cir.under aedpa,
an application for writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person who is incarcerated pursuant to a state conviction can not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
harris stovall,cir quoting d.findings of fact made by a state court are presumed correct and can be contravened only where the habeas petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that the state court factual findings were erroneous.e brumley wingard,cir.this presumption of correctness also applies to the factual findings of a state appellate court based on the state trial record.brumley,at citing sumner mata,d.
in williams taylor,d,the supreme court elaborated upon the standard of review under d,explaining that a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.at.an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law occurs when the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decision but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.see also brumley,at.we may not overturn a state court decision unless we determine that the application of supreme court precedent was objectively unreasonable.brumley,at.furthermore,clearly established federal law refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.williams,at.withrow,at.we have recognized,however,that aedpa does not require that the supreme court must have previously decided the very case that a lower court has before it.withrow,at.clearly established law encompasses more than just rules laid down by the court.it also clearly includes legal principles and standards enunciated in the court decisions.id.
right to confront witnesses 
bugh argues that his sixth amendment confrontation rights were violated when the trial court allowed four bugh,faith jones,kate noble offenberger,and joan testify as to statements made by robin concerning the abuse by her father.at trial,robin only testified that bugh touched her privates,which,bugh contends,alone could not sustain a rape conviction in ohio.
state court proceedings 
carolyn bugh,robin mother and bugh,was the state first witness.carolyn testified that she had a conversation with robin in january,in which robin told her that her father molested her 
she told me that he asked her to touch his privates a nd uh he also asked her to suck on it and she said that she did and he said that,or she said that he put her on top of him and put his privates against hers and squiggled them around.
the trial court overruled a hearsay objection to this testimony.
robin testified after carolyn,followed by jones,bothner,and offenberger.jones,a counselor who met with robin for sessions,testified that robin had told her of bugh molestation 
w e have an interview protocol that we use,using open ended questions and she told me that her father had touched her on her private parts and had put his private part up inside of her and at one time in the shower,he had her,he made her suck on his private part until juice came out.
the trial court overruled a hearsay objection to this testimony 
bothner,who performed a physical examination of robin in february,also testified as to robin statements concerning her father sexual abuse.bothner stated that,robin had told me uh in her own words,and i just quote this,that,daddy touched my privates.stating it happened lots of times in the bathroom and in mommy bed.bothner further testified 
she also stated,daddy touched my privates with his privates and also stated it hurt.these are all her own words i reading here.uh she also stated that daddy told me to put my mouth on his privates,and when i asked her what that was like,she said juice came out of it.these again were her exact words.uh when i asked her when these things had happened she stated,or how they happened,she stated,he made me sit on his lap.they happened in the bathtub,in the shower as well as in the bed.
the trial court overruled objections to this testimony as well.
finally,offenberger,a social services supervisor employed by the carroll county department of human services,testified to what robin had told her.offenberger participated in the investigation of bugh case and interviewed robin at the minerva police station in january,and in her office in february.in the first interview,robin did not tell offenberger of any sexual abuse.in the second interview,which was videotaped,robin used anatomically correct dolls,teddy bears and a puppet to describe the sexual abuse.offenberger testified that 
at that time robin told,uh demonstrated with the dolls that uh her father had touched her private parts.she demonstrated to me that the child female doll was put on top of the male doll.prior to that she had undressed both the adult male doll,adult male anatomically correct doll and the child female doll.uh she also indicated and demonstrated with the dolls that the child female doll put its mouth on the male penis.she also indicated to me that whenever the child female doll was,had its mouth on the adult male penis,that juice came out of her father penis whenever he did that.
the trial court overruled bugh objections to the admissibility of this testimony.
based upon questioning during a hearing,the trial court declared robin competent to testify at trial.despite having been deemed competent,robin answered through much of her examination.robin,who testified while sitting on her mother lap,stated that daddy touched my privates,and that this happened in mommy bedroom.she did not testify verbally thereafter,but answered questions by nodding her head affirmatively and negatively

in his state court appeal,bugh argued that the testimony concerning robin statements was inadmissible hearsay,and that the admission of such testimony resulted in a denial of his sixth amendment right to confront witnesses against him.specifically,bugh contended that the testimony as to robin statements was not admissible under the hearsay exception for excited utterances or statements of prior identification.in addition,bugh argued that the statements of jones,bothner,and offenberger were not admissible under the medical diagnosis exception to the hearsay rule.
the excited utterance exception,codified in ohio evidence rule,provides that a statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition is not excluded by the rule against hearsay.ohio evid.bugh argued that robin statements to carolyn bugh were not excited utterances because,at the time robin made the statements,there was no startling event which would have produced nervous excitement.the state appeals court rejected this argument and indicated that the exception applied.the state appeals court noted the clear judicial trend in ohio to recognize a liberalization of the requirements for an excited utterance when applied to young children victimized by sexual assaults.bugh,wl,at.the court also discussed state wagner,ohio app d,in which the ohio appeals court noted the limited reflective powers of a and the lack of motive or reflective capacities to prevaricate the circumstances of an attack,as supporting the trustworthiness of a child communications to others.according to the state appeals court,the facts of bugh case paralleled those in wagner,and 
g iven the fact that the child was of tender years,lacked sophisticated and detailed knowledge about sexual acts,that the statement was corroborated by physical evidence of penetration of the victim vagina,and that the defendant was her father,the statement made by the victim to her mother contained sufficient indicia of reliability to justify its admission by the trial court.
bugh,wl,at.the court further noted that deference must be accorded to the trial judge evidentiary ruling under ohio law.state boston,ohio,stating that the decision of the trial judge,in determining whether or not a declaration should be admissible under the spontaneous exclamations exception to the hearsay rule excited utterance,should be sustained where such decision appears to be a reasonable one,even though the reviewing court would have made a different decision.
the state appeals court also rejected bugh argument that the testimony was inadmissible under the exception for statements of prior identification.ohio evidence rule d c states that a statement is not hearsay if t he declarant testifies at trial and the statement is one of identification of a person soon after perceiving him,if the circumstances demonstrate the reliability of the prior identification.ohio evid.d c.bugh argued that this exception was inapplicable because robin statements were not made soon after perceiving the identity of the perpetrator,and robin was not willing to testify about the statements at trial and did not remember having made them.the state appeals court noted that the ohio supreme court,in state boston,at,endorsed the use of this rule to admit a child statements identifying the perpetrator of child abuse.bugh,wl,at.the state appellate court quoted the boston court holding that 
a prior identification that is found reliable by a trial judge falls outside the hearsay rule if it is shown that the,either at trial or a hearing,had been or is subject to under oath concerning the identification statement and the child responds willingly to questions about the previous identification.if these conditions are met and the judge finds the statement of prior identification reliable,then the statement of the declarant can be admitted at trial through a third person to whom or in whose presence the identification was made.
id.quoting boston,at.after recounting robin testimony that daddy touched my privates,and her responses,in the form of nodding her head affirmatively and negatively,to various questions posed to her concerning the statements she had made,the state appeals court stated that 
t he trial court,having heard the testimony regarding the identification,found it to be reliable and admitted it.the child victim testified at trial and did respond to some of the limited questions posed by defense counsel regarding her statement during with the manner in which a child could be expected to react to a courtroom appearance to testify regarding a sexual act perpetrated upon her by her father.
habeas proceedings 
in his habeas petition,bugh asserted that the testimony concerning robin statements by all four of the witnesses was inadmissible hearsay and that the trial court erred in admitting it.bugh further contended that this error resulted in a violation of his sixth amendment confrontation rights.
the sixth amendment provides in pertinent part that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.the confrontation clause does not necessarily prohibit the admission of hearsay statements against a criminal defendant,even though the admission of such statements might be thought to violate the literal terms of the clause.idaho wright,d.the scope of the confrontation clause is more expansive than the general rule prohibiting hearsay however,and the clause bars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.id.at.
the district court concluded that bugh confrontation rights were not violated because bugh had the opportunity to robin and the witnesses who testified to robin statements.the district court found that united states owens,d governed this issue.in owens,the supreme court held that the confrontation clause does not bar the admission of prior,statements of identification when a witness is unable,because of memory loss,to explain the basis for the prior identification.at.the supreme court explained that the confrontation clause guarantees only an opportunity for effective,not that is effective in whatever way,and to whatever extent,the defense might wish.id.at.quoting kentucky stincer,d.this opportunity is not denied when a witness testifies as to his current belief but is unable to recollect the reason for that belief.id.according to the court,it is sufficient that the defendant has the opportunity to bring out such matters as the witness bias,his lack of care and attentiveness,his poor eyesight,and even the very fact that he has a bad memory.see also delaware fensterer,d per curiam holding that the confrontation clause was not violated where an expert witness who testified as to his opinion could not recollect the basis upon which he had formed that opinion.further,in fensterer,the court explained that 
the confrontation clause includes no guarantee that every witness called by the prosecution will refrain from giving testimony that is marred by forgetfulness,confusion,or evasion.to the contrary,the confrontation clause is generally satisfied when the defense is given a full and fair opportunity to probe and expose these infirmities through,thereby calling to the attention of the factfinder the reasons for giving scant weight to the witness testimony.
at.the owens court found this principle applied equally in the case of statements.at.
when a hearsay declarant does not testify in court,the supreme court has set forth a standard for determining whether the admission of hearsay statements violates the confrontation clause.in ohio roberts,the court stated that an statement is admissible only if it bears adequate indicia of reliability,d the court later explained the two ways in which a showing of reliability may be met reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.in other cases,the evidence must be excluded,at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.id.at.see also idaho wright,d elaborating upon the requirements of the two prongs announced in roberts.
in owens,however,the supreme court stated with regard to the reliability analysis,we do not think such an inquiry is called for when a hearsay declarant is present at trial and subject to unrestricted.at.accordingly,after finding that owens controlled this case,the district court held that bugh confrontation rights were not violated because robin was present at trial and bugh had the opportunity to robin as well as the other witnesses.
bugh contends that the district court incorrectly found there to be no confrontation clause violation simply because robin testified and was subject to.bugh argues that the prosecution case was not subject to the rigorous adversarial testing that is the norm of criminal proceedings,maryland craig,d,and that robin was not in fact available for as to her statements.bugh contends that the district court reliance on owens is misplaced because owens was decided before both craig and wright,and owens involved an adult witness who had memory problems,while craig and wright involved child witnesses.bugh contends that craig and wright demonstrate that other indicia of reliability were needed in order for robin statements properly to be admitted,and that the hearsay statements lacked the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness required for admission under wright.
the government argues that the state court decision to permit the hearsay testimony is neither contrary to nor an incorrect application of clearly established federal law.the government argues that owens controls this case,and,consistent with that decision,there was no confrontation clause violation because robin testified in court and was,even if her responses were mainly.according to the government,by shrugging,robin indicated that she had no recollection at the time,which is analogous to the witness whose memory failed in owens.
under aedpa,our review is limited to an inquiry into whether the state court decisions were contrary to,or involved unreasonable applications of,clearly established supreme court precedent.the state appeals court did not identify controlling supreme court precedent,or even explicitly rule that the admission of the hearsay statements did not violate the confrontation clause.in such circumstances,we have held that the result of a state court decision controls when the state court fails to explain its reasoning.thompson bell,cir citing harris,at.furthermore,in such circumstances,we have held that the contrary to rather than the unreasonable application prong of d governs because the state court did not,as the supreme court defined an unreasonable application,correctly identify the governing legal principle only to unreasonably apply that principle to the particular facts of the case at hand.thompson,at quoting doan brigano,cir.thus,in reviewing bugh confrontation clause claim,we focus on the result of the state court decision to determine if it was contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent.
we can not say that the result of the state court decision was contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent.while the supreme court has not addressed a case with facts identical to those in this case,in owens the court clearly held that the confrontation clause guarantees only the opportunity for cross examination,and that the clause is not violated by the admission of hearsay evidence when the witness memory fails at trial.the owens court reiterated its previous statements in fensterer,at,that the confrontation clause is generally satisfied when the defense is given a full and fair opportunity to probe and expose infirmities in a witness testimony and memory through,thereby calling to the attention of the factfinder the reasons for giving scant weight to the witness testimony.owens,at.while counsel of robin may not have yielded the desired answers,and robin may not have recalled the circumstances surrounding her previous statements,counsel clearly had the opportunity to expose such infirmities,by pointing out robin youth and lack of memory.the jury had the opportunity to observe robin demeanor,thus permitting the jury to draw its own conclusions regarding her credibility as a witness.as the supreme court has recognized,the weapons available to impugn the witness statement when memory loss is asserted will of course not always achieve success,but successful is not the constitutional guarantee.id.at.all of the elements of the confrontation right identified by the supreme court have been satisfied in this case robin was physically present in court and confronted the accused robin was competent to testify and testified under oath bugh retained the full opportunity for contemporaneous and the judge,jury,and bugh were able to view robin demeanor and body language as she testified.see craig,at.
furthermore,the owens court rejected the idea that the dangers associated with hearsay required the testimony to be examined for either indicia of reliability or particularized guarantees of trustworthiness where the declarant is subject to 
we do not think such an inquiry is called for when a hearsay declarant is present at trial and subject to unrestricted.in that situation,as the court recognized in california green,d,the traditional protections of the oath,and opportunity for the jury to observe the witness demeanor satisfy the constitutional requirements.
at.thus,other indicia of reliability were not required to admit the statements at issue.no supreme court precedent has established a contrary rule.
we reject the argument that owens is inapplicable because it involved an adult,rather than child,witness who had memory problems at trial.the owens court did not limit its holding to cases involving adult witnesses.in fact,other courts have applied the rule in owens in cases involving young children.see,united states mchorse,cir united states nb,cir carson collins,cir jones dugger,cir.as we do in this case,those courts faced situations where the young child actually testified and was subject to.other courts have recognized that merely placing a child on the witness stand does not eliminate confrontation clause concerns.see,united states spotted war bonnet,cir.while the mere physical presence of a child victim on the witness stand does not necessarily eliminate confrontation clause concerns,we will not the state court trial judge determination that robin was mature enough to testify and to be.counsel had the opportunity to robin,and this opportunity served to satisfy bugh confrontation rights.robin inability to recall many of the details surrounding her statements does not lead us to conclude otherwise.see owens,at.
although we also disagree with bugh contention that the holdings of craig and wright are more relevant to bugh case,we find that,in any event,the result of the state court decision here does not violate the rules established in those cases.craig involved a challenge to a maryland statutory procedure that allowed a judge to receive,by closed circuit television,the testimony of a child witness alleged to be the victim of abuse.at.the supreme court addressed the question whether the confrontation clause categorically prohibits a child witness in an abuse case from testifying against a defendant at trial in such a manner,outside of the defendant physical presence.id.the craig court explained that t he central concern of the confrontation clause is to ensure the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to the rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the trier of fact.id.at.the court elaborated on the elements of the right guaranteed by the confrontation clause,stating that the combined effect of the elements of confrontation,physical presence,oath,and observation of demeanor by the trier of the purposes of the confrontation clause by ensuring that evidence admitted against an accused is reliable and subject to the rigorous adversarial testing that is the norm of criminal proceedings.id.at.the craig court held that the maryland procedure did not violate the confrontation clause,for,although it prevented a child witness from seeing the defendant,the procedure preserved all of the other elements of the confrontation right the child witness must be competent to testify and must testify under oath the defendant retains full opportunity for contemporaneous and the judge,jury,and defendant are able to view albeit by video monitor the demeanor and body of the witness as he or she testifies.id.at.the court also held,however,that a finding of necessity was required in such cases in order to determine whether the use of a procedure was necessary to further an important state interest.id.at.
in wright,the supreme court held that the admission of hearsay statements about alleged abuse made by a child declarant to an examining pediatrician violated the defendant rights under the confrontation clause.in that case,the state trial court had determined that the victim was not capable of testifying at trial.at.the state trial court had admitted the statements under idaho residual hearsay exception.the supreme court reversed,after determining that the state had not met its burden of proving that the child statements bore sufficient indicia of reliability to withstand scrutiny under the confrontation clause.id.at.the court held that idaho residual hearsay exception was not a firmly rooted hearsay exception for confrontation clause purposes,because it accommodates ad hoc instances in which statements not otherwise falling within a recognized hearsay exception might nevertheless be sufficiently reliable to be admissible at trial.id.at.statements admitted pursuant to this exception therefore do not share the same tradition of reliability that supports the admissibility of statements under a firmly rooted hearsay exception.id.the court then explained that particularized guarantees of trustworthiness also may be demonstrated from the totality of the relevant circumstances that surrounded the making of the statements and that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.id.at.
while it is true that craig and wright are factually similar to this case in that both cases involved children,a key fact distinguishes this case from both craig and confronted the accused in court and was subject to unrestricted.furthermore,the admission of robin hearsay statements was not contrary to the holdings in craig and wright.craig did not involve the admission of hearsay statements through the testimony of other witnesses.see white illinois,d explaining that craig involved only the question of what procedures are constitutionally required to guarantee a defendant confrontation right once a witness is testifying see also schaal gammon,cir noting that craig involved testimony,rather than declarations.rather,the court held that the absence of confrontation did not constitute a confrontation clause violation where the other elements of the confrontation right were satisfied and a proper finding had been made as to the necessity of safeguards to protect the welfare of child abuse victims.craig,at.wright held that idaho residual exception did not satisfy the reliability requirement for hearsay statements to satisfy the confrontation clause,as set forth in ohio roberts.wright,at.unlike in wright,however,robin was p
