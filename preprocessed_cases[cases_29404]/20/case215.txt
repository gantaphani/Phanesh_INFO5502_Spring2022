in,a massachusetts superior court jury convicted michael caputo caputo on two counts of murder.caputo appeals the district court order denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus by a person in state custody.because the state court decision affirming his conviction was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,we affirm.
in the early morning hours of november,two boston police officers were dispatched to a apartment in the jamaica plain neighborhood of boston in the apartment bedroom,the police found the bodies of caputo estranged wife and.caputo wife had been stabbed times,his seventeen times.caputo two young daughters,who were unharmed,were also found in the apartment.
noting an open kitchen window that led to the back porch,the police discovered that the telephone wires to the apartment had been cut.there was no sign of forced entry.on the dining room table,the police found a protective order dated july,ordering caputo to refrain from abusing his wife and to stay away from the jamaica plain apartment.the order contained caputo address in plymouth,massachusetts.
after the boston police notified the plymouth police department that caputo was a suspect in a double homicide,six plymouth police officers,including sergeant thornton morse morse and sergeant richard dorman dorman,arrived at caputo house.caputo opened the front door after the officers repeatedly knocked on the front and rear doors.morse and dorman introduced themselves,then asked whether they could enter the house to speak with caputo.caputo acquiesced.
once inside the house,dorman informed caputo that they were investigating a double homicide on behalf of the boston police department.from a printed card,dorman read caputo his rights under miranda arizona,d.when dorman asked caputo whether he understood his rights,caputo initially replied no.dorman then repeated each right,asking after each whether caputo understood.caputo replied affirmatively to each,then said that he thought it best if he said nothing further.the officers immediately stopped all questioning of caputo.they were not,however,asked to leave the house.
after dorman informed caputo that they were investigating a double homicide,caputo asked dorman who had died.dorman replied that he did not know.soon thereafter,wanting to obtain more information about the investigation to pass along to caputo,morse asked whether he could use caputo telephone to call the plymouth police station.caputo agreed that morse could use his phone.at the conclusion of his call to the station,morse informed caputo that the plymouth police could not then supply any additional information about the double homicide.
leaving some of the officers inside the house,dorman went outside to examine the automobile parked in caputo driveway.the vehicle matched the description given to the plymouth police.the hood was warm to the touch,and a registration plate with a number other than caputo registration number covered the automobile assigned registration plate.it was later learned that the outer registration plate had been stolen from a vehicle in the jamaica plain section of boston.
when he the house,dorman asked whether he could use caputo telephone to again call the plymouth police station.caputo again agreed.within caputo hearing,dorman informed the lieutenant on the line that caputo was at his residence,that the engine of caputo automobile was warm,and that there were two different registration plates on the automobile.spontaneously,caputo stated that he did not want to incriminate himself but that he had a story to tell.he then proceeded to tell the officers that two men kidnapped him after forcing their way into his home the night before and that he later awoke in a daze in the braintree area wearing only his underwear.the officers did not ask any questions in response to caputo unelicited statements.
at the request of the officers,caputo agreed to accompany the officers to the plymouth police station.at the station,caputo was once more advised of his miranda rights.indeed,he was given a written copy delineating each right.caputo read the form,making a check mark after each right.when asked whether he wished to talk to the officers,caputo replied i not sure i do know if i should say anything or not.what should i do morse responded i ca tell you that,but i want you to be aware of your rights and that you do not have to say anything to me.
yet again,morse informed caputo of his miranda rights,ascertained that caputo understood his rights,and asked caputo whether he wished to speak to the police.then,and only then,caputo began to elaborate on the statement he had previously made in his home.among other things,caputo told the officers that he remembered having blood on him,throwing an object out of his automobile,and,at some point during the night,being outside his home.
at approximately,sergeant detective charles horsley horsley of the boston police department arrived at the plymouth police station.informed that caputo had been read his miranda rights,horsley interviewed caputo for approximately minutes.when asked whether he had anything to do with the murders,caputo became upset and stopped talking.caputo asked to leave the police station but was informed that he was under arrest.
later that same afternoon,the police executed a search warrant at caputo residence.they recovered a knife set from which one knife was missing.a pair of tin snips capable of cutting telephone wires was found in caputo automobile.
on november,caputo was charged in two indictments with the murders of his wife and.before trial,caputo moved to suppress the statements that he made at his home and at the police station.after an evidentiary hearing,the motion judge denied caputo motions.the judge found that,on entering caputo house,the officers immediately informed caputo of his miranda rights,then ceased all questioning when caputo indicated that he did not want to speak to them.the judge also found that,at the plymouth police station,after he again received full and complete miranda warnings,caputo knowingly waived his miranda rights before he voluntarily answered police questions.
on march,a jury found caputo guilty of two counts of murder.he was sentenced that same day to two consecutive life sentences.the judgments were affirmed by the supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc on april.
in rejecting caputo claims on appeal,the sjc explained 
first,before he made any statement,caputo received and acknowledged that he understood his miranda rights.second,when caputo indicated a wish not to speak to the police,all questioning ceased.it was only after he overheard the police conversation that caputo stated,unprovoked,that he had been kidnapped the previous night.we do not agree with caputo that his statement should be suppressed because the police officer request to use his telephone was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from caputo,and therefore the functional equivalent of an interrogation.the telephone call was a report and request for further information,an action normally attendant to police procedures.caputo statement occurred only after and apparently because he had overheard the telephone conversation that tended to implicate him,not because of any interrogation.
caputo gave his consent to the police to enter his home,he did not ask them to leave,and spoke to them only after he recognized that the police had seen potentially incriminating evidence outside.a defendant who is nervous because he is in the presence of police within hours of committing murder and who chooses to give false information to the police in an attempt,however clumsy,to throw them off the trail as he perceives their attention focusing on him as a suspect,can not resort later to a claim of coercion.
because we reject caputo claims that his statements to the police at his home should have been suppressed,we need not consider his argument that his later statements should have been suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.
