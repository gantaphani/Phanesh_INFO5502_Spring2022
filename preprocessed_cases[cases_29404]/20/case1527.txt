darrell rittenberry,who had previously filed a federal habeas petition under and was denied relief,filed the present habeas petition under.rittenberry claims that by filing under section,he does not have to meet the requirement of b,which restricts the filing of successive petitions under section.the district court dismissed the petition,but granted a certificate of appealability on the single legal question of whether section remains an independent remedy for a claim of actual innocence.
in,rittenberry pled guilty in tennessee state court to second degree murder and armed robbery,and was sentenced to life imprisonment.he subsequently sought relief in state court,which was denied.in,rittenberry filed a federal habeas petition under,challenging his guilty pleas and sentence due to ineffective assistance of counsel,prosecutorial misconduct,the use of perjured testimony,and sentencing calculation errors.a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation rejecting rittenberry arguments,which the district court subsequently adopted,dismissing the petition.rittenberry filed a second habeas petition in,which the district court dismissed without prejudice due to rittenberry failure to exhaust state remedies.
after pursuing additional relief in state court,rittenberry filed the present petition in march,seeking habeas relief under opposed to section as to challenge his plea based on information he became privy to after the denial of his first federal habeas petition.specifically,rittenberry gained access to the prosecutor file in through his request under the state public records act.in the file,he discovered that his codefendant,charlie allen,had made a statement to a fellow prisoner in which he admitted to taking the primary responsibility for tying up the victim of their robbery,which led to the victim death.this information was significant because allen had been designated as the primary witness against rittenberry,pursuant to allen plea agreement,and the strength of allen statement had convinced rittenberry to plead guilty.
according to rittenberry,he only received this information in in exchange for his agreement to voluntarily dismiss his pending state habeas proceeding.this practice by the state of refusing to turn over records to parties involved in litigation against tennessee,including state and federal habeas proceedings,is endorsed by tennessee law.see swift campbell.this rule,operating in conjunction with the one year statute of limitations on filing a habeas action,leads to what rittenberry describes as tennessee,whereby a petitioner can not obtain information needed to litigate a habeas proceeding until an initial habeas petition is either or dismissed with prejudice.
rittenberry filed the present petition pro se after voluntarily dismissing his state habeas proceeding and subsequently discovering the information from the prosecutor file through the state public records act.he was then appointed counsel,and filed an amended petition through counsel on july.the amended petition raised three claims that rittenberry was denied effective assistance of trial counsel that his guilty plea was not knowing or voluntary and that he was denied due process by the prosecutor reliance on perjured testimony in procuring his guilty plea.after the warden moved to dismiss the petition on the grounds that it was a second or successive petition under b part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act rittenberry argued that because his action was filed under section rather than section,it was not subject to the second or successive petition restrictions of section b.the district court rejected this argument,and ordered the petition transferred to this court as a second or successive petition under section b on february.rittenberry then filed a motion to alter the judgment,seeking a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether the petition could be presented independently under section.the district court granted his motion in part by issuing the certificate of appealability on this single legal question,which is now before us.
we review a district court decision regarding a writ of habeas corpus de novo.wolfe brigano,cir.because this case presents only a question of law,there are no factual findings to which a more deferential standard would apply.
rittenberry appeal turns on the question of whether a habeas petitioner can avoid the procedural hurdles of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,the pertinent portions of which are codified in and,by filing his petition under,rather than section.section provides a general grant of habeas jurisdiction and would,on its own,be more friendly to a habeas one who has previously filed a federal habeas petition.by contrast,section limits the grounds for habeas relief to people in custody pursuant to a state court judgment.rittenberry freely admits that he is filing under section,which he describes as a separate gate to habeas relief from section,because hurdle for successive petitions is more flexible than.most significantly,because this is not rittenberry first habeas petition,if he were filing under section he would have to satisfy the requirement of section b b that he obtain initial authorization from this court to file his claim by making a showing of actual innocence in addition to showing that the facts underlying his claim could not have been discovered initially.rittenberry contends that he does not have to meet this prerequisite because he filed under section.
rittenberry legal argument relies largely on the language of the three relevant statutory provisions,and it is helpful at the outset to review the relevant portions of the statutory text.they provide as follows 
power to grant writ 
a writs of habeas corpus may be granted by the supreme court,any justice thereof,the district courts and any circuit judge within their respective jurisdictions.the order of a circuit judge shall be entered in the records of the district court of the district wherein the restraint complained of is had.
c the writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless 
he is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states 
finality of determination 
b a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.
a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless 
b i the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence and 
ii the facts underlying the claim,if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
a before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court,the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.
d a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court 
emphasis added 
state custody remedies in federal courts 
a the supreme court,a justice thereof,a circuit judge,or a district court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.
emphasis added rittenberry contrasts the language of the habeas statutes to present the argument that a section habeas petition is a different and independent avenue to relief from a section petition.he argues that because section b specifically references claims presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section,in requiring a petitioner to gain from the court of appeals based on an initial showing of actual innocence,this requiremen
