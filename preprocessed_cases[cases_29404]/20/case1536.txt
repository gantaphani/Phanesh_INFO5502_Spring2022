the petitioner,solomon stallings,is an ohio prison inmate serving a sentence for a conviction on a drug possession charge.at the conclusion of his direct appeal and litigation in state court,he filed a petition in federal court under,seeking habeas relief based on a violation of his right to confrontation under the sixth amendment.stallings contended that a hearsay statement by alexander quarterman,an acquaintance of stallings,accusing stallings of illegal possession of drugs and firearms was introduced at trial in violation of the supreme court holding in lilly virginia,d,and that this error is not harmless under delaware van arsdall,d.we agree and,therefore,find it necessary to reverse the district court denial of relief.
factual and procedural background 
this case began with a traffic stop of a vehicle driven by defendant stallings and in which quarterman and a man named john penson were passengers.the officers discovered what turned out to be fake cocaine and counterfeit money in quarterman pockets and a firearm in the backseat of the car.quarterman was arrested and subsequently admitted to police that the contents of his pockets were his.but quarterman also told officer brian simcox that because he was on parole,he did not want to go down on a weapons charge and offered to implicate stallings as the owner of the gun if the officers would help him.simcox agreed with him that if he cooperated he would talk to a prosecutor.
quarterman told simcox that stallings kept a dark green bag containing two additional weapons and a cache of drugs and money at a house on crosier street.as a result of this information,the police attained a search warrant for west crosier,the home of a woman named angela roberts.executing the warrant,the police found a duffel bag with the guns in the closet,crack cocaine in a drawer beneath roberts bed,several pieces of crack cocaine on the headboard,a razor blade,and a digital scale.roberts,absent when the search began,arrived home during the search and was detained and handcuffed by the police.
when first questioned about the contraband,roberts told police that the items belonged to quarterman.she apparently confirmed that the items were quarterman when asked a second time.however,after roberts was taken into police custody and her children were placed with children services,she gave police a written statement saying that she had lied and the contraband actually belonged to stallings.based on her statement and,presumably,that of quarterman,a state grand jury returned a indictment charging stallings with possession of cocaine,having weapons while under a disability,possession of criminal tools,and two counts of endangering children.
stallings waived his right to a jury and submitted his case to a bench trial.the parties stipulated that the contraband seized from the house on west crosier street had been tested for fingerprints and that the single fingerprint found did not match those of stallings,quarterman,or roberts.
at trial roberts described her relationship with stallings,saying that they had dated on and off for about a year,ending three or four months prior to his arrest,and that he would at times stay at her house,although she did not consider him her boyfriend.she testified that stallings brought a duffel bag containing three firearms to her residence,and a few days later a bag containing crack cocaine,asking that she keep them there for him.roberts conceded that she had originally lied to the police but said that she had done so because stallings told her to do so.she also stated that he asked her not to testify against him,but she told him that she was looking at going to the penitentiary over this also and losing her children.
the prosecution attempted to call quarterman as a witness.the court advised quarterman of his right not to testify and asked if he had spoken to his lawyer.quarterman replied,i told him that the detective forced me to say everything the first day.i said i told him i was going to testify.he still rubbed me down.i told him everything on that paper is bogus.quarterman then invoked his right not to testify.
that invocation by quarterman set the stage for the error that becomes dispositive here.in an effort to get quarterman previous statement into evidence,the state called officer simcox,the officer involved in the vehicle stop,the discovery of contraband in the car,and the ensuing arrest of quarterman.over defense counsel objection,simcox repeated the statements that quarterman had given inculpating stallings.the court allowed the hearsay statements,declaring quarterman as unavailable under ohio rule of evidence a.simcox described his meeting with quarterman 
i m irandized him,read him his rights,made sure that he understood them.he told me he wanted to come straight with me regarding the gun we found in the car the previous day.
he told me that the gun belonged to solomon stallings and that he could tell me where solomon had two more assault rifles and ounces of crack cocaine 
he stated that if he helped me with solomon,he wanted me to know that that gun in the car the other night was his i agreed with him that if he cooperated with us i would talk to a prosecutor but could make any promises.
simcox testified that after giving details about where the other weapons and drugs were located,quarterman volunteered to put his statement in writing.simcox read the statement 
up on crosier there is a green gym bag.it is upstairs.the lady name is angie.i know it in there.i been over there several times.it solomon stallings gun and dope.angie sells drugs for him.there an and a rifle in the gym bag.it all in the house.the last time i seen it,the guns,was sunday the in the afternoon,and drugs.
at the conclusion of the state case,the court granted in part the petitioner motion for acquittal,dismissing all counts of the indictment except the one charging possession of cocaine.at the conclusion of the trial,the court found stallings guilty of possession of cocaine and sentenced stallings to six years imprisonment.
on appeal,the ohio court of appeals affirmed the conviction,but remanded for.state stallings,wl ohio.in addressing the confrontation clause claim,the state appellate court reviewed the trial court ruling under state evidentiary and the reliability analysis of ohio roberts,d,reaching the following conclusions 
we have already determined that quarterman was unavailable to testify therefore,we must determine whether quarterman statements possess the required indicia of reliability.
quarterman did not attempt to completely exonerate himself and shift the blame to defendant.in fact,quarterman admitted that the fake dope and counterfeit money belonged to him.furthermore,quarterman was not given a promise or any consideration in exchange for his statement.finally,quarterman gave his statement to officer simcox after having been fully advised of his rights.therefore we find that quarterman statements satisfied the indicia of reliability prong and did not violate the confrontation clause.
wl,at.the ohio court of appeals actually cited lilly but did not make any effort to identify the central holding of that case or apply it to the facts before the court.id.
on remand,the trial court imposed the same term of imprisonment.the ohio supreme court denied leave to appeal and dismissed the appeal as not involving any substantial constitutional question.stallings then initiated litigation seeking relief in the state courts,but without success.he also filed a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence consisting of an alleged recantation of her trial testimony by angela roberts,but that pro se motion met with a similar lack of success in the trial court and on appeal.
on september,stallings,newly with counsel,filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,raising as a single ground for relief that he had been denied the right to due process of law and the right to confront adverse witnesses in violation of the fifth,sixth,and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution when the trial court admitted hearsay evidence in support of conviction.the parties submitted additio
