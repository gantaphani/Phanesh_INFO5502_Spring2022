the pending motion for leave of this court to file in a district court a second petition for a writ of habeas corpus presents an initial issue of whether the petition really is a second petition within the meaning of b.in this instance,that issue turns on the extent,if any,to which this court should reexamine the correctness of a district court dismissal of a previous habeas corpus petition as.the motion also presents the issue of whether the motion satisfies the standards for filing a second habeas corpus petition.these matters arise on a motion by ruddy quezada for leave to file a habeas corpus petition challenging the validity of his new york state court conviction for murder.we conclude that reexamination of an untimeliness ruling that was made with respect to a first habeas corpus petition may occur only in limited circumstances,that such circumstances are not present in quezada case,and that his current petition is properly considered second.we also conclude that quezada has made a sufficient showing to satisfy our responsibility under b,and we therefore grant the motion for leave to file a second petition for habeas corpus relief.
background 
trial.quezada was convicted of killing jos√© rosado.the state theory of the offense was that quezada shot rosado from a moving car while attempting to kill john delacruz,who had been involved in an altercation with quezada earlier in the evening of the killing.the state case was based primarily on the testimony of sixto salcedo,a friend of delacruz.salcedo testified that he saw the shooting and identified quezada as the shooter.he was the only witness to do so.a police officer testified that quezada admitted having had an altercation with delacruz,during which each shot at the other,but that he also insisted that he had been inside a nearby building in the presence of others when rosado was shot outside the building.the defense presented three witnesses who confirmed quezada version.
first habeas corpus petition.after a guilty verdict by a jury,sentencing,and direct appeal,see people quezada,dep t,quezada filed a habeas corpus petition on march,raising claims unrelated to the claims in the pending motion.that petition was dismissed as untimely under the limitations period of the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d.on appeal,this court acknowledged that the petition was untimely,but remanded for consideration of quezada claim of equitable tolling,based on his alleged confinement in a special housing unit shu.see cole kuhlman,table,wl cir,summary order.
on remand,the district court rejected the tolling claim,noting that the record revealed that quezada had been released from the shu during the relevant time period.see quezada artuz,wl.that decision was not appealed.
state court collateral attack.in march,quezada moved to vacate his conviction under new york criminal procedure law,alleging newly discovered evidence to support his claim of innocence.he contended that salcedo,the state key witness,had recanted his trial testimony against quezada and that salcedo had reported having been coerced before the trial by a local detective to accuse quezada.quezada also contended that a state prisoner,freddy caraballo,had told local detectives after the trial that he had participated in the killing for which quezada had been arrested and that quezada did not pull the trigger.at hearings on the section motion between and,salcedo testified that,contrary to his trial testimony,he had not seen the shooter face.he also testified that,prior to the trial,a time when he was on parole,a detective had told him that he had to testify against quezada or else the detective was going to give him ten years.salcedo also testified that the detective kept him confined in a hotel during the trial.caraballo appeared at the hearing but invoked his privilege against.
the state trial court denied the section motion.see people quezada,misc d a,table.
pending habeas corpus petition.in december,quezada filed the pending habeas corpus petition,alleging the recantation by,and the coercion of,salcedo,and the confession by caraballo as refined in the pending motion and the supporting memorandum of law,quezada endeavors to meet the requirements for a second habeas corpus petition by contending that the newly discovered evidence shows two constitutional errors conviction on the basis of salcedo perjured testimony,citing sanders sullivan,cir,and pretrial suppression of impeaching evidence,citing brady maryland,and giglio united states.upon the joint request of quezada and the state,the petition was transferred to this court for consideration of the pending motion for leave to file the petition in the district court 
discussion 
is the petition a second petition 
although not raised by either party,quezada motion presents an initial issue of whether his habeas corpus petition is really a second petition within the meaning of b.only a petition that is truly second or successive requires the permission of a court of appeals for filing in a district court.see id.b.the issue arises because of the dismissal of quezada first petition as untimely and some uncertainty concerning our case law with respect to dismissal of untimely habeas corpus petitions.
before considering that case law,we outline the basic principles concerning second or successive habeas corpus petitions.aedpa requires the permission of a court of appeals to file a second or successive habeas corpus petition in a district court.id.a petition is second or successive if a prior petition raising claims regarding the same conviction or sentence has been decided on the merits.corrao united states,cir.generally,a petition dismissed as is considered a decision on the merits.see murray greiner,cir see also villanueva united states,cir motion under considered second or successive if prior motion dismissed as untimely.
prior to murray,however,we had cast some doubt on an absolute rule that dismissal of a petition always rendered a subsequent petition second or successive.in muniz united states,cir,we considered a motion to file a second collateral attack following the dismissal of a first collateral attack as under unusual circumstances.aedpa limitations period,applicable to collateral attacks filed by both state prisoners under and federal prisoners under,became effective on april.in peterson demskie,cir,we ruled that as to convictions that became final before the effective date of aedpa,a habeas corpus petition would be timely if filed within a reasonable time after the effective date.relying on peterson,the district court dismissed muniz section motion as untimely,ruling that the filing eleven months after the effective date of aedpa was unreasonable.see muniz united states,civ.less than ten days later,we replaced the peterson reasonable time approach with a rule that collateral attacks on convictions that became final before aedpa would be deemed timely if filed within one year of aedpa effective date.see ross artuz,cir.muniz section motion had in fact been filed just prior to the end of the interval allowed by ross.
instead of filing a notice of appeal from the dismissal of her section motion within the days allowed where the united states is a party,see fed.a b,muniz returned to the district court and filed within days of the dismissal an application for a certificate of appealability coa,which the district court denied.on a purported appeal from that denial,we dismissed the appeal for lack of a timely notice of appeal from the previous order that had dismissed her section motion.see muniz united states,cir.since that decision,however,we have ruled that an application for a coa,filed within the time for appeal from a denial of a collateral attack,should be construed as a notice of appeal,see marmolejo united states,cir,a result that would have rendered timely muniz appeal from the denial of her application for coa.
confronting these unusual circumstances on muniz motion for leave to file a second collateral attack,we expressed concern that strict application of aedpa limitations period might render the habeas corpus remedy ineffective or inadequate to test the legality of detention so as to raise problems under the suspension clause.muniz,at citing rodriguez artuz,aff on opinion below,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we noted that the dismissal of muniz section motion had been erroneous in view of our later decision in ross and that this error had been compounded by the denial of her application for a coa,which could have been treated as a timely notice of appeal,and that these technical procedural errors had led to this court mistaken dismissal of her appeal see id.at.
to avoid the possible suspension clause issue,we held that when a habeas or petition is erroneously dismissed on aedpa limitations period grounds,and another petition is filed that presses the dismissed claims,the petition is not second or successive if the initial dismissal now appears to be erroneous because the law on which that dismissal was predicated is unarguably no longer good law.id.at emphasis added.
in considering the possible effect of muniz on the pending application,we focus first on the words of the quoted passage that appear to limit the holding to a subsequent petition that presses the dismissed claims.if those words are truly a part of the holding,then quezada pending habeas corpus petition is unquestionably second since it does not assert any of the claims advanced in his petition.however,if the main point of muniz is to make sure that,at least in some circumstances,a court of appeals is to consider the correctness of a dismissal of a prior habeas petition as,then a petitioner would be entitled to such consideration whether or not the second try concerns the same claims that were made in the prior petition.in that event,we would have to consider what circumstances warrant a look back at a ruling that dismissed a first petition.read broadly,the issue created by muniz would be whether a court of appeals performing its role is a to review the correctness of all dismissals of prior petitions on grounds of untimeliness,or b to undertake such review only upon allegations of unusual procedural errors of the sort that prevented muniz from having the merits of her first petition considered,including this court mistaken dismissal of an appeal from the dismissal of her first petition as.
even if we read muniz to apply to subsequent petitions raising new claims,we conclude that muniz points towards the second interpretation.the court emphasize d that its holding in this case is limited to situations akin to that faced by muniz id.the court also said,we simply conclude that the particular procedural bar faced by muniz does raise a sufficiently serious and difficult question under the suspension clause to justify interpreting in such a manner as to avoid that constitutional question.id.citation omitted.had the court not been able to say that the dismissal of her first appeal was mistaken,id.at,we doubt that it would have considered her subsequent petition not second or successive any error in dismissing the first petition would normally have been available for correction on appeal.in addition,we note that in murray greiner,when our court next considered whether dismissal of a first petition rendered a subsequent petition second,it did not mention muniz,apparently regarding the earlier decision as appropriately limited to circumstances akin,muniz,at,to those faced by muniz.rather than undertake consideration of the correctness of the ruling that resulted in dismissal of murray first petition,we flatly stated 
we hold that dismissal of a petition for failure to comply with the statute of limitations constitutes an adjudication on the merits that renders future petitions under challenging the same conviction second or successive petitions under b.
since the dismissal of quezada first petition is not alleged to have involved any procedural issues remotely comparable to those that led to a mistaken dismissal of muniz first petition,we will not undertake any consideration of the correctness of the district court unappealed dismissal of his first petition as and will regard his pending petition as second within the meaning of aedpa.ii.have the standards been met 
aedpa permits a court of appeals to authorize the filing of a second or successive habeas corpus application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of this subsection.b c.the relevant requirements of subsection b,with respect to a claim,like quezada,that was not presented in a prior application are 
i the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence and 
ii the facts underlying the claim,if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
id.b b i,ii 
quezada endeavors to meet these requirements by alleging newly discovered evidence in support of two constitutional errors.first,he contends that constitutional error occurred because the state has left in place a conviction that rests on material perjured testimony.second,he contends that constitutional error occurred because the state violated its obligations by not disclosing prior to trial the police coercion of salcedo to identify quezada as the shooter.
the state does not dispute that quezada claims rest on newly discovered evidence that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence.the alleged facts concerning salcedo recantation and his coercion came to quezada attention long after his conviction became final.thus,the first requirement of b b has been met.we turn then to quezada assertion of constitutional errors without which no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty.
a perjury unknown to the prosecution.quezada first contends that the state has committed a due process violation by leaving in place a conviction that,he contends,has now been shown to rest on perjured testimony.he relies on salcedo admission that his crucial testimony was false and the corroboration of salcedo recantation by caraballo confession.
in disputing quezada claim that perjury unknown to the prosecution can amount to constitutional error,the state initially asserts an incorrect proposition of law.asserting that the supreme court has not held that a conviction resting on perjury unknown to the prosecution constitutes constitutional error,the state contends that quezada must demonstrate that his custody is in violation of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.state memorandum of law in opposition to petitioner application state memorandum at citing d.however,whether a petitioner has satisfied that requirement is a determination required to be made by a district court before it may issue a writ of habeas corpus.see u.d.our responsibilities require determination only of whether the applicant has made a prima facie showing that his application satisfies the requirements of this subsection,b.b c emphasis added.
although at first glance it might seem anomalous for a court of appeals to be permitting a district court to consider a habeas corpus petition that the district court might be unable to issue,the apparent anomaly disappears when the distinct roles of each court are understood.a court of appeals determines whether the requirements for filing a second or successive petition have been met,which means,as we have noted,only whether the petitioner has made a prima facie showing that but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty.a district court considers the merits of the petition,and that consideration will require the district court,in the first instance,to determine whether,in rejecting a defendant claim of constitutional error,a state court made a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established law,as determined by the supreme court.our role does not oblige or even permit us to make the decision on the sometimes close question of whether a state court h
