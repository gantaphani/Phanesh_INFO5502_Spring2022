background 
a.the double homicide,trial,and sentencing 
on april,montgomery beat and strangled to death pearl briggs and betty tyson.after beating each woman unconscious and possibly after they were dead,montgomery raped them.after his apprehension,he gave a detailed confession of these crimes.
miss briggs owned two buildings in robbins,illinois.she lived in one with her sister,tyson,and rented the adjacent building to montgomery girlfriend.at the time of the attacks,montgomery had been living with his girlfriend in the house for approximately two months.on the evening of april,montgomery walked to miss briggs house to pick up a couch.miss briggs took him to the basement of her building,where the couch was located.there,montgomery knocked miss briggs unconscious,removed her clothes,and raped her.she died of strangulation.montgomery fingerprint was found on the lens of her glasses,his jacket was spattered with blood that matched her blood type but not his,and a hair consistent with his hair was found under her fingernail.
montgomery then walked upstairs to miss briggs apartment.when tyson opened the door,he pushed her down,removed her stockings,and wrapped them around her neck.when she was no longer conscious,he raped her.tyson died of strangulation.montgomery palm print was found on a camera case on a couch near tyson head,and a hair consistent with her hair was found on his.
a police investigator who came to the house that evening noticed montgomery standing outside,acting suspiciously.he saw that montgomery hands were scraped and that he had blood on his pants.the investigator approached montgomery,who agreed to go with the investigator to the police station.at the station,montgomery gave hair samples,fingerprints,and palm prints he also allowed the police to test his clothing.
montgomery was subsequently charged with the murders of miss briggs and tyson.he originally chose to be tried by a jury,but,on march,montgomery overheard a prospective juror say that he could convict montgomery just by looking at him.during that day,defense attorney john mcnamara contacted judge samuels to schedule a conference.when the prosecution refused to participate,judge samuels ruled that there could be no meeting without the participation of both parties.that evening,montgomery attempted to commit suicide in his cell.as a result,judge samuels declared a mistrial.
three months later,montgomery was declared fit to stand trial.on june,three days before trial,defense attorneys mcnamara and michael morrissey met with judge samuels in his chambers.in addition,two assistant state attorneys were present,neither of whom were assigned to montgomery case.mcnamara and morrissey told the judge that montgomery was going to elect a stipulated bench trial instead of a jury trial and that he was going to waive a jury for sentencing.as they were talking,assistant state attorney scott arthur,the lead prosecutor in the case,entered chambers.arthur became furious and accused mcnamara,morrissey,and judge samuels of trying to back door him.at.judge samuels assured arthur that nothing improper had occurred and invited him to join the meeting.arthur refused and ordered the other two prosecutors to leave with him,which they did.mcnamara and morrissey followed them out.
on june,montgomery waived his right to a jury trial and proceeded to a stipulated bench trial.judge samuels found him guilty of the two murders.montgomery also chose to waive a jury for purposes of a death penalty hearing.in the first stage of the hearing,the parties stipulated to the introduction of the evidence presented at trial.judge samuels then made findings that rendered montgomery eligible for the death penalty.
during the second stage of the sentencing hearing,the parties presented evidence in aggravation and mitigation.the state introduced evidence that included the following.in,when montgomery was years old,he stuck a coke bottle onto the penis of his brother,darryl,which required medical personnel to remove.in,when montgomery was years old,he attempted to rape his sister,rene.in,when he was years old,he raped his,eugene.in,when montgomery was years old,he on two occasions raped his,jean,who became pregnant and had an abortion.montgomery was convicted of contributing to the sexual delinquency of a minor.montgomery also had two other prior convictions,both for possession of a stolen motor vehicle.
in mitigation,montgomery relatives testified that he was very drunk immediately after the murders.they also testified about the deprived conditions in their home during his childhood and his parents alcoholism.steven porter testified that montgomery was acting under extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the murders because of the amount of alcohol he had consumed.albert stipes did not agree that montgomery had acted under extreme emotional disturbance,but he diagnosed montgomery as having alcohol dependency and antisocial personality disorder with stimulant abuse.people montgomery.
judge samuels found that montgomery was not acting under extreme emotional disturbance when he committed the murders.he also noted that montgomery intoxication was voluntary and that he had a history of preying on the weak and elderly.as a result,judge samuels determined that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude imposition of a death sentence.
on april,the illinois supreme court affirmed montgomery convictions and sentences.certiorari was denied on february.
b.the proceedings 
on december,montgomery filed a petition in the circuit court of cook county.he claimed,for the first time,that judge samuels was biased because defense counsel had ex parte meetings with him in which he allegedly promised that he would not impose the death penalty if montgomery waived his right to a jury for both trial and sentencing.the circuit court denied the petition.montgomery appealed to the illinois supreme court,arguing that he had not had a full and fair opportunity to judge samuels.the court remanded with directions to reopen the hearing to allow montgomery to fully all of the witnesses.
pursuant to montgomery request for a change of venue,a new hearing on montgomery claims of judicial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel was conducted in october and november by judge michael weber of the fourth judicial district in jasper county,illinois.at this hearing,judge samuels testified that he had not made an ex parte offer to sentence montgomery to natural life.he further stated that if he had ever met with defense attorneys mcnamara or morrissey ex parte,the only topic they would have discussed was scheduling.
defense attorneys mcnamara and morrissey testified that they had met with judge samuels on three occasions.mcnamara testified as to the first of these meetings.in april,he met with judge samuels ex parte to discuss scheduling.after mcnamara described the evidence he expected the state to introduce,judge samuels suggested pleading montgomery guilty.mcnamara expressed concern about making a blind plea in a capital case,to which judge samuels allegedly replied as far as that concerned,why do you look at my record.at.
defense counsel morrissey testified as to the second meeting.in april,he met with judge samuels ex parte to discuss scheduling.morrissey told the judge that montgomery would be electing a jury trial,and judge samuels replied that montgomery should plead guilty and that he would impose a life sentence,again referring to his track record.both defense counsel testified as to the june,meeting with judge samuels,which was also attended by two assistant state attorneys and ended when assistant state attorney arthur arrived.
after weighing the evidence,judge weber determined that the claimed ex parte communication from judge samuels promising a life sentence in exchange for a jury waiver simply did not exist.montgomery,at.in so ruling,he found that judge samuels was credible and that defense attorneys mcnamara and morrissey were not.he also found that it would be totally out of character for judge samuels to hold an ex parte meeting after he had previously rejected a plea conference because the state would not participate.id.thus,judge weber denied the petition.
on june,the illinois supreme court affirmed judge weber ruling,deferring to his credibility determinations.in so ruling,the court opined that defense attorneys mcnamara and morrissey might have been hoping to hear an indication from the trial judge about what sentence he would impose in this case,and counsel could have misrepresented the judge comments.montgomery,at.on june,the united states supreme court denied montgomery petition for certiorari.
on september,montgomery filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.on january,former governor ryan commuted montgomery sentence from death to natural life without the possibility for parole.on september,the district court denied habeas relief she also denied a certificate of appealability.on august,we granted montgomery request for a certificate of appealability as to the constitutional challenges connected to the ex parte discussions.
ii.discussion 
montgomery argues that the illinois supreme court decisions that his trial and sentencing comported with due process and that he received effective assistance of counsel were contrary to or based on an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.he also claims that the court conclusion that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to a trial and sentencing by jury was premised on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented at his hearing.montgomery maintains that the district court erred in concluding otherwise and that we should reverse the court denial of his petition for habeas corpus.
because montgomery filed his petition after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,the aedpa governs our review.lindh murphy,d martin evans,cir.the aedpa provides that habeas relief may not be granted as to any claim adjudicated on its merits in state court unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.we review the district court decision denying montgomery habeas relief de novo.harris cotton,cir.
due process 
we begin with montgomery claim that judge samuels failure to recuse himself after assistant state attorney arthur discovered him taking part in the june,meeting deprived montgomery of due process.montgomery maintains that the illinois supreme court failure to recognize tumey ohio,in its rejection of his claim resulted in an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.d.a state court application of clearly established federal law is unreasonable only if it is objectively unreasonable,which requires that it lie well outside the boundaries of permissive differences of opinion.hardaway young,cir.
the due process clause guarantees litigants an impartial judge.see in re murchison.recognizing that no man is permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome see also franklin mccaughtry.the general presumption is that judges are honest and impartial.withrow larkin,d.however,this presumption can be rebutted,as tumey and the cases that followed it illustrate.
tumey involved a judge whose income was derived solely from the fines he recovered from convictions.the supreme court held that his direct,personal,substantial,pecuniary interest in convicting defendants was sufficient to rebut the presumption of his impartiality.tumey,at.after tumey,the court recognized other situations where bias could be presumed from a judge pecuniary interest in a case in ward village of monroeville,d,the court presumed bias where the judge was also the mayor and a substantial portion of the village revenues were generated by fines from his court.at.and in aetna life ins.lavoie,d,the court held that a judge bias could be presumed where his decision had the immediate effect of enhancing the legal status and the settlement value of a separate lawsuit in which he had a personal stake.at.aetna life ins.involved an insurance company refusal to pay a claim.the alabama supreme court had found against the defendant insurance for the first time a claim for tortious injury in such ordered punitive damages in an amount times greater than any award ever affirmed by the court.id.at.however,the justice who cast the court deciding vote and authored its decision was the plaintiff in a similar claim which was settled for shortly thereafter.id.at.the court stated in its decision that when the justice pronounced his judgment,it was as though he acted as a judge in his own case.id.quoting murchison,at.internal quotes omitted.
montgomery argues that the appearance of impropriety created when assistant state attorney arthur became angry upon discovering judge samuels at the june,meeting put the judge job at risk.consequently,judge samuels had a personal,direct,substantial,pecuniary interest in imposing the death penalty,as this was the only surefire way to allay arthur suspicions that judge samuels had not colluded with the defense.montgomery claims that judge samuels failure to recuse himself violated due process and should result in a new trial and sentencing,despite montgomery thorough admission of guilt.the illinois supreme court rejected montgomery claim,citing state authority to the contrary.montgomery,at.the district court agreed,concluding that montgomery theory of bias was too speculative to rebut the presumption that judge samuels was impartial.ex rel.montgomery mcadory,c,wl,at.montgomery argues that the illinois supreme court decision was objectively unreasonable because it failed to address the tumey line of cases.
like the district court,we find judge samuels alleged interest in convicting montgomery and sentencing him to death to be too speculative and insubstantial to overcome the presumption of his impartiality.in tumey and ward,it was certain that only convictions would generate revenue thus,the judges bias was clear.similarly,in aetna life ins.it was certain that the alabama supreme court justice decision and unprecedented award of damages made success in his own contemporaneous lawsuit far more likely.by contrast,judge samuels interest in montgomery case is attenuated and based on several,dubious assumptions.we would have to assume from assistant state attorney arthur sudden outburst on june,that he actually intended to reveal the meeting to the public.that,however,is nowhere near certain judge samuels himself testified that this was not the first time he had seen arthur lose his temper.at.we would also have to assume that public disclosure of the meeting would impact judge samuels career.but that,too,is highly speculative.because both prosecutors and defense attorneys were present throughout the meeting,there was little or no appearance of impropriety attached to it,except in arthur mind.further,the illinois supreme court determined that discussion at the meeting was limited to scheduling,and montgomery has not offered clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.e.ex parte scheduling meetings do not necessarily offend due process rights.drobny comm r of internal revenue,cir.
montgomery theory of bias more closely resembles bracy gramley,which the district court cited in its order.in bracy,the petitioner was convicted by a judge who was later convicted of accepting bribes from defendants.the had not paid a that the judge convicted him in order to deflect suspicion that he was soft on defendants,which might draw attention to his corrupt activities.the supreme court characterized this as a theory of compensatory,or camouflag
