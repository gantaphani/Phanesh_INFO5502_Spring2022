robin lovitt was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of his former during the commission of a robbery.his challenges to his conviction and strickland,brady,and been heard by many courts.the supreme court of virginia rendered two thorough and conscientious opinions in his on direct appeal and one on habeas.the state habeas court in arlington also treated lovitt claims with care,holding a evidentiary hearing and authoring detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.finally,the federal district court again reviewed lovitt claims,and dismissed them in a meticulous and lengthy opinion.
this case is a good example of the care with which state courts should treat capital cases.we think the virginia supreme court properly resolved lovitt claims.even if that were not the case,however,we could not begin to say that it unreasonably applied clearly established supreme court law.d.in so concluding,we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing the petition.
the virginia supreme court has provided a full account of the facts of the murder on lovitt direct appeal,see lovitt commonwealth,lovitt i,so we need only summarize the salient evidence here.
on november,clayton dicks was brutally murdered at the pool hall where he worked in arlington county.dicks was stabbed six times in his back and chest.when his body was found,the police discovered that the pool hall cash register had been broken and one of the drawers was missing.
also missing that morning was a pair of scissors kept next to the register.a police canine unit found scissors of a similar description lying in the woods about fifteen yards behind the pool hall.those scissors had blood on them which matched the dna of clayton dicks.amy hudon,a manager at the pool hall,testified that two months before dicks was murdered,the cash register drawer was not opening properly.robin lovitt,an employee of hers at the time,assisted her by prying a pair of scissors into the drawer latch and forcing it open.
clayton dicks was scheduled to work the late managerial shift at the pool hall on the night he was murdered.he arrived for work between and in the morning.the other employees left the pool hall by,making dicks the only employee remaining on the premises.at,jose alverado and carlos clavell arrived at the pool hall and witnessed two men fighting behind the bar.alvarado testified that he saw the shorter man stab the taller man six or seven times with a weapon.once the taller man fell to the floor,alvarado said he saw the shorter man repeatedly kick him.at the preliminary hearing,alvarado could not say he was certain that lovitt was the assailant,but he did testify at trial that he was sure.
warren grant is lovitt cousin.he lives on the other side of the woods from the pool hall,about a quarter mile away.grant testified that lovitt arrived at his house between and on november.grant said lovitt was carrying a large square metal box.the two cousins opened the box with a screwdriver and split the money that was inside.
the government theory at trial was that lovitt used the scissors to pry open the cash register but was caught in the act by dicks.thus surprised,lovitt allegedly stabbed dicks several times with the scissors before fleeing with the drawer to his cousin house,discarding the scissors along the way.
in support of this theory,a forensic scientist testified that the cash register drawer that had been found at grant house did in fact come from the pool hall register,and that the pry marks on the drawer were made by the same scissors that were found in the woods.another scientist testified that the chance of someone other than dicks contributing to the dna sample on the tip of the scissors found in the woods was in more than billion.
another key witness for the prosecution was casel lucas.lucas was an inmate at the arlington county jail who befriended lovitt during the two months they lived together in the same unit.lucas testified that lovitt confided in him about murdering dicks.according to lucas,lovitt said he waited in the bathroom late at night on november until he knew everyone but dicks had left the pool hall.apparently,lovitt then attempted to jimmy open the cash register drawer.when confronted and recognized by dicks,lovitt told lucas he stabbed dicks several times and took the cash register drawer to his cousin house before leaving to buy drugs.
after hearing all of this evidence,on september,a jury found robin lovitt guilty of the capital murder of clayton dicks during the commission of a robbery.
in a separate sentencing proceeding,the government sought the death penalty for lovitt on a theory of future dangerousness.see ann.the prosecutors introduced evidence of lovitt rather extensive criminal history,starting with charges of assault when he was just eleven years old.the jury learned that while at a juvenile detention center during his teenage years,lovitt was disciplined for fighting,assault,and possession of contraband.he was convicted of grand larceny in and served months in jail.at various times in his life,lovitt was convicted of petit larceny,grand larceny,breaking and entering,distribution and possession of narcotics,attempted robbery,parole violations,destruction of property,and assault and battery.lovitt was on parole at the time of dicks murder.
to mitigate this evidence,lovitt attorneys presented testimony from the guards at the arlington county jail.those officers stated that lovitt had not caused any disciplinary problems while in jail on the present charges,and in fact regularly attended bible study and aa meetings.lovitt also offered testimony from his,lemanda jones,who testified that lovitt was the oldest of twelve children who took care of his younger siblings.
the jury weighed the aggravating and mitigating evidence and ordered death as the punishment for lovitt murder conviction.
lovitt appealed to the supreme court of virginia,which affirmed his conviction and sentence on november.lovitt i.in october of the following year,the united states supreme court denied lovitt petition for a writ of certiorari,d.
in may,virtually all of the evidence from lovitt trial was thrown away as ordered by robert mccarthy,a clerk in the arlington county circuit court.mccarthy did not notify anyone at the commonwealth attorney office of his intentions to dispose of these items.he had the evidence discarded in order to make additional space in the evidence room,and because he had received a mandate from the supreme court of virginia indicating that lovitt appeal was over.
in january of,lovitt new counsel filed a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the petition alleged,among others,that lovitt due process rights were violated because the state destroyed evidence and thus prevented adequate habeas review,that the prosecution willfully suppressed exculpatory evidence in violation of brady maryland,d,and that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance under strickland washington,d.
the supreme court of virginia reviewed lovitt petition,and decided that it raised issues of fact which required an evidentiary hearing to resolve.thus,at the supreme court direction,the circuit court of arlington county held a evidentiary hearing on june and.prior to the hearing,the circuit court granted much of lovitt extensive discovery requests.accordingly,lovitt was permitted to depose the two assistant commonwealth attorneys who prosecuted his case,and the head clerk of the court where the evidence was destroyed.he was also authorized to subpoena the social service records of many of his family members and he was given copies of certain records from the prosecutor files.
following this comprehensive evidentiary hearing in which live testimony was heard from over twenty witnesses,the circuit court issued a report with approximately fifty detailed findings of fact and over ten pages of proposed conclusions of law.it recommended that lovitt petition be denied.
the state supreme court then reviewed lovitt claim once a full briefing from the parties and oral argument.the court reviewed the arlington circuit court factual findings to ensure they were supported by the evidence,and it reviewed all legal issues de novo.on september,the supreme court of virginia unanimously accepted the circuit court findings and recommendations.lovitt warden,lovitt ii.lovitt state habeas petition was dismissed,and his subsequent writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court was denied seven months later,d.
having exhausted direct appeal and state collateral review,lovitt turned to federal court.on december,the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia stayed lovitt execution,allowing him to petition for federal habeas corpus relief under.that court heard oral argument and reviewed among others lovitt strickland,brady,and destruction of evidence claims.in a lengthy opinion,it concluded that lovitt petition was rightly dismissed.lovitt true,d.lovitt now appeals that decision.on october,the district court granted lovitt application for a certificate of appealability on three of his four claims,and this court expanded the order on november,to include the fourth claim.c.
lovitt federal habeas petition was filed pursuant to,which was amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.with this statute,congress provided a federal habeas remedy for state prisoners,but only when the state court proceedings 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
the supreme court has interpreted these provisions to require that federal courts accord considerable deference in their review of state habeas proceedings.terry williams taylor,d.thus,a state court decision is only contrary to clearly established law when it applies a rule that contradicts the governing supreme court holding or confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from its precedent.id.at.
similarly,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.see also nuth,cir stressing the supreme court recognition that congress chose the word unreasonable in aedpa instead of the word erroneous or incorrect.further,a decision adjudicated on the merits in a state court and based on a factual determination will not be overturned on factual grounds unless objectively unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the proceeding.cockrell,d.
when congress crafted this deferential standard of review in aedpa,it was at least partially motivated to limit federal intrusion into state criminal adjudications.michael williams taylor,d.it is,after all,the job of state courts to faithfully apply federal law,art.vi,cl.their efforts in this regard are to be respected as the acts of sovereign entities,whose sworn allegiance to the constitution and the laws of the united states is as solemn as our own.
keeping in mind the deference we owe to the virginia courts,we take up lovitt claims in the order he presents them.
lovitt first asserts that his trial lawyers provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel.he claims that they hardly investigated his background at all and thus neglected to present relevant mitigating evidence at sentencing about his nightmarish childhood.this performance,lovitt says,violated his sixth amendment right to counsel.
the standard used for evaluating ineffective assistance claims was set out by the supreme court in strickland washington,d.the now familiar strickland test requires a showing counsel performance must have fallen below an objective standard of reasonableness,and that deficient performance must have prejudiced the defense.id.at.
the supreme court of virginia rejected lovitt argument by holding that any alleged deficiencies on the part of lovitt lawyers did not alter the outcome of his sentencing.lovitt ii,at.the district court agreed with that conclusion,but additionally held that lovitt counsel performed in an objectively reasonable way.lovitt,d at.although it was perfectly appropriate for the virginia court to rely exclusively on the prejudice prong of strickland,we will nonetheless address both parts of the test here.
lovitt correctly notes that in death penalty cases,counsel must adequately investigate and present evidence in mitigation of guilt.williams,at.see also byram ozmint,cir.however,in assessing a lawyer performance in this regard,the supreme court has emphasized that strickland does not require counsel to investigate every conceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely the effort would be to assist the defendant at sentencing.wiggins smith,d.and,when courts review these decisions,every effort must be made to eliminate the distorting efforts of hindsight.strickland,at.
in many cases,counsel decision not to pursue a particular approach at sentencing reflects not incompetence,but rather a sound strategic choice.see rose lee,cir.accord bunch thompson,cir.the district court found that lovitt attorneys made a reasoned,informed,and strategic decision not to introduce lovitt social history records during the sentencing phase of trial.lovitt true,d.for the reasons that follow,we agree.
first,we think it relevant that the state habeas court found that lovitt did not give counsel permission to speak to members of his family,and he stated to counsel that his family does not care about his situation.ja see also lovitt,d at.we need not hold that heeding instructions of this sort from a capital defendant renders counsel performance effective in every set of circumstances.but capital sentencing proceedings do not set at naught the basic principle of relations namely that counsel,for all their learning and experience,remain in the end the agents of the one most intimately affected.lovitt is correct to insist that a client decision in this regard should be an informed one.at the same time,however,lovitt lawyers were hardly ineffective for incorporating their client wishes into their professional judgment.see strickland,at.the reasonableness of counsel actions may be determined or substantially influenced by the defendant own statements or actions in particular,what investigation decisions are reasonable depends critically on such information.
second,lovitt two seasoned attorneys knew that the information about lovitt family background was classic evidence.the virginia supreme court noted,in preparation for trial,lovitt attorneys obtained all of lovitt jail records from the arlington county detention facility,all of his juvenile records,his records from the beaumont juvenile facility,his medical records,and his presentence report.lovitt ii,at quoting a factual finding from the circuit court.lovitt lawyers were also familiar with lovitt family because they had represented many of them in prior criminal proceedings.they knew that all five of lovitt brothers were incarcerated,that at least two of his six sisters had criminal records,and that lovitt family had a long history of drug use and a reputed predilection for criminal activity in the community.
after listening to lovitt lawyers testify at the state habeas hearing,the court found that they had made a strategic decision not to present evidence that would have described lovitt and his family extensive drug use because they believed such evidence would have invited the commonwealth to argue that lovitt murdered the victim for a rock of crack cocaine.as one of lovitt lawyers explained at the hearing 
i was trying to avoid the connection between robin and substance abuse i was fearful that the door would be open,that the prosecution could parade up and down in front of that jury with a piece of simulated crack and argue,this is the value that robin lovitt put on dicks life.and i was terribly afraid that that would be devastating testimony in front of a jury,and i was doing everything i could to avoid that connection.
this decision does not represent deficient lawyering.lovitt lawyers were contesting the government theory that lovitt posed a risk of future danger.see ann.as one of them explained at the habeas hearing,t he commonwealth was concentrating on trying to get the death penalty on future dangerousness so i thought the way to combat the future dangerousness was to demonstrate what a good prisoner he had been.ja.
this strategy of not risking a more determined prosecutorial onslaught with respect to lovitt problematic past was sensible.for,if lovitt lawyers had pursued a strategy of mitigation that focused on lovitt social history,they risked calling further attention to lovitt drug addiction,underscoring his quick temper and physical aggressiveness referenced in his social records,and hammering home his checkered criminal past.his lawyers chose not to emphasize this part of lovitt life but instead to focus on the fact that lovitt had behaved well recently,participated in a prison bible study,and attended alcoholics anonymous meetings.see lovitt ii,at.this was not an unreasonable decision.for when a defendant family background is by no means uniformly helpful to him since it suggest s violent tendencies,it is reasonable to choose not to present it.burger kemp,d.see also hunt lee,cir.
third,despite lovitt contentions to the contrary,his trial lawyers strategic decisions were different from the ones made by the lawyers in wiggins.trial counsel in wiggins chose to focus almost exclusively on contesting guilt and hardly presented any mitigation evidence at all,despite counsels exposure to records alluding to the petitioner extensive history of childhood sexual abuse and rape.wiggins,at.the supreme court found this to be an unreasonable professional error.id.at.but,in so doing,it also noted that wiggins social history contained little of the double edge we have found to justify limited investigations in other cases.id.at.we think the present situation is a precise example of what the supreme court was referencing when making this distinction.
while the lawyers in wiggins limited their investigation artificially and were thus making decisions in the dark,id.at,the lawyers in lovitt case were personally familiar with lovitt family history and were well aware of the skeletons that would be found in that closet.while the lawyers in wiggins did not present any evidence of the defendant life history at all,id.at,the lawyers in lovitt case introduced evidence from lovitt about lovitt alcoholic and from prison guards who testified that lovitt behaved well in jail.while the lawyers in wiggins made a decision which resulted from inattention,the lawyers in lovitt case made a deliberate choice which resulted from a reasoned strategic judgment.id.at.we can not ignore these differences.
finally,we note that lovitt attorneys found themselves between a rock and a hard place.had they ignored lovitt advice and interviewed his family members without his consent,then they could be accused of being ineffective for ignoring their client wishes.had they introduced his family as witnesses and watched them be impeached through their own criminal histories on,then counsel could be accused of being ineffective for not anticipating that disaster.and,no matter how adroitly the pivot was made,had they presented an inconsistent approach between the guilt phase and the penalty phase he did not do it,but if he did,this is why,then they could be accused of being ineffective for forfeiting the trust of the jury.
we refuse to place defense lawyers in this position.trial counsel is too frequently placed in a situation with respect to possible mitigating evidence at the sentencing phase of a capital case.bunch,at.therefore,t he best course for a federal habeas court is to credit plausible strategic judgments.also truesdale moore,cir.to do otherwise would be a transparent misuse of the habeas court power of hindsight.
even if lovitt counsel had been deficient in their performance,we agree with the supreme court of virginia that the outcome of the penalty phase in lovitt trial would have remained the same.the relevant question is whether there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.see also byram,at.to answer this question,the virginia court properly observed that i n determining prejudice,we reweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of available mitigating evidence.lovitt ii,at quoting wiggins,at.and citing williams taylor,at.
as the virginia court noted,the aggravating evidence in lovitt case was quite severe.it included the brutal nature of the attack on dicks,the fact that lovitt murdered dicks solely to eliminate any witness to the robbery,lovitt prior record of numerous felonies,and the fact that lovitt was on parole at the time he murdered dicks.id.at.
by contrast,the mitigating evidence that lovitt says should have been presented to the jury was what the virginia supreme court described as mixed.id.the court explained that although the testimony at the habeas hearing described an abusive and alcoholic,other evidence in the juvenile records contained social worker descriptions of lovitt childhood home as being very clean and nicely furnished with parents who were strong individuals who provided lovitt with a stable home life.id.at.
further,while general allegations of sexual abuse in lovitt family were made at the habeas hearing,the virginia court found that there is no evidence describing the nature or extent of sexual abuse allegedly inflicted on lovitt by his stepfather.id.at.without this,the court concluded it would have to resort to speculation to consider any sexual abuse that lovitt may have suffered.id.quite reasonably,the court declined to do so.
not only did the supreme court of virginia find the mitigating evidence in lovitt case to be occasionally contradictory and to require speculation,but it further noted that much of this evidence could be viewed both in aggravation and in mitigation of the offense.id.for example,evidence in lovitt juvenile records indicated that lovitt began a cycle of crime and aggressive behavior at an early age and indicated that he had a serious problem with anger.id.at.it is entirely possible that presenting evidence of lovitt social history to the jury and drawing attention to this can of worms would have actually hurt lovitt case,rather than helped it.
in addition to the mitigating and aggravating factors,the supreme court of virginia also properly identified the relevant supreme court and proceeded to apply those cases with great care.the court noted several distinctions between those cases and lovitt case,and concluded,properly,that these differences greatly altered the prejudice analysis.
first,the virginia supreme court carefully distinguished wiggins.as noted above,the penalty phase in wiggins contained no evidence of the defendant life history,with counsel instead seeking to prove that he did not actually commit the crime.wiggins,at.by contrast,as the virginia court pointed out,the penalty phase in lovitt case contained recent personal history the testimony from the prison officials and some family history as well testimony from his,lemanda jones.
the virginia court found two additional important differences between wiggins and lovitt.wiggins had a diminished mental capacity and no criminal record,neither of which his counsel emphasized.id.at.by contrast,the virginia court noted that there was no indication that lovitt had a diminished mental capacity,and he did in fact have a lengthy criminal record.lovitt ii,at.lovitt says these distinctions are immaterial.but we can not believe that it would not make a difference to a jury whether a defendant had a mental impairment and whether he was a career criminal or a offender.
similarly,the virginia court found williams to be distinguishable on its facts.like unlike was found to have a mental disorder.williams,at.and,in contrast to the arguably conflicted evidence in lovitt case,williams had unquestionably suffered extreme parents had been imprisoned for two years for criminally neglecting him.id.at.finally,the court was disturbed in williams by the fact that the defendant attorneys never introduced a witness who offered to testify about the defendant positive adjustment to prison life.id.at.here,by comparison,similar witnesses did in fact speak to the jury on lovitt behalf.
thus,the supreme court of virginia properly identified the supreme court cases it was to apply to lovitt ineffectiveness claim strickland,wiggins,and williams.we think the court properly applied these holdings,but in any event it certainly did not apply them unreasonably.d.we therefore uphold the virginia court rejection of lovitt strickland claim.
lovitt additionally argues that the outcome of his case is unconstitutional because the prosecution failed to disclose material exculpatory evidence,in violation of brady maryland,d.
for a brady claim to be successful,three requirements must be met the evidence must be favorable to the accused,it must have been suppressed by the government,either willfully or inadvertently,and the suppression must have been material.monroe angelone,cir.this last element,the question of materiality,depends on whether there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.kyles whitley,d citing united states bagley,d.
lovitt says the prosecutors in his case withheld two material pieces of evidence the opinion of a medical examiner and the prison informant history of cooperating with the government.because we agree with the supreme court of virginia that neither piece of evidence was material,within the meaning of brady and kyles,we reject both arguments.
lovitt first argument under brady concerns the opinion of marie,the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on the victim and who testified at lovitt trial.
during trial,was not asked about whether the bloody scissors admitted into evidence were consistent with dicks stab wounds.however,prior to trial,she did examine two pairs of scissors found at the scene she was not presented with the bloody pair found in the woods.at that time,she opined that scissors with three and a half inch long blades could not have caused all of dicks wounds,some of which were eight inches deep.this opinion was not revealed to lovitt defense team.nonetheless,lovitt lawyers did have access to autopsy explicitly mentions that investigators presented scissors to her with three and a half inch long counsel of course had the chance to her at trial.
first,we note that materiality is not considered item by item,rather it must be assessed collectively.mchone polk,cir citing kyles.in lovitt case,after surveying all of the evidence,it is hard to believe that the doctor opinion would have seriously undermined the conclusion that the scissors were the murder weapon.
as the district court observed,never examined the actual pair of scissors believed to be the murder weapon.lovitt,d at.that pair of bloody scissors with the victim dna on it was found on the flight path from the murder scene.a forensic expert testified that those bloody scissors conclusively matched pry marks found on the cash register drawer.and that very drawer was ultimately discovered at the home of the defendant cousin who testified that the defendant had brought it there.under these circumstances,lovitt is hard pressed to show,as he must,that the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.kyles,at.
next,we observe several key factual findings made by the state habeas court after its evidentiary hearing.the circuit court found that a fter dna test results came back confirming that the victim blood was on the scissors,indicated to the attorneys that she had been wrong in her first conclusion regarding the scissors.this divergence in view undercuts the materiality of the doctor initial assessment,and makes it less probable that the assessment would have altered the outcome of the trial.
moreover,the circuit court found that lovitt trial talking to questioned whether scissors could inflict dicks wounds.this concern led them to contact a separate commonwealth expert who told them that in a frenzied violent attack,the tissue of the body can become compressed,and that it was conceivable that these scissors were capable of being the murder weapon.
in light of these important factual findings,we can not say that initial examining scissors other than the alleged murder material exculpatory evidence under brady.the supreme court of virginia was certainly not unreasonable to so conclude.
finally,we are persuaded by the opinion of the district court which emphasized lovitt access to opinion before trial.lovitt,at a s both the circuit court and the supreme court of virginia found,prior to trial,lovitt attorney had access to and could have asked her to compare the victim wounds to the various pairs of scissors.
before trial,lovitt attorneys obtained a copy of the autopsy report,had access to the bloody scissors,and could have easily questioned about the scissors on.we have explained before that where the exculpatory information is not only available to the defendant but also lies in a source where a reasonable defendant would have looked,a defendant is not entitled to the benefit of the brady doctrine.united states wilson,cir.such was the case here 
the second part of lovitt brady allegation involves casel lucas,the prison inmate who testified against lovitt at trial.it is undisputed that lucas did not receive and was not promised a benefit for testifying in lovitt trial.however,lovitt says lucas is a professional snitch who had a long history of cooperating with the government.he says the prosecutors should have provided lucas witness history to the defense for use as impeachment material.see united states bagley,d explaining that evidence to impeach a witness credibility counts as exculpatory for purposes of a brady claim.
according to lovitt,lucas had cooperated with the government in the and northern virginia area on four different occasions in the evans case,the young case,the lee case,and in the starbucks triple homicide case.the prosecutors did not inform lovitt lawyers of lucas role in any of these cases.significantly,however,the virginia supreme court found that lovitt prosecutors were only aware of lucas involvement in one of these cases,the evans case.lovitt ii,at.we have no reason to doubt its conclusion.d.
as an initial matter,we think petitioner exaggerates the value of this information.with respect to the young,lee,and starbucks cases,although lucas may have had a unilateral expectation of a benefit for his assistance,it is clear that he did not receive one in any of these cases.lovitt ii,at.moreover,there is no indication that lucas prior testimony was anything but truthful.see lovitt i,at.the exculpatory value of evidence is limited when the effect of disclosure might well be to emphasize to the jury that the prior testimony was in fact accurate.
in any event,because the prosecutors were not aware of lucas participation in the young,lee,and starbucks cases,we need not ask whether this information was material.see united states agurs,d brady only applies when evidence is known to the prosecution but unknown to the defense.of these three cases,only the young case took place in arlington county.however,as explained above,the state habeas court concluded that lovitt prosecutors had no knowledge of lucas assistance in the young case which had been prosecuted three years earlier.and,as the supreme court of virginia noted,lucas never testified in the young case since it resulted in a guilty plea,which when taken by the court,was accompanied by a recitation of facts that contained no mention of a confession to lucas at all.lovitt ii,at.
as for the lee and starbucks cases,those cases were not even prosecuted in arlington county.admittedly,an individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to others a
