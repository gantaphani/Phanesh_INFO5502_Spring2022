robert lynch appeals from the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus based on a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.the state court refused lynch trial counsel request to charge the jury that,to find lynch guilty of robbery by using or threatening the immediate use of a dangerous instrument,it had to find that lynch actually possessed a dangerous instrument at the time of the crime.although trial counsel made a full record on that request,and cited the applicable new york court of appeals case holding such possession to be a required element of the crime,lynch appellate counsel failed to raise the trial court refusal to give the charge as an error.new york law is clear that lynch was entitled to the requested instruction.indeed,after the conviction but before appellate counsel filed her opening brief the court of appeals reaffirmed the possession requirement,making clear that refusal to give the requested instruction is reversible error.appellate counsel failure to raise that issue and her decision instead to raise weaker issues that were unlikely to succeed fell below prevailing norms of professional conduct.further,given the weakness of the evidence that lynch in fact possessed a weapon during the robbery,the instructional error was not harmless,and there is a reasonable probability that,had counsel raised the issue,the state appellate court would have reversed lynch conviction on the most serious count.
lynch timely raised his ineffective assistance claim in a petition for a writ of error coram nobis,which was denied without explanation by the new york courts.the district court michael telesca,judge denied lynch federal petition for habeas corpus,holding that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient for a rational jury to find that lynch possessed his handgun at the time of the robbery.that was the wrong prejudice standard to apply.applying the correct standard,and in light of the evidence at trial and the pattern of the jury verdicts,we conclude that the state courts dismissal of lynch claim was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,and that his appellate counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance.we therefore reverse and remand with instructions to grant the writ conditionally.
background 
i.the crime 
on october,rachel tally verstraten drove to the family dollar store in rochester,ny,with her two children.she parked next to a dodge stratus,in which she saw two men sitting.tally verstraten got out of her car and opened the back door to get her younger daughter out of a.she then felt someone come up behind her and shove something into her right side.joint app x at.tally verstraten assailant,later identified as lynch,told her that he had a gun and would shoot her in front of her children if she did not relinquish her purse.she looked down to see if lynch did in fact have a gun and asked if he was kidding.he replied,n o,give me your purse or i hurt you and your kids.id.lynch then reached out and touched tally verstraten pocket she pushed him back and told him not to touch her.the two began to struggle over the purse lynch grabbed it,but tally verstraten would not let go.lynch cock ed his fist back and hit tally verstraten in the face.id.at.she then released her grip on the purse.lynch got into the passenger side of the stratus and he and the other man drove away.two witnesses saw the robbery ediberto diaz,and his son,ediberto diaz.by chance,the two diazes found themselves several minutes later driving behind the same stratus they had seen at the family dollar.they observed the car enter a gas station and two men get out.the diazes called the police.when the police arrived,the two men ran.lynch was apprehended and told the officers,i knew i should have gotten into that car.id.at.meanwhile,other officers arrested a second man,rodney brandon,and recovered an unloaded caliber handgun from him,as well as ammunition he was carrying in a separate pocket.in a procedure in the family dollar parking lot,the diazes identified lynch and brandon tally verstraten stated that she was certain that lynch was the man who stole her purse,but that she could not identify brandon.the purse was found in the stratus.lynch later made a statement to police,admitting that he had run up on the woman and bumped her in the mouth.lynch superintendent dolce,cv,ecf,at.
ii.the trial 
lynch and brandon were each indicted on two counts of robbery under new york penal law armed with a deadly weapon and using or threatening the immediate use of a dangerous instrument,and two counts of robbery under penal law aided by another person and a causing physical injury to a.brandon was also indicted on two counts of criminal possession of a weapon.the defendants were tried together.
at trial,tally verstraten testified about her encounter with lynch as follows 
q and did he touch you anywhere else at that point 
a he touched me like one hand on the side and like shoved something against my side waist indicating.
q now could you tell what he was shoving 
q could it have been his fist 
a it could have been.
q once you felt that you must have reacted to it.what did you do 
a um,i asked if he was kidding me.
q did you turn to face him 
a no,i was looking down.i wanted to see if there was a gun cause he said there was.
q when you were looking down pardon me what were you looking at his hands 
a i was just looking down.it was dark so i did see anything.
q okay.you certain once he said he had a gun you took it upon yourself to find out if that was true 
a that right.
q obviously 
q you concluded that he did have a gun 
joint app x at.the diazes also testified that they never saw lynch possess or use a weapon during the robbery.
lynch did not present a defense but brandon testified on his own behalf.he said that he had never met lynch and did not participate in the robbery.instead,brandon testified that on the day of his arrest,he had been walking through a field when a man approached him and offered to sell him a gun for.brandon obliged,testifying that he had bought the gun for no purpose.id.at.he was then walking down the street when the police accosted him,searched him,found the gun he had just bought,and placed him under arrest.
later,at the charge conference,counsel for both defendants asked the trial court to instruct the jury that,to convict under penal law,the count involving the use or threatened use of a dangerous instrument,the jury had to find that the defendant possessed a dangerous instrument at the time of the robbery.for authority,counsel cited the decision of the new york court of appeals in people pena,in an oral decision,the trial court acknowledged that case,but declined to give the possession instruction.lynch counsel then asked the court again 
i requested you as to count two to include in your charge an essential element of the commission of that offense,that the charge that alleges the use or the threatened use of a dangerous instrument,i ask that you charge the additional element that the in fact possessed a dangerous instrument.
joint app x at.the trial court again denied the request.
the court subsequently instructed the jury that to convict of robbery under penal law,the jury had to find only two elements first,that the defendant forcibly stole property and second,that during the commission of the crime or an immediate flight therefrom,the defendant or another participant in the crime used or threatened the immediate use of a dangerous weapon to wit,a handgun.id.at.
the jury convicted lynch of robbery in the first degree,involving the use or threatened use of a dangerous instrument.it acquitted him,however,of robbery in the first degree while armed with a deadly weapon,convicting him instead of the lesser included offense of simple robbery.it also convicted him of the two counts of robbery in the second degree aided by another person and causing physical injury to a.the jury acquitted brandon of all counts related to the robbery,but convicted him of criminal possession of a weapon.the trial court sentenced lynch to a year term of imprisonment for the robbery count,year terms for the counts,and a year term for the count,the sentences to run concurrently.
iii.the direct appeal 
lynch was represented by new counsel on appeal.for reasons that are not clear from the record,appellate counsel did not file her opening brief until august,nearly five years after the sentencing.in the intervening years,the new york court of appeals decided people ford,which held,relying on pena,that the trial court in that case had erred in failing to inform the jury that actual possession was an essential,though implicit,element of robbery,instead merely parrot ing the statute,as the trial court did here.id.at.following ford,new york amended its pattern jury instructions for robbery under penal law to include language stating that the people must prove that the defendant possessed a dangerous instrument.see people grant,quoting penal law revised.
lynch counsel did not raise any claim of instructional error in his direct appeal,however.instead,the appellate brief raised six issues,arguing that lynch was never actually convicted of robbery in the first degree because the trial transcript reflected that the court clerk asked the jury if it found lynch guilty only of robbery the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for robbery the evidence presented to the grand jury and petit jury was insufficient to support the convictions for robbery the convictions were against the weight of the evidence the court erred in excluding a call that the defense sought to admit and the sentence was excessively harsh.
the new york supreme court appellate division,fourth department,affirmed lynch conviction and sentence on february.people lynch,dep t lynch i.with regard to the court clerk error in asking the jury whether they found lynch guilty of robbery,the court held that the claim was unpreserved,and,in any event,the verdict sheet and the trial court charge made it clear that the jury had in fact convicted lynch of robbery.see id.at.regarding the sufficiency and weight of the evidence arguments,the court held,contrary to defendant further contention,the evidence is legally sufficient to support the conviction.viewing the evidence in light of the elements of the crimes as charged to the jury,we conclude that the verdict is not against the weight of the evidence.id.at citations omitted.the appellate division found lynch additional arguments to be without merit.leave to appeal to the court of appeals was denied.people lynch.
iv.postconviction proceedings 
lynch timely filed a pro se petition for a writ of error coram nobis in the state court,arguing,inter alia,that his appellate counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise the instructional error in his direct appeal.the appellate division summarily denied the petition,stating only that,having considered lynch petition and supporting affidavit and the affirmation of the assistant district attorney,it is hereby ordered that the motion is denied.joint app x at people lynch,dep t.leave to appeal to the court of appeals was again denied.people lynch.
lynch then filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus,asserting the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim,as well as several other issues.the district court denied the petition.lynch superintendent dolce,cv mat,wl,lynch ii.as to the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim,the district court was not prepared to say that appellate counsel was outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance in failing to press the instructional error argument on appeal.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court noted that respondent argued that the claim of instructional error was unpreserved,and stated that c ourts in this circuit have consistently held that appellate counsel should not be faulted for failing to raise an unpreserved claim.id.the district court went on,however,to question the conclusion of the assistant district attorney that the actual possession claim was unpreserved,noting that counsel had requested the charge,was rebuffed by the trial court,and after the trial court gave its charge to the jury,the court asked whether there were any requests or exceptions to the charge other than those previously made a part of the record.id.emphasis added alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the district court stated,arguably at least the judge and the trial attorneys understood the actual possession claim to be preserved.id.
the district court did not finally rule on the adequacy of counsel performance,however.instead,it held that lynch failed to demonstrate prejudice,because,as the appellate division found on appeal,the evidence was legally sufficient for the jury to find that petitioner actually possessed the handgun found later on his person.id.the district court noted that while a robber mere assertion that he had a weapon is not enough to convict of robbery under new york law,here there was more tally verstraten felt her assailant press an object into her back as he announced it was a gun,and,immediately after the robbery,lynch got into the car with brandon,who was later found with a gun id.at.based on this evidence,the district court held that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence for a rational juror to conclude that lynch had a gun in his possession at the time of the robbery,and that he used that gun to threaten tally verstraten and forcibly steal her purse.id.therefore,the district court concluded that the outcome of lynch direct appeal would not have been different,even if appellate counsel had raised the instructional issue.id.
we granted a certificate of appealability solely on the issue of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.lynch superintendent dolce,cir,ecf.

the sixth amendment guarantees the right to effective representation on direct appeal.see evitts lucey.in assessing a claim that a lawyer representation did not meet the constitutional minimum,we indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct f ell within the wide range of professional assistance.strickland washington.to overcome that presumption,a petitioner must establish both parts of the familiar strickland test,showing,first,that his attorney performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,id.at,and,second,that there was prejudice,meaning a reasonable probability that,but for counsel error,the outcome would have been different,id.at.this test applies in the appellate context as well as at trial.see smith robbins,clark stinson,cir.in that context,counsel has no duty to raise every issue that could be raised.see jones barnes.nevertheless,appellate counsel performance must meet prevailing professional norms.see smith murray,citing strickland.we have held that a petitioner may establish constitutionally inadequate performance of appellate counsel if he shows that counsel omitted significant and obvious issues while pursuing issues that were clearly and significantly weaker.mayo henderson,cir.the claim whose omission forms the basis of an ineffective assistance claim may be either a or a claim,so long as the failure to raise the state claim fell outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.id.alteration omitted,quoting claudio scully,cir.

ii.the standard applied 
at the outset,we pause to note what is at stake in this appeal.this appeal has no effect on lynch well deserved and fairly obtained convictions for the serious crimes of second and robbery,or the sentences imposed on those counts.the evidence showed that lynch forcibly stole from a young mother,threatening violence against her and her children and physically assaulting her in the process,and made his getaway with the aid of another person.that evidence overwhelmingly supports his convictions for second and robbery,for which he must serve a year prison term.all legal challenges to those convictions and that sentence have been rejected.
lynch was further sentenced,however,to two additional years in prison,based on a conviction for robbery.new york has seen fit to divide the crime of robbery into degrees,reserving the highest degree carrying the highest penalties for a select group of the most serious cases of forcible stealing.these cases are marked by specified aggravating circumstances.lynch was convicted of this most serious category of robbery based on the aggravating factor of using or threatening the immediate use of a dangerous instrument.penal law.notably,the jury acquitted him of a parallel charge of robbery based on his being actually armed with a deadly weapon.id.the only dangerous instrument or deadly weapon of which there was any evidence was the gun that lynch claimed to have when threatening his victim,which the prosecution argued was recovered from brandon at his arrest.
on the face of the statute on which lynch was convicted,there is an apparent ambiguity can a defendant be guilty for threatening a victim with the use of a dangerous weapon when the threat is,in effect,an empty one,because the defendant did not actually possess any weapon lynch counsel asked the trial judge to advise the jury that such an empty though obviously frightening and malicious threat would not aggravate the crime to robbery.trial counsel was astute to raise this issue.if the jury was not told that actual possession of a weapon was required,lynch was very likely to be convicted of robbery the victim testimony,which the jury had every reason to believe,was unequivocal that lynch had threatened to shoot her.but if an empty threat would not suffice,and possession of an actual weapon was required,as discussed more fully below,the defense would have a good chance to avoid conviction on the most serious,aggravated charge.
in short,the legal issue that lynch trial lawyer attempted to raise,and that forms the underlying issue lynch continues to press,could not result in overturning his conviction and year sentence for second and robbery,but does affect whether he was also guilty of robbery.
with these issues in mind,and with full respect for the state primary role in reviewing its own convictions,we conclude,based upon a full review of the law and the record of this case,that the district court erred in determining that the state court decision denying lynch claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
appellate counsel performance 
as explained above,an appellate lawyer performance falls below professional standards when she fails to raise a significant,obvious issue,while pursuing issues that are clearly and significantly weaker.mayo,at.the jury instruction issue presented by trial counsel was precisely such a significant and apparent issue that a competent appellate attorney should have pursued.
first,there is no question that the issue had merit,because the trial court failure to give the requested instruction was unquestionably error under new york law.the principle that actual possession of a dangerous instrument is a necessary element of robbery by the threatened use of such an instrument had been established in new york for a generation by the time of lynch trial.in people pena,decided in,new york highest court stated,d ecisional law tells us that,though the statutory ground upon which the first degree robbery count was brought is not explicit in that regard,the jury was required to find that the defendant actually possessed a dangerous instrument at the time of the crime.at citations omitted.although that statement may have been dictum,following pena,the fourth department twice held that an empty verbal threat to use a dangerous weapon was legally insufficient for a conviction for robbery in the first degree and under statutes,because a ctual possession of a dangerous instrument is required for robbery in the first degree.people white,dep t people stefano,dep t.each of the other departments of the appellate division had similarly so held by the time of lynch trial.see grant,at collecting cases.thus,it was clearly error for the trial court to refuse to instruct the jury that possession was an element of robbery under penal law 
to the extent there was any doubt as to that requirement,it was dispelled after lynch conviction,but before his appellate counsel filing of the direct appeal brief,when the court of appeals decided people ford.that case reaffirmed the language in pena and held that a jury instruction that fails to use the term actual possession,or in any other way convey that requirement to the jury constitutes reversible error.id.at.following ford,but still before counsel filed the appellate brief in this case,the new york pattern jury instructions were amended to reflect that possession was an element of robbery in the first degree with the use or threatened use of a dangerous instrument.see grant,at,citing penal law revised.consequently,although the charge given by the trial court in was based on the pattern jury instruction,the ford decision in rendered beyond debate the conclusion that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct on the possession element by the time the appellate brief was filed in 
the issue was thus plainly a significant one for appeal.criminal defense lawyers are not often able to argue on appeal that the trial court refused a specific request for a jury instruction that,at the time the appeal is heard,the state highest court had recently held based on precedent must be given.moreover,the issue was patently obvious on the face of the record.trial counsel had diligently made the charge request,citing the controlling precedent a simple of that precedent would have revealed the recent court of appeals case applying the precedent in a highly analogous context,the pattern jury instructions including the omitted element,and the multitude of appellate division cases holding that proof of actual possession was required for a robbery conviction.had appellate counsel conducted that search,she would have recognized the error in the jury instruction and that it was a promising ground for success on appeal.the error,it is true,did not affect most of the counts of conviction.but,as discussed more fully below,lynch did not have any promising issues that could lead to his full exoneration,or even to a new trial on all counts.an issue that could result in reversal of the conviction would undo the most serious count of conviction,on which lynch had received the longest sentence.further,the omission can not be explained as a strategic decision to eschew arguments that attacked only the conviction the first two arguments raised in lynch appellate brief addressed only that conviction.strickland,at s trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.
respondent argues that appellate counsel performance was not deficient,because counsel argument that the evidence presented at trial was legally insufficient to convict lynch of robbery and her argument that the conviction was against the weight of the evidence were essentially the same as the instructional issue.resp t br.furthermore,the argument goes,attacking the sufficiency of the evidence to support a robbery conviction offered the possibility of greater relief,since a finding of insufficient evidence would result in outright acquittal,rather than just a new trial.
but counsel decision to challenge the sufficiency and weight of the evidence in relation to the possession requirement does not support any reasonable strategic basis for failing to raise the instructional error as a distinct,alternative argument for relief.counsel did not face a choice between the two arguments they could have been presented as alternative grounds for reversal of the robbery conviction.moreover,counsel who was aware of the ford decision would have recognized that raising the sufficiency claim without pointing to the error in the jury instruction significantly weakened the sufficiency argument.while the court of appeals held in ford that failure to instruct on possession was error,because there was no objection to the erroneous charge in that case,the court analyzed the sufficiency of the evidence in light of the trial court charge as given without exception.at.thus,counsel failure in this case to apprise the appellate court that trial counsel had requested the correct charge had the additional deleterious effect of framing the analysis of lynch other claims through the lens of the charge as given.and without the actual possession instruction,the evidence was clearly sufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that lynch was guilty of robbery based solely on his threat to shoot the victim.
respondent contended at oral argument that the appellate division would not have analyzed the sufficiency of the evidence here as the court of appeals did in ford,because here,trial counsel did request the possession charge.but even assuming that the court would have analyzed the sufficiency of the evidence in the context of the correct charge,rather than the charge as given the sufficiency issue was inherently weaker than the instructional issue,both because of the different standard applied to each kind of claim and because of the merits of the specific claims in this case.
the sufficiency issue is analyzed on a standard of whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,a rational juror could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.see people taylor.whether an erroneous jury instruction is harmless,by contrast,is analyzed for whether in light of the totality of the evidence,there is no reasonable possibility that the instructional error affected the jury verdict.people.douglas.the latter is plainly a far more favorable standard for an appellant.
further,the evidence that lynch possessed a dangerous instrument,while less than overwhelming,was as the appellate division ultimately concluded sufficient for a rational,properly instructed jury to convict him of robbery lynch said he had a gun,tally verstraten felt something being shoved against her,and the diazes identified brandon,who had a gun,as the person who was with lynch at the gas station,and who,a reasonable jury could infer,was with lynch during the robbery.the instructional issue,by contrast,was a clear winner.for the reasons discussed above,the legal error in the instruction was plain,and the issue had been properly preserved.moreover,while the evidence may have been sufficient to allow a jury to convict under the correct instruction,lynch had a strong argument that a jury might well have had a reasonable doubt about whether he did have a gun as discussed more fully below,none of the witnesses saw a gun during the robbery,tally verstraten did not believe lynch actually had one,the evidence about the struggle suggested it was unlikely that lynch was holding a gun while snatching tally vertraten purse with one hand and punching her with the other,and brandon denied having been present at the robbery or having possessed a gun in any relation to lynch.nor are these arguments purely hypothetical the jury acquitted lynch of the charge that they were properly told did require lynch to be armed with a weapon,and the jury acquitted brandon of participating in the robbery.the sufficiency argument that appellate counsel raised was accordingly clearly and significantly weaker than the significant and obvious issue of the instructional error.mayo,at.
respondent argues,however,that the omission of the instructional issue from the appellate brief was strategic in any event,because counsel could have made a reasonable strategic choice to raise only issues whose success on appeal would result in dismissal of the indictment,rather than a new trial in which lynch could in theory have been exposed to a harsher sentence if.counsel manifestly did not follow such a strategy,however,since she raised an evidentiary issue regarding exclusion of the call,which,if successful,would have entitled lynch only to a new trial.forgoing the instructional issue therefore could not have been a strategic choice to protect lynch from the prospect of a new trial and a higher sentence counsel failure to raise the instructional issue,while pursuing other issues that were significantly weaker and had no strategic benefit,fell below prevailing professional norms for an appellate attorney.
the heart of the district court decision,however,and of the parties dispute,is strickland prejudice prong.in order to find prejudice,we must determine whether there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the appeal would have been different in other words,whether the appellate division likely would have concluded that the trial court failure to give the possession instruction was error,and that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see people clyde,d,noting that,for errors of constitutional dimension,new york courts apply united states supreme court precedent in deciding whether the error is of a type that may be harmless,citing chapman california.we have already concluded that the instruction was error.consequently,the critical question in this case is whether in light of the totality of the evidence,there is no reasonable possibility that the instructional error affected the jury verdict.douglas,at the district court determined that lynch was not prejudiced by appellate counsel failure to raise the instructional issue,because the evidence was legally sufficient for the jury to find that lynch actually possessed the handgun found later on his person.lynch ii,wl,at.that was the wrong standard.the question is not whether the evidence was sufficient to permit a conviction under the proper instructions as noted above,it was but,rather,whether there is no reasonable possibility that the failure to instruct on the possession requirement affected the jury verdict.analyzing that question in light of the evidence presented at trial and the jury verdicts on the various counts leads inexorably to the conclusion that the error was harmful.
first,the evidence that lynch himself possessed a gun during the robbery was minimal.neither the victim nor the witnesses saw a gun in lynch possession during the robbery.tally verstraten testified that she felt lynch shove something in her waist,which c ould have been his fist,and that she looked down to see whether he had a gun and concluded that he did not.joint app x at.that conclusion was supported by the evidence that,while lynch was struggling with the victim over her purse with one hand,he punched her with his other hand.finally,in addition to tally verstraten testimony that she did not believe lynch had a gun,a reasonable jury could infer from her courageous behavior asking her assailant if he was kidding,pushing him away,and refusing to let go of her purse coupled with lynch failure to use or brandish a firearm in response,that lynch did not possess a gun during the robbery.
moreover,the jury acquitted lynch of the offense of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon.penal law.to be sure,the jury decision to acquit lynch of robbery,while convicting him of robbery,could be explained,as respondent urges,by the fact that under new york law,a gun must be loaded to qualify as a deadly weapon,whereas an unloaded gun could be a dangerous
