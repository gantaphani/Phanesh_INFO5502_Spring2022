anthony fielder,a state prisoner serving a life sentence,appeals the dismissal of his application for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court approved and adopted the report and recommendation of a magistrate judge who concluded that fielder petition in its entirety was untimely under d.we hold that one of fielder claims his claim of prosecutorial misconduct was untimely and that his other claim which sought a new trial based on newly discovered evidence is not cognizable under the federal habeas statute.we therefore affirm the order of the district court,albeit in part on different grounds.
in,fielder was arrested and charged with murdering jack fauntleroy outside a bar at and market streets in philadelphia in september.as summarized by the trial judge,the evidence showed the following.shortly before fauntleroy was killed,he became involved in an argument with a man named stefan.stefan then went into the bar and emerged with fielder,who began to argue with fauntleroy.several minutes later,antonio goldsmith,a friend of fauntleroy,entered into the argument as well.after the parties came to blows,fielder reentered the bar and returned to the street with a caliber handgun.as fauntleroy was fleeing,fielder shot and fatally wounded him.
two witnesses gave testimony that tended to show that fielder was the one who shot fauntleroy.latonia shawyer,who was waiting for a bus and did not previously know either fauntleroy or fielder,testified that she saw fielder shoot fauntleroy.goldsmith testified that he ran from the scene when fielder came out of the bar with a gun.goldsmith stated that,while running,he heard two shots and that when he turned around,he saw that fielder was chasing him with the gun in his hand.
the jury found fielder guilty of murder and possession of an instrument of crime,and he was sentenced to imprisonment for life on the murder conviction and to a lesser concurrent term for the weapons conviction.fielder appealed,claiming among other things that the prosecutor had committed acts of misconduct during the trial.however,the superior court affirmed,and the state supreme court denied allocatur.commonwealth fielder,allocatur denied,table.
fielder initiated a proceeding under pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra in which claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and evidence were raised.fielder evidence claim was based on the discovery of an alleged eyewitness to the shooting,daran brown,who stated that a man whom he knew by the name of nike was the one who actually shot fauntleroy.according to brown,fielder and fauntleroy were walking down market street when nike came running down the street behind them and started shooting in their direction.he continued 
this is when zark fauntleroy was shot and fell down in the middle of market street.after zark got shot another guy who i did know chased nike up the street with a gun.at this point i left the scene.
brown stated that he did not come forward with this information at the time of the shooting because he did want to get involved and because on the street the general feeling is that it is best if you mind your own business.app.according to brown,he did not learn that fielder had been convicted for the shooting until october.id.
the pcra court denied the petition,and fielder appealed and advanced two arguments.first,he contended that the pcra court should have conducted an evidentiary hearing regarding the evidence.second,he argued that the attorney who represented him in the trial court during the pcra proceeding was ineffective for failing to contact brown.the superior court rejected both arguments.the court held that it was not likely that brown testimony would have compelled a different result if it had been offered at trial and that therefore the standard under pennsylvania law for granting a new trial based on evidence was not met.the court then concluded that because the underlying evidence claim lacked merit,fielder lawyer could not be deemed ineffective for failing in his efforts to find daran brown.
the superior court decision was issued on june,and fielder failed to file a timely allocatur petition with in the pennsylvania supreme court.instead,after the expiration of the time for filing an allocatur petition,he submitted a request for permission to seek allocatur on a nunc pro tunc basis.the state supreme court dismissed that request in an order dated october.
on may,fielder filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.fielder argued,first,that the pennsylvania courts erred when they rejected his claim of evidence and,second,that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct at trial.the magistrate judge to whom the petition was referred concluded that the entire petition was untimely.the magistrate judge began by noting that fielder conviction had become final before april,the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,which imposed the present statute of limitations for federal habeas petitions,d.as a consequence,the magistrate judge stated that fielder time to file his petition began to run on april.see burns morton,cir.the magistrate judge concluded that the period for filing the petition was tolled under d from the date when fielder filed his pcra petition january,until the date when the superior court affirmed the dismissal of that petition june.when the time again began to run after this period,the magistrate judge calculated,approximately three and months of the period remained,and therefore fielder had until the end of october to file the federal petition.because he did not file until may,the magistrate held,the petition was.
the district court approved and adopted the report and recommendation without elaboration and therefore dismissed the application.the district court also denied a certificate of appealability,but a motions panel of our court granted a certificate and set out issues to be addressed in the briefs.the order of the motions panel stated 
the parties shall address whether appellant petition was timely filed.specifically,the parties shall address whether the cognizability of fielder claim of newly discovered evidence affects the application of d d,and whether d d applies to the entire petition if the time period under d a for trial claims had not expired at the time of the discovery of the factual predicate of the claim of new evidence.
the timeliness of fielder federal habeas petition turns on the meaning of d and thus presents a question of law subject to plenary review.see merritt blaine.cir.under d,the period for filing a federal habeas application runs from the latest of the four dates set out in subsections a through d.these are 
a the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review 
b the date on which the impediment to filing an application created by state action in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states is removed,if the applicant was prevented from filing by such state action 
c the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court,if the right has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review or 
d the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
subsection a specifies the date when the period for filing a federal habeas petition begins in most cases at the end of the direct appeals.subsection b provides a later starting date when a state has unlawfully prevented the petitioner from filing,and subsections c and d provide later filing dates in two circumstances in which claims could not have been litigated within one year after the end of direct review,where the claim is based on a new,retroactive rule of constitutional law subsequently recognized by the supreme court and where the factual predicate of the claim did not arise or was not discoverable until after the conclusion of the direct review period.
fielder argues that we should apply these provisions to the present case in the following manner.he begins by noting that an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in state custody must be filed within one year after the latest of the four dates set out in subsections a through d.d emphasis added.he then points to subsection d,which refers to the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.fielder then argues that his entire application was timely because taking into account the tolling rule set out in d his application was filed within one year after the date on which the factual predicate for the evidence claim could have been discovered,the date of daran brown affidavit,april.thus,on fielder reading of d,both his evidence claim and his prosecutorial misconduct were timely even though the latter claim,if asserted alone,would have been.
an argument very similar to fielder was adopted by the eleventh circuit in walker crosby,cir there,the court held that t he statute of limitations in d applies to the application as a whole individual claims within an application can not be reviewed separately for timeliness.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court relied primarily on the language of d.the court wrote 
the statute directs the court to look at whether the application is timely,not whether the individual claims within the application are timely.the statute provides a single statute of limitations,with a single filing date,to be applied to the application as a whole.
the court added that its interpretation of d was guided by the distinction between an application and claims within an application,and by the presumption that congress understood the difference when drafting aedpa.id.at.the court continued 
section d states the limitation period shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus.contrast the language in d creating a statute of limitations with the language in b requiring dismissal of certain claims presented in a second or successive application.the former speaks only to the timeliness of the application,while the latter allows for the dismissal of claims within a second or successive application if they were or could have been presented in a prior application.
we do not agree with the interpretation advanced by fielder and the walker court.although fielder and the walker court claim that this interpretation is dictated by the language of d,their interpretation which,for convenience,we will simply call the walker interpretation actually disregards the language used in the portion of d that is most critical for present purposes,subsection d.subsection d,as noted,refers to the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.d d emphasis added.applying this language in a case in which multiple claims are presented poses a problem,as fielder case illustrates.
fielder application,as noted,presented two claims,a prosecutorial misconduct claim and an evidence claim.the factual predicate of the prosecutorial misconduct claim was presumably known to fielder at the time of trial,but the factual predicate of the evidence claim was not reasonably discoverable until years later.so which of these two dates should control 
if d is applied,as we believe it must be,on a basis,there is no problem,but if,as the walker interpretation prescribes,the approach is rejected,there is nothing in d that provides a ground for picking one date over the other.the walker interpretation implicitly reads subsection d as if it refers to the latest date on which the factual predicate of any claim presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.but that is not what subsection d says.
although neither fielder nor the walker court explains the ground for their implicit conclusion that subsection d requires a court to pick the latest date when the factual predicate of a claim was reasonably discoverable,it is possible that their analysis is based on the statement in d that the application runs from the latest of the four dates specified in subsections a through d.however,this reference to the latest date does not appear in subsection d and it does not pertain to the issue at hand.the reference to the latest date in d tells a court how to choose from among the four dates specified in subsections a through d once those dates are identified.this language does not tell a court how to identify the date specified in subsection d in a case in which the application contains multiple claims.accordingly,there is nothing in d that suggests that a court should follow the walker interpretation and select the latest date on which the factual predicate of any claim presented in a application could have reasonably been discovered.it would be just as consistent with the statutory language to pick the earliest date.
for these reasons,we believe that the walker interpretation fails on its own terms.it purports to be based on the language of d but actually neglects to pay close attention to the statutory language.
if we look beyond the words of the statute,as we believe we must in this case,we see two strong reasons for concluding that the statute of limitations set out in d should be applied on a basis.
first,this is the way that statutes of limitations are generally applied,and there is no reason to suppose that congress intended to make a radical departure from this approach in d.in both civil and criminal cases,statutes of limitations are applied on a or basis.when a statute of limitations defense is raised in a case with a civil complaint or a criminal indictment,the court determines the date on which the statute began to run for each of the claims or counts at issue,not just the latest date on which the statute began to run for any of the claims or counts.see,king otasco,cir when a suit alleges several distinct causes of action,even if they arise from a single event,the applicable limitations period must be determined by analyzing each cause of action separately.home indem.contractors,cir holding that the district court had erred in dismissing the appellant separate but related claim on statute of limitations grounds because it was in fact governed by a different statute of limitations barnebey hutton,establishing different statute of limitations for the different civil claims against the defendant weeks remington arms,cir affirming the district court dismissal of the appellant strict liability claims but reversing the district court directed verdict on the appellant negligence claims contract buyers league f f,applying antitrust statute of limitations to the antitrust counts but determining what limitation applied to the other civil rights counts united states spector,wl,dist.lexis dismissing several counts of a indictment as but sustaining other counts of the indictment people kelly,d,describing the information under which the defendant was charged and the fact that the defendant motion to dismiss three counts because they charged crimes whose statutes of limitations had run was granted state stansberry,wl ohio.july,ohio app.lexis denying defendant argument that his felony murder conviction should have been barred by the statute of limitations because the underlying felony,aggravated robbery,was.
the walker interpretation,recounted above,holds that the wording of d forecloses a approach because it refers to the period within which an application,rather than a claim,must be filed.but there is nothing unusual about the wording of d.it is common for statute of limitations provisions to be framed using the model of a case.for example,the general statute of limitations for federal claims,prescribes the date by which a civil action must be commenced.state statutes often use similar wording.the new jersey statutes speak of the time within an action of law must be commenced.et.the pennsylvania statutes generally refer to the time within which an action or proceeding must be begun.see.ann,et.
although these provisions are framed on the model of the complaint,it is understood that they must
