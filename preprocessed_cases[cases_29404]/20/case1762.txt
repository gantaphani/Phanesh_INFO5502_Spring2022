background 
the east cleveland,ohio,home of john mcgrath mcgrath,a man,was burglarized on three separate occasions in august.on august,after the third,east cleveland police detectives,in consultation with mcgrath,devised a plan to apprehend the person or persons that had burglarized his home.they placed a clean drinking glass upside down over a quarter on mcgrath dining room table,anticipating that the burglar would lift the glass to remove the quarter,and in the process,leave his or her fingerprints.a fourth burglary occurred on september,after which mcgrath again notified police.as predicted by the detectives,the burglar had moved the drinking glass and taken the quarter.the police analyzed the fingerprints obtained from the glass,but were unable to identify them at that time.
three years later,on saturday,july,mcgrath drove his ford escort to a bank,where he cashed a check.patricia hill,the head bank teller,stated that mcgrath appeared to be in high spirits and in good health.on monday morning,july,deidra coleman noticed mcgrath ford escort parked in her cleveland,ohio,neighborhood.behind the wheel of the car was a young,male,who remained in the car for almost two hours.her suspicions aroused,coleman walked by the car,looked at the driver,noted the license plate number,and twice called the police from a pay phone a block away.she provided police with a description of the vehicle and its license plate number.the car left at approximately and returned thirty minutes later,at which time coleman observed the driver walk to the yard of her elderly neighbors,where esther turk was home alone.again,coleman notified the police.shortly thereafter,she spotted the young man running from the turks home,while carrying a brown bag beneath his arm.coleman and turk husband then entered the home and discovered a bruised esther turk shaking with her blouse undone.she had been assaulted and robbed.
coleman,a trained artist,sketched for the police the driver she had seen in the ford escort parked outside the turks house.she subsequently identified lott from a photo array as the driver of the vehicle.coleman again provided city of cleveland police detectives with the vehicle license plate number,and they,in turn,used that information to identify mcgrath as the owner.the detectives traveled to mcgrath house and sought to speak with him about his car.upon seeking entry into the home,they were unable to elicit a response from anyone in the house.the following day,the detectives asked east cleveland police officers to check on the welfare of mcgrath.when uniformed east cleveland police officers were also unable to rouse mcgrath,they entered the house through an unsecured kitchen door,whereupon they discovered a bloody,and severely burned mcgrath lying on the bedroom floor of his home.apparently,during the course of a burglary of mcgrath home,an unknown assailant had doused mcgrath with heating lamp oil and set him on fire.mcgrath suffered burns over twelve to of his body.the burns extended over his right back and side,lower and upper left side,both arms,and both knees.mcgrath also suffered abrasions on his wrist,knee,and ankle,and a bruised left eye,which had apparently been caused by a blunt trauma.
at the time that police officers discovered mcgrath,he was wearing a shirt that covered his burns,although the shirt itself was not scorched.dried fluids apparently from mcgrath burning flesh were present on the shirt and a strong odor emanated from mcgrath burns.police also found,within a foot of mcgrath body,a frayed telephone cord,which police believe was used to bind mcgrath wrists and ankles.on an adjacent cabinet,police discovered an uncapped bottle of flammable heating lamp oil.of the oil remained in the bottle.other evidence of a fire included charred draperies and a sheet.
when police officers interviewed mcgrath,he informed them that he recognized his attacker.mcgrath described him as a,very man with long,straight hair,who,at the time of the attack,was wearing a shirt,tennis shoes,and a cap without a bill.one week after mcgrath provided police detectives with this description,he was interviewed again at the hospital,at which time he told them that he believed that he and his assailant were patrons of the same barber shop.police detectives showed mcgrath a composite sketch drawn by coleman of the man seen driving his car.mcgrath examined the sketch,but was unable to identify the sketched individual as his attacker.both interviews of mcgrath were memorialized in police reports.on july,mcgrath died of acute bilateral bronchopneumonia stemming from his injuries.
city of cleveland police officers arrested lott in cleveland for mcgrath murder on july.an investigation conducted by city of cleveland police officers determined that an intruder had forcibly entered mcgrath home by removing a rear basement window from its frame and prying loose a panel on the door leading from the basement to the kitchen.the house had obviously been ransacked.kitchen and bedroom drawers had been opened and emptied.the mattress to mcgrath bed had also been disturbed.the officers lifted a set of fingerprints from a church contribution envelope in mcgrath home and a fingerprint from a dresser in the bedroom.officers identified the fingerprints as lott and also determined that lott fingerprints matched those found on the glass that the officers had placed on mcgrath dining room table three years earlier.in mcgrath bedroom,the officers discovered a dusty shoeprint,which generally matched the pattern found on a pair of tennis shoes recovered by officers from the trunk of lott car on the date of his arrest.a few days after the discovery of mcgrath,police officers located mcgrath car,which they believe lott stole and drove for more than hours prior to his apprehension.
ii.procedural history 
indictments and trial 
on august,a cuyahoga county grand jury issued a indictment in case no.cr,charging lott with,inter alia,felony murder,aggravated burglary,aggravated robbery,kidnapping,and aggravated arson,all of which were committed in the government attached to each count an aggravated felony specification,because lott had previous convictions for aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary.a grand jury also indicted lott in case no.cr for the offenses against mcgrath,charging him with,inter alia,aggravated burglary and petty theft.on october,in case no.cr,a grand jury lott on the aggravated arson count of case no.cr,which had been indicted incorrectly.this count also carried an aggravated felony specification.lott pleaded not guilty to all counts charged in all the indictments.
at a june,conference,lott waived his right to a jury trial both orally and in writing,opting instead to be tried before a panel,as permitted by ohio law.the state trial court at this time also joined all offenses of the three indictments involving mcgrath.a trial ensued,which concluded on july,with a verdict of guilty as to all counts.the trial court,however,dismissed the kidnapping count pursuant to lott rule motion for judgment of acquittal.
after a mitigation hearing,a panel unanimously concluded on july,that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and,accordingly,sentenced lott to death for mcgrath murder.on july,the panel sentenced lott to,inter alia,fifteen to years imprisonment for the aggravated robbery and aggravated burglary convictions,and six months imprisonment for the petty theft conviction.
direct appeal 
lott appointed counsel filed a brief on his behalf,alleging a number of trial and sentencing errors.the court of appeals of ohio,eighth district,cuyahoga county cuyahoga county court of appeals affirmed lott conviction and sentence on march.see state lott,wl ohio.lott appealed from this decision to the ohio supreme court,setting forth seventeen assignments of error.the ohio supreme court affirmed his conviction and sentence on june.see state lott,ohio,ohio.on december,the united states supreme court denied lott petition for a writ of certiorari.see lott ohio,d.
lott raised bases for relief in his state court petition for review,filed on september.on the motion of the state prosecutor,the trial court dismissed lott petition on september.see state lott,cuyahoga of common pleas,unreported.in his appeal to the cuyahoga county court of appeals,lott merits brief,filed on february,set forth six assignments of error.the court of appeals affirmed the trial court dismissal of his petition on november.see state lott,wl ohio.on december,lott appealed to the ohio supreme court and alleged six assignments of error.the ohio supreme court declined to accept jurisdiction over the case on march.see state lott,ohio,ohio,unreported.
lott filed an application for delayed reconsideration also known as a murnahan motion on june,in the cuyahoga county court of appeals,in which he argued that his appellate counsel had been ineffective in their representation of him during direct appeal for their failure to raise additional assignments of error.the court of appeals denied lott motion on april,see state lott,cuyahoga of common pleas,unreported,and the ohio supreme court affirmed the court of appeals denial on september,see state lott,ohio,ohio.
federal habeas 
lott filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio on february,setting forth bases for relief.the district court denied the petition in its entirety on march.on april,lott filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,and submitted in support thereof pages of documentation collected during the federal discovery process.the district court denied the motion on august.from these denials lott now appeals.
iii.discussion 
a federal court may grant a habeas corpus petition only when it concludes that the state adjudication of the federal claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,see d.before a federal court may review a federal claim raised in a habeas petition,it must first determine whether the petitioner has exhausted the remedies available to him in state court.see b.if a federal habeas claim has not been presented to a state court for adjudication,then it is unexhausted and may not properly serve as the basis of a federal habeas petition.see wainwright sykes,d.
where a claim has been presented to a state court,and that claim was rejected on an adequate and independent state ground without an adjudication on the merits,a petitioner may seek federal habeas review of that claim only where he can establish cause and prejudice for the default.see cone bell,cir.in evaluating claims of procedural default,a reviewing court is guided by the following inquiry 
first,the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner claim and that the petitioner failed to comply with the rule second,the court must decide whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction third,the court must decide whether the state procedural forfeiture is an adequate and independent state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim.fourth,if the court determines that a state procedural rule was not complied with and that the rule was an adequate and independent state ground,then the petitioner must demonstrate that there was cause for him to not follow the procedural rule and that he was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.
maupin smith,cir internal citations omitted.the fourth prong requires a showing by the petitioner of a substantial reason to excuse the default and actual prejudice suffered as a result of the alleged constitutional error.see cone,at.
the vast majority of lott claims in the instant case are procedurally defaulted,and lott has failed to establish cause and prejudice for default of those claims.he,then,is left to argue that our refusal to evaluate his procedurally defaulted claims would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice because he is actually innocent of the crimes of which he was convicted.see schlup delo,d.we are not persuaded that lott has presented evidence of innocence so strong that a court can not have confidence in the outcome of the trial,id.at,and thus can not conclude that a manifest miscarriage of justice would result if we declined to review his procedurally defaulted claims.accordingly,for the reasons set forth both in the district court thorough and opinion and in our discussion infra of lott claims,we affirm the district court denial of lott petition in its entirety.
standard of review 
we review a district court limitation on the scope of discovery for an abuse of discretion.see e lavado keohane,cir.a district court may,in the context of a habeas proceeding,permit discovery,provided that the habeas petitioner presents specific allegations showing reason to believe that the facts,if fully developed,may lead the district court to believe that federal habeas relief is appropriate.see rule a of rules governing section proceedings for the united states district courts lynott story,cir.we review a district court decision whether to hold an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion.see mitchell rees,cir.
on november,lott filed with the district court a motion for leave to conduct discovery,which the district court granted in part on march,except insofar as it sought leave to allow lott to take the depositions of his previous counsel.the district court ordered the parties to complete discovery by may.lott also requested an evidentiary hearing.in response to this request,the district court ordered him to brief for the court the reasons for his entitlement to an evidentiary hearing,pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.briefing was to be completed by april.on april,after having already submitted some briefing on the issue,lott requested an additional three weeks to file a supplemental brief on the same issue,so that he could include information within the brief that had been gained as a result of discovery.the district court granted lott request.
one month later,on may,after having completed the discovery permitted by the court,lott filed an unopposed motion to compel discovery and to modify the scheduling order,because a city of cleveland police department records custodian had failed to appear at a scheduled records deposition.lott sought testimony from the custodian concerning documents of investigation and analysis of fingerprints,documents or video or audio recordings relating to physical descriptions of the suspect,or any documents from the prosecutor files relating to fingerprints or witness identification of the suspect or documentation of a decision to withhold such information from lott,which lott believed to be in the possession of the city of cleveland police department.the court never ruled on the motion,and on march,both parties filed a joint motion for a status conference to resolve the discovery dispute.
on march,the district court denied lott motion because lott sought to extend an already expired deadline and one which had previously been extended,thus rendering the motion untimely lott counsel failed to certify that his informal,efforts to resolve the dispute had been unsuccessful lott counsel never attempted to address the dispute by resort to a telephone conference,as required by local rule and a review of the motion revealed that it was unnecessary,in light of the city of cleveland explanation,after it had conducted a thorough search,that the requested documents were not within its possession.the district court also denied the parties joint motion for a status conference and lott request for an evidentiary hearing.on april,lott filed a motion to alter or amend the district court judgment,pursuant to,which the district court denied on august,
lott contends that the district court,in denying his motion to compel discovery,erroneously found that the motion was untimely,and that the motion did not contain a certification from counsel stating that efforts to resolve the discovery dispute had been unsuccessful.in point of fact,lott argues,the motion,which was the first and only one that had been filed,had been filed consistent with local discovery rules and did contain a certification from counsel.in light of the foregoing,and because the district court found that lott had demonstrated good cause to conduct discovery,lott contends that he was entitled to have his motion granted,and that the district court failure to do so was error.see bracy gramley,d lynott,at.
it appears that the district court conclusion that lott motion was deficient rested in part on erroneous factual determinations.first,as to the question of timeliness,our review of the record suggests that,while it is true that lott motion sought to extend a deadline that had already expired,the deadline had not been previously extended,as the district court suggested.moreover,while the district court correctly concluded that a motion to compel discovery must be filed within ten days of the discovery date,see ohio,lott in fact did comply with this rule,filing his motion on may,seven days after the may,discovery deadline.second,it is undisputed that lott counsel attached to lott motion a letter to the prosecutor detailing counsel difficulty in obtaining records from the city of cleveland police department.we see no reason why such a letter would not qualify as the requisite certification from counsel.despite these seemingly erroneous factual determinations,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying lott motion.the remaining considerations on which the district court denial was failure to resort to the requisite telephone conference and the city of cleveland police department denial that it possessed the a sufficient basis for the district court to conclude that denial was appropriate.
evidentiary hearing 
as already discussed,the district court permitted lott three weeks after the completion of discovery to file a supplemental brief outlining the reasons for his entitlement to an evidentiary hearing under aedpa.lott had already argued unsuccessfully that aedpa did not change the legal standard for granting an evidentiary hearing the district court refused to allow him the opportunity to submit a supplemental brief on the issue,which he contends would have included exculpatory evidence obtained during the federal discovery process such evidence would have related to lott brady,identification,ineffective assistance of counsel,and cause of death claims.
lott now argues that the district court refusal to permit additional briefing,and an evidentiary hearing on the issues raised in that briefing,was error.such a hearing,according to lott,would have resolved material factual disputes,including those regarding i the cause and prejudice excusing any procedural default that the court deemed to exist and ii the merits of his claims including the identification,ineffective assistance of counsel,brady,and cause of death claims.he also suggests that if the district court had granted his motion to compel discovery,discussed supra,he could have included with the supplemental brief documents obtained from the city of cleveland police department.
respondent emphasizes lott contradictory positions that,on the one hand,aedpa enactment had no effect on the question whether he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing,and,on the other,that the district court abused its discretion by denying him the opportunity to brief the impact aedpa had on his entitlement to an evidentiary hearing.respondent also suggests that lott claim is fatally flawed because he fails to discuss how the district court denial of his request for an evidentiary hearing prejudiced him in the absence of such a discussion,lott can not demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion.on the question of the district court refusal to permit lott to append additional discovery materials to his brief,respondent again argues that lott has failed to show how this denial prejudiced him in any event,respondent notes,the district court reviewed the disputed materials when it evaluated lott motion to alter or amend the judgment and concluded that they had no impact on its decisions concerning either lott entitlement to additional discovery and an evidentiary hearing,or the underlying merits of any of his claims.
while respondent notes correctly that lott has taken inherently contradictory positions,we presume that lott is making alternative arguments,which he is permitted to do.lott first his right to an evidentiary hearing is not governed by incorrect as a matter of law.where a habeas petitioner has filed his petition after the effective date of aedpa april,section e of aedpa provides the relevant standard for determining whether he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing.see lindh,at.lott filed his habeas petition on february.section e provides 
e if the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings,the court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows that 
a the claim relies on 
i a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable or 
ii a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence and 
b the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
lott second argument,that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing,is also without merit.the district court concluded that lott was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing because he was unable to explain when and how he obtained the police notes which purportedly contain a misidentification by mcgrath,and ha d presented no other evidence to suggest the existence of a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence.neither in his motion to alter or amend the judgment nor in his brief for purposes of this appeal did lott address when and how he obtained the new factual information why that information could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence whether the facts underlying the claim would establish by clear and convincing evidence that,but for the omission of these facts at trial,no reasonable factfinder would have found lott guilty and,as suggested by respondent,how the district court denial of an evidentiary hearing prejudiced him in light of the foregoing,we are not persuaded that the district court denial of an evidentiary hearing was an abuse of discretion.
jurisdiction 
standard of review 
in a habeas corpus proceeding,we review de novo a district court legal conclusions and its factual findings for clear error.see fair united states,cir.a habeas petitioner claim is a mixed question of law and fact,to which a district court determinations are subject to de novo review.see lucas,cir.we review de novo a district court procedural default rulings.see id.
the state of ohio has instituted a statutory scheme whereby a criminal defendant may waive a jury trial and request trial by a panel 
in all criminal cases pending in courts of record in this state,the defendant may waive a trial by jury and be tried by the court without a jury.such waiver by a defendant,sic shall be in writing,signed by the defendant,and filed in said cause and made a part of the record thereof.
ohio ann.west.lott argues that he never executed a valid waiver of his right to trial by jury,because his jury waiver was neither nor formally entered in the trial record.in the absence of a valid waiver,he contends,the panel that decided his case never had jurisdiction to try him and the resulting conviction is therefore void respondent submits that lott claim is procedurally barred because he failed to raise it in his direct appeal or at any other point during the pendency of the state court proceedings.see state pless,ohio,ohio holding that the failure to comply with may be remedied only in a direct appeal from a criminal conviction lott responds that this claim is not procedurally barred because a state court reached its merits this claim,although unexhausted,is not procedurally barred even assuming this claim is procedurally barred,lott can demonstrate cause and prejudice for the default and,in any event,a procedural default analysis is inapposite,because a challenge of a court jurisdiction may be made at any time.each argument ultimately fails.
whether claim is procedurally barred because state court reached merits.
relying on the cuyahoga county court of appeals language in the decision on his murnahan motion,lott argues that his jurisdiction claim is not procedurally barred because the court of appeals reached the merits of the claim.the court of appeals stated that a review of the record demonstrates that the appellant waived his right to a jury trial in conformity with crim.a and,suggesting that the court of appeals decided the merits of the waiver question and thus did not raise a procedural bar to consideration of the issue.that language,however,expressly referred to lott sixteenth proposed assignment of error,which concerned only the ineffectiveness of his appellate counsel for failing to argue on appeal the involuntariness of lott jury waiver.at no point did lott ever raise in his murnahan motion the instant jurisdiction issue as a discrete claim the court,therefore,never had an opportunity to reach that precise issue.
it is true that lott raised the issue,discussed infra,in state court.it is also true that the voluntariness of his waiver and the court compliance with the requirements of to effectuate a valid waiver are related former is a function of the latter.the relatedness of the issues,however,does not save lott claim.lott jurisdiction claim is not based on the same theory as the waiver claim that was presented in state court,see wong money,cir,and,in any event,lott himself apparently viewed the issues as distinct,as evidenced by the fact that he raised them as separate assignments of error in his federal habeas petition.lott jurisdiction claim,therefore,is procedurally barred 
whether claim is unexhausted,but not procedurally barred.
lott argues that,even assuming the jurisdiction issue was not adequately presented in the murnahan motion,the district court should have concluded that the claim was unexhausted and permitted him to present this claim before a state court.because this claim has not yet been aired in a state court proceeding,lott contends,then no state court has enforced a procedural sanction against him,and his claim necessarily can not then be procedurally barred,and the district court finding of procedural default,therefore,was erroneous.we disagree.
state prisoners must exhaust their state remedies prior to raising claims in federal habeas corpus proceedings.see b,c.this requirement is satisfied when the highest court in the state in which the petitioner was convicted has been given a full and fair opportunity to rule on the petitioner claims.manning alexander,cir.the district court in the case at bar,quoting our decision in rust zent,cir,found that the jurisdiction issue was procedurally barred because lott lacked any remedy for the alleged error in the state courts the absence of available relief,it reasoned,rendered moot the exhaustion question if no remedy exists,and the substance of a claim has not been presented to the state courts,no exhaustion problem exists rather,it is a problem of determining whether cause and prejudice exist to excuse the failure to present the claim in the state courts.the district court expressly rejected lott contention that he had available to him an opportunity to file a successor delayed application for reconsideration,noting that t here is no available mechanism through which lott could present his claims to the ohio state courts.
the district court conclusion is correct if its underlying lott was legally prohibited from raising the jurisdiction issue in a in fact true,a question we can not answer given the record presently before us.lott states that he filed his first successor petition on march,raising this precise jurisdiction question.because we do not have before us the actual petition,or information concerning the posture of this action,we can not determine whether the district court properly determined that lott had no remedy available in state court.
even assuming lott does have a remedy in state court,however,we may nevertheless consider his unexhausted jurisdiction claim.see b see also jones jones,cir because we conclude that petitioner does not prevail on the merits,we may,pursuant to b,deny relief,notwithstanding jones failure to exhaust state remedies.hoxsie kerby,cir citation omitted noting that,even if a habeas petitioner has an available remedy in state court,a district court may nevertheless deny the petitioner unexhausted claim without permitting him an opportunity to avail himself of the remedy in state court if to do so would avoid useless litigation in state court.because,for the reasons set forth herein,we conclude that lott jurisdiction claim lacks merit,and any resort to the state courts would amount to a mere futility,we need not await a state court determination of what we have already concluded.
whether procedural default is excused by showing of cause and prejudice.
lott asserts that even if his jurisdiction claim is procedurally barred,he can demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the default.we are not persuaded.to establish cause,lott necessarily must argue that his appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to raise the jurisdiction claim,which requires us to examine first whether his counsel error was so egregious as to render their assistance below that guaranteed by the sixth amendment,and second,whether lott suffered prejudice as a result of his counsel error.see strickland washington,d.lott can make neither showing.
lott never presented the state courts with an opportunity to review his claim as cause for the default of his jurisdiction claim,and thus,is procedurally barred from making such an argument now.see murray carrier,d.even assuming,however,that lott claim were not procedurally barred,lott can not demonstrate cause for his procedural default,because he can not establish the requisite cause for his claim.at the time that lott filed his murnahan motion on june,it was unclear whether,under ohio law,a defendant strict compliance with was required to execute a valid waiver,or whether substantial compliance was sufficient.compare state harris,ohio app d,ohio holding that strict compliance with is required to execute a valid waiver with state morris,ohio app d,ohio suggesting that substantial compliance is satisfactory,provided that is satisfied by a writing signed by the defendant himself and filed with the court with marysville foreman,ohio app d,ohio noting that w here there is a written waiver filed with the court after arraignment and opportunity to consult with counsel,there has been a substantial compliance with the applicable rules and statutes and there is no error.thus,we can not conclude that lott counsel should have reasonably anticipated in the ohio supreme court decision in pless,which finally resolved the issue and required strict compliance with each requirement of for execution of a valid jury waiver.see alcorn smith,cir noting that nonegregious errors such as failure to perceive or anticipate a change in the law generally can not be considered ineffective assistance of counsel state earl,wl,ohio,unpublished a ppellate counsel is not responsible for accurately predicting the development of the law,especially in an area marked by conflicting holdings.lott failure to demonstrate cause makes unnecessary our consideration of whether he can also establish prejudice.
whether procedural default analysis is inapposite.
finally,lott argues that the question of a court jurisdiction is never waivable and may be raised at any time.he reasons that an ohio court has jurisdiction to try a defendant in the absence of a jury only when a defendant waives that right in strict compliance with where a court disregards the mandatory requirements of,any resulting proceeding is rendered void ab initio for lack of jurisdiction,and a challenge of that proceeding may be made at any time.thus,lott submits,the district court procedural default analysis was inapposite.
the district court rejected lott characterization of the jurisdiction at issue in this case as jurisdiction,and concluded that concerned jurisdiction of the particular case.jurisdiction of the particular case,the district court reasoned,does not,like jurisdiction,concern the ability of a court to hear a particular class of cases,but rather is more akin to a statute of limitations or other bar that prevents a court from hearing a particular case that would,in the absence of that bar,properly be before it.while it is true that a challenge of a court jurisdiction may be raised at any time,the district court concluded that such was not the case for jurisdiction of the particular case,which may be waived.in support of its conclusion,the district court relied on state swiger,ohio app d,ohio,and swiger interpretation of pless,as evidence that the ohio supreme court was referring to something other than jurisdiction.see id.at if the jurisdiction to which the ohio supreme court in pless referred were subject matter jurisdiction,by its very nature,it would be open to challenge at any time.by holding that this defect in the trial court jurisdiction can be waived if not timely raised,the supreme court was apparently referring to something other than subject matter jurisdiction.
we are not convinced that the district court conclusion rests on solid ground.in a case,the ohio supreme court expressly held that the question whether a defendant was properly tried by a panel was a jurisdictional matter that can never be waived.see state filiaggi,ohio,ohio the state contends that defendant consented to a bifurcated procedure whereby a panel decided certain counts and a single judge decided others and therefore waived any error w e conclude that this jurisdictional matter can not be waived.thus,lott may be correct that the district court procedural default analysis was misplaced.we need not resolve this question,however,because,as discussed supra,at the time that lott sought to waive his right to a jury trial,it was an open question whether strict adherence to was required to execute a valid waiver and confer jurisdiction on a panel.we believe that lott entry of a signed and written waiver made in open court,although not filed and made part of the record,would meet the less restrictive,substantial compliance standard.lott,therefore,is foreclosed from obtaining federal habeas relief on this basis.
jury waiver 
standard of review 
whether lott waiver of a jury trial was knowing,intelligent,and voluntary is a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo.see strozier newsome,cir.
a panel tried and convicted lott of offenses stemming from three separate indictments.lott argues that,as to case no,the trial court and lott trial counsel failed to inform him of the circumstances and consequences of waiving his right to be tried by a jury in a capital case,and that the trial court never obtained from him any jury waiver,valid or otherwise,as to case no.and case no.
on august,a cuyahoga county grand jury indicted lott in case no,charging him in count with the july,aggravated murder of mcgrath with aggravated felony and felony murder specifications in count with the july,aggravated burglary of mcgrath with violence and aggravated felony specifications in count with the july,aggravated robbery of mcgrath with violence and aggravated felony specifications in count with the july,kidnapping of mcgrath with violence and aggravated felony specifications and in count with the july,aggravated arson against mcgrath with violence and aggravated felony specifications.
lott argues that the colloquy between him and the trial judge was inadequate in informing him of the panoply of rights that he was giving up by foregoing a jury trial specifically,the district court failed to inform lott of the following that the waiver would apply to the mitigation phase that the concurrence of only three rather than twelve people would be sufficient to convict him that the concurrence of only three rather than twelve people would be sufficient to convict him of the death penalty specification that the concurrence of only three rather than twelve people would be sufficient to sentence him to death that there would be fewer appellate issues available to him,concerning,for example,jury selection,motions,and jury instructions and that lott could withdraw the jury waiver at any time.
respondent contends that lott claim is procedurally barred,because he failed to raise this issue in his direct appeal,waiting instead until his state action.as noted supra in the discussion concerning jurisdiction,lott argued in his murnahan motion that the ohio court of appeals expressly found that a review of the record demonstrates that the appellant waived his right to a jury trial in conformity with crim.a and,suggesting that the court of appeals evaluated the merits of the waiver question and thus did not raise a procedural bar to consideration of the issue.respondent maintains that the ohio court of appeals discussion was in the context of an motion and came after three other state courts had already determined that the waiver claim was procedurally barred.
respondent has the better of the argument.lott is procedurally barred from raising this issue.both the cuyahoga county common pleas court and the cuyahoga county court of appeals concluded that lott was procedurally barred from raising this claim,because he failed to raise it in his direct appeal.lott,then,is left to argue that this claim is not procedurally because he did raise the claim in his direct appeal,or because a state court,subsequent to the court of appeals finding of procedural default,reached the merits of this that he can demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default.lott makes both arguments,but neither is availing.
whether claim is procedurally barred.
it is undisputed that lott failed to raise the claim in his direct appeal.it appears that it was raised for the first time in his murnahan motion,and there,only as the basis for his claim.thus,the claim is procedurally barred,and absent a showing of cause and prejudice to excuse the default,we may not review the merits of this claim.lott argues that,even if,on direct appeal,the cuyahoga county common pleas court and the cuyahoga county court of appeals raised a procedural bar to this claim,the cuyahoga county court of appeals subsequent discussion of the merits of the issue,as it related to lott murnahan motion,served to resurrect the otherwise defaulted claim.respondent contends that the court discussion in the murnahan opinion addressed the merits of lott claim,and not those of his waiver claim,and thus,there remains a procedural bar.lott responds that it was precisely because his appellate counsel failed to raise the waiver issue in lott direct appeal that lott was forced to argue it in the context of a murnahan motion.
although lott argument is not without force,it ultimately must fail.first,that a court,in reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,looks to the merits of the alleged error for purposes of determining the existence of strickland prejudice is not dispositive of the question whether a procedurally defaulted claim has been resurrected.as the district court correctly observed 
t he fact that the state courts engaged in that analysis,as they must under strickland,does not,however,serve as evidence that those courts excused the procedural default.to hold otherwise would eviscerate the continued vitality of the procedural default rule every procedural default could be avoided,and federal court merits review guaranteed,by claims that every act giving rise to every procedural default was the result of constitutionally ineffective counsel.
second,and of equal importance,even if we were to accept lott argument that the panel that reviewed his murnahan motion evaluated the merits of his waiver proposition that is flatly inconsistent with the would nevertheless be bound to accept as authoritative the last reasoned opinion concerning lott waiver claim,which was the cuyahoga county court of appeals decision of lott petition that found lott waiver claim to be procedurally barred.see state lott,wl ohio,a ppellant claims alleging error including his waiver claim are barred by application of the doctrine of res judicata.in this regard,we are guided by the united states supreme court decision in ylst nunnemaker,which established the following presumption 
where there has been one reasoned state judgment rejecting a federal claim,later unexplained orders upholding that judgment or rejecting the same claim rest upon the same ground.if an earlier opinion fairly appear s to rest primarily upon federal law,we will presume that no procedural default has been invoked by a subsequent unexplained order that leaves the judgment or its consequences in place.similarly where,as here,the last reasoned opinion on the claim explicitly imposes a procedural default,we will presume that a later decision rejecting the claim did not silently disregard that bar and consider the merits.
d emphasis added internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the april,court of appeals decision of lott murnahan motion,in which the court concluded that c learly,the appellant waived his right to a jury trial in a voluntary,knowing and intelligent fashion and the record further indicates that the appellant was fully aware of the circumstances and consequences of the waiver,predated the november,decision and thus could not have been the last reasoned decision and,in any event,addressed only the merits of the ineffectiveness claim and not the waiver claim.absent a showing of cause and prejudice to excuse this procedural default,therefore,lott may not now challenge the validity of his waiver.
ii.whether procedural default is excused by showing of cause and prejudice 
lott argues that any procedural default should be excused.in making a showing of cause,lott states that his appellate and murnahan counsel were constitutionally ineffective for failing to raise the waiver claim,and suggests that their actions could not have been the results of a reasonable strategic decision.relying upon our decision in mapes coyle,cir,which set forth eleven factors reviewing courts should consider in evaluating claims of appellate ineffectiveness,lott argues that five such factors weigh in favor of our finding that his counsel were constitutionally ineffective the omitted issues were significant and obvious they were stronger than other issues the appellate court was not required to defer to the trial court the decision to omit the issue in question was unreasonable and one that only an incompetent attorney would adopt and the appellate counsel level of expertise and experience were such that he should have been able to raise successfully the pless jurisdiction issue.on the question of prejudice,lott maintains that he need not demonstrate prejudice,because the failings of his counsel violated his constitutional right to a trial by jury,and are thus structural errors from which we may presume prejudice.see mcgurk stenberg,cir.respondent argues that,in light of the written jury waiver and the colloquy between lott,his counsel,and the trial court,lott appellate counsel could have reasonably decided not to raise this claim.furthermore,because the underlying claim lacks merit,it can not be said that appellate counsel were ineffective for their failure to raise it.
before we begin our analysis of the merits of lott argument,it is instructive to set forth the exchange between lott and the trial court concerning the issue of lott waiver 
the court in discussions with the defense counsel prior to coming into court this morning,and in discussions with the prosecutor,it is my understanding at this time that the defendant has indicated to his counsel that in criminal case cr,that he would agree and has consented to voluntarily,as indicated that he wishes to withdraw his previous request for a trial by jury with reference to the aggravated murder charge with specifications and consent to have his case tried to a panel.
before this court will accept that waiver and that request,the court will inquire of the defendant as to whether or not it is his desire,having been appraised of his rights by both the court and counsel,to waive his right to a trial by jury in these cases,and to agree to have his case tried to a panel.
gregory lott,the court has been advised by your counsel that you wish to withdraw your previously entered request for a trial by a jury on the count of aggravated murder with specification.
do you fully understand that you have a constitutional right to have your case tried to a jury as it relates to the aggravated murder charge with specification 
do you understand that 
defendant yes,sir.
the court have you had an opportunity to fully discuss with your attorneys your rights to a trial by jury in the case of the aggravated murder with specifications and also have you had an opportunity to discuss with them your request or the appropriate request for a trial by a panel in lieu of a trial by jury 
defendant yes,sir.
the court very well.
i have before me a form in case entitled state of ohio versus gregory lott,court of common pleas,cuyahoga county,ohio,defendant may waive jury trial.
i,gregory lott,the defendant,in the above cause,hereby voluntarily waive and relinquish my right to a trial by jury and elect to be tried by a panel,in which said cause may be pending.
i fully understand that under the laws of the state i have a constitutional right to a trial by jury.that is signed by gregory lott,witnessed by james kersey and elmer giuliani.
is this,sir,a form that was executed by you indicating to this court that you are waiving your right to a jury trial on the charge of aggravated murder,and have agreed to have your case tried to a panel 
defendant yes,sir.
the trial court then engaged in the following colloquy with lott counsel 
the court giuliani,have you had an opportunity to fully explain to your client his rights to a trial by jury in this case 
giuliani yes,sir.
the court have you fully explained to him his right to elect to have his case tried to a panel in lieu of a trial by a jury in this case 
giuliani yes,sir.
the court are you fully satisfied that he fully understands those rights 
giuliani i am.
the court are you satisfied that this is a voluntary act on his part,namely,to have his case tried to a panel 
giuliani yes,sir.
the court very well.
this court will accept the defendant waiver of a trial by jury on the count of aggravated murder with specifications and his election to be tried by a panel of this court.
it is well settled that whether or not there is an intelligent,competent,waiver of jury trial by an accused must depend upon the unique circumstances of each case.united states martin,cir.in martin,we held that a criminal defendant may waive a jury trial if the waiver is in writing,if the government attorney consents to the waiver,if the trial court approves the waiver,and if the defendant waiver is voluntary,knowing,and intelligent.in the present action,only the fourth factor is in dispute.a waiver may be voluntary,knowing,and intelligent if the defendant has a minimum amount of knowledge concerning his jury trial right and the mental capacity to understand the implications of the waiver of that right.see id.at.although a defendant need not have a detailed,technical knowledge of this right,a defendant is deemed sufficiently informed to make an intelligent waiver if he was aware that a jury is composed of members of the community,that he may participate in the selection of the jurors,that the verdict of the jury must be unanimous,and that a judge alone will decide guilt or innocence should he waive his jury trial right.id.at.we did not,however,adopt a mandatory rule requiring trial courts to interrogate defendants prior to accepting a jury trial waiver,but instead,offered a suggestion that district courts personally inform defendants of the benefits and burdens of jury trials on the record prior to accepting a proffered waiver.id.at.
we believe it is a close question whether the colloquies between lott and the trial judge and between lott counsel and the trial judge were constitutionally sufficient.the colloquy between the trial court and lott consisted of a short inquiry into whether lott understood that he had a constitutional right to a jury trial and whether lott had had the opportunity to discuss with his counsel the rights that he was forfeiting by waiving a jury trial.the trial court conducted no independent inquiry into the extent of the alleged discussions between lott and his counsel,but rather,accepted the word of lott and lott counsel that lott understood those rights.the district court found that a trial court need not conduct a particularly detailed oral inquiry before finding that a waiver is knowing and voluntary,and concluded that the colloquy between the trial court and lott and his counsel demonstrated that lott knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial.on the facts of this case,we find no error.
on september,a cuyahoga county grand jury indicted lott in case no,charging him in count with the september,aggravated burglary of mcgrath and in count with the september,petty theft of mcgrath.in case no,lott was indicted on october,and charged in count with the july,aggravated arson against mcgrath with violence and aggravated felony specifications.lott argues that the trial court never obtained a jury waiver as to case no.and case no,and that his trial counsel were not appointed to represent him with respect to these cases.in the absence of a valid waiver,the panel lacked jurisdiction to try him without a jury,and the convictions that flowed from that trial,at least as to case no.and case no,are void.respondent asserts that the trial court had jurisdiction over all of the charges against lott,and his waiver of trial as to one charge applied to all related charged offenses.
we reject lott argument.first,while not dispositive of the question before us,we note that lott made no contemporaneous objection to the trial court exercise of jurisdiction over case no.and case no.second,a review of the merits of his claim reveals that he can not prevail.although it appears that no ohio court has addressed the precise question presented by lott claim,the ohio supreme court confronted a similar issue in state smith,ohio,ohio in smith,a defendant appealed his counts of conviction to the appropriate court of appeals,and,in conformity with the ohio constitution and an implementing statute,appealed his capital convictions directly to the ohio supreme court.the court of appeals dismissed the charges for lack of jurisdiction,finding that appeal was proper only to the ohio supreme court.the ohio supreme court affirmed and found that it the ohio supreme court had jurisdiction over the whole case,instead of counts,charges,or sentences.id.at.
similarly,we are persuaded that lott waiver of a jury trial with respect to one case conferred jurisdiction on the panel to hear the entire case.in re waite,w here it is apparent from the allegations that the matter alleged is within the class of cases in which a particular court has been empowered to act,jurisdiction is present.any subsequent error in the proceedings is only error in the exercise of jurisdiction,as distinguished from the want of jurisdiction.that lott murder case had been consolidated with other cases involving other offenses did not confer jurisdiction only as to the murder charge and not to the other offenses.the panel had jurisdiction over the entire case and all counts and charges contained within that case.lott argument,therefore,must fail.
brady claim 
standard of review 
in a habeas corpus proceeding,we review de novo a district court legal conclusions and its factual findings for clear error.see fair united states,cir.we review de novo a district court procedural default rulings.see id.
lott argues that habeas relief is appropriate because the state of ohio violated brady maryland,d,by failing to disclose exculpatory evidence to him concerning the following the absence of fingerprints on mcgrath car mcgrath description of his assailant and other eyewitnesses descriptions of other possible suspects,which were at variance with his physical appearance and mcgrath ownership of an lamp respondent contends that all three pieces of this alleged brady material are procedurally barred from review,and that two pieces were never raised in the state proceedings below,and as such,are unexhausted.even if we were to set aside these procedural default and exhaustion questions,respondent argues,lott still would not be entitled to relief because he can not demonstrate both that respondent suppressed the evidence and that such evidence was material to the outcome of his case.
procedural default 
fingerprints 
lott contends that respondent failed to disclose that police officers were unable to find any of lott fingerprints either on or inside mcgrath car,evidence that likely would have drawn into question the veracity of deidra coleman testimony that lott was the man she saw sitting in mcgrath car.lott raised this claim on direct appeal in the context of arguing that his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to raise this issue during the penalty phase at trial as his sixteenth ground for relief in his state petition and as his second and assignments of error in his murnahan motion in the context of arguing that his appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to raise brady violations committed by the state.the question before us is whether lott direct appeal of this issue in the context of an claim is sufficient to save this issue from being deemed procedurally barred.as we have already noted,it does not.
perhaps recognizing that this claim is procedurally barred,lott argues that the ohio supreme court decision of lott fingerprints claim raised on direct appeal was a decision on the merits,which now precludes respondent from arguing that the claim is procedurally barred.it is true that the ohio supreme court,in reviewing lott claim,found that t his fingerprint evidence simply established that lott fingerprints were not found on mcgrath car but the mere absence of lott fingerprints does not refute evidence admitted at trial and is therefore not exculpatory,state lott,ohio,ohio,suggesting that it reached the merits of lott claim.because,however,the court discussion was in the context of analyzing lott claim and not the discrete claim lott now raises,that discussion,without more,can not resurrect lott claim similarly,lott argument that his claim was revived by the ohio court of appeals decision of his murnahan motion and its discussion of the merits of lott fingerprints claim also must fail.
lott also raised this brady claim in his petition for state relief.he now contends that a state court reached the merits of this claim both when the cuyahoga county court of common pleas granted respondent motion to dismiss,concluding that there were no substantive grounds for relief,and when the cuyahoga county court of appeals found that lott had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that there are substantive constitutional grounds for relief.lott,wl at lott,however,neglects the fact that the court of appeals,in the last reasoned decision on the subject,made an express finding that all of appellant claims alleging error including the fingerprints claim are barred by application of the doctrine of res judicata because lott failed to raise them on direct appeal.id.at.accordingly,lott claim is without merit.
ii.mcgrath description of of other suspects 
lott argues that respondent suppressed evidence from him concerning mcgrath description of his attacker,which lott suggests differed significantly from his physical appearance claim.specifically,mcgrath described his attacker to police,in a statement that was not introduced at trial,as a,very man with long straight hair,who,at the time of the assault,was wearing a shirt,tennis shoes,and a cap without a bill.lott is a man,who is five feet,ten inches tall,pounds,with short hair at the time of lott arrest,police found tennis shoes in the trunk of his car.lott also alleges,in what we will refer to as his claim,that respondent withheld from lott other physical descriptions of mcgrath assailant that were consistent with mcgrath description evidence that a man informed police officers that he was wanted for questioning in connection with mcgrath death and several burglaries evidence that one of eyewitness deidra coleman neighbors described the perpetrator as having a heavy build with a pot belly and evidence that mcgrath told police in that he could identify the man who burglarized his home in.
lott failed to raise the claim at all in the state courts,and failed to raise the claim either in the state courts or in his federal habeas petition,and thus,absent a showing of cause and prejudice for the defaults,is precluded from raising them now.he argued unsuccessfully before the district court that,because he raised his fingerprints claim on direct appeal as part of an claim,the instant brady claims are not defaulted,reasoning that he fairly presented to the state courts the legal theory on which his claim was based,even if he failed to present all of the factual premises for that claim.
citing landano rafferty,cir,the district court found that p resenting two claims under the same legal umbrella but with entirely different factual underpinnings,as here,does not constitute fair presentation to the state courts lott claim was not the substantial equivalent of the fingerprints claim presented to the state courts,because he failed to present both the legal theory and the facts on which his federal claim rests.landano,at see also daye attorney of new york,cir in order to have fairly presented his federal claim to the state courts the petitioner must have informed the state court of both the factual and the legal premises of the claim he asserts in federal court.we agree with the district court that lott presentation of a brady claim premised on the fingerprints issue does not permit him now to put forward other supposed brady claims predicated on factually dissimilar premises.
even if lott claim were not procedurally barred,he would,as the district court found,nevertheless have difficulty demonstrating that the information which forms the basis for this claim was outside,or dehors,the record at the time of his direct state court appeals,or that it became available to him only after state avenues to address it were no longer available to him.the district court rejected lott suggestion that the fingerprint evidence would have served to undermine the only identification of lott at trial coleman testimony in a case that was built entirely of circumstantial evidence,reasoning that w hile a court could conclude that the lack of fingerprints might serve to weaken the force of coleman identification of lott as the individual driving mcgrath car,the standard under the aedpa is not whether the district court would come to the same conclusion,but whether the conclusion is debatable among reasonable jurists.although we recognize that the applicable aedpa standard has changed since the district court considered this issue,see harris stovall,cir discussing the supreme court rejection in williams taylor,d,of the debatable among reasonable jurists standard,we are nevertheless unpersuaded that the state court conclusion on this point resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.see d.we thus reject lott argument.
iii.telephone cord 
lott maintains that respondent withheld evidence concerning mcgrath ownership of an lamp,which,if presented at trial,would have called into doubt the government theory that mcgrath did not own a lamp and thus had no reason to own heating oil and that lott brought a bottle of heating oil into mcgrath house with the express purpose of using it to set mcgrath on fire.lott also argues that respondent withheld information concerning a frayed telephone cord found near the location of mcgrath body,which mcgrath assailant allegedly used to bind and restrain him.the introduction of this evidence at trial,lott argues,so infused the trial with unfairness as to deny him due process of law.because the cuyahoga county court of appeals and the ohio supreme court rejected this claim on the merits,he contends that it can not be procedurally defaulted.although lott challenged on direct appeal the trial court admission of this evidence on the basis that the state failed to establish its relevance,it appears that lott never raised in state court the specific objection he raises today,and thus we are foreclosed from reviewing it.
iv.cause and 
as he has done with his other claims,lott argues that his brady claim may be unexhausted,but not procedurally barred,and if we do find a procedural bar,then he can demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse that bar.both arguments are without merit.turning first to the cause and prejudice inquiry,we find that lott can not meet his burden.first,as the district court noted,lott counsel might reasonably have made a strategic decision not to raise this claim,particularly in light of the fact that the description provided by mcgrath was not so materially different from lott actual appearance as to have affected the outcome of the trial.second,the district court also observed that even if lott claim had been properly raised,it would have likely been rejected,both because mcgrath absence from trial made his prior description unnecessary for impeachment purposes,and because lott counsel successfully argued at trial that mcgrath statements were inadmissible hearsay.we agree and can not conclude that the failure of lott counsel to assert this claim was an error of constitutional magnitude sufficient to establish cause for his default.
on the exhaustion question,as already discussed,where a habeas petitioner files a mixed petition containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims,a district court may deny the petition upon a finding that the petitioner has no available remedy in state court and to dismiss the petition would amount to nothing more than a futility.such is the case here.because lott claims are procedurally attempt to argue the ineffectiveness of his counsel as cause for that bar is are foreclosed from considering these claims,absent a showing that failure to do so would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice.
miscarriage of justice 
even in the absence of cause and prejudice,a petitioner may overcome a procedurally defaulted claim upon a showing of actual innocence.see schlup delo,d herrera collins,d.lott has long proclaimed his innocence in the killing of john mcgrath,suggesting instead that the victim own careless smoking was the cause of death.see state lott,ohio,ohio.in affirming lott death sentence,the ohio supreme court dismissed this explanation as an incredible hypothesis.id.yet the ohio high court also acknowledged that i t is true that the trial court convicted lott on circumstantial evidence.id.amid lott continued protestation of innocence,this is the most troubling aspect of the case.although habeas review does not permit petitioners to their cases in federal court,we must ensure that state convictions are supported by constitutionally adequate evidence.this safeguard is especially important when,as here,the petitioner argues that operation of procedural default rules would result in a miscarriage of justice because,according to lott,he is actually innocent of the aggravated murder.
although the parties have not argued the point,and we therefore reserve judgment on it,we should note that the evidence supporting lott conviction is reinforced by his interview with the cuyahoga county sheriff department on the afternoon of his arraignment.see motion to take judicial notice of state court proceedings,exhibit h.the police report of the interview reads 
when questioned about the above incident with john mcgrath he lott started crying.he stated he never intended to hurt mcgrath.he went over to mcgrath house at sometime in the middle of july and went to the back of the house and broke out a basement window.he went into the house and found mcgrath in a front bedroom on the main floor of the house.he stated that the next thing he knew mcgrath was tied up.he remembers using either telephone cord or electrical wire to tie him up.mcgrath was in bed when this took place but does remember or know why he was.
after he was tied up he took his car keys which were on a dresser or table either in the bedroom or the room next to it and left the house and got into the car,which was in the driveway and drove off with it.he described mcgrath car as being a smaller model car,dark in color.
when asked about any type of flammable sic fluid or liquid being put on mcgrath and then setting it on fire he stated that he did remember anything about that.he was asked about why he broke into mcgrath house and why did he tie him up he stated he did know why he broke into the house,he did want him to contact the police when he left the house with his car 
when questioned about his intent in the mcgrath incident he stated he did know.he stated he did intent sic to hurt anyone and that he did know what he was doing.he stated that he would do anything to keep from going to the electric chair.
because lott spoke to the interviewing detective without counsel present,defense counsel moved to suppress the statement during trial.at the suppression hearing,the prosecutor only summarized the contents of the statement to avoid biasing the trial panel.the panel then granted the motion to suppress on the authority of michigan jackson,d we thus hold that,if police initiate interrogation after a defendant assertion,at an arraignment or similar proceeding,of his right to counsel,any waiver of the defendant right to counsel for that interrogation is invalid.
although the panel did not consider lott statement in convicting him,a habeas court may take it into account in evaluating his claim of miscarriage of justice due to actual innocence.see schlup,at.in assessing the adequacy of petitioner showing,therefore,the district court is not bound by the rules of admissibility that would govern at trial.instead,the emphasis on actual innocence allows the reviewing tribunal also to consider the probative force of relevant evidence that was either excluded or unavailable at trial.see also gall parker,cir,cert.denied,d.
a more detailed review of the circumstances than appears in this record may show that lott inculpatory statement,although suppressed at trial,was voluntarily made and admits of no reason to doubt its reliability or truthfulness.though lott said he did not recall setting the fire that burned mcgrath,the state introduced evidence of lott fingerprints in the victim home,his possession of the victim car,and a shoeprint in mcgrath bedroom that generally matched lott shoes.since this issue may now be pending in state court and has not been fully briefed before us,we reach no final conclusion regarding the effect of the confession.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
i concur in the judgment of the court and in most of the analysis in its opinion.i write separately because the majority addresses one issue i believe we need not and offers obiter dictum on an issue lott has not pressed.i do not join parts and.b of the majority opinion.
the heart of my disagreement with the majority lies in its analysis of whether lott jurisdiction argument presents a federal question,which analysis appears in footnote.lott claim here is based entirely on a problem,as the majority review of developing ohio law reveals.footnote states that lott jurisdiction claim,although predicated on state law,directly implicates the federal question of whether lott trial,in the absence of a jury,violated his sixth amendment right to a jury trial and his fourteenth amendment right to due process.
although lott brief cites lowery estelle,cir,for a similar proposition concerning claims brought before federal habeas courts,the material at that location is actually the petitioner argument,which the court specifically declined to address because the petitioner failed to exhaust his argument in state court,see id.at.fifth circuit precedent on which lowery relies,some of which lott also cites in his brief,states the rule that federal habeas courts may not review an asserted error in an indictment unless the indictment is so fatally defective as to deprive the convicting court of jurisdiction.murphy beto,cir see also underwood bomar,cir.this rule appears to be based on old caselaw holding that a complete lack of jurisdiction in the sentencing court may provide grounds for federal habeas relief.see frank mangum.the writ of habeas corpus will lie only in case the judgment under which the prisoner is detained is shown to be absolutely void for want of jurisdiction in the court that pronounced it,either because such jurisdiction was absent at the beginning,or because it was lost in the course of the proceedings.keizo henry.ex parte siebold.
lott,of course,claims no such fatal error in his indictments.and he does not claim that the cuyahoga county court of common pleas entirely lacked jurisdiction to try his case.to the extent his claim may fit into this language,he argues that a panel of that court lacked jurisdiction to try him due to a clerical oversight,such that a single judge and jury of that same court should have tried him.this is not the sort of complete lack of jurisdiction discussed in frank,keizo,and siebold.
in actuality,lott claims that he never executed a valid knowing,intelligent,and voluntary waiver of his constitutional right to be tried by a jury.yet his argument,based in state law,addresses solely the validity of the waiver,rather than the federal standard that waiver of federal constitutional rights must be knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.it may be true that,under ohio law,the panel lacked jurisdiction because ohio procedures for protecting his right to a jury trial are extraordinarily strict and the clerical oversight resulted in an incomplete waiver.see state pless,ohio,ohio.but this has no bearing on whether his waiver of his right to trial by jury which would have succeeded under ohio law if the court clerk had it,filed it,and made it part of the record was effective to waive his federal constitutional right by being knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.
as the transcript of lott hearing demonstrates,ja at,lott was well aware of the implications of his request to be tried before a panel.the record clearly shows that lott waiver of his right to trial by jury was knowing,intelligent,and voluntary,and therefore effective under the federal constitution.i do not consider it a close question whether a court failure to comply with each of requirements is sufficient to invalidate an otherwise effective waiver a state court entirely internal mistakes can not vitiate a constitutionally valid waiver,for those processes have no relation at all to the defendant knowledge of his rights,his information regarding the implications of waiving them,or whether any improper forces made his decision to waive involuntary.
to say that a state law error may provide a basis for habeas relief when the error also violates federal constitutional rights states the obvious,but does not apply here.as estelle mcguire,d,attempted to make cl
