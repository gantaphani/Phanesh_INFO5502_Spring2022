we consider here whether a trial court must make particularized findings in order to render a proper ruling on a challenge to the peremptory strike of a jury panelist brought pursuant to batson kentucky,d.we hold that a trial court can fulfill its duty to rule at the step three of the batson framework by expressing a clear intention to uphold or reject a strike after listening to the challenge,the explanation and the arguments of the parties.
petitioner kassan supreme messiah appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard conway casey,judge denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.messiah,who was convicted of several crimes,including murder,contends that the state trial court failed to rule on his batson challenge to a peremptory strike the prosecutor exercised against a particular jury panelist.see batson,at.messiah argues in the alternative that if the trial court did render a ruling on the striking of that panelist,the ruling was not supported by the record.messiah also maintains that the trial court rulings with respect to two other batson challenges he asserted were not supported by the record.
for the reasons set forth below,we find messiah claims to be without merit.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of messiah petition.
background 
on september,insurance agent dennis grasso was shot and killed in his dobbs ferry,new york office.in connection with that homicide,former professional boxer kassan supreme messiah was indicted on two counts of murder in the second degree and one count each of robbery in the first degree,criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and criminal use of a firearm in the first degree.
messiah was tried by a jury in new york supreme court,westchester county.on may,the jury convicted him on all counts.messiah subsequently was sentenced principally to an indeterminate term of and a half years to life imprisonment,which he is currently serving.this appeal concerns messiah claims that certain peremptory strikes the prosecutor exercised against prospective jurors during voir dire were racially motivated.
in the first panel of jurors examined,the prosecutor exercised a peremptory strike against john woodbury,a social behavior counselor at a school for the deaf who had spent fourteen years teaching young deaf men how to socially behave in society,independent living skills.tr.of voir dire tr,at.woodbury wife worked for a law firm involved in the practice of all types of law.when asked whether the firm practice included criminal law,woodbury responded,i would assume.we do talk about it.id.at.
the prosecutor eliminated woodbury among the first set of peremptory strikes the following colloquy occurred 
the court three by consent.preempts by the people.
neary prosecutor two,three and four,eight and ten.
the court is that it 
aslaksen defense counsel judge,i do have a motion with regard to number two woodbury.
the court what do you want to say then 
aslaksen i want to find out what the nonracial motivation is for the exercise of the peremptory challenge.
the court he wants to know why you are challenging number two.
neary social work background,i think it would make him sympathetic to the defendant.his wife works for a law firm.
aslaksen i would note,your honor,for the record that he the only black juror on the panel.
the court you can stop that nonsense.that not true.stop that.that is not true.he and number thirteen.
aslaksen i was just going to say other than smith,number thirteen,who is going to be excused by consent.
the court anything else you wish to add 
aslaksen our striking 
the court with reference to these.that five,five by the people.
id.at.before the second round of jury selection,defense counsel objected to the composition of the panel because it purportedly contained an inadequate representation of racial or ethnic minorities id.at.jury selection was thereafter adjourned for the weekend.
when jury selection continued the following monday,defense counsel again objected to the composition of the panel on the ground that i could only see one person of color in that panel in the last row and there was in the first row another individual who i could not tell whether he was a person of color or not,april,at.the prosecutor disagreed with defense counsel characterization of the panel,insisting that i saw more than two people of color.id.at.the prosecutor then went on to discuss the composition of the panel and elaborated further on his reasons for striking woodbury 
i excused one black male woodbury on the basis of the fact that he was a behavioral scientist sic who worked with deaf children.he indicated also and i felt that fact indicated to me that he might be sympathetic to someone in a defendant situation.he also indicated to me that his wife worked in a law office and he indicated that he had never spoken to his wife about her employment which i found hard to believe and also the fact that while counsel for defense and myself were considering our challenges during that period of time i observed him what appeared to be laughing and joking with a juror next to him chicirelli and the record should reflect i excused both of those gentlemen on the basis i thought their laughing and joking was inappropriate given the seriousness of the charge.
id.defense counsel disputed that woodbury and chicirelli had been laughing and emphasized the importance to the defendant of get ting some more people on the panel that would be people of color so as to be able to protect this defendant rights.id.at.
during a later round of jury selection,the prosecutor exercised a peremptory strike against panelist john rodgers.the discussion concerning that strike occurred,in relevant part,as follows 
aslaksen number one,your honor,i do want to ask the court with regard to the last black juror who was peremptorily eliminated.
the court you 
aslaksen that the people eliminated.
the court who are you talking about 
aslaksen rodgers.
the court what about him 
aslaksen he was a man of color.
neary i not aware of that.
the court let him talk.
aslaksen i wanted to ask the court that we have the reason for the prosecution for the exercise of the peremptory challenge.
the court you been saying that from the beginning and it not a true statement.do you wish to comment,neary 
neary other than i not aware that this gentleman is a man of color.i not aware from looking at him.
the court whether he is or is,would you care to put a reason.
neary he an investment banker in new york city.i saw him reading the newspaper during the course of the voir dire.maybe it was stock quotations.he also expressed an interest in boxing above that of the average sports fan and,frankly,given the fact there are more jurors i think that are more qualified on the panel that why i exercised a peremptory challenge.
giamboi defense counsel it has to be specifically stated that it obvious that the man is a man of color.
the court i heard more about color from you people than we had in the last year.
giamboi with all due respect,i think it most important in this case because of the nature and because of certain factors in the case that the court be made aware of these objections that we draw.we do do it arbitrarily.
the court all i can tell you is i look at messiah here and i can see.so far i have seen anything unusual.i do know what it is that you are referring to.if you have something to tell me,tell me.so far you kept me in the dark.
giamboi i told you in the past we honestly believe this man to be innocent.
the court what does that have to do.
giamboi it important he be judged by his peers.one of his peers would be a man of color on that jury.
the court you had your say.you had your say.the ruling stands.
later in the selection process,the prosecutor exercised another peremptory strike against panelist calvin whitfield and defense counsel objected.id.at.without direction from the court,the prosecutor immediately responded as follows 
neary this particular juror was excused by the people on the basis of the fact that he apparently has an arrest in for obstructing governmental administration in mount vernon which he told us about and he plead sic guilty to disorderly conduct.he told us at the side bar he has four relatives currently in state prison.for those reasons i do think he could be fair for the people.
id.at.defense counsel noted that whitfield had recently been involved with the police in helping the police with regard to juveniles in his town and argued that therefore any comment by the people with regard to the disorderly conduct plea or sentence i think is really not valid.id.at.whitfield was not seated as a juror.
after the full jury and two alternates had been selected,the prosecutor challenged panelist george purnell for cause.during voir dire,purnell recounted an incident in which he had been arrested the police allegedly assaulted him and never charged him with a crime.he also discussed a different incident in which he was going to testify in court after his wife had been assaulted.the prosecutor had purnell wife,purnell and other witnesses wait in a room.according to purnell,the judge threw the case out because we did show.id at.when asked whether the prosecutor had acted improperly,purnell responded,she definitely did.id.purnell said that as a result of these experiences it would be difficult for him to be fair.the court seemed inclined to grant the prosecutor challenge to purnell,stating that it would go with two alternates.id.at.but after defense counsel vigorously objected on the ground that purnell was the last black juror that we had,the prosecutor acquiesced to the seating of purnell as the third alternate.id.at.
messiah did not challenge the prosecutor attempts to strike any jurors other than woodbury,rodgers,whitfield and purnell.the jury that was seated did not include any members of racial minority groups except for purnell,who,as an alternate,did not deliberate.
following the completion of jury selection,a trial was held and messiah was convicted on all counts of the indictment against him.he thereafter brought a motion,through counsel and pro se,to set aside the verdict pursuant to section of the new york criminal procedure law on account of the prosecutor allegedly discriminatory use of peremptory strikes in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and the doctrine of batson kentucky,d.the trial court denied that motion.
ii.state appellate proceedings 
messiah appealed his conviction and among the contentions he raised was that the prosecutor had stricken panelists on the basis of race in violation of the equal protection clause.the appellate division affirmed messiah conviction on february,in a decision that directly addressed certain of messiah contentions,but that disposed of his batson claims with the following concluding sentence the defendant remaining contentions,including those raised in his supplemental pro se brief,are either unpreserved for appellate review see,cpl people allen,or without merit.people messiah,dep t.
messiah sought leave to appeal the appellate division affirmance of his conviction to the new york court of appeals,but leave was denied on may.messiah then filed a petition for a writ of error coram nobis in the appellate division,second department,contending that his appellate counsel had provided ineffective assistance in failing to argue that messiah right to counsel had been denied because his attorney had allegedly been excluded from the room during the in which messiah was identified.that petition was denied in an order dated october.people messiah,dep t.
iii.federal habeas corpus proceedings 
on december,messiah filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the district court.among the grounds he asserted in his petition,messiah argued that his rights under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment were violated as a result of the prosecutor alleged racially discriminatory use of peremptory strikes.
in a report and recommendation dated november,magistrate judge henry pitman recommended that all of messiah claims be denied,except his batson claim relating to panelist john woodbury.messiah duncan,civ,report and recommendation,at.judge pitman determined that no independent and adequate state procedural bar precluded a federal court from reviewing messiah batson claims.see id.at.upon undertaking that review,judge pitman concluded that messiah claims concerning panelists john rodgers and calvin whitfield were without merit because the trial court rulings were supported by the record.id.at.however,judge pitman recommended that an evidentiary hearing be held regarding the striking of panelist john woodbury b ecause the trial court never ruled on petitioner batson objection to the striking of woodbury,which made it impossible to determine whether the ruling would be supported by the record.id.at.
the district court accepted the recommendations of judge pitman in part and denied messiah petition in its entirety.see messiah duncan,civ,wl.the court agreed with judge pitman that the decision of the appellate division did not exhibit a sufficiently clear,independent and adequate state ground to preclude federal review of messiah batson claims and that those the extent they concerned panelists rodgers and merit.id.at.but the district court rejected judge pitman determination that the state trial court had failed to rule on the batson challenge to the striking of woodbury,because t he trial court dismissed petitioner claim of pretext when it directed defense counsel to stop that nonsense.id.at.the district court further concluded that the trial court denial of messiah batson challenge to the striking of woodbury was not clearly unreasonable.id.at.
on january,a panel of this court granted messiah a certificate of appealability limited to his batson claims,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
messiah contends that the district court erred in denying his petition because the trial court failed to rule on his batson challenge to the striking of panelist woodbury and because the trial court rejection of his batson claims relating to each of the three panelists at issue is not supported by the record.see appellant br.according to respondents,we need not address the merits of messiah contentions because he procedurally defaulted on his batson claims,which were dismissed by the appellate division on independent and adequate state grounds.see appellee br.as it is not clear that the appellate division considered messiah batson claims procedurally defaulted,we review those claims and conclude that they are without merit because the trial court ruled on the batson challenge to the striking of woodbury and because all three of the relevant batson rulings are supported by the record.
i.the batson 
in batson kentucky,d,the supreme court fashioned a framework that trial courts are to employ when ascertaining whether a particular peremptory strike of a jury panelist is based on an impermissible discriminatory motive in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.see id.at.see also rice collins,d.initially,upon the assertion of an objection that a peremptory strike has been exercised in an unlawfully discriminatory manner,the movant must make a prima facie showing of circumstances that generate an inference that the relevant panelist was stricken on improper grounds.see batson,at.an method for such a showing is the description or discernment of a pattern of strikes against panelists who are members of particular protected groups.see id.at.
if the trial court is satisfied that the movant has made the requisite prima facie showing,the must then proffer a explanation for striking the panelist.see id.this explanation need not be persuasive,or even plausible for the to meet his obligation at step two of the batson procedure and thereby advance the inquiry to the third step.see purkett elem,d.
once the has proffered his explanation,the trial court must then determine whether the movant has satisfied his burden of proving that the relevant strike was exercised for discriminatory reasons.see batson,at.this third step requires a trial judge to make an ultimate determination on the issue of discriminatory intent based on all the facts and circumstances.jordan lefevre,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
throughout the batson procedure,the burden of proving that a strike was exercised on an impermissible discriminatory ground remains with the movant.see mckinney artuz,cir.the persuasiveness of the prosecutor explanation only becomes relevant at the third batson step when the trial court must determine whether the movant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.see id.ordinarily,at step three,the decisive question will be whether counsel explanation for a peremptory challenge should be believed.id.quoting hernandez new york,d.
ii.adequate and independent state ground 
federal courts considering habeas corpus petitions are generally barred from reviewing the decisions of state courts insofar as those decisions are predicated on adequate and independent state procedural grounds.as the supreme court has explained,if a petitioner defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule,federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the petitioner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law,or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman thompson,d.
the preclusion of federal review applies only when the last state court rendering a judgment in the case clearly and expressly states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar.glenn bartlett,cir quotation marks omitted.it must be clear from the face of the opinion that the court intended to rely on the state procedural rule in disposing of the federal claim.fama comm r of corr,cir quoting coleman,at.quotation marks omitted.
respondents assert that we are foreclosed from reviewing messiah batson claims because the appellate division disposed of them on adequate and independent state,the application of the rule of people allen.in allen,the new york court of appeals held that the ultimate burden of proof of a party claiming a violation of batson is not satisfied if he raise s no claim of pretext after the adverse party proffers a reason for the relevant strike at step two of the batson inquiry.id.at.according to respondents,allen is an adequate and independent state procedural rule on which the appellate division clearly relied in rejecting each of messiah batson claims.
we need not decide whether allen can be an adequate and independent state ground that would procedurally bar a habeas petition asserting batson claims,because it is not at all clear in these circumstances that the appellate division relied on allen in ruling on each of messiah batson claims.see deberry portuondo,cir.by alleging that the characterization of panelist whitfield prior prosecution was not valid,at,messiah trial counsel effectively asserted a claim of pretext relating to at least part of the prosecutor explanation for the striking of whitfield.that fact,together with the ambiguity of the disjunctive language in the appellate division affirmance,see deberry,at,prevent us from definitively concluding that the appellate division relied on allen in disposing of any of messiah batson claims in particular see miranda bennett,cir generally when the appellate division opinion states that a group of contentions is either without merit or procedurally barred,the decision does not disclose which claim in the group has been rejected on which ground.as it is not clear from the face of the opinion,fama,at,that the appellate division judgment with respect to any one of messiah batson claims was based on the rule of allen,we are not precluded from reviewing the merits of those claims.
iii.messiah batson claims 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision to deny messiah petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.mckinney artuz,cir.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,modified the standard under which we review petitions.see mckinney,at.prior to aedpa entry into force,when we considered a petition raising a batson claim,we would review de novo the state court conclusions of law,as well as its mixed findings of fact and conclusions of law.see deberry portuondo,cir.however,in accordance with the supreme court directive in hernandez new york,d,we would afford great deference to the state court credibility assessment of a prosecutor proffered explanation for striking a juror.deberry,at.that deference stems from the fact that the best evidence of the credibility vel non of a explanation will often be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge,and such evaluations of demeanor lie peculiarly within a trial judge province.mckinney,at quoting hernandez,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
aedpa reconfigured our standard of review in habeas cases,at least when the relevant claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings,d,by requiring more deferential review,jenkins artuz,cir,of the factual findings and legal conclusions of the trial court.see d we need not determine here whether messiah claims were adjudicated on the merits by the state courts,thereby triggering aedpa review,because his claims would fail even if we apply the less deferential,standard see deberry,at.in other words,the distinction between aedpa and standards is not crucial for our consideration of the particular batson claims asserted here.id.with respect to messiah claim of legal the trial court failed to rule on the batson challenge relating to panelist would reach the same conclusion regardless of whether we apply a de novo standard of review,see cotto herbert,cir,or the relevant aedpa,whether the purported failure to rule was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.in regard to messiah claims that the trial court batson rulings were not supported by the record,we reach the same outcome under the standard of great deference to the trial court assessment of credibility,hernandez,at,as we would if we applied aedpa even more deferential,whether the trial court determination was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.we need not therefore determine whether messiah claims were subject to a ruling on the merits in state court,as those claims fail under the more forgiving standards of review.see deberry,at.
panelist woodbury 
messiah argues that the trial court failed to rule on his batson challenge to the prosecutor striking of panelist woodbury and that,in the alternative,if the trial court did render such a ruling,it was not supported by the record.
we have held that a trial judge has a duty at the third stage of the batson inquiry to determine the credibility of the party proffered explanations for peremptorily striking jurors.jordan lefevre,cir.that duty requires that the trial judge explicitly adjudicat e the credibility of the party race neutral explanations for peremptorily striking potential jurors.id.we have also recognized,however,that a judge need not engage in a talismanic recitation of specific words in order to satisfy batson.galarza keane,cir.instead,the trial judge must simply make clear whether he credits the party explanation for striking the relevant panelist.see id.at.
ordinarily,the outcome determinative issue at step three of the batson procedure is whether counsel explanation for a peremptory challenge should be believed.mckinney,at quoting hernandez,at.accordingly,unambiguous rejection of a batson challenge will demonstrate with sufficient clarity that a trial court deems the movant to have failed to carry his burden to show that the prosecutor proffered explanation is pretextual.see id.at holding that the trial court comment i see no reason why the juror should not be seated amounted to a batson ruling because b y saying that it saw no reason for the juror not to be seated,the court was saying that it found the defense proffered reason to be pretextual.the trial court is not compelled to make intricate factual findings in connection with its ruling in order to comply with batson.see cockrell,d explaining that a state court need not make detailed findings addressing all the evidence before it to render a proper batson ruling.as long as a trial judge affords the parties a reasonable opportunity to make their respective records,he may express his batson ruling on the credibility of a proffered explanation in the form of a clear rejection or acceptance of a batson challenge.see mckinney,at although reviewing courts might have preferred the trial court to provide express reasons for each credibility determination,no clearly established federal law required the trial court to do so.
after the batson challenge to the striking of woodbury was lodged and the prosecutor proffered a explanation,defense counsel commented that woodbury was the only black juror on the panel,at,and the trial judge responded you can stop that nonsense.that not true.stop that.that is not true.he and number thirteen.id.the district court determined that these comments constituted a batson ruling,reasoning that t he trial court dismissed petitioner claim of pretext when it directed defense counsel to stop that nonsense.messiah duncan,civ,wl,at.messiah challenges the district court ruling,arguing that the trial judge comments did not adjudicat e the credibility of the party race neutral explanations for peremptorily striking potential jurors.jordan,at.we agree with messiah.from the the comment h e and number thirteen,as well as the recurring disagreement over the number of minority panelists present at jury is clear that stop that nonsense was not actually intended to adjudicate the batson claim,but rather,to respond to defense counsel assertion that woodbury was the only black member of the venire.
despite the district court error,we nevertheless affirm its judgment because we locate a batson adjudication later in the colloquy.after the stop that nonsense comment,the trial judge asked defense counsel,anything else you wish to add,at.defense counsel then asked,our striking and the trial judge answered,with reference to these peremptory strikes and said,that five,five by the people.id.in the first round of jury selection,which involved the panel that included woodbury,the prosecutor had listed five two woodbury,three,four,eight and his peremptory strikes.the trial judge listened to the arguments,asked defense counsel if he had anything more to contribute and then unequivocally stated on the record his acceptance of all five of the prosecutor strikes,including that of woodbury.it is evident that the trial judge did not discredit or find unpersuasive the prosecutor explanations for striking woodbury.clear acceptance of that strike following the batson challenge,the proffered explanation,and the ensuing discussion was a succinct but adequate batson ruling 
messiah has not argued that the trial judge prevented defense counsel from making a full record.see jordan,at trial judge batson ruling was inadequate because he had resisted counsel efforts to make arguments regarding the peremptory strikes so as to create a full record and granted counsel no time to identify the relevant facts and circumstances necessary to decide whether the reasons were credible and nonpretextual.nor is this a situation in which the trial judge ruled on some challenged panelists without ruling on others,see galarza,at quoting trial court statement that s ince i am satisfied that at least three of five or six batson challenges have certain articulable sic reasons,i am not going to stop the trial emphasis in original united states alvarado,cir t he magistrate made findings that the prosecution explanations were as to two panelists,but made no findings as to two other panelists,or in which the court expressly refused to rule,see barnes anderson,cir quoting trial court statement that i wo rule on credibility of attorneys right now myself,but i find both cases have sufficient reason.rather,here,the trial judge ruled by clearly accepting the strike of woodbury after listening to the relevant arguments.
messiah contends that to the extent the trial court did rule on woodbury,its rejection of the batson challenge was not supported by the record.he claims that the prosecutor explanations for the woodbury was a social behavior counselor who was likely to show sympathy for the defendant and that his wife worked for a law patently pretextual in light of the fact that there were four white panelists who performed volunteer work,but who were not stricken.messiah does not dispute,however,that woodbury was a social service professional,unlike the white subjects of comparison.it is not implausible that the prosecutor would have believed that a social service provider who had dedicated his professional life to helping others might have more sympathy for a defendant than panelists who were volunteers in charitable endeavors.
the prosecutor also explained that he did not find believable woodbury claim that he and his wife never talked about the subject of her work in a law office.the prosecutor might reasonably have felt less inclined to trust woodbury on the basis of that statement.in addition,the prosecutor might have thought that woodbury was in fact likely to have discussed other legal matters with his wife that could influence his decision in messiah case.
these distinctions between woodbury and the white panelists,in combination with the great deference we are required to pay the trial judge credibility determination,hernandez,at,support the ruling on the batson challenge to the striking of woodbury.see rice collins,even if r easonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about the prosecutor credibility,it is inappropriate on habeas review to supersede the trial court credibility determination.
panelist rodgers 
messiah contends that the state trial court denial of his batson challenge to the striking of panelist john rodgers is not supported by the record.as an initial matter,the prosecutor asserted that he was not aware that rodgers was a member of a minority group.moreover,the prosecutor claimed to have stricken rodgers because of the latter purported inattentiveness during voir was reported to be reading the because of his interest in boxing messiah was a professional boxer.a prosecutor may reasonably have qualms about a panelist who fails to pay attention during voir dire.moreover,a prosecutor could reasonably believe that a boxing fan who watches the contenders,hbo,showtime,at,would have a degree of unwelcome or undue sympathy for the plight of a professional boxer.
messiah contends that the prosecutor explanations for striking rodgers were disingenuous because the prosecutor failed to strike a white panelist,william cade,who also had expressed an interest in boxing.appellant br.at.however,there is no suggestion in the record that cade had been inattentive during voir dire,and,in any event,cade explained that his interest in boxing was limited to a matuer boxing,olympic type,three rounds,bang,bang,bang,not professional,at.it would have been rational for the prosecutor to infer that a panelist who only followed amateur boxing was less likely to have undue sympathy for a professional boxer than a fan of professional boxing.indeed,the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge against a white panelist,benedict tocci,who stated that he was an avid fan of professional boxing.
mindful of the great deference we owe to the trial court credibility determination,hernandez,at,we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that there had been no batson violation in the exclusion of rodgers.
panelist whitfield 
messiah maintains that the state trial court rejection of his batson challenge to the striking of panelist calvin whitfield was not supported by the record.the prosecutor asserted that he had stricken whitfield because the latter had been prosecuted ten years earlier by the westchester county district attorney office,and because he had four relatives in state prison serving sentences of at least five years.the prosecutor could reasonably have believed that a panelist who had been if onl
