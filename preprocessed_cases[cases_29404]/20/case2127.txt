on may,the minnesota supreme court reversed,holding that the minnesota court of appeals erred in concluding that was not entitled to the benefit of apprendi.state,ii.according to the court,
if a case is pending on direct review when a new rule of federal constitutional criminal procedure is announced,the defendant is entitled to benefit from that new rule.but if the defendant conviction is already final at the time the new rule is announced,then the criminal defendant ordinarily may not avail himself of the new rule.

appeal period expired on august.having failed to perfect a direct appeal,his conviction became final on that date.apprendi was decided on june.because the apprendi decision was handed down before conviction became final,is entitled to benefit from the apprendi rule,as we applied it in grossman.the state has conceded that if is entitled to benefit from the apprendi rule,his sentence was imposed in violation of apprendi,and must therefore be reduced.
id.at emphasis added.in light of its holding,the court 
r eversed and remanded for imposition of the statutory maximum sentences of two consecutive terms under,subd,and,subd,plus the conditional release term of years mandated by,subd.a.
while awaited resentencing,on june,the supreme court issued blakely,holding that an upward departure from the maximum statutory sentence is unconstitutional under a guideline system unless a jury finds the underlying facts or the defendant admits such facts.
on august,the state trial court resentenced.at the resentencing hearing,argued that under blakely and apprendi,the longest sentences he could receive were the top of the box presumptive guidelines.state,no,wl,at,unpublished iii.the state trial court rejected argument,concluding that blakely did not apply to case because case had become final in august,well before the decision in blakely.based on its earlier findings under the patterned sex offender statute,the court sentenced to two consecutive prison terms.id.
appealed to the minnesota court of appeals,asserting that his sentence is unconstitutional because a judge,not a jury,decided the facts supporting the upward durational departure based on the patterned sex offender statute.he argue d that his case was still pending,not yet final,and therefore,the holding in blakely applies to his case.id the court rejected argument,reasoning that case became final on august,almost four years prior to blakely.id.at.the court also rejected contention that the holding in blakely is to be applied retroactively based on a prior holding of the minnesota supreme court.id.citing state houston.on march,the minnesota supreme court denied review of the minnesota court of appeals decision.

the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation in which he recommended that the district court deny petition and dismiss the action with prejudice.the magistrate judge determined that the minnesota court of appeals committed no habeas error in concluding that conviction was final in august.as a result,the magistrate judge found that the court decision can not be contrary to clearly established federal law and that the court application of the griffith line of cases,the closest relevant precedent,was not objectively unreasonable.furthermore,the magistrate judge concluded that the court reasonably applied teague in holding that blakely did not retroactively apply to final judgment of conviction.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation.
