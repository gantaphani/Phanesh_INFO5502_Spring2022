this case presents the question of what type of deference we owe on collateral review to a state court determination.david eddleman was convicted of murder and a firearm offense in a michigan state court.on direct review,the michigan court of appeals affirmed his conviction,concluding that the trial court erred in admitting his coerced confession but that the error was harmless.eddleman petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.the district court granted the writ,and warden ken mckee appealed.
we affirm.we hold that,when a state court has found an error to be harmless,we should ask on collateral review whether the state court decision was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,the clearly established federal rule that a trial error is harmless only if it is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.applying this standard of review to the case at hand,we hold that the michigan court of appeals determination was an unreasonable application of the supreme court decisions in chapman california,d,and arizona fulminante,d.
eddleman conviction arose out of the shooting death of joane georgescu early in the morning of october.georgescu was seated in a car parked near the corner of kirkland and trenton streets in western detroit,near dearborn,when a bullet shot from a passing car entered through the trunk of her car,passed through the back seat,and struck her in the heart.the state of michigan charged eddleman with premeditated murder,murder,and possession of a firearm during a felony.he stood trial in wayne county circuit court,starting on july.
the government argued that eddleman was a member of the insane spanish cobras,a street gang,and shot georgescu while carrying out a mission ordered by the gang leader,jesus garcia.the evidence it introduced to support its theory consisted of eddleman confession and the testimony of four key other gang members and a jailhouse informant.as discussed below,reasons existed to doubt the credibility of each of the witnesses.the government did not present any physical evidence linking eddleman to the crime or any other eyewitnesses who could identify the vehicle used in the shooting or any of its occupants.
the first witness,brian babbitt,testified that he was a member of the insane spanish cobras street gang in october and that garcia was the gang leader.he stated that on the evening of october,shortly before the shooting,garcia ordered eddleman on a mission to find and shoot members of a rival gang in order to increase his rank within the insane spanish cobras.according to babbitt,eddleman received a carbine,the type of gun used in the shooting,and then left to carry out the mission.
eddleman allegedly sat in the front passenger seat of a burgundy chevrolet nova carrying three other people fellow gang member richard glockens,who was driving babbitt,who was in the back seat and an unnamed fourth individual,who was lying across the back seat after passing out due to alcohol consumption.their initial attempt to find rival gang members failed.they returned to the gang house,where,according to babbitt,eddleman told garcia that he knew the location of a rival gang party.garcia told him to shoot it up,and the car departed again,with eddleman giving glockens directions to an address near the intersection of kirkland and trenton streets.a second car followed,t o make sure the mission was done right.babbitt claimed that,before the shooting,he got out of eddleman car and got into the second car,because he had a bad feeling about what was happening.from that second car,he testified,he saw a total of ten to twelve shots fired from the passenger side of the nova toward a crowd of young men gathered outside a house.according to babbitt,dave eddleman was the only one firing any shots.
two categories of facts brought out at trial call babbitt credibility into question.first,babbitt received significant benefits from the police in exchange for his testimony.on january,babbitt was arrested for the killing of georgescu.on january,he was arrested again,this time for the murder of freddy sanchez.the wayne county prosecutor office granted him immunity from prosecution for both murders on january,in exchange for his testimony against eddleman,garcia,glockens,and another gang member allegedly involved in the sanchez murder.at the time,babbitt also faced charges of felony assault,using a firearm in the commission of a felony,and violating probation.after negotiating the immunity agreement,the prosecutor allowed babbitt to plead guilty only to a reduced charge of aiming without malice,with a sentence of time served.
second,babbitt trial testimony conflicted in three ways with statements he had made previously.on january,and again on january,babbitt told police that he was never in a car with eddleman on the night of the shooting at trial,he testified that he was in the same car as eddleman until shortly before the shooting.in the same january interview,babbitt stated that eddleman brought the carbine used in the shooting himself in his preliminary examination testimony for a separate trial against garcia,he claimed that garcia had given eddleman the gun finally,at trial,he testified that another gang member,cano,gave eddleman the gun.in another interview with police on january,babbitt did not mention that garcia was involved in the shooting at trial,he testified that garcia directly ordered the shooting.
the next witness,jailhouse informant ricky,testified that he was the head of a gang,that he had met and befriended garcia while in prison in or,and that garcia had introduced him to eddleman while garcia and eddleman were in jail awaiting trial for georgescu murder.claims that he talked to eddleman while the two of them,along with garcia and glockens,were working out at the jail gym.according to,eddleman admitted that he had shot and killed that innocent girl and stated that he wanted to take the rap alone to free garcia and glockens.
testified pursuant to a plea agreement in which the state agreed to reduce a pending charge of assault with intent to rob,which carried a possible life sentence,to two counts of felony assault,for which he received concurrent sentences of one to four years.he had an extensive prior criminal record,including convictions for breaking and entering,larceny,and unarmed robbery.
the next two witnesses,brian weaver and thomas valastek,both testified that they heard eddleman admit to the shooting.weaver testified that he attended a gang meeting on october,the day after georgescu murder,and that eddleman stated at that meeting that he had committed a shooting while on a mission the previous night.weaver explained that he remembered the date because,on the previous evening,he had watched the boxing match between mike tyson and evander holyfield in which tyson bit holyfield ear.on,the defense impeached weaver testimony with evidence that tyson and holyfield did not fight each other at all until november,and that the bout did not take place until june.the defense also presented evidence that weaver may have avoided punishment for numerous probation violations by testifying against eddleman.
valastek gave testimony substantially similar to weaver he stated that he was watching the boxing match,that he heard garcia mention a mission he wanted completed that evening,and that the next morning he heard eddleman bragging that he had been involved in a shooting the day before.in addition to the inaccuracy of the boxing reference,three other pieces of information call into question valastek credibility.first,he too cooperated with police only after he was arrested in connection with georgescu murder.second,he admitted on that his initial statement to police contained a lot of lying.third,he admitted that he chose to cooperate fully with police a day after he saw that babbitt was receiving special perks in as family visits,outside food,and television figured he must have told them something really good to give him all that.
a fifth witness,jennifer lertola,eddleman girlfriend at the time of the shooting,testified that eddleman called her shortly after the time of the shooting and told her to watch the channel news.before trial,she allegedly had told police that,when she asked eddleman if he had shot georgescu,eddleman laughed and said that for me to know and for you to find out,and that eddleman later admitted to the shooting.at trial,however,she stated that she did not think that she made those statements and that any statements she did make were driven by fear that the police would take her children away if they thought she was concealing information.
eddleman argued that the insane spanish cobras had no role in the shooting.instead,he claimed at trial,the person who shot georgescu was targeting a resident of a house at the corner of kirkland and trenton streets,who had been involved in an earlier bar fight.four witnesses supported this core theory.on,all four admitted that they formed their beliefs about what happened based on rumor and speculation rather than specific evidence.
the prosecution made frequent references to eddleman confession,both in supporting its theory of the case and in rebutting eddleman theory.four references stand out.first,in his opening statement,the prosecutor emphasized the confession as soon as he began to discuss the facts 
let me see,if i can,introduce you once again to the defendant in this case this is david eddleman,insane spanish cobra,a member of the insane spanish cobras.back in october of,the evidence will show you that this defendant,this insane spanish cobra,david eddleman,confessed,made a full confession to shooting and killing an innocent sic girl 
second,detective barbara simon read eddleman confession to the jury.her testimony,focused entirely on the confession,lasted for almost five hours.third,the prosecutor used the confession as a potent weapon during his of each of the four witnesses supporting eddleman prior fight theory fourth,the prosecutor began his summary of the evidence in his closing argument by stating that w e got the defendant confession,first and foremost of all in this case,and later referred to the confession at least five more times.
the jury struggled to reach a verdict.after a day of deliberations,the jury communicated to the court that it was deadlocked.the court instructed the jurors to continue their deliberations.about an hour later,the jury returned a second communication stating that it could no longer deliberate and had reached an impasse.the court then dismissed the jury for the weekend.shortly after reconvening,the jury found eddleman not guilty of murder but guilty of both murder and the firearm charge.the trial court sentenced eddleman to thirty to sixty years of imprisonment for the murder conviction,to be served consecutively to two years of imprisonment for the firearm conviction.
eddleman appealed to the michigan court of appeals,arguing,inter alia,that the trial court erred in admitting the confession into evidence.the court agreed,but concluded that the error was harmless 
nonetheless,we conclude that reversal is not warranted because the error was harmless.people anderson.the testimony of several witnesses clearly implicated the defendant in the crime.brian babbitt,also a member of defendant street gang,was in a car traveling behind the car defendant was riding in on the night of the shooting.babbitt testified that he witnessed shots coming from the passenger side of defendant car,where defendant was seated.two other gang members,brian weaver and thomas valastek,testified that they heard defendant admit to being the shooter.defendant also told a fellow inmate that he had shot and killed georgescu.given the weight of this evidence,we conclude that the erroneous admission of the confession was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
people eddleman,slip op.at,wl.the michigan supreme court denied his petition for review.
eddleman then filed a timely federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,attacking only the state appellate court determination.the district court conditionally granted the writ,mandating that the state either schedule a new trial within ninety days or release eddleman.the warden appealed,and the district court agreed to stay its order pending the resolution of this appeal.
the admission of an involuntary confession at trial is subject to analysis.arizona fulminante,d.in this case,we must clarify what type of deference we owe on collateral review to a state court determination that an error was harmless.
prior to the enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,the supreme court articulated two standards.on direct review,before a federal constitutional error can be held harmless,the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.chapman california,d.on collateral review,however,the court instructed us to find an error to be harmless unless the error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brecht abrahamson,d quoting kotteakos united states.
when congress enacted aedpa,it complicated this dichotomy.aedpa states 
an application for writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or an involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.when a state court addresses a claim on direct review,the clearly established federal law that it must apply is the chapman standard.as such,aedpa plain language requires federal courts to deny a habeas petition in this situation unless a state court determination of harmless error was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,the principle that an error must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
in cases when a state court ruled that an error was harmless,however,it is not clear whether this new plus aedpa brecht substantial and injurious effect standard or supplements it.the second,seventh,and eighth circuits have held that aedpa supersedes the brecht standard and therefore have applied only chapman harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard plus aedpa deference.see davis,cir gutierrez mcginnis,cir whitmore kemna,cir.the fourth and ninth circuits have held that aedpa supplements brecht and therefore have crafted a approach,granting habeas relief only if the state court decision was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,the chapman standard and the error is not harmless under the brecht standard.see inthavong lamarque,cir jones polk,cir.joined by the first,fifth,and tenth circuits,see robertson cain,cir herrera lemaster,cir en banc medina matesanz,cir,we have agreed that aedpa supplements brecht,but concluded that,if the petitioner can make the showing required by brecht,he will surely have demonstrated that the state court finding that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable chapman outside the realm of credible outcomes,and therefore resulted from an unreasonable application of chapman.nevers killinger,cir.consequently,we have continued to apply only the brecht standard despite the enactment of aedpa.see bulls jones,cir.
today,we reconsider our position in light of the supreme court decision in mitchell esparza,which strongly implied that courts should apply only the chapman plus aedpa deference standard of review,d per curiam,rev g cir.in esparza,the court reversed this court grant of a writ of habeas corpus,holding that we showed insufficient deference under aedpa to the analysis of the ohio court of appeals and explaining 
a constitutional error is harmless when it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.neder united states,d quoting chapman,at.we may not grant respondent habeas petition,however,if the state court simply erred in concluding that the state errors were harmless rather,habeas relief is appropriate only if the ohio court of appeals applied review in an objectively unreasonable manner.
id.at.some citations omitted.the supreme court never discussed or cited brecht.two circuits,the second and the seventh,already have relied on esparza to revisit their prior precedents and adopt the standard of chapman plus aedpa deference.see,at overruling sub silentio aleman sternes,cir,which applied the approach gutierrez,at.the fifth circuit has suggested in dicta that it might do the same.see garcia quarterman,cir.taking guidance from esparza,we now join those circuits we hold that aedpa replaced the brecht standard with the standard of chapman plus aedpa deference when,as here,a state court made a determination 
this result makes practical sense for two reasons.first,a judicially crafted standard generally gives way when congress steps in to address the same issue,as long as the original standard was not constitutionally required.see,schweiker chilicky,d holding that the bivens remedy is unavailable when congress,through the social security act,provided an alternative mechanism for a plaintiff to vindicate his due process rights.that is precisely what happened here.the brecht court saw the harm caused by de novo collateral review of state court determinations and crafted its own solution to prevent that harm.see at.it recognized that in mandating an alternative standard of review it was acting as a temporary substitute for congress,not as a permanent partner in the absence of any express statutory guidance from congress,it explained,it remains for this court to determine what standard applies to the petitioner claim.id.at.emphasis added.when congress enacted aedpa,it obviated the need for such a stopgap.
second,we owe a different type of deference to state proceedings when a state court has found an error to be harmless than when it found no error.we defer to judgments for two reasons.first,we respect the presumption of finality that attaches to the conviction and sentence at the conclusion of direct review.brecht,at.second,we respect a state interest,grounded in principles of comity,in maintaining the primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law.id.at.both brecht and aedpa reflect these finality and comity interests.see,cong.rec,daily ed.february,statement of cox the central problem underlying federal habeas corpus review prior to aedpa is a lack of comity and respect for state judicial decisions.cong.rec,daily ed.february,statement of mccollum aedpa stands for the clear and simple proposition that there must be finality and accountability.
one might think that these finality and comity interests are strongest when a state court addressed the issue and concluded that an error was harmless.in one sense,that intuition is correct.when a state court explicitly has held that an error was harmless,we owe deference to that conclusion of law as a matter of comity.when a state court does not reach the question of harmless error,we owe no such deference,since there is no relevant conclusion of law to which we could defer.
however,we do not defer to a state court solely out of respect for its resolution of a particular legal issue.the principles of comity and finality also dictate that we should defer to a state court ultimate disposition of a case.for two reasons,this second type of deference is weaker when a state court found an error to be harmless than when it found no error at all.first,the state interest in finality is weaker.a state court acknowledges that its resolution of the case was not perfect when it recognizes that a federal constitutional error occurred at trial.while an imperfect judgment still is entitled to a presumption of correctness,this presumption is not as strong as it would be absent any finding of error.second,the relevant state interest in comity is weaker.when a state proceeding has violated federal constitutional rights,the state interest in the autonomous administration of its criminal law gives way,at least in part,to the federal government interest in protecting those rights.when a state court itself admits that a constitutional error occurred at a state trial and therefore that a strong federal interest is in play,we do not compromise the state status as a separate sovereign by lessening the deference to the final outcome reached in state court.
in the situation we face today,in which a state court found error but concluded that the error was harmless,we owe deference primarily to the state court determination rather than to the final outcome the state court reached.the standard we announce,chapman plus aedpa deference,provides this type of deference by requiring us to decide whether that determination was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.in contrast,if the state court had found no error,we would owe deference only to the final outcome the state court reached.the brecht standard,which clearly applies in that situation,provides that type of deference by requiring us to determine whether an error had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury verdict.
thus,our analysis of principles of separation of powers and of federalism supports our reading of the supreme court precedent.when a state court addressed the question of harmless error,the appropriate standard of review is the chapman standard plus aedpa deference.
we now must determine whether the michigan court of appeals decision that admitting eddleman confession was harmless error was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,chapman.despite some confusion about the relationship between aedpa and brecht,the district court properly applied the chapman standard plus aedpa deference and concluded that the state court decision was an unreasonable application of chapman.we agree.
because the michigan court of appeals applied the correct legal standard,asking whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,we evaluate its decision under the unreasonable application portion of aedpa.see terry williams taylor,d.a state court unreasonably applies clearly established supreme court precedent when it reaches a result that falls outside the realm of plausible credible outcomes dictated by the governing law.barker yukins,cir.since the district court based its factual findings solely on a transcript from the petitioner state court trial,we review de novo both those factual findings,wolfe brigano,cir,and the district court legal conclusions,greer mitchell,cir.
in arizona fulminante,the supreme court applied chapman beyond a reasonable doubt analysis in the context of a coerced confession,d citing chapman,at.fulminante represents the best available explication of the clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,relevant to eddleman claim.
the defendant in fulminante twice confessed to killing his stepdaughter.id.at.the court held that the first confession,made to his cell mate while in jail on another charge,was coerced.ibid.the key piece of evidence remaining against him was his second confession,made to the cellmate wife after his release from prison.id.at.the court questioned the credibility of testimony about this second confession,noting that the cellmate did not remember that it occurred until a year later,even though he was in the car when the alleged conversation between his wife and the defendant took place that the wife account of the circumstances surrounding the confession sounded somewhat implausible and that prosecutors agreed to secure the cellmate a sentence reduction and to place both him and his wife in the witness protection program in exchange for their testimony.id.at.
because the court considered the case on direct review,it applied the chapman standard,id.at,and concluded that the erroneous admission of the first confession was not harmless,id.at.it explained that the erroneous admission of a coerced confession presents a unique problem under chapman 
a confession is like no other evidence.indeed,the defendant own confession is probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him in the case of a coerced confession such as that at issue in this case,
