factual and procedural history 
facts of the crime 
in late,ogan moved from louis,missouri to houston,texas.ogan had acted as a confidential informant for the drug enforcement agency dea in louis.however,upon his request,the dea relocated him to houston after state court prosecutions for narcotics trafficking revealed his identity.
in houston,dea agent norman houle agent houle supervised ogan.agent houle warned ogan that the dea did not permit informants to carry weapons.however,while in houston,ogan carried a firearm despite the dea policy.agent houle also instructed ogan not to get involved in any drug deals and to just let his face be known around houston.nevertheless,ogan sought involvement in drug transactions.
on december,ogan called agent houle from taco rico,a houston restaurant,and told him that he had encountered someone with whom he had previously attempted to set up a drug deal.the drug deal had not realized,but resulted in an armed confrontation.ogan told agent houle that at the restaurant the man had put a gun to ogan head,and that he had put a gun to the man head.the man was still outside the restaurant when ogan called agent houle.ogan told agent houle that he was afraid and asked him to come to the restaurant and escort him safely out.
agent houle arranged for houston police officers to accompany ogan off the premises.houston police officer darryl officer arrived to assist ogan at around.according to officer,ogan was extremely excited.ogan requested that the officer take him to his apartment so that he could remove some papers and tapes related to a dea investigation.however,officer told him that he could not take him there until after backup arrived.ogan then became impatient,hostile,and loud.houston police officer steven hanner officer hanner arrived to provide backup for officer.the officers took ogan to his apartment.ogan retrieved some items from his apartment,including a caliber pistol,a shotgun,and at least two hunting knives.the officers followed ogan to a best western motel,now a motel,and left him there at around 
ogan made two or three telephone calls after he checked in to his motel room.shortly thereafter,a motel employee disconnected his service because he had failed to leave a deposit for such service.ogan phoned the motel office and requested that the service be reconnected.he then went to the office to pay for his calls and to leave a deposit.while there,he complained that the heater in his room was not functioning properly.he was loud and upset as he complained.he eventually left the office but returned shortly thereafter,at around,to complain again.he requested his money back for the calls.because ogan grew angrier as he confronted the motel attendant,the attendant threatened to call security.ogan began kicking the office door,and the attendant dialed.ogan then left the motel and began walking toward a store.as he was leaving,he saw a police officer across the street from the motel.he walked over to the patrol unit and looked in the passenger side window.houston police officers morgan gainer officer gainer and james boswell officer boswell were sitting in the patrol unit.they had driven into a parking lot to make a traffic stop.
ogan knocked on the window of the patrol unit.officer boswell let his window down and asked ogan what he wanted.ogan responded that the dea had left him at the motel and that he was cold.officer boswell told ogan to back away from the car until the officers finished the traffic stop and then let his window back up.however,ogan knocked on the window again.officer boswell opened the door and again asked ogan to step away from the car.ogan stated that he was a dea informant and that he was cold.officer boswell again told ogan to wait.ogan repeated his previous statements,and officer boswell told him that he would have to wait,leave,or go to jail.officer boswell then got out of the patrol unit.ogan demanded immediate assistance.officer boswell unholstered his weapon,and holding the gun behind his right leg,reached into the patrol unit to unlock the back door.at this point,ogan pulled out a gun and shot officer boswell in the head and then stated well,fuck you then.ogan then ran.officer gainer,who had seen officer boswell fall against the back door of the patrol unit,chased ogan.the officer caught ogan,wounding him in the process.
ii.ogan trial phase and penalty phase 
on february,the state of texas indicted ogan for the capital murder of a police officer.at trial,ogan testified that officer boswell had threatened to tell people that he was a dea snitch.he also testified that officer boswell was lunging toward him and frantically attempting to remove his gun from the holster.ogan claimed to have killed officer boswell in a reflexive action,without thinking and fearing that officer boswell was going to shoot him.sally webster webster,a forensic psychologist,testified on ogan behalf during the phase of the trial.she testified that ogan was anxious,agitated,and fearful for his life after moving to houston.she also stated that he suffered from functional paranoia,which,according to webster,is not a form of insanity.she testified that ogan was intelligent but used his intelligence inefficiently.she also determined that ogan had a passive aggressive personality disorder.the jury found ogan guilty.
during the penalty phase of the trial,the state presented testimony from several witnesses regarding ogan history of aggressive behavior.ogan countered this evidence with testimony from several friends and relatives.the jury answered affirmatively the three special issues given after the sentencing hearing and the trial court sentenced ogan to death.
iii.direct appeal to the texas court of criminal appeals 
ogan filed a direct appeal to the texas court of criminal appeals,raising three points of error.he challenged the sufficiency of the evidence demonstrating his deliberate conduct in causing officer boswell death the sufficiency of the evidence establishing his future dangerousness and the effectiveness of his trial counsel at the penalty stage regarding counsel requested jury instruction on mitigation.the court of criminal appeals affirmed ogan conviction and sentence.on december,the united states supreme court denied ogan writ of certiorari petition.
iv.state habeas proceedings and appeal 
on february,the district court of harris county,texas,judge belinda hill,adopted the state proposed findings of fact,conclusions of law,and order and recommended that the texas court of criminal appeals deny ogan application for habeas relief.the state district court concluded that ogan had failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of his trial counsel with regard to counsel failure to employ a mitigation specialist and with regard to counsel alleged failure to investigate ogan history in an effort to discover mitigating evidence.the court also found that ogan had failed to demonstrate that his conviction was unlawfully obtained.
on april,the texas court of criminal appeals denied ogan petition for habeas relief.in a brief order,the court stated 
in the instant cause,applicant presents a single allegation challenging the validity of his conviction and resulting sentence.the trial court has entered findings of fact and conclusions of law recommending the relief sought be denied.this court has reviewed the record.the findings and conclusions entered by the trial court are supported by the record and upon such basis the relief sought by the applicant is denied.

federal habeas proceedings 
on august,ogan filed a preliminary petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.on december,ogan filed a supplemental petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the petition requested relief on the following bases insufficient evidence to sustain the jury affirmative answer to the statutory punishment issue on deliberate conduct insufficient evidence to sustain the jury affirmative answer to the statutory punishment issue on future dangerousness ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel limitation of the jury instruction on mitigation ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel failure adequately to develop and present mitigation evidence and ogan purported incompetency to stand trial.the state moved for summary judgment on all of ogan claims,and the district court granted that motion.
the district court rejected ogan two claims regarding the special issues on the merits additionally,the court rejected ogan claim of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding the jury instructions on mitigating evidence.the district court found that ogan had failed to present his claim of lack of competency to stand trial on direct review,or during the state habeas proceedings and that he had failed to demonstrate cause and prejudice for this failure.nevertheless,the court considered the claim on the merits and rejected it.the district court also applied the procedural bar to ogan claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to recognize the extent of his mental health problems.the district court rejected ogan remaining miscellaneous ineffective assistance claims regarding state trial and habeas counsel and the texas state courts obligations to provide him with effective counsel.the court based its rejection of these claims on either a procedural bar,the merits,or both.the district court also denied ogan request for an evidentiary hearing.additionally,the court found that ogan had failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,and refused to grant a coa even though ogan had not yet requested one.ogan now appeals the district court rulings.
discussion 
standard of review 
ogan filed his preliminary habeas petition pursuant to in the district court on august,and his supplemental petition on december,both after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.thus,aedpa applies to his application.see lindh murphy,d nobles johnson,cir.under aedpa,a petitioner seeking habeas relief must obtain a certificate of appealability coa.see c.a coa may be issued only if the prisoner makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.see id.a petitioner makes this showing if he demonstrates that his petition involves issues which are debatable among reasonable jurists,that a court could resolve the issues differently,or that the issues are adequate enough to deserve encouragement to proceed further.johnson,cir see also lamb johnson,cir.
although the nature of the death penalty is a proper consideration for determining whether the court should issue a coa,its severity alone is not sufficient to warrant the issuance of the certificate.see lamb,at.nevertheless,doubts regarding the propriety of issuing the certificate should be resolved in favor of the petitioner.id.section d,as amended by aedpa,provides that 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
section d provides the standard of review for questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact.caldwell johnson,cir.the court may grant habeas relief under the unreasonable application clause if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle but applies it incorrectly,or expands a legal principle to an area outside the scope intended by the supreme court.id.furthermore,the state court application must be unreasonable in addition to being merely incorrect.id.in other words,the appropriate inquiry is whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.id.quoting williams taylor,d.with respect to the contrary to clause of d,a federal court may grant the writ if the state court has arrived at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law,or if the state court decides the case differently than the supreme court on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.id.
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment in a habeas proceeding de novo.see soffar johnson,cir.when reviewing summary judgment on a petition for habeas corpus,consistent with the provisions of d,we presume all state court findings of fact to be correct in the absence of clear and convincing evidence.see caldwell,at.
ii.procedurally defaulted claims 
in considering ogan writ of habeas corpus petition,the district determined that the following claims were procedurally defaulted ogan claim that the state failed to provide competent habeas counsel his assertion that he was incompetent to stand trial and ogan contention that his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to realize the extent of his mental health problems.the law requires that a state prisoner seeking to raise claims in a federal petition for habeas corpus ordinarily must first present those claims to the state court and must exhaust state remedies.martinez johnson,cir citing b.generally,if the petitioner fails to follow these procedures,his claims will be considered procedurally defaulted and will not be regarded as a bases for granting federal habeas relief.id.at citing keeney,d.however,a petitioner can overcome this procedural default,and thus procure federal habeas corpus review of his barred claims,if he can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law.id.citing jones johnson,cir.
failure to provide competent habeas counsel 
ogan argued for the first time in his federal habeas petition that the state courts violated his rights to meaningful access to the courts,equal protection,and due process by refusing to remedy its earlier error of appointing him ineffective counsel the district court determined that the claims were procedurally defaulted and could not constitute cause for any other procedurally barred claims.the district court further noted that there is no underlying right to counsel in state review and that there is no cognizable constitutional claim based on the ineffectiveness of state habeas counsel.the district court concluded that to recognize a constitutional claim for ineffective assistance of state habeas counsel would require the retroactive application of a new constitutional principle on collateral review in violation of the supreme court decision in teague lane,d 
ogan challenges the district court determination that he could not assert a constitutional claim on the basis of ineffective assistance of state habeas counsel.he asserts that the texas courts appointment of incompetent counsel was a violation of his statutory right to competent counsel,as well as a violation of his due process rights under the fourteenth amendment.ogan avers that because texas has opted to provide review of death sentences under article of the texas code of criminal procedure,and has guaranteed the appointment counsel under that statute,it must follow the statutory requirements in accordance with due process.he concedes that the sixth amendment does not guarantee effective assistance of counsel in state proceedings.however,he argues that there are other constitutional bases to support his claim that he was entitled to effective assistance of state habeas counsel,namely the first amendment right to meaningful access to courts and the fourteenth amendment due process requirement that state forums and procedures be administered in a reasonably fair and consistent manner.
ogan claim that the texas courts violated his constitutional rights by providing him ineffective habeas counsel is meritless.this court has repeatedly held,usually in the cont
