kevin mccloud pleaded guilty to state charges of robbery and operating a vehicle without the owner consent arising from a carjacking incident.he later sought postconviction relief from the consecutive terms of imprisonment he was ordered to serve on these charges,contending that because the charges amount to the same offense when the object of the robbery is an automobile,the cumulative punishments deprived him of his constitutional right not to be twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense.the wisconsin court of appeals rejected the premise of his claim,finding that robbery and operating a vehicle without the owner consent are separate offenses for which the wisconsin legislature had authorized cumulative punishments.mccloud now seeks a writ of habeas corpus,contending that the wisconsin court of appeals erred in determining that the two offenses are distinct for purposes of the double jeopardy analysis.however,because the state court error,if any,was one of state law,it is beyond the limited scope of habeas review.
david shelby and his friend bette dunn were driving through the state of wisconsin on the evening of august,when they stopped at a walgreen drugstore at approximately shelby left his keys in the ignition of his car while he ran inside a nearby taco bell dunn remained behind in the car.at that moment,mccloud and his wife,donna mccloud,happened to drive by the walgreen parking lot.earlier that evening,the mcclouds had spent several hours celebrating donna birthday at a local tavern but had run out of money they decided to find someone to rob.after driving around the city for an hour or more,the mcclouds came upon the walgreen lot just in time to spot shelby getting out of his cadillac.on further reconnaissance,mccloud noticed that the keys were in the ignition of the car.the mcclouds had found their victims.
mccloud walked up to the car and entered through the unlocked driver side door.he told dunn to get out of the car and opened her door.dunn screamed and struggled with mccloud.shelby,on returning to the car,observed the struggle and intervened.he backed off when mccloud asked him,do you want to die as mccloud put the car in gear and began to drive away from the scene,dunn was thrown from the vehicle through the open door and run over.she died as a result of the injuries she sustained.
mccloud and his wife were apprehended a short time later.mccloud pleaded no contest to one count of reckless homicide,and he pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery along with one count of operating a vehicle without the owner consent.the milwaukee county circuit court ordered him to serve a prison term on the reckless homicide count,two terms on the robbery counts concurrent with one another and consecutive to the reckless homicide sentence,and a term for operating a vehicle without the owner consent consecutive to all other a total prison term of years.
mccloud subsequently filed a postconviction motion asking the state court for relief from his consecutive sentence for operating a vehicle without the owner consent he asserted that robbery when the item stolen is a car and operating a vehicle without the owner consent amount to the same offense and that punishing him cumulatively on both charges violated his right under the federal and wisconsin constitutions not to be placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense.the circuit court denied the motion,and mccloud appealed both the judgment of conviction and the denial of his postconviction motion to the wisconsin court of appeals.the appellate court affirmed in an unreported decision.state mccloud,opinion order.
recognizing that the double jeopardy clause permits multiple punishments to be imposed on a defendant in a single prosecution so long as the legislature authorized cumulative punishments,the wisconsin court of appeals examined the relevant indicia of legislative intent and concluded that the wisconsin legislature had intended to authorize separate penalties for both robbery and operating a vehicle without the owner consent.applying the same elements test of blockburger united states,the court considered first whether,as mccloud argued,these two crimes amounted to the same offense.state mccloud,op.at.more specifically,the court considered whether one could be considered a lesser included offense of the other.id.the court concluded that the answer to this inquiry was no,in that each offense required proof of an element that the other did not.operating a motor vehicle without the owner consent required proof that mccloud drove the vehicle,whereas one could rob the owner of his vehicle by towing it,hoisting it onto a truck,or pushing it into a garage rather than driving it away.id.at see.stat.robbery,on the other hand,required proof that mccloud used force and that he intended to steal the car,permanently deprive the owner of the vehicle,neither of which would be necessary in order to show that he operated the vehicle without the owner consent.mccloud,op.at see.stat.a.because,in these respects,the offenses were distinct,the presumption arises that the legislature intended for cumulative punishment for both offenses.mccloud,op.at citing state lechner.the court considered whether there were any other factors,including the language of the statutes,legislative history,the nature of the conduct proscribed,or propriety of multiple punishments,that might indicate a legislative intent not to authorize cumulative penalties.id.it concluded,however,that there were no such circumstances rebutting the presumption that multiple punishments were authorized.id.at.accordingly,the court concluded that mccloud was not twice put in jeopardy when he was consecutively sentenced for the two offenses.mccloud sought review in the wisconsin supreme court,which declined to hear his case.state mccloud,table.
having exhausted his state court remedies,mccloud sought a writ of habeas corpus from the district court.the parties consented to disposition by the magistrate judge,who denied mccloud habeas petition in an unreported decision.mccloud gamble,c,decision order.march.the court examined the elements of robbery and operating a motor vehicle without the owner consent and concluded that the wisconsin court had not unreasonably determined that neither was a lesser included offense of the other,such that the two were the same for purposes of the double jeopardy inquiry.id.at.the court subsequently granted mccloud request for a certificate of appealability.see c fed.b.
the fifth amendment double jeopardy clause,made applicable to the states via the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,benton maryland,d,provides that no person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.const.amend.v.this provision protects the criminal defendant in three ways.the first two,and most familiar,of these protections operate as a limit on the executive branch,barring the government from prosecuting the defendant a second time for an offense after he has been convicted or acquitted of that same offense.see jones thomas,d united states handford,cir.neither of these two protections is at issue here,for mccloud was not serially prosecuted.it is,instead,the third protection which is relevant,and that is the protection against multiple punishments for the same offense imposed in a single proceeding.jones,at.at quoting north carolina pearce,d,overruled in part on other grounds by alabama smith,d.
this third protection is a limited one,for the double jeopardy clause does not preclude the imposition of multiple punishments for the same offense,so long as the legislature has authorized cumulative punishment.see.at.as we noted in handford,it is the legislature and the legislature alone that has the power to define criminal offenses and to prescribe penalties for them.at.as a result,it is completely within a legislature purview to determine that the appropriate punishment for certain conduct is additional prison time,even if it has already established that a prison sentence be increased for a separate offense that includes such conduct.id.thus,in the multiple punishments context,the double jeopardy clause
