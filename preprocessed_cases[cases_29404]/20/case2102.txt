this appeal raises one crucial question whether the illinois appellate court determination that carl dixon was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel in his state court murder trial was unreasonable in light of strickland washington,d.we find that the court determination was unreasonable,and thus affirm the order of the district court granting dixon petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
in an appeal from a ruling on a petition for habeas relief,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.see denny gudmanson,cir.under the statutory framework governing habeas review,state court factual findings are presumed to be correct unless the petitioner rebuts the presumption with clear and convincing evidence.sanchez gilmore,cir,cert.denied sub nom.sanchez schomig,d e.the district court opinion provided a substantially more thorough discussion of the facts than either of the illinois appellate court opinions.compare dixon washington,wl.march,with people dixon,d,and people dixon.the district court did not determine that any of the state courts factual findings were incorrect,it simply supplemented the factual discussions in the state court opinions after a review of the trial record.as we find the district court discussion to be an accurate recitation of the facts in this case,we incorporate it here 
patrick marshall and christopher carlisle were standing next to each other on the sidewalk when a green car pulled up.a man got out and shot marshall three times with a caliber handgun.marshall attempted to run away,but only made it a half of a block before collapsing and dying 
carlisle was standing next to the body when the first police officer arrived on the scene.he told the officer that his friend had been shot by a black male who got out of a car.carlisle,however,did not identify the shooter by name.he then went to the police station at where he apparently stayed overnight and was interviewed by detectives investigating the case.sometime the next day he was interviewed by an assistant state attorney named david studenroth.after the interview,carlisle signed a statement identifying carl dixon as the black male who shot patrick marshall.specifically,the statement said that dixon got out of the green car and asked marshall,where my shit at.marshall responded,i get it to you,man,and dixon then shot marshall.
dixon was indicted for first degree murder.he hired attorney william wise hereinafter,defense counsel to defend him.many months before trial,defense counsel learned that only eyewitness against his prepared to recant the may statement he gave to the police.on january,carlisle visited defense counsel office and gave him an affidavit,in which carlisle stated that carl dixon was not the person who pulled the trigger of the gun that killed patrick marshall.
although defense counsel had a signed statement,he took the extra step of having carlisle repeat his recantation in front of a court reporter.two weeks later,on february,carlisle returned to defense counsel office and gave a statement.he again asserted that dixon was not the shooter and further explained that he only signed the statement implicating dixon because he had been held at the police station for hours and was told he could go home if he signed it.before trial,defense counsel assured his client that,because the state main witness had recanted,there was no need to prepare a defense and no need for dixon to testify.
dixon,wl,at footnote omitted.
when the trial began on october,dixon waived his right to a jury and a bench trial took place.during trial,the state focused on an incident which it believed provided the motive for the murder.ashadu mcpherson,the victim cousin,testified that on the evening of may he was with patrick marshall,dixon,and a group of other men.dixon was showing off his new black millimeter gun.when the gun was handed to marshall,he ran away with it.dixon then ran into his house and came out with a shotgun,which he put in the trunk of his car a monte carlo with a red panel,according to one witness.
dixon drove around looking for marshall for several hours,accompanied by mcpherson,charles jemison,and another man.dixon said that if he did not get his gun back he was going to have to do something to marshall.mcpherson and jemison testimony about the ride was similar in most respects but conflicted on one key point whether dixon had a caliber handgun with him the police had located caliber shell casings at the scene.mcpherson testified that,at one point in the evening,he saw dixon sitting in the driver seat with a small handgun in his lap,which mcpherson believed was either a or caliber handgun.jemison,on the other hand,had been sitting in the front seat and testified that he did not see dixon with a handgun.
the state only direct evidence that dixon killed the victim was carlisle may statement.when called by the state,carlisle testified that he did not know who had shot the victim.when specifically asked whether carl dixon was the man,carlisle invoked his fifth amendment privilege against.when the trial judge ordered him to answer the question,carlisle said that dixon was not the man who shot patrick marshall.
the state next attempted to question carlisle about the may statement that he signed at the police station.carlisle admitted that he had been at the police station and had been interviewed by assistant state attorney studenroth.when asked whether he signed the statement,carlisle again asserted his fifth amendment privilege.the trial judge allowed him to invoke it and prevented any further questioning about the statement.counsel declined to carlisle but asked that the writ of habeas corpus be carried over for the next day of trial in case he wanted to use carlisle as a rebuttal witness.
on the second day of trial,the state called studenroth,who testified that he interviewed carlisle on may and that carlisle signed and initialed each page of the three page statement studenroth had written.when the state asked about the contents of the statement,the trial judge sustained defense counsel objection and asked the state to tell him under what theory of exception to the hearsay rule you are attempting to get this hearsay document into evidence.the state indicated that it was relying on section of the illinois code of criminal procedure.
section is an illinois statute which allows prosecutors to introduce prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence rather than solely for impeachment purposes.comp.statt.passed by the illinois legislature in,section was an attempt to solve the problem of the turncoat witness,who makes a statement to the police implicating the defendant but then comes to trial and recants.dixon,wl,at.therefore,even though the eyewitness recants at trial,the fact finder may nonetheless rely on the witness earlier statement in order to convict the defendant.id.this was a substantial change from the previous illinois law,under which a prior inconsistent statement could only be used for impeachment.see,people bryant,this court has repeatedly disapproved prosecutorial efforts to impart substantive character to prior inconsistent statements under the guise of impeachment.section sets forth three foundational requirements that had to be met in order to admit carlisle prior inconsistent statement as substantive evidence the prior statement had to be inconsistent with the testimony at trial the witness had to be subject to concerning the statement and the statement had to describe an event of which the witness had personal knowledge and had to be signed by the witness.
after the state indicated that it was relying on section to admit the may statement,the trial judge asked how the statement was inconsistent with carlisle testimony.the state explained that,in court,carlisle said that dixon was not the shooter but his may statement indicated that dixon was the shooter.counsel then objected,contending that the statement should not be considered as substantive evidence.rather than arguing that one of the three statutory requirements had not been met,however,defense counsel relied upon an illinois supreme court rule that was irrelevant and a case which predated the passage of section.
the trial judge interrupted defense counsel arguments and told him that he was still going to have to deal with.counsel continued to argue that the state could not use the statement substantively because i t been the law in illinois and still is.the trial judge again rejected his arguments,none of which addressed the statutory requirements,and ruled that the statement could come into evidence.studenroth then resumed his testimony and explained that carlisle identified dixon as the man who got out of the car and shot marshall.after minor stipulations,the state rested.the defense did not recall carlisle as a rebuttal witness.instead,the defense rested without putting on any evidence.after closing arguments,the trial judge found dixon guilty of first degree murder.
defense counsel moved for a new trial.by this time,counsel apparently had been made aware of section,because he argued that the three foundational requirements for admitting a prior inconsistent statement under that section had not been met.in particular,he argued that carlisle invocation of the fifth amendment on direct rendered him unavailable for.the state responded by noting that defense counsel never even attempted to question carlisle.the trial judge denied the motion and sentenced dixon to twenty years imprisonment.
on direct appeal,but still represented by the same counsel,dixon alleged a number of errors,including that the may statement should not have been admitted as substantive evidence because carlisle was not available for.the illinois appellate court rejected this argument d efendant can not claim a lack of opportunity to carlisle when he did not even attempt to call him to the stand.people dixon,d.the court concluded that defense counsel decided not to carlisle presumably because his testimony was favorable to defendant.id.at.the appellate court also found that a s defendant had the opportunity to carlisle,his right to confront witnesses was not violated.id.at.
after exhausting his options on direct appeal dixon engaged new defense counsel.on may,dixon filed a state court petition for relief.this petition set forth the allegation now alleged in dixon habeas petition that defense counsel did not know or understand section and assumed throughout the trial that carlisle statement had no substantive force and that the state had,therefore,completely failed to make its case.dixon petition for relief at.in count i,dixon argued that defense counsel was ineffective because he did not present a defense including,inter alia,the two statements carlisle gave at defense counsel office the affidavit and the statement.in count ii,dixon argued that counsel was ineffective for not carlisle.both counts alleged that counsel acted as he did because he was not aware of section.
dixon petition was dismissed as frivolous patently without merit in a order dated june.people dixon,slip op.at cook county circuit court june.the court concluded,with respect to count i,that defense counsel could not be considered ineffective for not presenting the affidavit and statement because they were inadmissable hearsay.as to count ii,the court noted that t he inquiry into the competency of counsel will not generally extend to the exercise of judgment,discretion,trial tactics or strategy and found that defense counsel decision not to carlisle was reasonable because his testimony was favorable to defendant.id.at.
the illinois appellate court affirmed the trial court dismissal of the petition.people dixon,slip op.in addressing count i,the illinois appellate court disagreed with the trial court determination that carlisle recantations were inadmissable hearsay,finding that they could have been introduced to impeach the may statement,pursuant to section.id.slip op.at.the illinois appellate court found,however,that dixon was not prejudiced by counsel failure to present the statements because the trial court itself witnessed carlisle recant and thus these earlier recantations would not have changed the outcome of the trial.id.at.as to count ii,the appellate court first cited a series of illinois cases for the proposition that deciding whether to a witness is generally not an appropriate basis for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.id.at.it then concluded that defense counsel no doubt realized that carlisle direct testimony was extremely damaging to the state and that he would not have benefitted his client by delving into a matter that may have raised the question of carlisle credibility.id.the court reasoned that this decision was perfectly sound trial strategy and thus found no error in the trial court dismissal of count ii of the petition.id.at.on october,the illinois supreme court denied dixon petition for leave to appeal.
dixon subsequently filed a federal habeas corpus petition in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.that petition alleged that dixon was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his defense counsel ignorance of the governing law resulted in the admission of the sole piece of evidence relied upon to support dixon conviction dixon was denied the effective assistance of counsel when defense counsel ignorance of the law led him to decline to present a defense and the only possible way of justifying defense counsel actions was to conclude that carlisle may statement was,in fact,inadmissible because carlisle unavailability for confrontation had already been demonstrated.see petition for writ of habeas corpus at.the district court granted dixon petition on the first two grounds.see dixon,wl,at.respondent filed a timely notice of appeal and now asks us to reverse the grant of the petition.
ii.analysis 
our review of dixon petition for habeas corpus is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,aedpa,because dixon filed his petition for habeas relief after the effective date of that act.aedpa provides that habeas relief may be granted if a state court adjudication of a matter resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a state court decision is contrary to supreme court precedent if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at a result opposite to that reached by the supreme court.williams taylor,d an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent occurs when the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case or if the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from the court precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.id.at.see also jackson miller,cir.we review a state court decision de novo to determine whether it was contrary to supreme court precedent however,we defer to reasonable state court decisions.see ouska,cir.further,in reviewing a district court grant of a petition for habeas relief,we review the district court determinations de novo and its factual determinations for clear error.see denny gudmanson,cir.in order to issue a writ of habeas corpus,the state court decision must be both incorrect and unreasonable.washington smith,cir.
dixon petition alleges that the illinois appellate court determination that he was not deprived the effective assistance of counsel in his state court murder trial was unreasonable in light of strickland washington,d.the rule set forth in strickland is clearly established federal law,see williams,at.washington,at,and provides that a petitioner claiming the ineffective assistance of counsel must establish that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.strickland,at.dixon did not raise this claim on direct appeal,and he was not required t
