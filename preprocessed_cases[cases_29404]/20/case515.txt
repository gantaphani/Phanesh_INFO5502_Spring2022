background 
cephas conviction for narcotics trafficking and firearms possession 
on july,a federal grand jury sitting in the northern district of new york charged orville cephas,together with eleven other persons,in a count superseding indictment with violations of federal narcotics and firearms laws in connection with a drug network operating out of saratoga springs,new york.in,following a jury trial,cephas was convicted of participating in a cce,see a four substantive counts of drug distribution,see a and ten counts of using or carrying a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,see c.for these crimes,cephas was sentenced to a total of incarceration on direct appeal,this court affirmed the conviction.see united states cephas,cir.
section motion 
five years later,on november,cephas and various of his,through counsel,moved for collateral relief pursuant to,asserting,inter alia,that their convictions on multiple firearms counts,all relating to a single drug trafficking offense,were at odds with this court decision in united states lindsay,cir,and that the instructions and evidence on each firearms count were inadequate in light of the supreme court ruling in bailey united states,at,d requiring showing of active employment of a firearm to prove unlawful use under c.in a detailed memorandum decision dated october,the district court granted so much of the motion as relied on united states lindsay and,in cephas case,vacated nine of his ten firearms convictions,a ruling that did not alter his sentence.nevertheless,it denied that part of the motion relying on bailey united states,finding that any defect in the jury instruction on use of a firearm was harmless because both the instruction and the evidence were sufficient to satisfy the alternative carry prong of c.see united states pimentel,cir in so ruling,the court specifically declined to consider a claim that the trial evidence was insufficient to establish that a firearm was carried during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime,because the relationship element of c had not been affected by bailey so as to excuse defendants failure to raise this argument on direct appeal.
defendants thereafter moved in the district court for reconsideration as well as a certificate of appealability,both of which were denied on february.defendants were equally unsuccessful in moving in this court for a certificate of appealability or an order of remand in light of the supreme court intervening decision in muscarello united states,at holding that carry prong of c was not limited to the carrying of weapons directly on one person but could include knowing possession and conveyance in a vehicle.see cephas united states,cir.
application to file a second motion 
in the interim,cephas also filed a pro se application with this court seeking leave to file a second motion,see b,in light of the supreme court decisions in muscarello and richardson united states,at.holding that jury must unanimously agree as to the specific violations of the drug laws that make up the continuing series element of a crime.the application was summarily denied because cephas proposed motion was not based on either newly discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court.cephas united states,cir.nevertheless,the court noted that its order was entered without prejudice to cephas filing a petition under c in light of the ruling in triestman united states.id.
section petition 
on may,cephas filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the northern district of new york asserting that in light of bailey and muscarello,he was actually innocent of the c count of conviction because the trial evidence failed to establish that the handgun at issue was carried during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime and in light of richardson,he was actually innocent of the cce conviction because the jury had not been required to agree unanimously on the specific drug violations that established the requisite continuing series.a few months later,counsel entered a notice of appearance on cephas behalf and filed a memorandum of law supporting these claims.
the magistrate judge to whom the case was referred concluded preliminarily that because cephas claimed actual innocence,he could pursue his collateral challenge under in light of triestman and,accordingly,set a schedule for the government response.the government moved for dismissal on the grounds that cephas petition was in fact an impermissible successive motion.
a second magistrate judge,to whom the case was reassigned,agreed that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant cephas relief and recommended dismissal.while acknowledging that triestman permitted prisoners claiming actual innocence to file challenges to their convictions and sentence if afforded inadequate or ineffective relief,the magistrate judge concluded that cephas did not fit into this narrow category for the simple reason that his bailey claim had been rejected on his first motion and his muscarello claim had been considered by this court when it rejected his motion to file a second motion in recommending dismissal for lack of jurisdiction,the magistrate judge did not address petitioner richardson claim.
neither did cephas allude to his richardson claim in objections filed by counsel to the magistrate judge report.instead,he asserted simply that no court had ruled on the merits of his muscarello claim.further,because the first magistrate judge assigned to cephas case had concluded that petitioner could pursue his collateral challenge pursuant to,cephas submitted that the second magistrate judge was obliged to rule on the merits of his petition.the district court was unconvinced and dismissed cephas petition for lack of jurisdiction,adopting the reasons recommended by the magistrate judge.
ii.discussion 
dismissal of a habeas corpus petition 
title provides that a federal court presented with a petition for a writ of habeas corpus shall forthwith award the writ or issue an order directing the respondent to show cause why the writ should not be granted,unless it appears from the application that the applicant or person detained is not entitled thereto.implicit in this directive is the power to dismiss a habeas petition when it is patently apparent that the court lacks jurisdiction to grant the relief demanded.see also rule b of the rules governing section proceedings providing for summary dismissal of challenges to federal convictions i f it plainly appears from the face of the motion and any annexed exhibits and the prior proceedings in the case that the movant is not entitled to relief in the district court rule of the rules governing section cases providing for summary dismissal of challenges to state convictions.
we review de novo a district court decision to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction a habeas petition filed pursuant to.see cyr,cir,aff,d accord wang ashcroft,cir kuhali reno,cir.
section jurisdiction 
the judiciary act of,ch,stat,conferred jurisdiction upon federal courts to issue writs of habeas corpus to prisoners in the custody of the united states.see mccleskey zant,d united states hayman.that grant of jurisdiction is presently codified at,which permits federal courts to entertain habeas corpus petitions from federal prisoners in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.see jiminian nash,cir triestman united states,at.with the enactment of,however,congress restricted the exercise of jurisdiction,see triestman united states,at describing effect of in restricting the rights of federal prisoners to proceed under,such that federal prisoners challenging the legality of their convictions or sentences must proceed by way of motion pursuant to,with petitions generally reserved for challenges to the execution of a federal prisoner sentence,jiminian nash,at emphasis in original accord roccisano menifee,cir.
nevertheless,as we recognized in triestman,at the same time that restricts jurisdiction,it explicitly recognizes an important exception to the general rule that a federal prisoner must use instead of when challenging the legality of a conviction or sentence.see at.specifically,provides 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section,shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief,by motion,to the court which sentenced him,or that such court has denied him relief,unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.
emphasis added.in triestman,we observed that the highlighted savings clause in may well serve to displace that statute limitation on federal collateral review in circumstances where such a limitation might encounter constitutional challenge.see at.
the net result of this statutory scheme is to limit federal jurisdiction to hear habeas claims based on the invalidity of a federal conviction or sentence to unless a petitioner can show that a motion pursuant to that section is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.if such a showing can be made,federal courts retain jurisdiction to hear the habeas petition pursuant to.but if the necessary showing can not be made,can not be invoked,and the district court must either dismiss the habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction or recast it as a motion 
in triestman,this court considered the meaning of the term inadequate and ineffective in the savings clause of and determined that it referred to those cases in which the petitioner can not,for whatever reason,utilize,and in which the failure to allow for collateral review would raise serious constitutional questions.triestman united states,at.we predicted that the types of cases raising such serious constitutional questions would be relatively few,id.at,and to date we have recognized only one cases involving prisoners who can prove actual innocence on the existing record,and could not have effectively raised their claim s of innocence at an earlier time.id.at 
cephas attempt to invoke jurisdiction 
cephas insists that he fits within the savings clause exception of and,therefore,can petition for habeas relief pursuant to because this court has denied him leave to file a successive motion,he is actually innocent of two counts of his conviction in light of the supreme court decisions in muscarello and richardson,and he could not have raised his innocence claim on direct appeal or in his first motion because neither muscarello nor richardson had then been decided.cephas first refusal to allow him to raise his muscarello and richardson claims in a second undisputed.equally apparent from the record,however,is cephas patent inability to establish his last two points.were there any question in this regard,it would have been inappropriate for the district court to dismiss cephas habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction.see generally triestman united states,at holding that is available to test the legality of a conviction where prisoner may in fact be innocent of the crime of conviction and has had no prior effective opportunity to raise his claim.but where,as in cephas case,petitioner invokes jurisdiction to raise claims that clearly could have been pursued earlier,or where his asserted innocence is plainly belied by the record,then the savings clause of is not triggered and dismissal of the petition for lack of jurisdiction is warranted.
the c conviction 
cephas claims that he is actually innocent of violating c because the trial evidence failed to prove that his confederate carried a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.cephas could have raised this claim on direct appeal and did raise it on his motion,both long before the supreme court decision in muscarello.
indeed,cephas misapprehends the import of muscarello.in that case the supreme court focus was on the phrase carries a firearm and on the question of whether its use in c referred only to individuals who carried firearms on their persons.in rejecting such a narrow interpretation,see muscarello united states,at,the supreme court reviewed the statute legislative history,observing,among other things,that a broad interpretation of the word carry did not equate to a prohibition on all firearm possession because the during and in relation to requirement of c was intended in part to prevent prosecution where guns played no part in the crime,id.at.
this last statement,which cephas emphasizes,was hardly a new insight.the need to prove a relationship between the predicate crime and the use or carrying of a firearm to convict a defendant pursuant to c was well established at the time of cephas conviction.in united states,cir,this court cited to the same legislative history as the supreme court in muscarello and concluded that the during and in relation to requirement of c 
requires more than mere possession of a firearm.rather,there must be some relation or connection between the firearm and the underlying crime.the necessary relation or connection is established if from the circumstances or otherwise it could be found that the defendant intended to use the gun if a contingency arose or to make his escape.
id.at emphasis omitted quoting,at,reprinted in,further demonstrating that the relationship requirement was well established at the time of cephas conviction is the fact that the district judge who presided at cephas criminal trial repeatedly instructed the jury on the prosecution burden to prove this element beyond a reasonable doubt.had cephas thought the evidence insufficient to establish this element,he could certainly have pressed this point on direct appeal 
it was precisely because cephas had inexcusably failed to raise such a challenge on direct appeal that the district court correctly refused to entertain the claim when,five years after conviction,cephas moved for relief.see bousley united states,d holding that defendant who fails to raise a claim on direct appeal can not pursue it in a habeas petition unless he demonstrates either cause for the default and ensuing prejudice for the default or actual innocence,the latter meaning factual innocence,not mere legal insufficiency accord underwood united states,cir.the fact that cephas procedural default of an available c claim thereafter barred him from raising the issue in a motion can not,without more,demonstrate that is an inadequate or ineffective remedy so as to trigger jurisdiction.see jiminian nash,at holding that where prisoner is procedurally barred from using to raise a claim that was previously available o
