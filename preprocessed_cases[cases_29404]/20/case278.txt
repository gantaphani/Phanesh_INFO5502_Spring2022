asserting that the prosecution failed to divulge the full extent of special favors showered upon its star witness,gerald mastracchio,a state prisoner,unsuccessfully sought a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of rhode island.the petitioner now appeals that court order of dismissal.although the state court did err in three respects and the petitioner arguments are ably presented,we nonetheless find that these errors are not of a magnitude that would warrant federal habeas relief.we therefore affirm the order of dismissal.
background 
our factual account derives primarily from the copious records of prior court proceedings.readers who hunger for additional facts should consult the trio of earlier opinions authored by the rhode island supreme court.see state mastracchio,rejecting most grounds of petitioner direct appeal but remanding for determination anent family court waiver of jurisdiction,aff after remand,mastracchio moran,rejecting petitioner application for relief.
on december,the lifeless body of richard valente washed ashore on a beach bordering narragansett bay.an autopsy revealed that valente had been badly beaten,but that drowning caused his death.the autopsy further revealed that a plastic plate had been inserted into his head some time prior to his demise.
a few weeks earlier the police had caught valente engaging in petty larceny,and he had laid blame on the petitioner then age seventeen.armed with this knowledge and with a witness who had seen the petitioner in valente company several days before the body surfaced,the police launched an investigation.when the investigating officers were unable to tie the petitioner to the slaying,the investigation stalled.
while these events were transpiring,peter gilbert,a career criminal,was incarcerated in florida.he escaped in and eventually telephoned the petitioner father,gelardo mastracchio gelardo.gelardo,a notorious organized crime figure,invited gilbert to return home and partake of various illicit enterprises.gilbert accepted this invitation and surreptitiously repaired to rhode island.he remained in gelardo employ until the authorities arrested him in february of.sensing that gelardo had a hand in his capture,gilbert agreed to assist the authorities.
gilbert cooperation proved fruitful,shedding light on numerous unsolved crimes.of particular interest here,he told the state police that the petitioner had bragged about killing a friend by beating him,transporting him to the jamestown bridge,and throwing him over while still alive.although gilbert did not know the victim identity,he quoted the petitioner as saying i that he had committed the murder to prevent his victim from talking to the authorities,and ii that his victim had never been the same since he had a plastic plate inserted into his skull following an automobile accident.this testimony filled the gaps in the dormant investigation,and a state grand jury soon indicted the petitioner for valente murder.
gilbert remained in the protective custody of the providence police department from and after the time that he began to warble.during his debriefing,he implicated james broccoli and lawrence mastrofine in the robbery of a liquor store.shortly before their trial,he testified in a voir dire hearing regarding the promises,rewards,and inducements given to him in exchange for his cooperation.the testimony revealed a variety of benefits received by gilbert including payment of personal expenses averaging per month,a stay with his family during the holidays,conjugal visits at a local motel,to fifty excursions to restaurants,easy access to alcohol throughout the course of his custody,and unlimited telephone privileges.
gilbert was vigorously by defense counsel about these matters and about the conditions of his confinement.he was less than forthcoming.a representative sampling of the follows 
q.you pay for that food 
yes.someone goes shopping and gets groceries.
q.you give them the money 
i do give them the money,the attorney general office gives them the money.
q.you sure that comes out of the fifteen or eighteen hundred 
i do see the money.when i need groceries the money is made available to buy groceries.
have you been provided with any types of rules and regulations,either verbally or in writing,concerning your conditions of confinement while in the custody of the providence police,things you can do and things you can not do 
a.what i can do is pretty much limited.i locked up.i got cell bars in the window.doors that are locked.i confined to a area.that my exercise.i do have no exercise yards.
all you do is just live from day to day and week to week and month to month and you get your food and clothing,you get your haircuts and glasses,and then someone tells you that is costing them between fifteen hundred and eighteen hundred dollars a month is that fair to say 
besides the thirty dollars a week that you given by welfare do you receive any other cash from either the providence police or the attorney general department for spending money 
is that what you told the attorney general,you do have an sic drug problem 
no.i used cocaine when i was on the street,but i have no drug problem.i took care of it myself within my own mind and body.i no longer dependent or need any of that stuff.i have had it for months.
did you take any trips or have you taken any trips while you have been in the custody of the providence police 
yeah i went to florida.i went to florida to go to court.
q.in addition,to florida and maine has there been any other 
no.all i can remember is going to florida twice and maine once.
the voir dire hearing took place on january.the petitioner trial began approximately two months later.gilbert testimony was essential to the prosecution case he,and he alone,placed the petitioner at the murder scene.the petitioner trial counsel,dale anderson,was fully apprised of what had transpired at the voir dire hearing,and the prosecutor anticipated a attack on gilbert credibility.he attempted to blunt the force of this attack by delineating,in his case in chief,the range of benefits that gilbert had received.to that end,the following exchange occurred during gilbert direct examination.
of the fifteen to eighteen hundred dollars you get per month,do you see any of that cash,physically,yourself 
no,i do get it.whatever bills are incurred are paid from that.
would you explain the circumstances of your custody at this time 
my family is kept in a sic undisclosed location in protective custody.myself,i in a lockup situation,in the custody of the providence police department.i have a guard,seven days a week.
and describe the facility that you in 
i live in what could be described as a cellblock area.bars on the window,there are three locked doors,successive locked doors,with a sic armed guard,and i have no access to the outside world or anything like that.
as expected,anderson mounted a vigorous challenge to gilbert credibility.in,he relied heavily on the voir dire transcript.anderson asked gilbert about the conditions of his confinement,his checkered past a sorry record that included murder,armed robbery,fraud,and burglary,and his penchant for prevarication.anderson also inquired about gilbert affinity for narcotics,but gilbert denied having used drugs since his arrest two years earlier.
on march,the jury found the petitioner guilty of valente murder.he was sentenced to life imprisonment.in contrast,gilbert received what amounted to a incarcerative sentence,a nominal sentence,with forty years suspended for his myriad offenses,to be served in the protective custody of the providence police department.
on june,gilbert was still serving his sentence.on that date,he died from a heart attack that occurred while he was driving unaccompanied to a skydiving lesson.because of the exotic purpose of the sojourn,the absence of any police escort,and the presence of cocaine in the vehicle,this incident touched off a furor concerning the nature of gilbert confinement.a spate of investigations revealed that gilbert jailers had permitted him to take extraordinary liberties both before and after the petitioner trial.many of these special favors had not been disclosed to the petitioner,including,inter alia,the receipt of sums of cash over the course of the six months immediately preceding the petitioner trial,regular access to marijuana,free passage through the corridors of the police station including use of the halls for and access to the roof,use of a municipal courtroom for exercise,travel to florida to see his family on two additional undisclosed occasions use of the state attorney general office as a reference on a loan application,and the aforementioned skydiving lessons.
spurred by these revelations,the petitioner filed an application for relief in the state superior court.see laws.following a lengthy evidentiary hearing,the hearing justice found that the state did not fully and accurately disclose either the conditions of gilbert confinement or the nature of the payments made to him.the hearing justice imputed knowledge of these omissions to the prosecution because the underlying facts were reasonably well known to the witness protection team,the officers in charge of peter gilbert during his detention,who were in fairly regular communication with the prosecutor.concluding that this undisclosed information was material,the hearing justice vacated the conviction and ordered a new trial.
the petitioner victory proved.on appeal,the state supreme court reinstated the conviction.it concluded that defense counsel had sufficient opportunity to learn the true facts,mastracchio moran,at and that,in all events,the prosecution was innocent of any wrongdoing and negligence in not informing defense counsel of the peculiar nature of gilbert custodial arrangements,id.at.as an alternative ground of decision,the court concluded that gilbert detailed testimony concerning valente murder would not have been in the slightest way affected or impeached by the additional evidence.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court described the newly emergent information as merely cumulative and impeaching,id.at,such that its existence did not undermine confidence in the verdict,id.at.
the united states supreme court refused to review this decision,see,d,and the petitioner ventured to the federal district court in search of habeas relief.the matter was referred to a magistrate judge,see.b,who recommended denial of the petition.see mastrachhio vose,wl,unpublished.the district court subsequently adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation.this appeal followed.
ii.the habeas standard 
we review this appeal under the standards imposed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,and in particular by that portion of the aedpa codified at d.this statute permits federal courts to issue a writ of habeas corpus at the behest of a state prisoner if the underlying state adjudication 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
in applying these provisions,we do not write on a pristine page.we first addressed the aedpa standard in dubois,cir.there,we determined that this statute requires a federal habeas court first to assess whether the state court acted contrary to a legal rule prescribed by the supreme court.id.at.we held that if the state court correctly identified the controlling rule and acted in accordance with it or,alternatively,if no controlling rule exists,the federal court then proceeds to determine whether the state court use of or failure to use existing law in deciding the petitioner claim involved an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.id.
in a later case,the supreme court spoke authoritatively to the same general set of questions.see williams taylor,d.in williams matesanz,cir,we noted that and taylor were fully consistent.we then synthesized these precedents,explaining that section d creates two classes of covered cases the first category embraces cases in which a state court decision directly contravenes supreme court precedent,and the second embraces cases in which a state court decision,although not contrary to relevant supreme court precedent,nonetheless constitutes an unreasonable application of relevant supreme court precedent.id.we added that a state court decision would be contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent if that decision applies a rule that contradicts a rule clearly articulated by the supreme court or if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from an earlier supreme court decision,yet arrives at a result that differs from that precedent.id.at citing taylor,at.thus,
the key inquiry is whether a supreme court virtue of its factual similarity though not necessarily identicality or its distillation of general federal law precepts into a channeled mode of analysis specifically intended for application to variant factual fairly be said to require a particular result in a particular case.
in respect to the second prong of the model established by section d,we explained that federal habeas relief may lie in favor of a state prisoner when a state court correctly identifies the applicable federal rule but applies it in an unreasonable manner to the facts of a particular case.matesanz,at.we then added 
this reduces to a question of whether the state court derivation of a rule from the court generally relevant jurisprudence appears objectively reasonable t he mere fact that some judges might find a particular outcome unreasonable does not warrant relief.nor does the existence of error,in and of itself there is,for this purpose,an important distinction between unreasonable applications and incorrect applications.
id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.refined to bare essence,a state court decision is objectively unreasonable only if it falls outside the universe of plausible,credible outcomes.id.quoting,at.
federal habeas review of a state court factual findings is similarly constrained.a habeas petitioner can overcome such findings only by demonstrating that they were based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.of course,these words must be interpreted in light of twin congressional directives that a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct,and that an applicant for a writ of habeas corpus shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e.under this regime,a federal habeas court ordinarily refrains from revisiting credibility determinations as it would be wholly inappropriate for a federal court to repastinate soil already thoroughly plowed and delve into the veracity of the witnesses on habeas review.sanna dipaolo,cir.a habeas petitioner therefore must clear a high hurdle before a federal court will set aside any of the state court factual findings.
iii.analysis 
within the aedpa framework,the petitioner asserts three general claims of error.first,he asseverates that the state supreme court unreasonably concluded that his defense counsel knew or should have known of the cash payments and the conditions of confinement.second,he maintains that the court erred when it refused to impute knowledge of these facts to the prosecutor.third,he faults the court for deeming the undisclosed evidence immaterial to the jury assessment of gilbert credibility.
a.the lack of full disclosure.
we will assume without extended analysis that the petitioner prevails on the first of these asseveration that the entire gamut of the special favors afforded to gilbert was not fully revealed to the defense prior to trial.while anderson had knowledge from the voir dire of many of these benefices,to fifty jaunts to fancy restaurants,the occasional presence of alcohol in gilbert cell,a prolonged visit by gilbert with his family,it seems fairly clear that the state did not provide complete information about either the dazzling array of liberties that gilbert enjoyed or the range of perquisites that he received.the state supreme court acknowledged the lack of disclosure to some extent,see mastracchio moran,at agreeing that certain details of gilbert confinement were not revealed until after gilbert testimony at the petitioner trial,but nonetheless found that the petitioner had sufficient overall knowledge of the largesse extended to gilbert.to justify this conclusion,the court pointed to the disclosures made before trial including the contents of the voir dire transcript and a ledger sheet reflecting monies given to gilbert.id.at.
there is,however,a wealth of information pointing in the opposite direction,much of it unearthed during the several investigations that followed gilbert death.taken in the aggregate,we think that this evidence shows beyond hope of contradiction that gilbert was treated more favorably than the defense was led to believe.
we need not belabor the point.certainly,gilbert guarded responses at the voir dire hearing hinted broadly at an unorthodox relationship with his jailers,but those responses,fairly read,did not illuminate the full range of benefits that he received from the state.to the contrary,gilbert perjured himself when he denied receiving large sums of cash,see infra part iii b,and he minimized the liberties available to him at every turn.the ledger sheet alluded to by the state supreme court did not bridge these gaps.it antedated gilbert trial by more than a gilbert apparently pocketed the largest sums of cash during that intervening period.in all events,the ledger sheet was little more than a series of scribbled numbers listed under two columns paid and unpaid the petitioner or his trial counsel,for that matter would have had to possess delphic powers to divine from those hieroglyphics the purport that the state now ascribes to them.the short of it is that notwithstanding the high degree of deference that section d demands,the record in this case virtually compels the conclusion that the state supreme court unreasonably determined that the prosecution,in the course of the pretrial proceedings,had adequately disclosed the favors conferred upon gilbert.the evidence to that effect is clear and convincing.
that said,the question remains whether this error was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant habeas relief.that question must be answered in the negative unless i the nondisclosure was imputable to the prosecution,ii the withheld information was favorable to the petitioner,and iii the information was material.in the pages that follow,we examine these points.
b.the failure to impute knowledge.
the petitioner second claim of error hinges on the premise that the state supreme court wrongly determined that the prosecution bore no responsibility for any failure to disclose.this claim turns on a line of cases that trace their roots to napue illinois,d.the state supreme court found napue and its progeny inapplicable here because this was not a 
factual situation wherein the prosecutor could be found to have been negligent in failing to discover and make known,for example,gilbert skydiving antics during confinement.what we do have instead is simply a factual situation where,as the hearing justice found,the prosecution was innocent of any wrongdoing and negligence in not informing or being able to inform defense counsel of the several facts concerning gilbert custodial confinement that came to public attention shortly after gilbert unexpected death.
mastracchio moran,at.the petitioner assails this finding,arguing that it depends on too myopic a view of both the law and the record.concluding,as we do,that knowledge of information beneficial to the defendant should be imputed to the prosecutor whenever such knowledge is possessed by a representative of the prosecution,we detect error.
to begin,the state supreme court appears to have misread the findings of the lower court.even though the hearing justice found that the providence police officers had not suborned,instigated or encouraged peter gilbert to withhold evidence,he also found that members of the witness protection team were keenly aware of the more exotic features of gilbert confinement mindful of the intense involvement of the attorney general department in gilbert protective custody,we conclude,as did the hearing justice,that the providence police officers who comprised the witness protection team must be treated as an integral part of the prosecution team for the purpose of determining whether a failure to disclose occurred.see united states wilson,cir,cert.denied,d.
as a legal matter,the supreme court precedent on this issue is clear.when any member of the prosecution team has information in his possession that is favorable to the defense,that information is imputable to the prosecutor.see kyles whitley,d explaining that the individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government behalf in the case,including the police see also giglio united states,d holding that whether nondisclosure results from negligence or design,the prosecutor is responsible.
giglio illustrates this point in the context of a prosecutor negligent use of perjured testimony.there,an assistant to the prosecutor secretly promised a witness that he would avoid prosecution if he testified on the state behalf,but did not reveal the clandestine promise to the prosecutor.giglio,at.at trial,the witness denied the existence of any such promise,and the prosecuting attorney did not correct the testimony.the supreme court made short shrift of the argument that the perjured testimony should be overlooked because the prosecuting attorney himself did not know of its falsity and was,at most,negligent in failing to discover the truth.a promise made by one attorney must be attributed,for these purposes,to the government.id.at.
so too kyles,in which the court rebuffed the state argument that an individual prosecutor could not be held accountable for evidence known only to investigators 
n o one doubts that police investigators sometimes fail to inform a prosecutor of all they know.but neither is there any serious doubt that procedures and regulations can be established to carry the prosecutor burden and to insure communication of all relevant information on each case to every lawyer who deals with it.since,then,the prosecutor has the means to discharge the government disclosure responsibility if he will,any argument for excusing a prosecutor from disclosing what he does not happen to know about boils down to a plea to substitute the police for the prosecutor,and even for the courts themselves,as the final arbiters of the government obligation to ensure fair trials.
at.citations and internal punctuation omitted.imputing the investigator knowledge to the prosecutor,the court reasoned,will tend to preserve the criminal trial,as distinct from the prosecutor private deliberations,as the chosen forum for ascertaining the truth about criminal accusations.id.at.
for purposes of the instant case,these supreme court precedents make manifest that the knowledge of other members of the attorney general department and of the witness protection team must be imputed to the prosecuting attorney.having placed gilbert on the stand to testify on behalf of the state,the prosecutor had a duty to learn of all the inducements and rewards that the state had tendered.that means that he was chargeable with knowledge that the attorney general department had funneled significant amounts of cash to gilbert in the months immediately preceding the trial that the department had served as a reference for him in connection with the purchase of a new car and that gilbert,while incarcerated,had enjoyed sybaritic treatment above and beyond what had been disclosed to the defense,two unreported trips to florida,skydiving lessons,and free passage throughout the providence police station.we therefore hold that the state supreme court refusal to impute the police officers knowledge to the prosecutor runs contrary to established supreme court case law.
c.the materiality of the undisclosed evidence.
having enlarged the dimensions of the withheld information to include what was known to members of the witness protection team,we turn next to whether that corpus of withheld information was material 
it is that the prosecution failure to disclose favorable information to the defense constitutes a violation of the defendant constitutional rights only if,and to the extent that,it deprives the defendant of a fundamentally fair trial.see united states bagley,d giglio,at.to scale this barrier,the defendant must show that the undisclosed information was material to guilt or to punishment.see brady maryland,d.
the level of materiality at which nondisclosure effects a constitutional error depends upon whether the prosecution failure to disclose additional exculpatory or impeaching evidence is simply that,or,alternatively,results from the prosecution knowing use of false testimony or evidence.we limned this dichotomy in gilday callahan,cir.there,we made clear that when the prosecution simply fails to disclose evidence that is favorable to the accused,such evidence is deemed material only if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at citation omitted.for ease in reference,we shall call this the brady standard.see brady,at.
a different,more standard of materiality attaches when a prosecutor has knowingly used perjured testimony or,equivalently,has knowingly failed to disclose the information that would give the lie to perjurious testimony.see united states agurs,d giglio,at.when that occurs,a conviction is fundamentally unfair,and must be set aside,if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.gilday,at.for ease in reference,we shall call this more lenient standard of materiality the agurs standard.
here,the state supreme court used the brady standard across the board,requiring the petitioner to show that there would be a significant chance that the use and development of the posttrial discovered evidence would have produced a reasonable doubt in the minds of enough jurors to avoid a conviction.mastracchio moran,at.in this venue,the petitioner asseverates that the court should have applied the more rigorous agurs standard to the entire body of undisclosed evidence or,in the alternative,that it unreasonably applied the brady standard.
in order to determine who has the better of the argument,we must assess the reasonableness of the state supreme court determination that even though gilbert testimony might have been somewhat misleading,it did not amount to perjury.id.the court made this determination based upon its conclusion that although gilbert did not go out of his way to explain all the minute details of his custodial confinement while at the providence police station,he did in fact answer directly the questions as posed to him by defense counsel.id.in so concluding,the court relied heavily on bronston united states,d,for the proposition that literally true but unresponsive answers do not constitute perjury.
to test the soundness of this determination,we must examine what gilbert was asked,how he responded,the literal truth of his answers,and what if any falsehoods were known to the prosecution but unknown to the defense.we reiterate that we may set aside the judgment of the supreme court on this matter only if its determination fell outside the universe of plausible,credible outcomes.matesanz,at quoting,at.
we undertake this inquiry in considerable detail since the prosecution knowing use of perjury,if material,is incompatible with the rudimentary demands of justice.giglio,at.indeed,a finding of condoned perjury demands the application of a more lenient standard of materiality not simply because the knowing use of false testimony involves a prosecutorial peccadillo,but,more importantly because it involve s a corruption of the function of the trial process.agurs,at.
upon perscrutation,one of gilbert statements at trial quite obviously crosses the line.the prosecutor,referring to the disclosed fact that the state had regularly reimbursed gilbert for certain expenses,asked him point blank do you handle any of the cash,physically,yourself gilbert replied no,i do get it.but the disclosures revealed that gilbert was given a total of in cash in the six months leading up to the trial.clearly,then,this answer was false,and knowledge of its falsity was imputable to the prosecutor since members of the attorney general department the witness protection team actually delivered the cash to gilbert.that leaves the question of whether this condoned perjury was material in the requisite sense,and,thus,rose to the level of constitutional error.we shall return to that question shortly.
first,however,we deal with the remainder of the undisclosed evidence.in regard to those instances of nondisclosure,the state supreme court determined that they were not occasioned by the prosecutor reliance on perjurious testimony,known by him to be false yet undisclosed to the defense.inasmuch as the record supports that determination the court did not act contrary to the pertinent supreme court precedents when it concluded that those instances of nondisclosure that is,everything except the failure to disclose the manifest falsity of gilbert categorical denial that he had received cash warranted employment of the brady standard rather than the agurs standard 
we are also persuaded that the state supreme court did not unreasonably apply brady when it opined,as an alternative holding,that the nondisclosure of this evidence would not have in any circumstance created a reasonable probability that the jury verdict would have been any different.mastracchio moran,at.to support this holding,the court cited the powerful evidence buttressing gilbert testimony,id.at,and noted that his story remained consistent both before and after he received treatment from the state,id.at.
this conclusion withstands scrutiny.although gilbert was the sole witness who placed the petitioner at the scene of the crime,his testimony relating to the petitioner confession was fully corroborated by other evidence.for example,gilbert described the victim as still alive when he was thrown into the the medical examiner evidence confirmed this fact.similarly,gilbert tied the incident to the jamestown span in close physical proximity to the place where the body washed ashore.gilbert also recalled that the victim had a plastic plate in his head,and the autopsy revealed that such a plate had been surgically inserted into valente skull at some time before the beating.gilbert said that the victim had been the petitioner friend valente fit this description.finally,gilbert had been in florida from to and was unlikely to have heard such details from anyone who was not privy to the crime.this chain of similarities,forged by one who would otherwise have little opportunity to acquire this knowledge,strongly supports the conclusion that the jury probably would have believed gilbert even if the additional details of his confinement were fully exposed.
furthermore,gilbert,even without the withheld information,was a sullied witness.the petitioner trial counsel had a great deal of adverse information at his disposal,and he fiercely attacked gilbert credibility at the attack that included the sordid details of gilbert prior drug use,his extensive criminal record,and his previous lies under oath.gilbert credibility was significantly impeached by reason of this sustained the jury nevertheless believed his account of the petitioner boasting.
that ends this aspect of the matter.although we might well have concluded differently on direct review,we are confident that the state supreme court reached a plausible and credible outcome on the basis of the record.consequently,we are not at liberty to disturb that outcome.see taylor,at.holding that an erroneous,but not unreasonable,application of supreme court precedent will not justify habeas relief matesanz,at same.
d.the materiality of the perjury.
we now return to the prosecution knowing use of gilbert false testimony about the cash payments.since the agur
