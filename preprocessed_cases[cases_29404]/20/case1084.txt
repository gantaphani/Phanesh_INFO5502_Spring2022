background 
in june,following a jury trial in louisiana state court,kelly geiger was found guilty of second degree murder he was thereafter sentenced to life in prison.the facts underlying his conviction,as adduced at trial,are as follows.
on october,geiger and five acquaintances,jason gross,gerard gross,lester panter,sarah lenard,and clifford gaines,were gathered under the governor nicholls street wharf in new orleans,louisiana,socializing and drinking whiskey.at geiger trial,jason gross gross testified that at some point during the,geiger,gross and panter walked to the french quarter to purchase more alcohol.on their walk back to the wharf,the three encountered a woman,hereafter referred to as the victim,who,after some conversation,agreed to accompany geiger,gross and panter back to the wharf.
upon returning to the wharf,the group gathered upon a large concrete slab and continued drinking.gross eventually passed out from inebriation.gross testified that he was awakened by the sound of geiger and panter beating the victim with a stick.thereafter,geiger and panter tossed the victim off the concrete slab,then followed her down and began kicking her.geiger then allegedly demanded gross participation,at which time gross complied by disposing of the victim clothes in the nearby river.next,geiger and panter,according to gross,crushed the victim head with large boulders,apparently to ensure her death.the two then threw her body into the river.shortly thereafter,geiger suggested to the others in the of whom were asleep during the they leave the scene because they had just killed a girl.
while leaving the wharf premises the group encountered michael carmouche,a new orleans police officer,who issued all six in the group citations for trespassing.officer carmouche did not at the time realize what had transpired moments prior to his arrival.
sometime after officer carmouche sent the group on its way,lenard left the group,found a police officer and reported the killing.gross was later questioned by police and eventually charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder,a charge the state later dropped when gross agreed to testify against geiger.
among the state eight witnesses at geiger trial were jason gross officer ryan maher,the police officer to whom lenard reported the killing and officer carmouche.importantly,although she reported the crime to the police,lenard did not testify at trial she did not answer the subpoena mandating her appearance.as the district court noted in its opinion and order granting geiger petition,gross was the only witness able to identify geiger as the victim killer.no defense evidence was presented.
a jury found geiger guilty of second degree murder.on july,geiger was sentenced to life imprisonment.on july,the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal denied geiger direct appeal.on november,geiger filed a motion for relief in state district court,which was denied.the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal denied geiger request for a supervisory writ on february.the louisiana supreme court did the same on january.
geiger next filed his habeas corpus petition in federal district court on march,asserting four grounds for relief.first,geiger claimed that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain his conviction.second,geiger claimed his indictment was constitutionally defective.third,he claimed that the prosecutor made inappropriate remarks throughout his trial that were so prejudicial as to render his trial fundamentally unfair.specifically,geiger argued that the state insinuated several times before the jury that,had it been able to secure sarah lenard testimony,that testimony would have corroborated that of the state key witness,jason gross.fourth,geiger claimed he was denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of his sixth amendment rights because his trial counsel failed to move for a mistrial based on the prosecution allegedly inappropriate remarks,and because counsel failed to request an instruction directing the jury to consider the uncorroborated accomplice testimony of gross with caution.
the district court concluded that geiger exhausted his state remedies by presenting his claims to the appropriate louisiana courts,and that his federal petition was timely.it then granted geiger habeas relief on prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance grounds.
ii.discussion 
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,a federal court may not grant habeas relief on any ground previously disposed of on the merits by a state court unless the state decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established f ederal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the s tate court proceeding.d.the aedpa mandates a high degree of deference to state court rulings on both pure questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact.see generally hill johnson,cir.further,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and review its conclusions of law de novo,applying the same standard of review to the state court decision as the district court.beazley johnson,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
a.the prosecutor allegedly improper remarks 
the district court found that geiger was entitled to habeas relief based on remarks made by the prosecutor during trial remarks the district court concluded were so prejudicial as to render geiger trial fundamentally unfair.during voir dire,the following exchange took place before the jury 
prosecutor i do want to talk to you about lay witnesses.jason gross is the state only eyewitness that we have access to.he about 
defense i going to object.i think we getting a little bit into the facts of the case more than is proper in voir dire.
court ah,as to that one comment,i would overrule the objection,note the objection for the defense.
during opening argument,the following occurred 
prosecutor let me tell you what you going to hear.you going to hear that on october around,someone named jason gross,whom you will hear from,and someone named sarah lenard,whom you will not hear from because i ca get my hands on her 
defense objection,your honor.this is completely 
court i could hear what you said.please,i apologize.because i could not what 
prosecutor cause i ca get my hands on her.cause i ca produce her.it a fact.
court you you intending to present evidence that you can not reach her 
prosecutor oh,yes.
court then i would overrule that as to what the lady intends to offer.
defense based on the fact 
court i not saying that correct or not.
the following occurred during closing argument 
prosecutor do i wish i had sarah lenard to corroborate jason gross account of what happened you better believe i do.did i take the necessary actions against her you better believe i have.
defense i going to object to this.arguing 
court yeah,i would sustain that on the representation that she would corroborate.i not here to say that she would or would.
the district court concluded that these remarks warranted habeas relief because they jeopardized geiger right to be tried solely on the evidence presented at trial,which amounted to prejudicial error.according to the district court,the prosecutor inappropriately suggested that lenard would have corroborated gross testimony,which is significant given that gross was the only state witness able to identify geiger as a perpetrator.
pursuant to the aedpa,our task is to determine de novo whether the district court was correct in finding that the state court treatment of geiger prosecutorial misconduct claim was contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court.see d.under this standard,we will affirm the district court only if the prosecutor remarks so infected the tr
