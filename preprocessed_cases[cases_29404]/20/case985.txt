james edward reid appeals a district court order denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,see west supp,in which he challenged his conviction and death sentence for the murder of annie lester for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the rejection of reid claims by the district court.
lester body was discovered on october.she had been brutally murdered an autopsy revealed that lester had suffered stab wounds.lester had also been beaten about her head with a blunt instrument,and a bone in her throat had been crushed by strangulation or being struck with a hard object.a trail of blood led from lester kitchen to her bedroom,where her body was found.lester clothing was in disarray,and the room had been ransacked.a bottle of wine was found on the floor at the foot of the bed.
substantial evidence connected reid to the murder.reid was acquainted with lester and had received an automobile ride to her house in the of the day of the murder on the way,he purchased a bottle of wine.late in the afternoon,reid was observed walking from the direction of lester house,drunk and covered in blood.the blood on reid clothing was later determined to be consistent with lester dna.reid fingerprints were found in blood on the telephone in lester bedroom,his saliva was found on a cigarette butt left in the room,and his handwriting was found on pieces of paper in the house.
reid,who claimed to have no memory of lester murder,subsequently entered an alford plea to one count each of capital murder,attempted rape,and attempted robbery.see north carolina alford,d holding that a defendant may plead guilty even if he is unwilling or unable to admit his participation in the acts constituting the crime.after a sentencing hearing,the trial judge imposed the death penalty,finding that the murder satisfied the vileness predicate of virginia law.see ann.michie permitting imposition of the death penalty if the court determines that the defendant conduct in committing the murder was outrageously or wantonly vile,horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture,depravity of mind or an aggravated battery to the victim.
on direct appeal,reid claimed that the trial court failed to consider uncontradicted mitigating evidence in reaching its sentencing determination.the virginia supreme court characterized this argument as a complaint that the trial court must not have considered reid mitigating evidence since the court imposed the death penalty and rejected it,concluding that the trial court did,in fact,consider reid mitigating evidence.reid commonwealth.the united states supreme court thereafter denied reid petition for a writ of certiorari.see reid virginia,d.
reid subsequently sought habeas relief in the virginia supreme court,contending,as is relevant here,that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary and that counsel were constitutionally ineffective for advising him to enter an alford plea.the virginia supreme court denied relief,ruling that the first claim was defaulted and that the second was without merit.
reid filed this federal habeas petition on november,claiming that counsel were constitutionally deficient for advising him to enter an alford plea,that his alford plea was not knowing and voluntary,and that the trial court failed to consider mitigating evidence.the district court denied reid motions for discovery and to expand the record but conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine what reid trial counsel told him about the effect of his alford pleas and reid understanding about the effect of his alford pleas.following the hearing,the district court denied the petition,concluding that reid claims regarding counsel ineffectiveness and the voluntariness of his plea were without merit and that reid claim regarding consideration of mitigating evidence by the trial court was procedurally defaulted.
under the provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,an individual can not appeal a denial of collateral relief without first obtaining a certificate of appealability coa.see generally c west supp.a coa may issue only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right and must specify the issue or issues as to which the coa has been granted.id.c see id.c.
prior to oral argument,we granted a coa as to all issues.thus,the question of whether to issue a coa in this case is no longer before us.we nevertheless take this opportunity to explain procedures we have recently adopted for deciding when to certify issues for appeal in collateral review cases.these procedures were initially found in standing order,which this court adopted on may.on july,this order became new local rule a.a copy of the new rule is appended to this opinion.
provisions of the new rule 
local rule a divides appeals in collateral review cases into three categories.the first category includes all cases in which the appellant expressly requests a expansion of a coa,if the district court has already certified some issues for this court enters its briefing order.in such cases,the court will review the request and a grant a coa and direct the parties to file briefs addressing the issues certified for review or b deny a coa and either dismiss the the district court did not grant a direct the parties to file briefs regarding the issues certified by the district court if the district court granted a coa see cir.a a,a.
the second category consists of cases in which the district court did not issue a coa and the appellant has not explicitly requested one from this court.in such cases,the notice of appeal will be treated as a request for a coa.see fed.b.to guide its inquiry into whether to grant a coa,the court will enter a preliminary briefing order directing the appellant to file a brief addressing the merits of the claims the appellant wishes to raise.the court will then review that brief and determine whether to grant a coa as to any of the issues raised in the brief.upon determining that the appellant has made the showing required by c as to any issue,the court will grant a coa as to that issue and enter a final briefing order directing the parties to complete the briefing process.if the appellant fails to make the required showing,the court will deny a coa and dismiss the appeal.see cir.a b.
the third category created by the new rule includes cases in which the district court granted a coa as to some issues and,as of the time for entering a briefing order,the appellant has not requested that the coa be expanded by this court.in such cases,the court will enter a standard briefing order directing the parties to brief the issues certified for review by the district court.the appellant may raise additional claims in his opening brief,but the court will not consider them unless the appellant files a separate statement noting that the brief contains claims beyond the scope of the coa issued by the district court.the statement need not be elaborate or contain any reasoning its sole purpose is to notify this court of the appellant desire to expand the coa.upon receipt of such a statement,the court will stay further briefing and decide whether to expand the coa.once the court makes its decision,it will lift the stay and allow the parties to complete the briefing process as to all issues certified for review by either this court or the district court.see cir.a b.
regardless of the category into which a case falls,matters concerning the grant or expansion of a coa will be referred to a panel.see cir.a.the panel will review the request to determine whether the appellant has made the showing required by c but will not consider the ultimate question of whether the claim has merit.if any member of the panel determines that the appellant has made the requisite showing as to any issue,the court will grant a coa as to that issue.see id.
finally,the rule authorizes the court to request additional materials from any party.see cir.a.the rule is silent on the question of whether the court may accept unsolicited materials in light of this silence,we conclude that the rule neither expands nor impairs the discretion that the panel would otherwise possess.
reasons for adopting the new rule 
the primary impetus for the adoption of rule a was the recent decision of the supreme court in cockrell.the petitioner in was a state prisoner seeking relief under.see id.at.the district court denied the prisoner application and denied a coa,see,and the court of appeals likewise denied a coa,stating that the state court adjudication neither resulted in a decision that was unreasonable in light of the evidence presented nor resulted in a decision contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court,id.quoting johnson,cir.the supreme court reversed,concluding that the court of appeals improperly conducted a full inquiry into the merits before deciding whether to grant a coa.see id.at.the court held that c permits only a general assessment of the merits of the claims in a habeas petition and admonished that w hen a court of appeals side steps this process by first deciding the merits of an appeal,and then justifying its denial of a coa based on its adjudication of the actual merits,it is in essence deciding an appeal without jurisdiction.id.at.
prior to,we did not have a mechanism for separating the coa determination from the decision on the merits,and it was our custom to undertake both inquiries simultaneously,after the case was fully briefed.this practice did not prejudice appellants on the contrary,it is likely that we afforded full review in many appeals that should have been dismissed for failure to satisfy the threshold requirements of c.nonetheless,the practice was not in strict compliance with the statute.see in re fowlkes,cir.
the new local rule brings our practice into conformity with c.under the rule,we will conduct the coa inquiry before completing the briefing process and deciding the case on its merits.this remains true even though,in cases falling into the second and third categories described above,our decision respecting a coa will be informed by our review of the appellant brief on the merits,rather than a separate request for a coa.in examining these briefs at the coa stage,we will not engage in full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.at,but will instead conduct the cursory review necessary to identify those appeals deserving of attention while dismissing claims that plainly do not deserve further review,id.at.
this procedure advances the goals of the aedpa more effectively than either requiring a separate request for a coa or acting without any request other than the notice of appeal.the purpose of the aedpa was to reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences,particularly in capital cases.woodford garceau,d.requiring a separate request for a coa before ordering briefing would add delay to habeas litigation.moreover,such delays would not be offset by the benefit of clearer guidance for our coa inquiry in our experience,few appellants file separate requests for a coa,and those who do generally rely on their briefs with little or no embellishment and,while we could examine the record ourselves without any indication of what claims the appellant desires to present to us,doing so would add to our own burdens and would not give effect to the requirement that the applicant make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c emphasis added.for these reasons,we have adopted the rule described above,which allows us to use a single document as both the appellant request for a coa and the appellant brief on the merits,even as we maintain a clear distinction between the coa and merits phases of the appeal.
we first consider reid claim that his alford plea was invalid due to the ineffectiveness of defense counsel.reid maintains that counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and advise reid concerning a defense of voluntary intoxication failing to investigate and advise reid regarding a defense of insanity and failing to advise reid concerning the nature and consequences of an alford plea.
in order to establish that his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel was violated,reid must make a twofold showing.see wiggins smith,d.first,he must demonstrate that his attorneys representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.strickland washington,d.judicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential,and every effort must be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight and to evaluate the challenged conduct from counsel perspective at the time.id.at.
reid must also demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his attorneys ineffectiveness,that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.in the context of a guilty plea,a demonstration of prejudice requires reid to establish that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel errors,he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.hill lockhart,d.in hill,the supreme court explained that this prejudice inquiry is quite similar to the inquiry for prejudice under strickland,in that the question of whether counsel ineffectiveness prejudiced a petitioner guilty plea will often turn on an assessment of the likelihood of success of a particular investigation or strategy.see id.at.
standard of review 
because this claim was adjudicated on the merits by the virginia supreme court,our review is limited to determining whether the decision of that court was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.d as is particularly relevant here,a state court decision is contrary to supreme court precedent in either of two situations when the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court cases,or when the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from the court precedent.williams taylor williams ii,d.
reid maintains that the decision of the virginia supreme court on his ineffective assistance claim was contrary to supreme court precedent because it must be presumed that the state court applied its ruling in williams warden williams i.in williams i,the virginia supreme court held that a habeas petitioner can not prevail on an ineffective assistance claim simply by making the showing required under strickland rather,the court held that the petitioner must additionally demonstrate that the result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable.williams i,at quoting lockhart fretwell,d.the supreme court subsequently declared that this standard was contrary to the clearly established law of strickland.see williams ii,at.id.at.opinion of,t he virginia supreme court decision was contrary to clearly established federal law to the extent it held that our decision in lockhart somehow modified or supplanted the rule set forth in strickland.
as noted above,the virginia supreme court rejected reid ineffective assistance claim summarily,without providing any reasoning for the decision.reid maintains that because this decision was made after the virginia supreme court decided williams i,but before the united states supreme court decided williams ii,it must be presumed that the state court applied an incorrect standard.
it is not at all clear that this is a tenable assumption.during the interim between williams i and williams ii,the virginia supreme court decided at least two published opinions regarding claims of ineffective assistance without referring to lockhart.see moore hinkle,see also curo becker,not mentioning lockhart when setting forth standard for ineffective assistance claim.but see pender angelone,citing lockhart for the proposition that t he strickland prejudice analysis includes a focus on whether the result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable internal quotation marks omitted.
in any event,reid position can not be squared with the way this court applies the d standard when the state court has not articulated the rationale for its decision.in such cases,we conduct an independent examination of the record and the clearly established supreme court law,but we must still confine our review to whether the court determination resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law bell jarvis,cir en banc citations internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,when the state court does not articulate a rationale for its decision,our analysis focuses solely on the result reached,and application of the contrary to prong is necessarily limited to determining whether the state court decision is contrary to a decision reached by the supreme court on indistinguishable facts.early packer,d holding that failure to cite federal law does not mean that state court decision was contrary to established federal law state court need not even be aware of supreme court precedents,so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the decision contradicts them.reid does not contend that the state court rejection of his ineffective assistance claim is contrary to supreme court precedent in this way.accordingly,we turn to the question of whether the denial of relief by the state court on this claim is consistent with a reasonable application of supreme court precedent.
voluntary intoxication 
reid first contends that counsel failed to adequately investigate,consider,and advise him concerning a defense of voluntary intoxication.under virginia law,voluntary intoxication does not excuse any crime.see wright commonwealth.however,when a person voluntarily becomes so intoxicated that he is incapable of deliberation or premeditation,he can not commit a class of murder that requires proof of a deliberate and premeditated killing.id.in determining whether the evidence supports a voluntary intoxication defense,virginia courts look to the defendant behavior before and after the offense.see,giarratano commonwealth.relevant behaviors include attempts to conceal the crime,see id.at noting that defendant killed second person in order to conceal first murder a lapse of time between ingestion of intoxicants and the crime,see hedrick warden,whether the conduct of the defendant was planned and purposeful,and whether the defendant was able to engage in complex behaviors such as operating an automobile,see lilly commonwealth,rev on other grounds,d.
reid correctly points out that some of these factors support a claim of voluntary intoxication in his case.for example,reid consumption of alcohol was contemporaneous with the crime.according to reid recollection of events,while visiting with lester he periodically went outside to smoke,and while outside he drank from the bottle of wine he purchased on the way to lester home.and,the bottle was found near lester body.additionally,reid made no attempt to conceal the fact that he had been involved in some kind of violent incident.he emerged from lester house covered in blood,staggering and obviously drunk he approached george eanes and eanes father who were complete strangers to him,and asked for a ride to his house.such behavior arguably indicates that reid was so intoxicated as to be unaware of what had happened in lester home,a finding that would,in turn,support a determination that reid had been too drunk to premeditate or act deliberately 
two experts who examined reid and who later testified during the sentencing phase provided reports to counsel indicating that reid may have been too intoxicated to form the necessary intent to commit premeditated murder.doctor pogos voskanian concluded that reid history of brain injury combined with various other ailments suffered by reid and exacerbated by an acutely intoxicated state,is likely to have a devastating effect on one judgment,appreciation of reality,ability to resist impulses,ability to form rational decisions and perform intentional acts.more specifically,voskanian asserted that reid functioning and ability to act intentionally at the time of the alleged offense were markedly impaired and that reid capacity to form an intent for a criminal act was substantially compromised.id.at.doctor stephen herrick reached a similar conclusion,stating that reid behavior following the crime would suggest he did not understand the nature,character,or consequences of the alleged offense and that i n general the description of his behavior suggests extreme cognitive impairment.id.at.
on the other hand,there is strong evidence that reid was capable of planned and purposeful conduct.forensic evidence indicated that reid first bludgeoned lester with a milk can in the kitchen.he then dragged her to the bedroom,where he stabbed her with a pair of sewing scissors which he apparently obtained from the living room and strangled her with the cord of a heating pad.reid selection of three different weapons indicates a capacity for coherent,deliberative thought that is inconsistent with a voluntary intoxication defense.also,reid wrote i got ta kill you on a card while he was in lester house.internal quotation marks omitted.reid apparently told the probation officer who wrote his presentence report that his last memory from lester house was of writing something on the card 
according to affidavits submitted by trial counsel,several strategic considerations played into the decision not to pursue a voluntary intoxication defense.first,counsel experience indicated to them that a jury would not be receptive to such a defense.and,after consultation with others experienced in capital litigation,counsel determined that reid should avoid a jury if at all possible because,given the facts of the crime,a jury was likely not to be favorable to reid.since the prosecutor indicated that he would refuse to waive a jury trial if reid pleaded not guilty,the only way to accomplish this goal was to enter some form of guilty plea.and,the judge to whom reid case was assigned had previously imposed a life sentence in a capital murder prosecution that involved facts that were,in counsel view,more egregious than those here.
in short,the evidence to support a voluntary intoxication defense was,at best,conflicting,and sound strategic considerations weighed against presenting such a defense.in view of these circumstances,it was not unreasonable for the virginia supreme court to conclude that counsel were not ineffective for advising against a defense of voluntary intoxication.
reid next contends that counsel failed to adequately investigate and advise him regarding an insanity defense.virginia law recognizes two tests by which an accused can establish criminal insanity,the rule and the irresistible impulse doctrine.bennett commonwealth.in either case,the defendant bears the burden of proving that he was insane at the time of the offense.see vann commonwealth.when the corpus delicti has been established and proof adduced that the accused committed the act,it is not sufficient for the accused to raise a reasonable doubt as to his sanity he must go one step further and prove to the satisfaction of the jury that he was insane at the time of the commission of the act.wessells commonwealth.
the rule requires the defendant to prove that,because of a disease of the mind,he either did not know the nature and quality of his act or did not know that the act was wrong.see price commonwealth,see also id.at noting that the actual test for insanity,stated in the disjunctive,is the rule in virginia emphasis added.as the virginia supreme court explained in price,
the first portion of relates to an accused who is psychotic to an extreme degree.it assumes an accused who,because of mental disease,did not know the nature and quality of his act he simply did not know what he was doing.for example,in crushing the skull of a human being with an iron bar,he believed that he was smashing a glass jar.the latter portion of relates to an accused who knew the nature and quality of his act.he knew what he was doing he knew that he was crushing the skull of a human being with an iron bar.however,because of mental disease,he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.he believed,for example,that he was carrying out a command from god.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the irresistible impulse defense is available when the accused mind has become so impaired by disease that he is totally deprived of the mental power to control or restrain his act.bennett,at internal quotation marks omitted.impulsivity is the essence of this definition of insanity planning or deliberative conduct is inconsistent with the defense.see vann,at.
reid argues that the reports of herrick and voskanian should have alerted counsel to the viability of an insanity defense.we disagree.it is true,as reid notes,that both doctors concluded that reid suffered from a mental defect in the form of brain damage stemming from the automobile accident and ensuing coma in and the seizure disorder.however,neither doctor reached conclusions that would support a finding of insanity under the rule or the irresistible impulse test.in fact,herrick concluded that,while reid behavior following the crime suggested he did not understand the nature,character,or consequences of the alleged offense,reid inability to remember the offense and the lack of an eyewitness resulted in insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that reid was legally insane at the time of the murder.to state br.at.likewise,neither doctor concluded that reid had totally lost the ability to control his actions,as required by the irresistible impulse test.they merely opined that his ability to do so was impaired.while such impairment is a mitigating factor for sentencing,it does not establish the existence of insanity under virginia law.
nature of an alford plea 
finally,reid contends that counsel were constitutionally ineffective for failing to ensure that he understood the nature of an alford plea the district court held a hearing on this portion of the ineffective assistance claim.during the hearing,reid testified that trial counsel urged him to make the alford plea,telling him that the worst sentence he could receive under such a plea would be life without parole and that he might even be eligible for geriatric parole.reid further asserted that counsel failed to explain to him that an alford plea was a guilty plea and that counsel told him he would be ineligible for the death penalty under such a plea.this testimony was contradicted by one of reid attorneys who testified that he and his explained the nature of an alford plea to reid and members of his family 
the attorney testimony was corroborated by a letter written by the attorney and signed by reid shortly before his plea.in pertinent part,the letter stated 
we have advised you that you have a right to enter a plea of not guilty,guilty,no contest or enter an alford plea y ou understand by pleading guilty,no contest or alford plea you may lose significant rights to appeal and your right to a jury trial 
we have all fully discussed how to proceed with this case and we have advised you we believe it is best to enter an alford plea wherein you do not admit guilt but concede the commonwealth has enough evidence against you for a conviction.
we are therefore going to enter an alford plea and present evidence on your behalf in mitigation of the offenses to hopefully avoid a death sentence.
to state br.moreover,during his plea colloquy reid informed the judge that he understood the charges against him and his plea options and that he had decided for him self to enter an alford plea.id.at.reid also responded affirmatively to the question of whether he understood that he could receive the death penalty.
based on the foregoing evidence,the district court found that reid counsel had adequately explained to him the nature of an alford plea and its consequences,and the court discredited reid contrary testimony.these findings are not clearly erroneous.and,in light of these findings,this aspect of reid challenge to counsel effectiveness must fail.
reid next contends that because he did not understand what an alford plea was or that he could face the death penalty under such a plea,his plea was not knowing and voluntary.reid faults the trial court for failing to inquire adequately into whether reid understood the charges against him and for not assessing the impact of reid mental deficiencies on his competence to plead guilty.reid presented this claim for the first time in his state habeas petition,and the virginia supreme court concluded that the claim was defaulted under the rule of slayton parrigan,holding that claims not properly raised on direct appeal will not be considered as a basis for collateral relief.
absent cause and prejudice or a miscarriage of justice,a federal habeas court may not review a constitutional claim when a state court has declined to consider its merits on the basis of an adequate and independent state procedural rule.see harris reed,d.reid maintains that slayton is not an adequate state procedural rule,and thus can not serve as a basis for a procedural default.alternatively,reid argues that he has established cause and prejudice or a miscarriage of justice,such that the default must be excused and the merits of his claim considered.
adequacy of slayton 
a state procedural rule is adequate if it is consistently or regularly applied.see johnson mississippi,d.consistent or regular application of a state rule of procedural default does not mean undeviating adherence to such rule admitting of no exception.meadows legursky,cir en banc.rather,despite some deviations,a general rule that ha s been applied in the vast majority of cases must be considered adequate.plath moore,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in assessing whether a state has consistently applied a procedural rule,we consider only those instances in which the state advanced the procedural rule as a basis for a decision adverse to the petitioner,because we can not say that a state court inconsistently applied a procedural rule that was not presented for its consideration.see meadows,at.furthermore,we necessarily look only to the period prior to the time the defendant violated the state procedural rule decisions applying or declining to apply a state rule after that time are irrelevant in determining whether the rule was consistently applied at the critical time.see id.at.
we have previously determined that slayton is an adequate state procedural rule,see wright angelone,cir,and we are not at liberty to revisit that ruling,see etheridge norfolk ry,cir.however,the fact that a state procedural rule is adequate in general does not answer the question of whether the rule is adequate as applied in a particular case.see brown lee,cir explaining that a procedural rule is inadequate when it has not been regularly or consistently applied to a particular type of federal constitutional claim.answering that question requires us to determine whether slayton is regularly and consistently applied to claims of the type raised by reid.the relevant inquiry concerns the procedural posture of the defaulted claim the question we must ask is whether the particular procedural bar is applied consistently to cases that are procedurally,cases in which the particular claim raised could have been raised previously but was not.mccarver lee,cir.in order to demonstrate that slayton is inadequate in this particular instance,reid would need to cite a number of cases in which involuntary plea claims could have been brought on direct review but were not,and in which the collateral review court nonetheless failed to bar the claim under slayton.id.
reid offers three cases purportedly demonstrating that the slayton rule is not regularly or consistently applied in this particular context.see walton angelone,cir,cert.denied,d chapman angelone,wl cir per curiam unpublished table decision gardner warden.as reid notes,all of these cases involved claims that a guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary,and in none of them did the virginia supreme court bar the claim under slayton.nevertheless,these cases do not establish the inadequacy of slayton.in walton,the challenge to the guilty plea was defaulted on the basis of the procedural rule found in anderson warden,holding that a defendant is bound by representations made during a guilty plea absent a valid re
