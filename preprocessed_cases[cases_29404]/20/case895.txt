david appleby appleby appeals the judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of west virginia,which dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus hereinafter habeas petition pursuant to.pursuant to c,this court granted a certificate of appealability on one issue.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
appleby was indicted in september in the circuit court of ohio county,west virginia circuit court for driving under the influence of alcohol,third offense count i,in violation of west virginia code d a and k,and driving while revoked for driving under the influence,third offense count ii,in violation of west virginia code b.
appleby entered a plea of guilty to both charges.during the plea colloquy,the circuit court informed appleby that,as a consequence of his guilty plea,he could be imprisoned for a term of not less than one year nor more than three years each for count i and for count ii.the court advised appleby that the one to three year sentences for each count could run consecutively so that your sentence then would be not less then sic two nor more than six years.the court then accepted appleby guilty plea as being entered knowingly,intelligently and voluntarily,and set sentencing to take place approximately a week later.
the ohio county prosecuting attorney then filed a recidivist information,which alleged that appleby was the same person who has been five times previously convicted in the state of west virginia for crimes punishable by confinement in a penitentiary,and should be sentenced to be confined in the state correctional facility for life pursuant to the west virginia recidivist statutes,west virginia code and the west virginia recidivist statutes.the predicate offenses alleged in the recidivist information included a felony conviction of unlawful assault,in violation of west virginia code a two felony convictions of driving while revoked for driving under the influence,third offense,in violation of west virginia code b and two felony convictions of driving under the influence,third offense,in violation of west virginia code k.
before proceedings on the recidivist information began,appleby filed numerous motions with the circuit court,including a motion to dismiss contending that the offenses alleged in the information do not form a basis for the state request for a sentence of life.this motion was denied,but after obtaining new counsel,appleby filed a second motion to dismiss,alleging multiple constitutional issues.the circuit court held a hearing on the second motion to dismiss which it also denied.
appleby then petitioned the supreme court of appeals of west virginia wvsca for a writ of prohibition to prevent the recidivist proceedings from continuing or,in the alternative,to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea.appleby raised multiple constitutional and procedural issues in the petition,including s hould appleby have been given notice of the state intention to have him sentenced as a recidivist before his plea was accepted.the wvsca heard the petition on the merits,and ultimately denied relief on all issues.the wvsca held,in relevant part,that because the imposition of a life sentence is not definite,immediate and largely automatic,the recidivist proceedings are a collateral consequence of a guilty plea and thus the sentencing court need not advise a defendant about the habitual offender law before accepting a guilty plea to a predicate offense under that law.appleby recht,quoting cuthrell director,patuxent,cir,and state elliott.
proceedings on the recidivist information were then conducted in the circuit court.a jury verdict was returned finding appleby to be the same person who committed the predicate crimes alleged.a sentencing hearing was held and a life sentence,with eligibility of parole after years,was imposed in october.appleby appealed the decision to the wvsca,but the petition for appeal was denied 
appleby then timely filed the habeas petition with the district court,contending that his guilty plea was not voluntary because he did not have a full understanding of the consequences of his guilty plea,in particular,petitioner was not told at his plea hearing that he faced the possibility of a life sentence under the west virginia recidivist statute.the warden filed a motion to dismiss,which the magistrate judge recommended be granted principally because the wvsca had found that a recidivist life sentence is a collateral consequence of a plea,rather than a direct consequence citing the decision in recht.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation,and found,in relevant part,that petitioner plea was done knowingly and voluntarily because a valid guilty plea requires only that the defendant be advised as to the direct consequences of his plea,and a recidivist life sentence is a collateral consequence of a plea.the district court held the wvsca determination was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law and granted a motion to dismiss appleby habeas petition with prejudice.
appleby timely appealed the district court order denying his habeas petition.this court granted a certificate of appealability as to this issue whether appleby guilty plea was knowing and voluntary,in light of the question whether his sentence of life imprisonment was a direct or collateral consequence of his guilty plea.our review is limited only to the foregoing issue 
ii.standard of review 
the decision of a district court on a matter of habeas corpus relief is reviewed de novo and under the standards set forth in.bell ozmint,cir.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,if the issue on appeal was adjudicated in state court,as it was here,this court 
may award habeas corpus relief on a claim that was adjudicated on its merits in state court only if the adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
cummings polk,cir quoting d.
in bell cone,the supreme court held that a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court applies a rule different from the governing law set forth in our cases,or if it decides a case differently than we have done on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.a state court decision is an unreasonable application of federal law if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal principle from our decisions but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case.id.however,it is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine determinations on questions.estelle mcguire.
iii.collateral consequence 
appleby argues that his due process rights were violated because the circuit court failed to make certain that he had a full understanding of the consequences of his guilty plea.appellant br.specifically,appleby contends that he was never told that by pleading guilty that he might be subject to a sentence in excess of the indeterminate consecutive sentence of two to six years imprisonment.appellant br.in sum,appleby claims that t he decision of the wvsca that appleby had no right to have the likelihood he would have to face a life sentence as a recidivist explained to him as part of a plea of guilty is not reasonable.appellant br.
the wvsca held that the west virginia analogue to federal rule of criminal procedure does not require a trial court to advise a defendant concerning a possible recidivist enhancement.recht,at.the wvsca found further support in the recognition of the fourth circuit that the defendant need not be advised of all collateral consequences of his plea,which are those that do not result in a definite,immediate and largely automatic effect on the range of the defendant punishment.id.quoting cuthrell,at.because t he state not only retains the discretion to decide when to pursue recidivist sentencing or to decide not to so proceed,but the separate nature of the recidivist proceeding s also requires the state to satisfy a number of requirements,the wvsca held that a recidivist proceeding is a collateral,and not direct,consequence of a guilty plea.id.the wvsca concluded that appleby thus had full understanding of the direct consequences of his plea,and therefore his due process rights were not violated.the issue before us is whether the wvsca determination is contrary to or an unreasonable application of applicable federal law,as determined by the united states supreme court.
in recht,the wvsca stated that 
g uilty pleas are governed by rule of the west virginia rules of criminal procedure,which is patterned after rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.state bennett.in applying our rule,we have looked to the advisory committee note to federal rule.
recht,at.the amendments to the rule set out the requirement that,before accepting a guilty plea,a judge must determine that the defendant understands the consequences and provides a list of these consequences which includes,among other things,any maximum possible penalty and any mandatory minimum penalty.frcp b h b i.the notes to the amendments of the rule explain that 
the judge is not required to inform a defendant about additional consequences that might follow a guilty plea,including additional punishment,though a judge is free to do so if he feels a consequence of a plea of guilty in a particular case is likely to be of real significance to the defendant.
id.emphasis added.
these amendments brought the rule in line with the preexisting and longstanding principle that,before accepting a guilty plea,a trial judge must ensure that the defendant is fully aware of the relevant consequences of the plea.see,kercheval united states.however,exactly which consequences are relevant beyond the list articulated by the rule remained undefined.thus,it was clear that administration of rule require d the development of some limiting guide to define the nature of the consequences of which a defendant must be advised so that the requirements of the rule shall have been met.kenton,cir.
the supreme court has emphasized that,because a defendant who enters a guilty plea forgoes not only a fair trial,but also other accompanying constitutional guarantees,the constitution insists,among other things,that the defendant enter a guilty plea that is voluntary and that the defendant must make related waivers knowing ly,intelligently,and with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.united states ruiz,quoting brady united states.a defendant enters a guilty plea intelligently when he is advised by competent counsel,made aware of the nature of the charge against him,and there was nothing to indicate that he was incompetent or otherwise not in control of his mental faculties.brady,at.a guilty plea is voluntary if entered by one fully aware of the direct consequences of the plea.id.at emphasis added quoting shelton united states,cir en banc,rev on confession of error on other grounds.
the supreme court has neither further defined the term direct,nor has it addressed whether recidivist proceedings are a direct consequence of the plea within the meaning of brady therefore,we must decide whether the wvsca determination that the west virginia recidivist proceedings are not a direct consequence of the plea is contrary to or an unreasonable application of brady.an examination of the nature of the west virginia recidivist statutes and proceedings,supreme court commentary on recidivist statutes generally,and the federal circuit court of appeals interpretation of brady lead us to the conclusion that it was not.
in recht,the wvsca examined recidivist proceedings brought pursuant to the west virginia recidivist statutes,and concluded those proceedings are of a separate nature,and thus a collateral consequence of the plea after citing our decision in cuthrell that the distinction between direct and collateral consequences of a plea turns on whether the result represents a definite,immediate and largely automatic effect on the range of the defendant punishment,the recht court addressed the state law basis of appleby claim.
under west virginia code,the imposition of a life sentence is not definite,immediate and largely automatic.the state not only retains the discretion to decide when to pursue recidivist sentencing or to decide not to so proceed,but the separate nature of the recidivist proceeding requires the state to satisfy a number of requirements,such as filing a written information proving beyond a reasonable doubt that each penitentiary offense,including the principal penitentiary offense,was committed subsequent to each preceding conviction and sentence and proving beyond a reasonable doubt to the jury the identity of the defendant.
recht,at internal citations omitted.
moreover,west virginia code requires the recidivist information be brought before the defendant is sentenced and within the same term of court at which such person was convicted or jurisdiction to impose the recidivist sentence is lost.to the extent the issue before us involves questions of west virginia law,the determination of the wvsca is binding as to matters of interpretation of state law.estelle,at.
we agree with the wvsca determination that recidivist proceedings are of a separate nature for several reasons.first,even if a defendant has committed the requisite predicate crimes,it is not a certainty that the recidivist information will be filed.the decision to file the recidivist information is soundly left to the prosecuting attorney discretion.see also rummel estelle,it is a matter of common knowledge that prosecutors often exercise their discretion in invoking recidivist statutes.because the recidivist information is filed after the court accepts the defendant guilty plea,and because the prosecuting attorney has the discretion to decide whether to file it,the trial court can not necessarily be expected to have knowledge of the possibility.see united states cariola,cir u nsolicited advice concerning the collateral consequences of a plea which necessitates judicial clairvoyance of a superhuman kind can be neither expected nor required.
second,if the prosecuting attorney decides to file the recidivist information,it must be timely and a separate proceeding must be held and several additional elements must be proven.the fact that each predicate offense was actually committed and that the defendant is the person who committed these crimes must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.if a jury is impaneled for the recidivist proceedings,that jury is completely distinct from that of the original proceeding.see george black,cir holding that a mandatory mental health commitment proceeding is not a direct consequence of the plea because the proceedings are completely distinct from the original criminal proceedings and are conducted by a different tribunal.thus,the nature of recidivist proceedings pursuant to the west virginia recidivist statutes verifies that those proceedings are not a direct consequence of the plea because they are not definite,immediate and largely automatic.
the view that west virginia recidivist proceedings are of a separate,indirect nature is bolstered by the supreme court holdings and comments in decisions dealing with recidivist statutes.the court has,in multiple cases,noted the distinct nature of recidivism proceedings.in graham west virginia,the supreme court noted the distinct nature of the issue of recidivism and the fact that it does not relate to the commission of the offense and therefore it may be subsequently decided,see also united states.the court has consistently held that recidivism is not an element of the triggering crime,thus further emphasizing the discrete nature of the two proceedings,at t o hold that the constitution requires that recidivism be deemed an element of petitioner offense would mark an abrupt departure from a longstanding tradition.
in oyler boles,a decision also dealing with a challenge to the west virginia recidivist statutes,the supreme court held that a defendant need not receive notice of impending recidivist proceedings during the trial on the underlying triggering offense.although it does not deal with precisely the same issue at bar,oyler is instructive.the court held that the determination of whether one is an habitual criminal is essentially independent of the determination of guilt on the underlying substantive offense.oyler.although a defendant must receive reasonable notice of impending recidivism proceedings,the oyler court emphasized that due process does not require advance notice that the trial on the substantive offense will be followed by an habitual criminal proceeding.see also,at.it is clear from the oyler decision and others that the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized the separate nature of recidivist proceedings,lending support to the wvsca determination that the proceedings are not a direct consequence of a guilty plea within the meaning of brady.
the recht court appropriately referenced an opinion of retired justice souter when sitting as a new hampshire supreme court justice 
the possible significance of a guilty verdict for purposes of the habitual offender act is a classic example of a conviction consequences that is collateral in the sense that the consequence requires application of a legal provision extraneous to the definition of the criminal offense and the provisions for sentencing those convicted under it.thus,we have consistently held that a sentencing court need not advise a defendant about the habitual offender law before accepting a guilty plea to a predicate offense under that law.
recht,at quoting elliott,at.
we find further support for the wvsca decision in an examination of circuit courts of appeals almost universally identical interpretation of brady.see virsnieks smith,cir t o a very limited extent,reference to lower court holdings may be evidence of a rule mandated implicitly by the supreme court.hawkins alabama,cir.the fourth circuit and many of its sister circuits have defined the term direct used by the brady court by focusing on a dichotomy between direct and collateral consequences of a plea.see cuthrell,at see also wilson mcginnis,cir steele murphy,cir united states littlejohn,cir king button,cir united states salmon,cir george black,cir united states sambro,f d,en banc we presume that the supreme court meant what it said when it used the word direct by doing so,it excluded collateral consequences.
in defining the two terms,this court in cuthrell held that t he distinction between direct and collateral consequences of a plea,while sometimes shaded in the relevant decisions,turns on whether the result represents a definite,immediate and largely automatic effect on the range of the defendant punishment.cuthrell,at see also united states bouthot,cir.the ninth circuit noted that where the consequence is contingent upon action taken by an individual or individuals other than the sentencing court the consequence is generally collateral.littlejohn,at.courts have held that collateral consequences of a plea include deportation,united states russell,the potential loss of federal benefits,united states morse,cir the use of a conviction as an aggravating circumstance in sentence for an unrelated charge,king dutton,cir the possibility of consecutive sentences,wall united states,cir per curiam a subsequent mandatory mental health commitment proceeding,george,at and the possibility of commitment for life as a sexually dangerous person,steele,at.furthermore,several circuit courts of appeals have explicitly held that possible subsequent classification of the defendant as a recidivist if he committed a future felony is a collateral,and thus not a direct,consequence of a plea.see,united states salerno,cir salmon,at.but see berry united states,cir holding that the fact that the defendant was ineligible for parole because of his status as a recidivist was a consequence of which he must have been informed during the plea colloquy.
although these circuit court decisions do not ultimately determine whether the wvsca misapplied supreme court precedent,these prior decisions can and indeed must guide us in determining what constitutes an unreasonable application,under d,of the rule that a guilty plea must be knowing,intelligent and voluntary in order to be valid.wilson,at.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the wvsca holding that recidivist proceedings were not a direct consequence of appleby guilty plea,and thus his plea was knowing and voluntary,was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of established federal law as determined by the supreme court.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is 
david appleby pleaded guilty to two related charges after being informed by the judge that the most he could get would be six years.at sentencing the judge gave him life imprisonment.clearly established federal law requires defendants to be informed of the direct consequences of their decision to plead guilty,and the sentence for the crime to which a defendant is pleading guilty is a direct consequence of that guilty plea.i therefore believe that the decision of west virginia supreme court of appeals was contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court and that the district court denial of appleby habeas petition should be reversed.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
a criminal defendant who pleads guilty waives many constitutional rights,including his privilege against compulsory,his right to trial by jury,and his right to confront his accusers.for this waiver to be valid under the due process clause,it must be an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.mccarthy united states,footnote and internal quotation marks omitted.we may not presume a waiver to be knowing and voluntary the record must affirmatively demonstrate that the defendant had a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.boykin alabama.
the consequences of which the defendant must be aware before pleading guilty are the direct consequences of the plea.brady united states,internal quotation marks omitted.courts of appeal have generally understood boykin and brady to mean that a defendant pleading guilty must be aware of the direct consequences of the plea but need not be informed of the indirect or collateral consequences of a guilty plea.see united states sambro,per curiam we presume that the supreme court meant what it said when it used the word direct by doing so,it excluded collateral consequences.see also virsnieks smith,cir a lthough a defendant must be informed of the direct consequences flowing from a guilty plea,he need not be informed of collateral consequences.meyer branker,cir for a guilty plea to be constitutionally valid,a defendant must be made aware of all the direct,but not the collateral,consequences of his plea,cert.denied.
the supreme court has yet to catalogue all of the consequences of a guilty plea that it views as direct or indirect,but there can be no real dispute that one of the direct consequences of a guilty plea is the resulting sentence and that the constitution therefore requires that a defendant be informed of the maximum sentence that could be imposed for the crime to which he is pleading guilty.the supreme court said as much in boykin,and that has been the consistent view of the circuit courts both before and after boykin.see boykin,at if these convictions after a guilty plea are to be insulated from attack,the trial court is best advised to conduct an on the record examination of the defendant which should include,inter alia,an attempt to satisfy itself that the defendant understands the nature of the charges,his right to a jury trial,the acts sufficient to constitute the offenses for which he is charged and the permissible range of sentences.emphasis added quoting commonwealth ex rel.west rundle,burton terrell,cir t he due process clause require s that a defendant be advised and understand the consequences of a guilty plea.with respect to sentencing,this means that the defendant must know the maximum prison term and fine for the offense charged.footnot
