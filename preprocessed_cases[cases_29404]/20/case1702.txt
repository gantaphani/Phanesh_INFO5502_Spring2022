petitioner,larry donnell smith,appeals from the district court order denying petitioner application for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to.on appeal,petitioner argues that because of his trial counsel conflict of interest,a structural defect in petitioner trial occurred such that petitioner was denied his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel under the auspices of cuyler sullivan,d.
petitioner claim seeks to extend sullivan lessened standard of proof necessary for a defendant to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance counsel based on a conflict of interest involving joint representation to other types of attorney conflicts of interest.because the rule sought to be invoked by petitioner in order to succeed on his claim is a new rule that was not in effect at the time of conviction and,indeed,is still not in effect under supreme court precedent at this time,petitioner claim fails inasmuch as it is not based upon clearly established federal law for purposes of satisfying of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.d.we therefore affirm the district court denial of petitioner application for the writ,albeit for reasons other than those of the district court.
background 
petitioner,a body builder who was years old at the time,was arrested in late january of,following an allegation that he performed fellatio on a boy by force.petitioner was charged with criminal sexual conduct in violation of.comp.laws ann.b e in kent county circuit court,kent county,michigan,and with being a fourth felony offender in violation of.comp.laws ann.shortly thereafter,petitioner fired his counsel and retained attorney jeffrey balgooyen.on april,petitioner was arraigned as a fourth felony offender on the criminal sexual conduct charge,which carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
three weeks later,on may,another assistant prosecuting attorney from kent county obtained an indictment against balgooyen,charging him with one count of possession with the intent to deliver cocaine,which carried a mandatory minimum sentence of one year imprisonment,and a maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment.
on the eve of petitioner jury trial,balgooyen moved to withdraw as petitioner attorney,claiming that difficulties in establishing contact with petitioner deprived balgooyen of sufficient time to prepare his defense and to complete his financial arrangements with petitioner.the trial court denied balgooyen motion,and reminded petitioner of the prosecution earlier plea offer of assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct,for which the maximum sentence would have been ten years imprisonment,instead of life imprisonment which petitioner faced if he proceeded to trial.petitioner indicated that he continued to reject the prosecution plea offer,and that he desired to go to trial.following a jury trial,petitioner was found guilty of criminal sexual conduct on august.
about one month later,on september,balgooyen appeared in kent county circuit court,but before a judge different from the judge before whom petitioner had appeared,on the charge of intent to distribute cocaine.the prosecuting attorney assigned to balgooyen case,who was not the prosecuting attorney assigned to petitioner case,made a plea offer to reduce the charge to attempted possession with the intent to deliver cocaine.balgooyen accepted the offer,pleaded guilty to the lesser charge,and was sentenced to five months imprisonment plus probation.
prior to petitioner sentencing on october,a attorney replaced balgooyen as petitioner counsel,possibly because balgooyen license to practice law may have been suspended as of his date of conviction under michigan court rule.yet another prosecuting attorney from kent county represented the state of michigan at petitioner sentencing.petitioner pleaded guilty to being a second felony offender in exchange for the dismissal of the information charging him as being a fourth felony offender,and was sentenced to a term of to forty years imprisonment.
petitioner appealed his conviction to the michigan court of appeals raising,among other things,a claim that balgooyen pending drug charge in the same county in which petitioner was tried and convicted created a conflict of interest which denied petitioner his right to the effective assistance of counsel per se.as far as the record indicates,this was the first time that petitioner raised this issue.at the same time petitioner filed his appeal with the michigan court of appeals,he also filed a motion to remand for an evidentiary hearing in the trial court,requesting further factual development regarding his ineffective assistance of counsel claims.although petitioner alleged six claims of ineffective assistance by balgooyen for which further factual development was necessary,only one allegation involved balgooyen potential conflict of interest.and even that allegation was made in reference to petitioner allegation that balgooyen was ineffective for failing to challenge the composition of the jury pool.specifically,petitioner alleged as follows 
smith,who is black,also wishes to claim on appeal that counsel was ineffective because he failed to challenge the composition of the jury based on the underrepresentation sic of blacks.this court can take judicial notice that the of blacks on kent county circuit court juries is a subject of ongoing concern in kent county.counsel failure to raise this claim may have been the result of a conflict of interest created by a felony drug charge pending against him in the kent county circuit court.kent county circuit court.alternatively,smith wishes to claim that he was denied his federal and state constitutional right to a trial by jury because the jury members did not represent a fair of the community.see duren missouri,d.
at petitioner motion to remand.
the michigan court of appeals affirmed petitioner conviction and sentence in an unpublished per curiam opinion,opining that b ecause the judge and prosecutor involved in counsel balgooyen case were not the same as defendant,no actual conflict of interest has been shown.people smith,slip op.at.july,unpublished per curiam citing people pickens.apparently,in light of the court decision,petitioner motion to remand for an evidentiary hearing was denied.
on july,petitioner filed an application for leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court,again raising the ineffective assistance of counsel issue.leave was granted on that issue,along with an evidentiary claim,but the supreme court affirmed petitioner conviction.see people smith.the court opined in relevant part that petitioner cited no evidence to suggest that defense counsel actively lessened his defense as a result of his pending felony charge,nor do we find evidence of an actual conflict of interest on the record.to the contrary,defense counsel vigorously pursued his objections and presented a strong case.id.at.
petitioner filed the instant application for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court raising the single issue of ineffective assistance of counsel.specifically,petitioner argued that because his trial counsel was being prosecuted on a drug charge in the same county in which petitioner was being tried,a conflict of interest existed which created a structural defect,thereby denying petitioner his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of trial counsel.at petition for writ of habeas corpus.the district court referred petitioner case to a magistrate who recommended that the application be denied.in a memorandum opinion,the district court adopted the magistrate recommendation,opining in relevant part as follows 
the state court conclusion that defendant cited no evidence to suggest that defense counsel actively lessened his defense as a result of his pending felony charge is amply supported by the record.counsel conducted a vigorous defense,lodging appropriate objections to evidence,engaging in extensive and competent,and presenting testimony of defendant and two other witnesses.the michigan supreme court reasonably concluded that petitioner failed to show any adverse effect on his representation by counsel conflict of interest.
as a result,the decision of the michigan supreme court that petitioner was not denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court.
at memorandum opinion adopting report and recommendation alteration in original.the district court thereafter entered its corresponding order denying petitioner application for the writ,and it is from this order that petitioner now appeals.
discussion 
when reviewing a district court decision regarding a petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought under,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see harris stovall,cir.
aedpa standards 
aedpa provides federal habeas relief for a state court defendant if the state court decision resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,d,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.a state court adjudication is contrary to supreme court precedent under d,if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law,or if the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at a different result.williams taylor,d.a state court adjudication involves an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent under d,if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from the supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case,or if the court unreasonably refuses to extend,or unreasonably extends,existing legal principles from the court precedents to a new context.id.at.
whether petitioner was deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo.hunt mitchell,citing olden united states,cir.this court applies the unreasonable application prong of d to mixed questions of law and fact.id.citing harpster ohio,cir.the supreme court has cautioned that a federal habeas court may not overturn a state court decision simply because it concludes that a state court misapplied supreme court precedent rather,the state court application of supreme court precedent must also be unreasonable.see id.citing williams,at.
supreme court precedent as to ineffective assistance of counsel claims based upon counsel conflict of interest 
it has long been recognized that the right to counsel under the sixth amendment is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.mcmann richardson,d.in this regard,the court opined in strickland washington,d that in general,in order for a criminal defendant to prevail on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under the sixth amendment,the defendant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceedings would have been different.according to strickland,a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.see also bell cone,d without proof of both deficient performance and prejudice to the defense,under strickland it could not be said that the sentence or conviction resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that rendered the result of the proceeding unreliable,and the sentence or conviction should stand.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
however,strickland also recognized that i n certain sixth amendment contexts,prejudice is presumed.see strickland,at.citing united states cronic,d,the strickland court recognized that a ctual or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel altogether is legally presumed to result in prejudice.so are various kinds of state interference with counsel assistance.strickland,at.more specifically,in cronic,the court noted that there are circumstances that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified,and found such circumstances to include the complete denial of counsel or the denial of counsel at a critical stage of the defendant trial the failure to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing and those circumstances in which counsel is called upon to render assistance where competent counsel very likely could not,such as in powell alabama.cronic,at.
strickland further recognized that o ne type of actual ineffectiveness claim warrants a similar,though more limited,presumption of prejudice than that found in the type of circumstances described in cronic.see strickland,at.specifically,the type of ineffectiveness claim referred to by strickland in this regard was that of cuyler sullivan,wherein the court held that prejudice is presumed for purposes of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim only if the defendant demonstrates that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.strickland,at.quoting cuyler sullivan,d.
the sullivan standard grew out of the court prior recognition that when a trial court improperly requires joint representation over timely objection,ineffective assistance of counsel is presumed.holloway arkansas,d citing glasser united states.the court in holloway held that where counsel is representing multiple defendants at trial,and timely objects in open court to the joint representation but is nonetheless forced to represent the,an automatic reversal is required unless the trial court has determined that there is no conflict.id.the court reasoned that a presumption of prejudice to the defendants is proper under such circumstances because 
in a case of joint representation of conflicting interests,the evil is in what the advocate finds himself compelled to refrain from doing,not only at trial but also as to possible pretrial plea negotiations and in the sentencing process.it may be possible in some cases to identify from the record the prejudice resulting from an attorney failure to undertake certain trial tasks,but even with a record of the sentencing hearing available it would be difficult to judge intelligently the impact of a conflict on the attorney representation of a client.and to assess the impact of a conflict of interests on the attorney options,tactics,and decisions in plea negotiations would be virtually impossible.thus,an inquiry into a claim of harmless error here would require,unlike most cases,unguided speculation.
id.emphasis in original.
later,in sullivan,the supreme court declined to extend holloway automatic reversal rule to cases in which there was no objection made to the joint representation at trial.rather,the court found that i n order to establish a violation of the sixth amendment,a defendant who raised no objection at trial to joint representation must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.at.the court also noted that nothing in its precedents suggests that the sixth amendment requires state courts themselves to initiate inquiries into the propriety of multiple representation in every case.id.at.instead,a bsent special circumstances,trial courts may assume either that multiple representation entails no conflict or that the lawyer and his clients knowingly accept such risk of conflict as may exist.id.footnote omitted.the court reasoned that trial courts necessarily rely in large measure upon the good faith and good judgment of defense counsel,such that u nless the trial court knows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists,the court need not initiate an inquiry.id.footnote omitted.therefore,pursuant to sullivan,where counsel engages in joint representation and makes no objection to the joint representation,and nothing reasonably indicates to the trial court that a conflict exists,a convicted defendant raising an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must demonstrate that an actual conflict existed that affected his counsel performance.id.at.
recently,in mickens taylor,d,the supreme court had before it the question of what a defendant must show in order to demonstrate a sixth amendment violation where the trial court fails to inquire into a potential conflict of interest about which it knew or reasonably should have known.in affirming the fourth circuit en banc denial of the petitioner application for the writ brought on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel,the court opined 
since this was not a case in which as in holloway counsel protested his inability simultaneously to represent multiple defendants and since the trial court failure to make the inquiry does not reduce the petitioner burden of proof it was at least necessary,to void the conviction,for petitioner to establish that the conflict of interest adversely affected his counsel performance.the court of appeals having found no such effect,see at,the denial of habeas relief must be affirmed.
having so found,the court expressly cautioned that its holding was limited to the issue before,what burden of proof under the sullivan rule was required by a petitioner to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim when the trial court did not inquire into a potential conflict of interest of which it knew or should have known.mickens.at.the court noted that the type of conflict itself at issue in mickens was one of successive representation,not joint representation,and that the sullivan rule,although having been unblinkingly applied by the circuits to a bevy of various ethical attorney conflicts,had never been extended by the supreme court to conflicts other than joint representation at trial.id.at citing examples of various types of ethical conflicts of interests wherein the circuits have applied the sullivan rule.the court therefore emphasized that although it adjudicated the question before it,it did so under the assumption that the case properly proceeded under sullivan in the lower courts.however,the court cautioned that its decision should not be misconstrued as extending the sullivan rule to conflicts other than joint representation.id.specifically,the court emphasized that 
i n resolving this case on the grounds on which it was presented to us,we do not rule upon the need for the sullivan prophylaxis in cases of successive representation or alleged conflicts based upon anything but joint representation.whether sullivan should be extended to such cases remains,as far as the jurisprudence of this court is concerned,an open question.
id.at emphasis added.
application to petitioner case 
michigan appellate courts decisions 
the michigan court of appeals found that petitioner ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed inasmuch as the judge and prosecutor involved in counsel case were not the same as defendant therefore,no actual conflict of interest has been shown.people smith,slip op.at.july,unpublished per curiam citing people pickens.
the michigan supreme court also held that petitioner ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed,opining as follows 
defendant argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in violation of his sixth amendment rights because his attorney was charged with a felony pending in the same county.defendant asks that we presume a conflict of interest exists whenever an attorney is being prosecuted in the same county as a criminal defendant whom he represents.we decline to create such a rule and hold instead that in order to demonstrate that a conflict of interest has violated his sixth amendment rights,a defendant must establish that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.cuyler sullivan,d.
people smith,footnote omitted.the court concluded that i n this case,defendant has cited no evidence to suggest that defense counsel actively lessened his defense as a result of his pending felony charge,nor do we find evidence of an actual conflict of interest on the record.to the contrary,defense counsel vigorously pursued his objections and presented a strong case.id.at.
district court order 
the district court concluded that the michigan appellate courts did not unreasonably apply supreme court precedent to petitioner claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel alleged conflict of interest.the court held that the michigan courts properly found that in order for petitioner to succeed on his claim,he not only had to prove that a conflict existed,but that the conflict adversely affected his counsel performance under sullivan.in doing so,the district court rejected petitioner where he has shown that the conflict was actual,and not potential,prejudice is the basis that sullivan commands a showing of both actual conflict and adverse effect before prejudice will be presumed for purposes of succeeding on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.because petitioner failed to demonstrate that he was adversely effected by his counsel alleged conflict,and because the record showed no indication that a factual record could be developed to support petitioner claim,the district court denied petitioner application for the writ.
de novo review of district court order 
because the question of whether the sullivan lessened standard of proof for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based upon an attorney conflict of interest for anything other than joint representation remains an open question in the jurisprudence of the supreme court,mickens.at,and in fact was an open question at the time petitioner case was heard,petitioner claim fails because it is not based upon clearly established supreme court precedent as mandated by aedpa.
indeed,in williams taylor,d,the supreme court held that for purposes of the aedpa,whatever would qualify as an old rule under our teague lane,d jurisprudence will constitute clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states under d.pursuant to teague,a case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant conviction became final.see teague lane,d emphasis in original.in determining whether the relief requested would constitute a new rule,the question becomes whether a state court considering the defendant claim at the time his conviction became final would have felt compelled by existing precedent to conclude that the rule he seeks was required by the constitution.caspari bohlen,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted alteration in bohlen.
accordingly,applying teague principles to the matter at hand,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states means that the rule sought by petitioner the lessened standard of proof for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as set forth in cuyler sullivan be extended to conflicts of interest other than those of multiple concurrent have been dictated by sullivan.it clearly was not dictated by sullivan and,as explained by the court in mickens,the concerns which led to the sullivan standard of proof for conflicts of joint representation may not be present in situations involving other types of conflicts.see mickens.at.that is not to suggest that one ethical duty is more or less important than another.the purpose of the court holloway and sullivan exceptions from the ordinary requirements of strickland,however,is not to enforce the canons of legal ethics,but to apply needed prophylaxis in situations where strickland itself is evidently inadequate to assure vindication of the defendant sixth amendment right to counsel.id.
the fact that it was not until mickens that the court expressly stated that sullivan does not support such an expansion,and the fact that the court said so in dicta,does nothing to change the fact that the rule sought by petitioner was not clearly established federal law at the time of his conviction nor is at the current time.said differently,it is not mickens dicta that bars petitioner claim rather,it is the holding of sullivan and of holloway arkansas,d from which sullivan arose which bars petitioner case inasmuch as sullivan applied only to joint representation and the supreme court has yet to extend sullivan reach to any other type of conflict.that is not to say that the court may not do so in the future,but at the time petitioner case was heard,and indeed up until the current time,the supreme court has yet to extend sullivan.because petitioner claim does not rest upon a sullivan conflict,petitioner claim does not rest upon clearly established federal precedent.thus,the decision from the michigan appellate courts denying petitioner relief was not unreasonable for purposes of aedpa.
moreover,it would be improvident for us to follow the other circuits,or even our own decisions on direct review,which have,in the words of mickens,unblinkingly applied sullivan lessened standard to all kinds of alleged attorney conflicts.mickens.at.petitioner application is governed by aedpa,and therefore only decisions from the united states supreme court may be relied upon as authority for relief.see d williams,at.see also harris stovall,cir holding that when reviewing a petition under aedpa,clearly established federal precedent for purposes of obtaining relief is governed by decisions from the united states supreme court,and it is error for a court to rely on authority other that of the supreme court of the united states.
we therefore agree with the district court that the michigan appellate courts did not unreasonably apply supreme court precedent in denying petitioner relief under his ineffective assistance of counsel claim however,we do so based on the fact that petitioner seeks relief on a basis not supported by clearly established federal law inasmuch as the supreme court has never applied sullivan lessened standard of proof to any conflict other than joint representation.see city management chemical,cir finding that this court may affirm the district court for any reason supported by the record.as a result,petitioner request for an evidentiary hearing so as to establish whether his counsel performance was affected by the alleged conflict of interest is moot.
conclusion 
the district court order denying petitioner application for a writ of habeas corpus brought under is affirmed.
i agree with the majority that smith is not now entitled to the writ that he seeks.however,i respectfully disagree with the conclusion that his request for an evidentiary hearing in the district court is moot.
background 
because my view of the record differs in some respects from that of my colleagues,i will briefly summarize the aspects which influence my conclusion that the district court should have honored smith request for a hearing.
smith criminal case in january,larry donnell smith,a inch,gay,male bodybuilder was arrested on charges that he had threatened joel dewaard,a inch,white male who exercised at the same gym,with a pair of scissors and forced him to submit to oral sex.at the time of the alleged incident,dewaard was years old and smith was years old.smith was charged under michigan law with one felony count of first degree criminal sexual conduct and,subsequently,as a habitual offender,fourth degree.maximum punishment for conviction on these charges was life imprisonment.his case was brought and prosecuted by an assistant in the office of the prosecuting attorney of kent county.early on in the proceedings,smith fired his counsel and retained jeffrey balgooyen to conduct the defense.
balgooyen criminal case shortly after he was retained by smith,on april,balgooyen was charged under michigan law with one felony count of possession with intent to deliver cocaine.he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of one year and a maximum sentence of twenty years.his case was also brought and prosecuted by the office of the prosecuting attorney of kent county.
balgooyen motion to withdraw smith trial was scheduled to begin on august.in court that morning,balgooyen moved to withdraw as smith counsel.he claimed that difficulties in establishing contact with smith had deprived him of sufficient time to complete their financial arrangements and to prepare smith defense.he made no mention of his own pending criminal case.apparently oblivious of the fact that balgooyen was under indictment by the same prosecutor office his case was being handled by a different assistant prosecutor and was assigned to a different judge,judge dennis lieber,the kent county circuit court trial judge assigned to smith case,denied the motion.he noted that the trial had already been delayed one month due to the court own schedule and that smith had opted to replace counsel with retained counsel.he set trial to begin the following morning.
smith plea offer after denying balgooyen motion to withdraw,judge lieber reminded smith on the record that the prosecution had made a plea offer that would permit smith to plead to assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct,with a maximum sentence of ten years,instead of the life sentence which smith faced if he went to trial and lost.judge lieber engaged in the following colloquy with smith and balgooyen 
the court in the intervening time of hours,i of the opinion that smith will have to speak to balgooyen,who is to represent him by virtue of his lengthy experience.i should conclude with these remarks,too,so that i know that smith knows that you are charged,sir,with criminal sexual conduct in the first degree,as you have known from your arraignment,with the potential of life or any term of years.
also you are charged as a felony offender which,again,grants to this court the possibility of,upon conviction of the substantial criminal sexual conduct,a first degree charge,again,which includes the potential of a life sentence.that is what you going into,smith.the prosecution in this case has offered you the opportunity to plead to assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct,first degree,a felony offense is that correct 
balgooyen that correct.
the court you should know then,sir,that is a substantial difference between the maximum possible sentence of ten years and that which you are presently facing which has a maximum sentence of any term of years up to life in prison.
your attorney is best able to describe to you the impact of these two offenses in terms of time served,but it is clear to this court if you plead,your sentence will be less than a conviction of the original charge because the sentencing guidelines provide for a much lower minimum sentence for a felony offense then sic a life felony offense do you understand that 
smith yes,i do.
the court knowing and understanding that,it is you sic desire to go with the felony supplement is that correct 
the court you will have the opportunity,in my opinion,to discuss this matter in great detail with balgooyen.i wanted to make sure that you knew what was coming from the bench before we proceed to trial in the morning.
at emphasis added.the existing record does not disclose what discussions about the plea offer,if any,took place between smith and balgooyen,or between balgooyen and the prosecutor in the remaining few hours before the trial.
smith trial and verdict on august,with no further record mention of the plea offer,the trial of smith on the criminal sexual conduct indictment commenced,with the trial of the habitual offender charge to follow,if necessary.after a routine voir dire,a jury was selected.balgooyen voir dire inquired about the attitudes of individual jurors in the venire about race and sex.however,he did not question the racial composition of the venire from which the smith jury was selected or the process by which kent county assembled venires.
at the trial,the prosecution called,among others,dewaard and his mother.dewaard testified that on several occasions he met smith outside the gym for social activities,sometimes accompanied by smith regular boyfriend and roommate,joel huyser.dewaard testified that late on his last and critical evening with smith he accompanied smith to his apartment.there smith made various threats,including a bizarre proposal that they fight each other.if smith at pounds won,dewaard would submit to oral sex if dewaard at pounds won,he would not submit.dewaard testified that when he refused to accept the challenge,smith threatened but did not injure him with a pair of scissors,whereupon dewaard submitted and went home.
dewaard mother testified,over objection,that her son returned home in the early hours of the morning in question,upset and muttering to himself,and that later that morning he told her something of what had transpired the previous night between himself and smith.she then called the police.
smith took the stand in his own defense.on the night in question,according to smith,he had a conversation with dewaard about the fact that he smith was gay,that his roommate was his companion and that they had lived together for two years.he testified that dewaard became upset and smith responded by taking him home.he denied that he had ever had any physical contact with dewaard or threatened him in any way.
on august,the jury returned a verdict of guilty.still mute about his conflict,balgooyen filed no motions,such as a motion for new trial.
balgooyen plea and sentence between smith trial and sentencing,balgooyen resolved his own criminal case.on september,before a different kent county circuit court judge,he agreed to,and entered,a plea of guilty to the reduced charge of attempted possession with intent to deliver cocaine in exchange for a sentence of five months imprisonment plus probation and dismissal of the original charge with its maximum.he also ceased to represent smith,being replaced at smith sentencing by a attorney 
smith plea and sentence on october,smith pleaded guilty to being a second felony offender,admitting to a conviction for burglary in,in exchange for the dismissal of the fourth felony offender charge.judge lieber,consistent with his warning,sentenced smith,then,to a term of to forty years imprisonment.
direct appeals 
michigan court of appeals through appointed counsel smith appealed his conviction to the michigan court of appeals on the theory,among others,that balgooyen conflict of interest resulted in his being deprived of his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.brief on appeal.filed may.smith simultaneously moved to remand his case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to develop additional factual support for his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,motion to remand.filed may,as contemplated by michigan law,see people ginther,the motion asserted several examples of balgooyen allegedly deficient performance as trial counsel,including 
smith,who is black,also wishes to claim on appeal that counsel was ineffective because he failed to challenge the composition of the jury based on the underrepresentation of blacks.this court can take judicial notice that the of blacks on kent county circuit court juries is a subject of ongoing concern in kent county.counsel failure to raise this claim may have been the result of a conflict of interest created by a felony drug charge pending against him in the kent county circuit court.kent county circuit court alternatively,smith wishes to claim that he was denied his federal and state constitutional right to a trial by jury because the jury members did not represent a fair of the community.see duren missouri,d.
at.smith motion further alleged that balgooyen performance was deficient because at the time of trial counsel ability to practice law competently was materially impaired by drug and alcohol addiction material consequences from the prior active addiction behaviors.id.at.on july,the michigan court of appeals denied the motion to remand,stating only that smith had fail ed to persuade the court of the necessity of a remand at this time.people smith.july,emphasis added.
in his brief on the merits,smith argued that balgooyen concurrent prosecution created a conflict of interest so severe that smith was entitled to relief without having to prove that the conflict had any adverse effect on balgooyen representation.the state responded,in apparent disregard of smith motion for a remand for an evidentiary hearing,that on the matter of whether counsel performance was deficient and that,under an objective standard of reasonableness,counsel was not functioning as an attorney as guaranteed under the sixth amendment,citations omitted,smith did not seek an evidentiary hearing.appellee brief,at.filed.
on july,the michigan court of appeals affirmed smith conviction and sentence.nothing in the record indicated the extent,if any,to which the assistant prosecuting attorneys in the office involved in smith and balgooyen cases,or their supervisors,formally or informally exchanged information about both cases,particularly the plea bargains negotiated to dispose of them.nor was there any information in the record about whether assistants in the office customarily negotiate plea bargains with or without the approval of their supervisors,including the prosecuting attorney.nevertheless,without revisiting its earlier decision not to remand as its denial of that motion implied it might,that court disposed of smith ineffective assistance claim with the bare conclusion that,b ecause the judge and prosecutor involved in balgooyen case were not the same as defendant,no actual conflict of interest has been shown.at.having found no conflict of interest,the court of appeals did not reach the question of whether the alleged conflict had any effect on balgooyen performance.
michigan supreme court on august,smith filed an application for leave to appeal in the michigan supreme court.in his application,smith stated,smith made a motion to remand for the purpose of developing an evidentiary record to support his claim that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel.application for leave to appeal at vi,people smith filed.the application continued,t he denial of the motion was clearly erroneous because it denied smith the opportunity to make an evidentiary record necessary to support his claim that he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel.id.citing people ginther.smith attached to his application a copy of the remand motion which he had filed in the lower appellate court.in a footnote in his application,smith stated,s hould this court find that a showing of a specific prejudice is required,the appropriate remedy would be to remand this case to the trial court for the purpose of holding an evidentiary hearing at which smith will have the opportunity to show specific prejudice.id.at.as its opposition to smith application,the state submitted the identical brief it had filed in the michigan court of appeals,complete with the inaccurate representation that smith had never requested a hearing.answer in opposition to application for leave to appeal,people smith,attachment,at filed.
the michigan supreme court granted smith application for leave to appeal with respect to two issues,one of which was whether the defendant was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel where,at the time of the trial,his attorney had been charged with a criminal offense in the same county.people smith.on march,the michigan supreme court affirmed smith conviction and sentence.see people smith.the court stated that smith cited no evidence to suggest that defense counsel actively lessened his defense as a result of his pending felony charge,nor do we find evidence of an actual conflict of interest on the record.without mention of either jury selection or plea negotiation,and focusing entirely on the record of the trial before the impaneled jury,the court continued t o the contrary,defense counsel vigorously pursued his objections and presented a strong case.id.at.the court,without reference to smith motion to the michigan court of appeals for a remand for purposes of a ginther hearing,stated inexplicably,i f a convicted defendant believes that his attorney representation was below an objective standard of reasonableness,the appropriate procedure is to seek a ginther hearing.id.citing people ginther.
collateral attack 
federal district court on december,smith filed a petition in federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus,pursuant to.the petition asserted that balgooyen conflict of interest entitled smith to a new trial.
on september,a magistrate judge to whom the district court referred the matter stated,a n actual conflict of interest is obvious from the fact that defense counsel had criminal charges pending against him in kent county at the time of petitioner trial in the kent county circuit court.the actual conflict is reinforced by the fact that defense counsel pled guilty to a reduced charge just a month after petitioner trial.at.he concluded,under the circumstances,defense counsel had every reason to maintain good relations with the prosecutor office during petitioner trial.id.at.however,without reference to jury selection,judge lieber admonition about the pretrial plea offer,or the difference between the offer and the ultimate to sentence,the magistrate judge expressed his opinion that smith had failed to show that this conflict adversely affected balgooyen performance,and thus recommended that his petition be denied.smith objected to the magistrate report and recommendation.
in his objections to the magistrate judge recommendation,smith stated that he should be entitled to an evidentiary hearing to develop a record in support of his ineffective assistance claim.he asserted that he did everything in his power to demonstrate individualized instances of prejudice on appeal.at.he attached his earlier motion to remand filed in the michigan court of appeals see supra which he characterized as raising specific points of prejudice justifying a hearing.at.he concluded,i t would be inherently unfair and a denial of due process to dismiss this petition for failure to prove prejudice after smith was unfairly prevented from doing so.this court has the ability to order an evidentiary hearing on this aspect and at a minimum should order such a hearing in this case.id.
on january,the district court,adopting the magistrate judge recommendation,denied smith petition.regarding smith objection that he should be entitled to a hearing,the district court stated that smith fails to identify what facts he would attempt to prove at an evidentiary hearing that would support his claim of adverse effect.id.at.the court noted that in his requests for a hearing,smith identified specific alleged failings of counsel at trial,but it stated that such errors are subject to review on the trial record,and do not require a separate evidentiary hearing.id.based on its own review of the trial record,the district court found that the state court conclusion that defendant cited no evidence to suggest that defense counsel actively lessened his defense as a result of his pending felony charge is amply supported by the record.id.at.the court continued,c ounsel conducted a vigorous defense,lodging appropriate objections to evidence,engaging in extensive and competent,and presenting testimony of defendant and two other witnesses.the michigan supreme court reasonably concluded that petitioner failed to show any adverse effect on his representation caused by counsel conflict of interest.id.the district court also made no reference either to balgooyen role in jury selection or the rejected plea bargain and denied smith petition.
ii.discussion 
i agree with the majority that the supreme court has clearly established that,at a minimum,a federal habeas court must grant a writ to a state court petitioner who over his protest and without further inquiry,was represented by counsel who also represented another defendant in that case,holloway arkansas,d fails to object to dual representation,but demonstrates that it created an actual conflict that adversely affected counsel performance,cuyler sullivan,d or demonstrates that,but for his counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceedings would have been different,strickland washington,d.i also agree that smith has not yet satisfied these formulae as they have been recently construed.see mickens taylor,d 
however,as stated,i disagree,with the ruling that smith request for an evidentiary hearing is moot.supreme court decisions clearly established long ago that a person charged with crime requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.see powell alabama.emphasis added,and that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel,see mcmann richardson,d.it is also clear that the right to effective assistance of counsel applies at the plea stage of the proceedings.hill lockhart,d.e ven when there is a bona fide defense,counsel may still advise his client to plead guilty if that advice falls within the range of reasonable competence under the circumstances.see united states cronic,d citing tollett henderson,d.finally,highly relevant to the circumstances here,supreme court decisions teach that an indispensable element of the effective performance of defense counsel responsibilities is the ability to act independently of the government and to oppose it in adversary litigation.ferri ackerman,d.
effective assistance of counsel and conflicts of interest 
a supreme court majority has established a clear framework for evaluating the effectiveness of counsel where one lawyer represents more than one defendant in a criminal case.see holloway arkansas,at.cuyler sullivan,at.see also strickland washington,at.mickens taylor.at see also majority op.at for thorough summary of facts and precise holdings of these cases.my colleagues here apply that supreme court precedent quite literally to the unique facts before us,concluding that the only clear and relevant supreme court law establishes that conflicts of interest arising out of joint representation,the precise conflict at issue in cuyler,trigger analysis and relief.
obviously,cuyler is clearly established and relevant supreme court law.but it is not the totality of it.the reality is that conflicts come in all shapes and sizes,only one of which is joint representation.in my view,and critical to my analysis of the present case,the supreme court decision in holloway clearly established the ultimate,functionally governing,legal rationale for federal habeas review for any convicted defendant represented in state court by conflicted counsel,not merely joint representation.holloway arkansas,at.as the court explained there,j oint representation of conflicting interests is suspect because of what it tends to prevent the attorney from doing t he evil is in what the advocate finds himself compelled to refrain from doing,not only at trial,but also as to possible pretrial plea negotiations and in the sentencing process.id.burger,see also mickens.at kennedy,concurring in a related context,disparaging a wooden rule and emphasizing the importance of an evidentiary hearing and district court findings on the effect of the conflict on the representation.
the foregoing considered,i believe that,even though balgooyen conflict is not on all fours with the joint representation at issue in cuyler,it is even more suspect.it had a stronger tendency to influence,if not compel,him to refrain from actions potentially advantageous to his client that an effective counsel would take.that tendency should have aroused the district court serious suspicions and prompted it to examine the entire state court record with heightened scrutiny.
evidentiary hearing 
a close examination of the state court record by the district court would have led to the discovery that there were two critical phases of balgooyen representation which should have been explored with care in an evidentiary hearing his failure to challenge the composition of the smith jury in light of his allegations of a judicially noticeable ongoing concern about the underrepresentation of on kent county circuit court venires,from one of which the smith jury was drawn,and his role in smith fateful rejection of the offer of the prosecution of a sentence in exchange for a plea of guilty,in light of the trial judge pointed admonition to smith,with respect to the prospect of a life sentence,that he seek balgooyen advice,and his admonition to balgooyen to render it,in great detail.see supra.
the jury trying smith was called on to resolve a swearing match between the direct testimony of a old at the time of trial white male,corroborated by the hearsay testimony of his mother,and the direct,categorical,but uncorroborated,denial by smith,a then old african american,who took th
