this is another tennessee death penalty case from the in which the state concedes constitutional error but argues that the error was harmless and that the execution should go forward.at petitioner richard caldwell state trial,the jury was given an instruction to presume malice from use of a deadly weapon,which had the unconstitutional effect of shifting the burden of proof on malice onto caldwell.we conclude that the constitutional error was not harmless and therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to issue the writ.
factual and procedural background 
on friday,february,tony climer went with his parents to moody disco,a community dance hall in chester county,tennessee.while there,he was seen talking to the petitioner,richard caldwell,and his son virgil.climer was last seen alive about,and no one saw him leave the dance hall.in the days after climer disappearance,petitioner gave conflicting stories about their relationship,telling the disco owner that he did not know climer,while telling climer mother that her son was in illinois,having run off with petitioner wife.
seven weeks later,petitioner was arrested for public drunkenness and taken to chester county jail.his son virgil,who was with him,was also detained.the next morning virgil caldwell led law enforcement officers to an isolated area in decatur county where they found the partial skeletal remains of a man.that afternoon,while being interrogated by authorities,petitioner confessed to killing climer.he told authorities that climer had left the dance hall with him and his son.petitioner claimed that climer had provoked him,first,by making sexual advances toward him and his son en route to petitioner home,and later by slapping whiskey into petitioner one good eye.as a result of this provocation,petitioner said,he went crazy and shot climer with a shotgun,then took climer body to decatur county and burned climer clothing.
while petitioner son was leading officers to the skeletal remains,other officers went to petitioner home.there they found unidentifiable blood stains on the walls,three caliber shotgun shells in the front yard,and burned fabric that was identified as having come from the shirt climer was wearing the night he disappeared.dental records later showed the skeletal remains were climer,and an autopsy revealed he was killed by two shotgun blasts to the back of the head.
at petitioner trial,the prosecution told jurors in its closing argument that it had established each and every element of the offense of murder in the first degree.at.concerning the element of malice,the prosecution said that not only does it it come from the use of a weapon,but that b lowing away a human being is the definition,the embodiment of the word malice.at.
in jury instructions,the court told the jury that it could convict richard caldwell of one of four possible crimes murder,murder,voluntary manslaughter,or involuntary manslaughter.in tennessee,malice is an essential element of both first and murder.for murder,the court gave the jury the correct definition of malice.for murder,the court instructed jurors that w hen the defendant is shown to have used a deadly weapon,and death is clearly shown to have resulted from its use,it is a presumption of law that the killing was done maliciously,that is,with the malice necessary to support a conviction of murder in the second degree.at.
the jury found richard caldwell guilty of murder and,in a separate sentencing proceeding,sentenced him to death.
caldwell timely appealed his conviction in state court,and it was affirmed on direct appeal.see state caldwell,cert.denied,d.he then pursued state remedies for relief,which were denied.see caldwell state,cert.denied,d.he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under in the united states district court for the western district of tennessee on october.the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the state on december,and granted summary judgment in favor of the state on the remaining claims on december,

in a criminal trial in this country,it is an elementary principle of due process that every element of the crime must be proven by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt.sandstrom montana,d.an instruction that tells a jury to presume any element of a crime without evidence is unconstitutional,for the fourteenth amendment guarantees prohibit a state from shifting to the defendant the burden of disproving an element of the crime charged,at.rehnquist,concurring.the supreme court has made clear that an instruction that a jury should presume malice from use of a deadly weapon falls under this constitutional prohibition.yates evatt,d francis franklin,d see also houston dutton,cir.a mandatory rebuttable presumption is equally unconstitutional.francis,at.
the judge instructions to the jury as to the law and how the evidence should be assessed are crucial to a fair trial.they should guide the jury deliberations and are not mere technicalities in our legal system.houston,at.when faced with a sandstrom error a court should not assume it is harmless but must review the entire case under the standard the supreme court most recently expounded in brecht abrahamson,d,and mcaninch,d.these cases adopt the principles set out in kotteakos united states,which held that an error is not to be deemed harmless if it had a substantial or injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brecht,at.quoting kotteakos united states.when the reviewing court has grave doubt as to the harmlessness of an error,the writ should issue,at.
although brecht was a decision,four members of the court deviated from the kotteakos standard of assessing harmless error when they held that habeas petitioners are not entitled to habeas relief unless they can establish that it resulted in actual prejudice,at.quoting brecht,at.justice stevens,who joined the majority opinion but who also authored a concurring opinion,differed from the majority in that respect,and wrote separately to explicate the kotteakos standard,at.stating that justice stevens agreed in part because the kotteakos standard places the burden on prosecutors to explain why errors were harmless in,the court held that,in assessing harmless error,we must follow the somewhat more restrictive approach of justice stevens concurring opinion in brecht,which stated explicitly that the kotteakos standard applied in its entirety.see,at.emphasis in original noting that brecht was not controlling to the extent it failed to adopt the kotteakos standard in its entirety and citing with approval justice stevens concurrence.
the kotteakos standard is appropriately demanding.brecht,at.stevens,concurring.
if,when all is said and done,the court is sure that the error did not influence the jury,or had but very sight effect,the verdict and the judgment should stand but if one can not say,with fair assurance,after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected.the inquiry can not be merely whether there was enough to support the result,apart from the phase affected by the error.it is rather,even so,whether the error itself had substantial influence.if so,or if one is left in grave doubt,the conviction can not stand.
kotteakos,at.see also houston,at noting that in assessing whether error is harmless,the supreme court has quoted with approval the standard from kotteakos outlined above.this is the test we must apply.
here,the jury was instructed that w hen the defendant is shown to have used a deadly weapon,and death is clearly shown to have resulted from its use,it is a presumption of law that the killing was done maliciously,that is,with the malice necessary to support a conviction of murder in the second degree.at.as the state concedes,this instruction violated the rule laid down in sandstrom and yates.see yates,at.sandstrom,at.the question before us therefore is whether this instruction,consider
