warden ricky bell appeals from the district court judgment granting a conditional writ of habeas corpus to derrick quintero pursuant to.we affirm.
quintero and other inmates escaped from the kentucky state penitentiary in june.in,subsequent to his recapture,a jury convicted quintero of second degree escape and first degree persistent felony offender.the jury included seven jurors who had previously served on a jury that had convicted quintero.
at trial,quintero admitted to having escaped but argued a choice of evils defense pursuant to kentucky revised statute,which excuses a defendant conduct if it was necessitated by a specific and immediate threat of personal injury.however,the trial court did not instruct the jury on this affirmative defense since it concluded that quintero had failed to offer proof of an immediate threat of personal injury.after it convicted quintero,the jury was instructed to sentence him to between ten and twenty years of imprisonment.the jury then sentenced quintero to the maximum term of twenty years of imprisonment,to run consecutively with the sentence he was serving at the time of the escape.
defense counsel did not object to the composition of the jury based on the prior involvement of the seven jurors.although the judge,prosecutor,and defense attorney had participated in the previous trial of quintero,none of them specifically questioned the seven jurors about whether their involvement in the prior trial would affect their impartiality.instead,the prosecutor and the defense attorney generally inquired of all the jurors whether anything they knew or had heard about the case would affect their ability to render a fair and impartial verdict.all of the jurors indicated that they could render a fair and impartial verdict.
the kentucky supreme court affirmed quintero conviction on direct appeal.with respect to quintero claim that he did not receive a fair and impartial jury,the kentucky supreme court declined to address its merits on the ground that quintero had failed to preserve the issue for review.
on august,the trial court denied quintero pro se motion to vacate,set aside,or correct his sentence.the kentucky court of appeals affirmed the denial without directly addressing quintero contention that he did not receive an impartial jury,it noted that the kentucky supreme court had refused to address the issue on direct appeal since it was not preserved.quintero then filed a motion for discretionary review,which the kentucky supreme court rejected.
quintero filed his petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus.based on its conclusion that quintero sixth amendment right to an impartial jury was violated,the district court granted a conditional writ of habeas corpus requiring a new trial.though quintero had procedurally defaulted his sixth amendment impartial jury claim,the district court determined that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel that sufficient cause and prejudice for the default therefore existed and that it could reach the merits of his claim.
standard of review 
we review a district court legal conclusions in a habeas proceeding de novo and its factual findings for clear error.lucas,cir.because quintero filed his habeas petition on july,the standards set forth in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of govern review of the state court decision.see lindh murphy,d harpster ohio,cir.as amended,d provides 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
with respect to the district court finding that quintero received ineffective assistance of trial counsel,we review de novo the performance and prejudice prongs of the test announced in strickland washington,d.sims livesay,cir citing strickland,at.
sixth amendment 
criminal defendants have a sixth amendment right to be tried by impartial and unbiased jurors.united states frost,cir citing ross oklahoma,d.in evaluating whether quintero right to an impartial jury was violated,we note that the parties do not cite to,nor can we find,any federal cases where members of a jury served in a prior trial of a.however,a case from the tenth circuit is instructive.
in united states gillis,cir,the court of appeals reversed a conviction where members of the jury had sat on a voir dire panel from an earlier case in which the same defendant was tried on different charges.id.at.the tenth circuit found a significant risk that the jury was biased due to some of the jurors exposure to voir dire questions in the earlier case.id.according to the court,p otential jurors present at both voir dire examinations could easily have been influenced by the prior questioning such that they would not be willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before them.id.quoting smith phillips,d.although gillis involved two trials of the same defendant,we believe that the logic of that decision applies with equal force to quintero trial before seven jurors who had previously convicted his.see united states maliszewski,cir observing that a defendant is prejudiced where a court informs a jury that indicted have pleaded guilty.
we thus agree with the district court conclusion that quintero sixth amendment right to an impartial jury was violated.if a juror mere exposure to a prior voir dire prejudices a defendant,then the circumstances of quintero trial certainly violate the sixth amendment since seven of the jurors who convicted him had served on a jury two months earlier and had determined beyond a reasonable doubt that his were guilty of the same offense.
bell argues that the district court applied case law that quintero conviction,and thus inappropriately applied constitutional principles of law that did not exist when the conviction became final.see teague lane,d n ew constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced.however,the principle of presuming prejudice in extreme cases of jury bias predates quintero conviction.see,mcdonough power,greenwood,d blackmun,concurring acknowledging the possibility of facts from which bias is to be inferred remmer united states.noting that in criminal cases,any private communication,contact,or tampering,directly or indirectly,with a juror about the matter pending before the jury is,for obvious reasons,deemed presumptively prejudicial.moreover,the district court did not rely on recent cases,such as gillis or frost,to announce a new controlling rule instead,as in our own analysis,the district court discussion of these cases was simply part of its reasoning by analogy to determine that the facts of this case warranted a conclusion that quintero sixth amendment right to be tried by an impartial jury was violated.
finally,the jurors attestation of their impartiality does not,under the circumstances of this case,overcome a presumption of bias.after being questioned by the prosecutor and the defense attorney regarding their general exposure to the case,every juror indicated that he or she could render a fair and impartial verdict.however,although the judge,prosecutor,and defense attorney had participated in the trial of quintero,none of them questioned the seven jurors about their involvement in that trial.such a colloquy was inadequate to wipe away the taint of bias which attached to a jury that included seven members who had previously determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the others who escaped were guilty.under these circumstances,bias must be presumed.
procedural default 
we now turn to whether the district court appropriately reached the merits of the procedurally defaulted claim a federal court may not reach the mer
