federal courts may grant habeas corpus relief if the underlying decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by this court.d.here,the sixth circuit held that respondent cory donald attorney provided per se ineffective assistance of counsel under united states cronic,when he was briefly absent during testimony concerning other defendants.because no decision from this court clearly establishes that donald is entitled to relief under cronic,we reverse.
after a day of drinking and smoking marijuana,cory donald and four others seante liggins,rashad moore,dewayne saine,and fawzi zaya decided to rob a drug dealer named mohammed makki.donald,moore,and liggins drove to makki home in dearborn,michigan,wearing black skull caps and coats.moore and donald entered the house,while liggins waited in the car.
michael mcginnis,one of makki drug runners,was in the house at the time.when donald and moore came through the door,mcginnis raised his hands and dropped to the floor.he heard a scuffle in the kitchen and two gunshots as someone said,l et it go.donald rapelje,fed.appx.after that,mcginnnis felt a gun on the back of his head while someone rifled through his pockets saying,w hat you got,what you got donald rapelje,wl,ed.he also heard one of the two men whisper to the other,i got shot,i got shot.fed,at.after moore and donald left,mcginnis found makki slumped against the refrigerator dying.
about seven minutes after they entered the house,moore and donald returned,guns in hand,to liggins car.donald told the others that he had stolen and that moore had accidentally shot him during the crime.that night,donald checked into a hospital for a gunshot wound to his foot.police arrested him about three weeks later.
the state charged donald with one count of felony murder and two counts of armed robbery.liggins and zaya pleaded guilty,and donald was tried with moore and saine.his defense theory was that he was present at the scene of the crime but he did not participate.at trial,the government sought to admit a chart chronicling phone calls from the day of the crime among moore,saine,and zaya.moore and saine attorneys objected,but donald attorney declined,saying i do have a dog in this race.it does not affect me at all.at.the court admitted the exhibit and took a short recess.
when the trial resumed,donald counsel was not in the courtroom.at first,the judge indicated that he would wait for the attorney.but he then decided to proceed because donald counsel had already indicated that the exhibit and testimony did not apply to his client.about minutes later,the lawyer returned.the judge informed him that up until that point we only were discussing the telephone chart,to which the attorney replied,y es,your honor,and as i had indicated on the record,i had no dog in the race and no interest in that.ibid.
the jury found donald guilty on all three counts.he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the count and to concurrent prison terms of to years for each of the armed robbery counts.on appeal,donald argued that he was entitled to a new trial because his attorney absence during the phone call testimony denied him his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.the michigan court of appeals rejected his claim,and the michigan supreme court denied review.
the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan granted federal habeas relief,and the sixth circuit affirmed.the sixth circuit held that the michigan court of appeals decision was both contrary to and involved an unreasonable application of this court decision in cronic.in the normal course,defendants claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must satisfy the familiar framework of strickland washington,which requires a showing that counsel performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.and when reviewing an claim,a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.at.
in cronic,however,we held that courts may presume that a defendant has suffered unconstitutional prejudice if he is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial.at.and in bell cone,we characterized a critical stage as one that held significant consequences for the accused.according to the sixth circuit,these statements should have compelled the michigan court to hold that the phone call testimony was a critical stage and that counsel absence per se ineffective assistance.without identifying any decision from this court directly in point,the sixth circuit concluded that the relevant testimony in this case was similar to our cases applying cronic.fed,at.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,a federal court may grant habeas relief only when a state court decision on the merits was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by decisions from this court,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.d.donald does not argue that the decision in his case was factually erroneous.instead,he argues that the decision was both contrary to and involved an unreasonable application of this court cases.
aedpa standard is intentionally difficult to meet.white woodall,slip,at quoting metrish lancaster,slip,at.we have explained that clearly established federal law for purposes of d includes only the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of this court decisions.white,at slip,at some internal quotation marks omitted.and an unreasonable application of those holdings must be objectively unreasonable,not merely wrong even clear error will not suffice.at slip,at same.to satisfy this high bar,a habeas petitioner is required to show that the state court ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington richter.
adherence to these principles serves important interests of federalism and comity.aedpa requirements reflect a presumption that state courts know and follow the law.woodford visciotti,per curiam.when reviewing state criminal convictions on collateral review,federal judges are required to afford state courts due respect by overturning their decisions only when there could be no reasonable dispute that they were wrong.federal habeas review thus exists as a guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems,not a substitute for ordinary error correction through appeal.harrington,supra,at internal quotation marks omitted.this is especially true for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,where aedpa review must be doubly deferential in order to afford both the state court and the defense attorney the benefit of the doubt.burt titlow,slip,at quoting cullen pinholster,slip,at.
the sixth circuit should not have affirmed the grant of habeas relief in this case.the michigan court of appeals decision was not contrary to any clearly established holding of this court.we have never addressed whether the rule announced in cronic applies to testimony regarding codefendants actions.in cronic itself,we rejected the defendant claim that his counsel lack of experience and short time for preparation warranted a presumption of prejudice,not a claim based on counsel absence.see,at.when announcing the rule in cronic,we cited earlier cases finding prejudice where counsel was either totally absent,or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding.at.but none of those cases dealt with circumstances like those present here.and bell did not involve the absence of counsel instead,we declined to presume prejudice where a capital defendant counsel failed to mount some case for life after the prosecution introduced evidence in the sentencing hearing and gave a closing statement.at.
because none of our cases confront the specific question presented by this case,the state court decision could not be contrary to any holding from this court.lopez smith,per curiam
