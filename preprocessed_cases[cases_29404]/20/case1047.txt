john lezell balentine,a texas prisoner sentenced to death,appeals the denial of his motion to set aside the judgment that a year earlier had denied him habeas corpus relief.we find the prior judgment should have been set aside because of a subsequent state court ruling.we reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing on whether balentine trial counsel ineffectively investigated for mitigation evidence to present during sentencing.
procedural history 
balentine confessed that on january,in amarillo,texas,he murdered three teenagers,mark caylor,kai geyer,and steven brady watson.the details of the crime are set out in balentine quarterman,wl,at.
there have been several separate actions to determine balentine guilt for the murders and then to review that determination in state and federal court.we summarize the proceedings that have led to today appeal.
trial,sentencing,and direct appeal 
in april,a jury found balentine guilty of capital murder and sentenced him to death.the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence on april.balentine state.
first state habeas application 
balentine filed a state application for writ of habeas corpus on january,which would have been before proceedings on the direct appeal were final.grounds for relief were stated,the first fourteen all challenging the constitutionality of the texas death penalty scheme.the only identified issue concerning sentencing was that counsel was ineffective by not presenting any evidence at the sentencing hearing.the state district court denied relief on october.the court of criminal appeals,after adopting the trial judge findings and conclusions,also denied relief on december.ex parte balentine,no,not designated for publication.
first federal habeas application 
balentine filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the northern district of texas on december,then filed an amended application on august.see.he alleged nine grounds of error,including a denial of a right to individualized sentencing under the eighth amendment.the crux of such a claim is that a defendant did not receive an individualized sentence because no mitigating evidence was presented at trial.see lockett ohio.after securing new counsel,balentine the first time in any mitigation evidence that could have been presented had there been proper investigation.that evidence included affidavits by family members and experts.the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation finding balentine not entitled to relief because the claims relating to mitigating evidence were unexhausted and procedurally barred.
balentine objected to the report and recommendation on december.he also requested that the district court stay the federal proceedings so that he could return to state court to exhaust the mitigation claims.the district court denied the motion on march.this denial of a stay is a key procedural point in our review of the decision on the rule b motion.also on march,and then on reconsideration on may,the district court overruled all objections to the report and recommendation.
balentine appealed the denial of his habeas petition to this court.we affirmed on april.balentine quarterman,app x,cir,cert.denied.
successive state habeas application 
on august,balentine filed a subsequent habeas application in state district court pursuant to section of texas code of criminal procedure article.he alleged that he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to effective assistance when his trial counsel did not investigate,develop,and present mitigation evidence in the punishment phase of the trial.he also alleged a violation of batson kentucky.the court of criminal appeals dismissed the application.ex parte balentine,nos,wl.
motion for rule b relief from the federal court judgment 
on september,balentine filed a motion for relief from judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b in federal district court.the judgments from which relief was sought were those of march and may,denying his section claims.balentine argued that the court of criminal appeals september,dismissal of his application did not constitute an independent and adequate ground that would bar review of the claim.he requested an evidentiary hearing on the merits of his claim that counsel had been ineffective by failing adequately to search for mitigating evidence.
on september,the district court denied relief from judgment and stay of execution.the court rejected balentine argument that the court of criminal appeals decision of september,had invalidated the district court ruling that an unexhausted claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was procedurally barred.the district court found that the court of criminal appeals had not ruled on the merits of the claim on september,and the claim therefore remained procedurally barred.
the district court granted a certificate of appealability.balentine now appeals the district court denial of rule b relief,claiming that the september,decision of the court of criminal appeals constituted a determination on the merits of balentine ineffective assistance of counsel claim.therefore,he argues,the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is no longer procedurally defaulted and the federal courts should review it on the merits.
discussion 
the language of rule b is brief,but its reach is broad.on motion and just terms,the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons any other reason that justifies relief.we have described this rule as a powerful one 
rule b is a grand reservoir of equitable power to do justice in a particular case when relief is not warranted by the preceding clauses,we have also narrowly circumscribed its availability,holding that rule b relief will be granted only if extraordinary circumstances are present.
batts forklift,cir citations and internal quotation marks removed.
the equitable power of the district court judge is to be exercised with discretion,while our appellate examination is for whether the discretion was abused.dunn cockrell,cir.
is this a new claim under aedpa 
the relief that is available under rule b in habeas proceedings must be granted consistently with the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.ruiz quarterman,cir b.the supreme court has described how aedpa and rule b motions operate in harmony.gonzalez crosby.under aedpa,any successive habeas claim that has not already been adjudicated must be dismissed unless it relies on either a new and retroactive rule of constitutional law or new facts showing a high probability of actual innocence.id.at.
where a rule b motion raises a new habeas claim,the motion is considered a successive habeas application using rule b to present new claims for relief from a state court judgment of claims couched in the language of a true rule b aedpa requirement that a new claim be dismissed unless it relies on either a new rule of constitutional law or newly discovered facts.gonzalez,at.
but there is no new habeas claim where a petitioner merely asserts that a previous ruling which precluded a merits determination was in example,a denial for such reasons as failure to exhaust,procedural default,or bar.id.at.if neither the rule b motion itself nor the federal judgment from which it seeks relief substantively addresses federal grounds for setting aside the movant state conviction,allowing the motion to proceed as denominated creates no inconsistency with the habeas statute or rules.id.at.
balentine now alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel,in violation of his rights under the sixth amendment,when his initial counsel failed to investigate mitigating evidence for the sentencing phase of his trial see wiggins smith.the state argues that balentine initial federal habeas application never raised a sixth amendment claim for counsel failure to investigate mitigating evidence.if that is so,then balentine rule b motion raised a new claim that constitutes a successive habeas application barred by aedpa.see b.consequently,whether aedpa requires dismissal of balentine rule b motion in part depends on when the issue of ineffective assistance for failure to investigate mitigating evidence was first presented in earlier proceedings.
a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to investigate mitigation evidence was not raised on direct appeal.nor was a claim of failure to investigate mitigation evidence presented in the state habeas application that was filed in.instead,the initial state habeas application made a weak assertion of a failure to present mitigation evidence.
we now look for whether balentine raised the wiggins claim in federal district court in his section habeas petition,filed in and amended in.the state contends that balentine federal habeas petition did not state a sixth amendment claim of ineffective assistance for counsel failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence.rather,the state asserts that any claim regarding mitigation was an eighth and fourteenth amendment challenge.
the relevant section of balentine federal habeas application was titled ground eight iac ineffective assistance of counsel lockett doctrine risk assessment balentine was denied his federal eighth and fourteenth a mendment rights to individualized sentencing.trial counsel failed to present any evidence at all in the punishment phase.this section of the application asserted that the trial counsel performance was deficient.it included five arguments in support of counsel constitutional deficiency with regard to mitigating evidence.the application then stated that such deficient performance of trial counsel raises a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different and cites to the sixth and fourteenth amendments,and to strickland washington.
the general rule is that arguments not raised before the district court are waived on appeal.state indus.prods.beta,cir.the errant heading in a brief does not waive an argument.balentine raised a sixth amendment argument.both the magistrate judge and this court ruled on it.see belt emcare,cir holding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it.
the section title gave some misdirection with the reference to lockett,but balentine claim was nonetheless for ineffective assistance of counsel.the section title contained counsel acronym for ineffective assistance of counsel,iac,and stated that counsel failed to present any evidence at all in the punishment phase.additionally,balentine presented his argument in terms of strickland washington and wiggins smith,both sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel cases.further,the section subheadings tracked the test for ineffective counsel.subheading was titled trial counsel performance was deficient,and subheading was titled the deficient performance raises a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different.the magistrate judge properly recognized the claim as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and ruled on it,and on appeal this court considered the claim to be one for ineffective assistance.balentine,app x at.
thus,balentine federal habeas application stated a sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claim,and the rule b motion does not present a new habeas claim barred by aedpa.
b.did the texas court of criminal appeals rely on an independent and adequate state ground precluding federal merits review 
the next key issue is whether the state court reached the merits of the claim or instead ruled that the habeas application was procedurally flawed.this distinction matters in a section proceeding because we do not reach the merits when the state court denied relief due to a state law that provides an adequate basis for the decision,independent of the merits of the federal claim.coleman thompson,finley johnson,cir.the supreme court has held that if the state court decision rests primarily on federal law or the state and federal law are interwoven,and if the adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the opinion,we will construe the state court ruling as one applying federal law.ruiz quarterman,cir quoting michigan long.an independent and adequate state ground must be express in order to avoid the michigan long default rule.finley,at.
consequently,if the texas court of criminal appeals did not clearly rely on an independent state ground in its september,order,we will conclude that it reached the merits and did not reject the claim for not having been exhausted.such a conclusion would undermine our failure to stay the federal suit in in order to allow the claim to be presented first in state court,a refusal based on the view that the state would not countenance such a claim.
we now apply these principles to the state court order.
by statute,a texas state prisoner has a limited right to have a successive application for habeas relief considered in state court.
a if a subsequent application for a writ of habeas corpus is filed after filing an initial application,a court may not consider the merits of or grant relief based on the subsequent application unless the application contains sufficient specific facts establishing that 
the current claims and issues have not been and could not have been presented previously in a timely initial application or in a previously considered application filed under this article or article because the factual or legal basis for the claim was unavailable on the date the applicant filed the previous application 
by a preponderance of the evidence,but for a violation of the united states constitution no rational juror could have found the applicant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt or 
by clear and convincing evidence,but for a violation of the united states constitution no rational juror would have answered in the state favor one or more of the special issues that were submitted to the jury in the applicant trial under article,or.
crim.proc.ann,a.
the application may be filed in the court of conviction,but the clerk of that court is to send the application to the court of criminal appeals.id.b.the court of criminal appeals then decides whether one of the limited bases for consideration of the application on the merits has been shown.
on august,balentine filed a successive application.in a order,the court of criminal appeals first summarized the prior proceedings.it then addressed the most recent filing 
applicant presents two allegations in his application.in the first allegation,applicant asserts that he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of trial counsel because counsel failed to adequately investigate,develop,and present mitigation evidence in the punishment phase of the trial.in his second allegation,applicant asserts that the prosecution unconstitutionally exercised peremptory challenges on two venire persons in violation of batson kentucky.we have reviewed the application and find that his allegations fail to satisfy the requirements of article.accordingly,applicant application is dismissed,and his motion to stay his execution is denied.likewise,applicant motion to vacate the judgment rendered in his initial state writ application is denied,and the court otherwise declines to reconsider that case.
ex parte balentine,nos,wl.
we find substantial guidance for interpreting the court of criminal appeals order in ruiz quarterman.the procedural steps in ruiz were the same as appeal,state habeas,federal habeas,successive application in state court,then a rule b motion in federal court.id.at.there we concluded that the court of criminal appeals order denying relief on the second habeas application could not be considered a decision based on independent and adequate state grounds.id.at.part of the reason was the fact that there were only four votes at the court of criminal appeals for the lead opinion that denied the writ the judge casting the fifth vote necessary for the decision reached the merits.id.at.such is not involved in balentine court of criminal appeals decision.
however,another reason ruiz found that the texas court of criminal appeals could not be said to have ruled on an independent state ground was because the texas court,in an earlier case,explained how it reached decisions such as ruiz.id.at.in,the court of criminal appeals held that satisfying section of article had two separate components 
the factual or legal basis for an applicant current claims must have been unavailable as to all of his previous applications and the specific facts alleged,if established,would constitute a constitutional violation that would likely require relief from either the conviction or sentence.
ex parte campbell,discussed in ruiz,at.on that basis,ruiz concluded that a boilerplate dismissal by the court of criminal appeals of an application for an abuse of the writ is itself uncertain on this point,being unclear whether the court decision was based on the first element,a question,or on the second element,a question of federal constitutional law.ruiz,at.
the district court in ruiz had held,when rejecting the section application,that a stay and a return to state court would be futile because the claim had not been exhausted the first time.id.at.futile or not,ruiz returned to state court and got the ruling from the court of criminal appeals that we construed as.as the ruiz opinion put it,this merits ruling pulled the ground from under the federal district court earlier judgment dismissing the claim and refusing to hold the federal claim in abeyance while ruiz returned to state court with his unexhausted claim.id.at.
importantly,the court of criminal appeals ruling in ruiz that was construed as one on the merits is not readily distinguishable from the one here.the september,ruling stated that balentine allegations fail to satisfy the requirements of article.under the court of criminal appeals explanation in campbell,that denial could have been a decision that the facts were previously available and no excuse from presenting the claim earlier adequate and independent state that denial could have been based on a finding that the facts as alleged did not indicate a federal constitutional violation.
there is at least one distinction,though,besides the lack of a majority in ruiz,between the state court order in ruiz and the order here.the distinction helps balentine.in the ruiz order,the texas court of criminal appeals said that the application was dismissed as an abuse of the writ,but that phrase does not appear in the same court balentine order.
the abuse of the writ language is significant because of our decision in hughes quarterman,cir.the hughes court neither cited ruiz nor discussed the decision of the court of criminal appeals in campbell.the hughes court held that a finding by the texas court that a second application was an abuse of the writ could be considered an adequate state ground independent of the merits of the federal claim.id.at.the court of criminal appeals order in hughes said that the application fails to satisfy the requirements of,sec a,accordingly,the application is dismissed as an abuse of the writ.ex parte hughes,not designated for publication.
because the abuse of the writ language was not included in the court of criminal appeals order on balentine successive state habeas application,hughes has no direct.true,the statute itself says that a successive application that fails to satisfy its requirements presumably either for procedural or for merits reasons should be dismissed as an abuse of the writ.proc,c.however,giving our imprimatur to the statute unvarying abuse of the writ label when a second state habeas application is denied,is inconsistent with our precedents.for example,we have held that the texas abuse of writ approach could not always be considered a procedural ruling because at times it requires a determination of whether a prima facie constitutional claim has been shown 
although texas abuse of the writ doctrine is superficially procedural in that it has a procedural effect,because it leads to determining which claims are remanded to the state trial courts for further development,it steps beyond a procedural determination to examine the merits of an atkins claim.
rivera quarterman,cir.similarly,the campbell explanation by the court of criminal appeals reveals that the court may rule on the basis that the specific facts alleged,if established,would constitute a constitutional violation that would likely require relief from either the conviction or sentence.ex parte campbell,at.further,a ruling that the facts,if established,did not constitute a violation would also be interwoven with federal constitutional law.
regardless of the effect of hughes and its focus on abuse of the writ language in a texas court of criminal appeals order,we give some weight to the absence of express language of abuse in balentine order from that court.we give weight because of the interplay between the responsibilities and procedures of state and federal courts in this area each court likely is attentive or at least aware of the effects of its decision on the other.the ruiz court believed that how the federal courts will react to the language of a state court habeas decision is a rote rule at the fingertips of every writing member of state courts of last studied ambiguity or clarity in the decisional footing is an art form and an absence of clarity in an opinion is seldom inadvertent.ruiz,at.we do not decide that the absence of abuse of the writ language was an omission meant for our eyes,but we see it all the same.
moreover,to the extent there is inconsistency between hughes and the careful examination of abuse of the writ determinations required by ruiz and hughes did not address either are bound by the decisions predating hughes because one panel can not overrule earlier decisions.united states,cir.ruiz compels us to construe the september,court of criminal appeals ruling as one on federal grounds,because it was not clearly based on an adequate state ground independent of the merits.
does ruiz require reversal here 
to succeed on his rule b motion,balentine must demonstrate a basis for relief from the district court judgment,as affirmed by this court.the issue before the district court in late september was whether something about the court of criminal appeals september,decision was a basis to overturn the district court judgment that the wiggins claim could not be exhausted at that late date.
the supreme court has considered whether a rule b motion,filed several years after the inmate section application had been denied,was an available procedural option.gonzalez crosby,at.although a rule b motion should be denied if it challenges on the merits an earlier denial of habeas relief,
t hat is not the case when a rule b motion attacks,not the substance of the federal court resolution of a claim on the merits,but some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings.
when no claim is presented,there is no basis for contending that the rule b motion should be treated like a habeas corpus application.if neither the motion itself nor the federal judgment from which it seeks relief substantively addresses federal grounds for setting aside the movant state conviction,allowing the motion to proceed as denominated creates no inconsistency with the habeas statute or rules.
id.at footnote omitted.
this means that in order for balentine to proceed,he must have raised in his rule b motion something other than a ruling in the earlier judgment.balentine argues that on september,the court of criminal appeals reached the merits,thereby vitiating our earlier conclusion that the unexhausted claim was no longer a viable one in state court.according to balentine,this is not an attack on a merits ruling in the earlier federal decision,but an undermining of a procedural ruling regarding the inability of balentine to exhaust.
for guidance in analyzing whether there was anything vitiating about the texas court latest balentine ruling,we again turn to ruiz,the seminal application of gonzalez in this circuit.the district court in ruiz section proceedings denied habeas relief because his ineffective assistance claims were procedurally defaulted.as we explained on appeal,
the district court made clear that his ruling rested on his conclusion that texas law precludes petitioner from obtaini
