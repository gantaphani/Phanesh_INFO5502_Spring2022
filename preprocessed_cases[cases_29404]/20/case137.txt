petitioner tony gaskins appeals the district court denial of his request for habeas corpus relief from his massachusetts state court conviction for first degree murder.he claims that his conviction was based on coerced and perjured testimony and faulty jury instructions.massachusetts contends that the district court erred in failing to dismiss the petition as untimely,but correctly decided its substance.the statute of limitations issue presents a close question that merits some discussion,but it is one that we ultimately need not resolve.after careful review of the petition and the lengthy trail of prior proceedings,we affirm the denial on the merits.
factual background procedural trail 
we take the facts of conviction as recounted by the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc when it affirmed gaskins conviction on direct appeal,supplementing those with other record facts consistent with the sjc findings.yeboah sefah ficco,cir.cert.denied.healy spencer,cir.according to the sjc 
the jury could have found the following from the evidence.raymond coffill and leo womack had had a general plan in february,to rob a drug house.on february,coffill purchased cocaine from a drug house in lynn and shared it with womack.later that day they went to the drug house to purchase more cocaine,but because they were short of funds,they were unable to make a purchase.as they were leaving,they met gaskins and robert reid.the four pooled their resources,purchased cocaine,and went to coffill house where they discovered that the cocaine was of poor quality.there followed a loosely developed plan to rob the drug house.they returned to the drug house.coffill and gaskins knocked on the door,had an argument with the people inside about the poor quality of the cocaine,but failed to obtain any satisfaction.the four then consulted and decided that they would try to disrupt the business of the drug house.two people were allowed to make purchases without incident.the victim then arrived alone.he apparently made a drug purchase,and,as he was leaving,womack grabbed him and struck him on the head.gaskins held a knife to the victim body and told the victim,kick it in.the victim begged that they not stab him for a twenty.the victim struggled and fled,pursued by gaskins,womack,and reid on foot and coffill in an automobile.ultimately,the four joined up in the automobile.gaskins said i stuck that nigger.he did make the fence.i got him.gaskins still had the knife.the victim died one week later as a result of a stab wound to his abdomen.

both coffill and womack testified at gaskins trial in exchange for reduced charges and sentences.each had murder charges reduced to manslaughter.id.gaskins was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.
direct appeal 
gaskins appealed to the sjc.he argued that the trial judge erred in failing to order a not guilty finding the jury was improperly instructed concerning the possibility of a second degree murder verdict and counsel was constitutionally ineffective both in failing to challenge the composition of the jury pool and failing to offer certain evidence.id.at.the sjc denied gaskins appeal in.
first new trial motion 
in,gaskins filed his first motion for new trial in state superior court.in addition to the points raised in his direct appeal,he argued that the prosecution used perjured testimony to convict him and inappropriately vouched for the credibility of womack and coffill.he also alleged that the trial judge provided an erroneous reasonable doubt instruction and that he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.see commonwealth gaskins,order at.may.the motion was denied,with the judge ruling that a ll of the issues now raised in this motion have either been previously raised and ruled upon in the prior appeal,or have been waived.id.the issues raised in the new trial motion that were held to be waived were deemed so because gaskins had not identified them in his direct appeal.id.citing.c.gaskins sought leave to appeal that decision with respect to his trial counsel failure to challenge the composition of the jury pool.an sjc gatekeeper justice denied leave to appeal in january 
first habeas petition 
meanwhile,in july,during the pendency of his state court new trial motion,gaskins filed a habeas petition in federal court.the petition contained an expanded version of his claim that his conviction was caused,in part,by womack perjury,and included an affidavit from womack asserting that he was coerced by the prosecutor to lie on the witness stand.see gaskins duval,d,gaskins iii the district court dismissed the petition as untimely,but we reversed,holding that the applicable limitations period was tolled while gaskins state court motion was pending.gaskins duval,cir gaskins ii.
on remand,the district court dismissed the petition without prejudice because it contained both exhausted claims and the unexhausted expanded perjury claim.gaskins iii,d at.
further state proceedings 
gaskins returned to state court after the district court dismissal without prejudice of his habeas petition and filed another motion for new trial in april.he asserted two grounds relevant here prosecutorial misconduct in light of the womack affidavit and erroneous jury instructions which permitted an inference of malice on less than a strong likelihood of death.see commonwealth gaskins,order at.july.the superior court ordered an evidentiary hearing on the prosecutorial misconduct issue and further argument on the jury instruction claim.id.at.
the evidentiary hearing took place in december.in an order dated february,the superior court denied the motion with respect to the jury instruction issue.the court reasoned both that gaskins had waived the jury instruction issue because it was not addressed in his direct appeal or any motions,and alternatively,that the argument failed substantively.
womack did not testify at the december evidentiary hearing,asserting his fifth amendment right against.somewhat ironically,he claimed before the hearing that he was coerced into signing the very affidavit in which he announced that he was coerced to lie at gaskins trial,and thus argued that he did not waive his fifth amendment rights by providing that affidavit.
as a result of womack refusal to testify,the superior court,although it accepted evidence from many of the individuals involved in preparing womack for trial,did not reach the substance of gaskins claim that womack had essentially recanted his trial testimony.however,based on womack testimony at an in camera limited to his fifth amendment claim,the court rejected womack claim that he was coerced into signing the recantation affidavit and thus held that womack had waived his fifth amendment privilege.the court concluded that o n the circumstances surrounding the preparation and signing of the affidavit womack testimony was not credible or believable.in addition,the court stated that on the claim of coercion in the signing of the affidavit,womack did not appear,and i find he was not,truthful.in light of all the circumstances and evidence,womack explanations were not plausible and i do not accept them.commonwealth gaskins,slip op.at.the superior court stayed the proceedings in order to allow womack to pursue an appeal of the court fifth amendment ruling.the sjc ruled against womack,holding that he could refuse to testify at a reconvened hearing and then appeal from any ensuing contempt order.in re womack.
the matter returned to the same superior court judge in,in order to reach the remaining merits of gaskins new trial motion,which by then had been pending for more than five years.womack again refused to testify.finally,in february,the judge issued a decision denying gaskins new trial motion on two grounds.see commonwealth gaskins,order at.first,while referring to its order the court stated that it had previously found that womack explanations regarding the prosecution alleged actions were not plausible and that the court did not accept them.brackets in original.this was erroneous because,as previously noted,the order addressed womack credibility only with respect to whether he was coerced into signing the recantation affidavit,and not the affidavit relating to the issue of whether womack was coerced to testify falsely at gaskins trial.the second basis for denying the new trial motion was the additional evidence submitted by the commonwealth in connection with the motion that undermined the perjury claim,which the court summarized as follows 
in response to gaskins motion for a new trial and the court july,decision,the assistant district attorney assigned to prosecute the motion,kevin mitchell ada mitchell,filed an affidavit on may.the affidavit stated that ada mitchell had spoken with womack defense attorney,larry mcguire mcguire.mcguire,after reviewing womack case file,had told ada mitchell that he and womack met with then prosecutor,now superior court judge,howard whitehead judge whitehead and lynn police dennis flynn shortly before womack testified at gaskins trial.mcguire also stated that this was the only meeting that occurred between womack and the commonwealth,and that neither judge whitehead,nor law enforcement,made any attempts to encourage womack to testify falsely.
judge whitehead also filed an affidavit on may.that affidavit stated that he,acting for the commonwealth,had entered into a plea agreement with womack on february,shortly before gaskins trial.the agreement established that,in exchange for certain concessions on the part of the commonwealth,womack would testify,truthfully,against gaskins.judge whitehead also stated that he memorialized the meeting with handwritten notes.during the meeting with the commonwealth,womack gave his account of the events surrounding the murder,which was consistent with the testimony womack provided at trial.footnote omitted judge whitehead also stated that he never advised womack to tailor his testimony in any manner 
in addition to the affidavits,the court also described testimony given at the december hearing.in sum,mcguire corroborated mitchell and whitehead affidavits when he testified that he and womack met with whitehead and flynn shortly before gaskins trial this was the only meeting between womack and the commonwealth and neither whitehead nor law enforcement attempted to encourage womack to testify falsely 
relying at least as much on the evidence provided by mcguire,mitchell and whitehead as it did on its erroneous recollection of its finding about womack credibility,the court concluded that gaskins conviction was not based on prosecutorial misconduct or perjured testimony and denied his new trial motion on february.
gaskins subsequently sought leave to appeal the february order to the sjc.the sjc gatekeeper justice denied the motion,first finding that the claims related to the jury instruction on malice,destruction of exculpatory evidence,and ineffective assistance of trial counsel were not new or substantial,and do not require consideration by the full court.laws ch.commonwealth gaskins,no,slip op.at.next,the justice found the prosecutorial misconduct issue to be new,and thus addressed it.id.although repeating the error made by the superior court regarding womack credibility,the justice also noted that womack accusation of coerced perjury was countered by the considerable evidence provided by gaskins defense attorney and prosecutors.id.at.accordingly,after reviewing the record,the gatekeeper justice concluded that the prosecutorial misconduct issue was not substantial,and did not refer the matter to the full court.id.
first habeas petition revisited 
the federal forum did not remain dormant during the roughly period that gaskins state court motions were being resolved.in december,gaskins moved in the district court for vacatur of the dismissal without prejudice of his habeas petition to restore his petition to the docket and to stay the petition while he exhausted his state court remedies.the district court denied the motion and gaskins subsequent motion for reconsideration,following which the court published a memorandum decision.gaskins duval,d gaskins iv.
in reaching its decision,the district court first noted that gaskins had filed a mixed petition,containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims.id.at.historically,as the court had done with gaskins petition in,district courts had provided petitioners with two alternatives either file an amended petition sans the unexhausted claims or return to state court to present the unexhausted claims.id.the court,however,also pointed out that the statute of limitations contained in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d,created a predicament for prisoners filing mixed petitions 
if a prisoner deletes unexhausted claims from her petition,she may well be barred from bringing those claims at a later date,because of aedpa limitation on second or successive petitions.under b,state prisoners may only bring such petitions in limited circumstances subject to strict procedural requirements.on the other hand,if the prisoner agrees to dismissal of her claims,she runs the risk of running afoul of the one year limitations period.
gaskins iv,d at.
the district court then described the stay and abeyance procedure that courts had employed to protect habeas petitioners from falling into this trap.id.citing neverson farquharson,cir.rather than dismissing a mixed petition,a district court may stay proceedings while the petitioner returns to state court to resolve his unexhausted claims.id.at the time of the district court consideration,this procedure was in its relative infancy.we had recommended the practice,see delaney matesanz,cir,but the supreme court did not explicitly approve of it under certain limited conditions until.see rhines weber.
the district court noted that it did not employ the stay and abeyance procedure at the time that it had dismissed gaskins petition.gaskins iv,d at.the court then went on to construe gaskins motion to vacate as a motion for relief under.b.it ultimately denied the motion as violative of the rule requirement that the motion be filed within a reasonable time because its filing was almost two and a half years after the supreme court had held in duncan walker,that the limitations period is tolled during state,but not federal proceedings.gaskins iv,d at.
the court then added a conciliatory coda 
gaskins has one final option.he could file a new habeas petition,with a request that the court apply the stay and abeyance procedure.procedurally,a new habeas petition would stop the aedpa limitations clock on the date of filing,and all the time since aedpa effective date that gaskins has been challenging his convictions in the courts of the commonwealth would be excluded.if gaskins were to finish exhausting his claims in the state courts,without obtaining relief,this court would presumably then have to determine whether gaskins is eligible for equitable tolling of the period during which his original petition was pending in the federal courts.if equitable tolling were not available,then gaskins federal habeas claims would be.
since the date of his original conviction,gaskins has promptly pursued his remedies,and has never in any way abused the writ of habeas corpus.he has proposed that,should the court allow his motion to reconsider,he will provide the court with regular updates on his state proceedings,and will promptly pursue his federal claims,should the state courts deny him relief.he has consistently acted in good faith,and there can be little doubt that the equities favor him.
given that the court ideally should have applied the stay and abeyance procedure in,that gaskins has consistently acted in good faith,and that his liberty is at stake,the court would be entirely willing to permit gaskins to file a renewed habeas petition,which the court would then immediately stay and hold in abeyance until gaskins finishes exhausting his administrative remedies.with matters in their present posture,however,this court can not render an advisory opinion concerning equitable tolling,and it is inappropriate for the court to recharacterize gaskins motion to vacate in this manner without his permission,however.see castro united states.therefore,the court denied gaskins motion to reconsider in its en
