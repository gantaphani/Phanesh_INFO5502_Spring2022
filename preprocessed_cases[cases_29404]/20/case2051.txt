urbano alejo was disciplined for failing to obey a federal correction officer order that was issued in english.alejo,a cuban national,brought this action,alleging various denials of due process based on his nationality and ethnicity.all but one of these alejo was unconstitutionally disciplined for his failure to obey an order he could not dismissed for want of prosecution,a ruling that is not challenged here.what is challenged is i the district court sua sponte dismissal without prejudice,at the threshold stage,of all but one of the defendants on account of alejo failure to allege their personal involvement,and ii the district court subsequent dismissal of the remaining claim against defendant lieutenant gary heller,because that claim necessarily asserted the invalidity of a disciplinary determination that had not previously been challenged.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
alejo background 
alejo fled cuba for the united states in.shortly after his arrival,the immigration and naturalization service detained him and placed him in federal custody.three years later,while in detention,alejo was convicted and sentenced for conveying a weapon at a federal facility.thereafter,in,alejo was convicted and sentenced for killing his cellmate.
during his sentence for murder,alejo served time at various federal prisons,including the united states penitentiary at marion,illinois usp marion,where the events giving rise to this action occurred.alejo has completed his criminal sentence,but remains confined as an ins detainee.
the incident 
while at usp marion,alejo was housed in the prison b unit and was placed in the prison pretransfer program,a unit and program designated for those prisoners and detainees who had maintained clear conduct during their recent history of incarceration and as a reward received special privileges,such as relaxed rules and the ability to work at a cable factory.as a condition for receiving these privileges,however,inmates were subject to random strip searches.
in the afternoon of august,alejo was stopped as he was leaving the dinner hall by usp correction officer keith heckler and ordered to strip.alejo complied.heckler then ordered alejo in english to hand heckler his clothes as he removed them.heckler contends that alejo refused this order,placing his clothes instead on a nearby wooden bench and telling heckler also in english to pick them up himself.
alejo denies this,and contends that although he understood heckler order to complied with such orders on occasions too numerous to did not understand what heckler was ordering him to do with his discarded clothes.it is undisputed that alejo has difficulty understanding english.in fact,this was apparently known to prison officials at the time of the incident.a november prisoner report on alejo described the extent of his grasp of the english language does not speak english in any substantial manner and effective communication is only accomplished by use of an interpreter.
nonetheless,heckler reported alejo noncompliance to his superior,usp lieutenant gary heller.heller instructed heckler to write him up for refusal to obey an order.heckler did so,and after another lieutenant conducted a short investigation into the incident,which revealed alejo defense that he had not understood the order,the report was referred to the prison disciplinary committee.
three days later,the disciplinary committee convened to consider the incident report and determined that alejo had willfully disobeyed heckler order.as a result,alejo was removed from the b unit and the pretransfer program.
on september,alejo appealed the decision to the prison warden,who denied relief.alejo then submitted an administrative appeal of the warden decision to the regional director.but that appeal did not challenge the disciplinary committee decision regarding the incident instead,it challenged an unrelated disciplinary determination arising from a separate incident involving alejo possession of a razor blade,which had resulted in alejo being placed in disciplinary segregation.
the lawsuit 
rather than further pursuing his administrative appeal of the incident,on september,alejo initiated this action by filing a pro se complaint written entirely in spanish.the district court struck the complaint for noncompliance with federal rule of civil procedure a,granting alejo leave to refile.on march,alejo filed his amended pro se complaint,written in english.
the amended complaint named heller and heckler,as well as various other prison officials,as defendants.but in alejo statement of his claim,only heller is referred to by name.he described the defendants as gary heller,and other john does of the bureau of prisons,and accused them of violating his constitutional rights by i harassing him on account of his cuban ancestry and in retaliation for prior complaints about his custodial conditions,ii inflicting disproportionate punishment upon him also on account of his cuban ancestry,and iii denying him interpreters when issuing orders and preventing him from meaningful access to the courts by refusing to address his administrative appeals written in spanish.
on may,the district court granted alejo permission to proceed in forma pauperis,but sua sponte dismissed heckler and every other defendant except for heller from the suit,finding that in his statement of claim,alejo made no allegation that any of them were personally involved in the events giving rise to the suit.the dismissal regarding the other defendants was granted without prejudice,and the case against heller was referred to a magistrate judge for further proceedings.
heller moved for a more definite statement on july,a motion which the district court summarily denied a month later.on january,the district court appointed counsel for alejo.
a year later,heller filed a motion seeking dismissal or,alternatively,summary judgment on alejo claims,arguing that he was not personally involved in the events at issue and that even if he was,he did not violate any of alejo clearly established constitutional rights by advising heckler to pursue disciplinary charges against alejo and was therefore entitled to qualified immunity.because heller had relied on materials outside of the pleadings,the motion was treated as one for summary judgment.
in his report and recommendation issued june,the magistrate judge recommended rejection of alejo first amendment claim and retention of the remaining claims.on august,the district court adopted the report and recommendation in full,granting summary judgment in favor of heller on the claim and denying relief as to the balance of the claims.
for the next three years,the case meandered through discovery and pretrial motions.on july,heller filed his second motion for summary judgment,claiming that because success on alejo claims arising out of the incident would necessarily invalidate the disciplinary determination resulting from that incident,he was precluded from collaterally seeking damages relief without having first invalidated that determination directly.heller noted that alejo had not exhausted his administrative remedies to expunge that incident report or the decision of the disciplinary committee.heller also reasserted his and arguments.on august,alejo filed his response to the motion.
the magistrate judge agreed with heller position that this circuit precedent interpreting the supreme court holding in heck humphrey,d,required alejo to invalidate the disciplinary determination before collaterally attacking it in a suit.on september,he recommended the complaint be dismissed.alejo filed his objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation on september.
on november,the district judge adopted the report and recommendation and dismissed without prejudice alejo claims relating to the incident.the district judge recognized that in a decision issued august,we overruled our prior precedent applying heck to prisoners who challenge only the conditions of their confinement,dewalt carter,cir however,he concluded that the invalidity of that prior precedent was unrelated to the principles a
