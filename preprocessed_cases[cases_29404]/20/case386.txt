richard appeals the july,denial of his petition for habeas corpus by the united states district court for the northern district of new york hurd.richard argues that the state courts unreasonably refused to apply the united states supreme court holding in kansas crane,d,to his case.for the reasons that follow,we hold that crane involuntary commitment standard applies to insanity acquittees,but that the new york courts did not unreasonably conclude that richard continued involuntary confinement meets the requirements of the due process clause.the denial of richard petition for a writ of habeas corpus is therefore affirmed.
background 
new york statutory scheme 
under new york law,a person charged with a crime may be determined,by the acceptance of a plea or by verdict,to be not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect nrrmdd.francis stone,cir.upon entry of a verdict of nrrmdd or acceptance of a plea of nrrmdd,the court orders a psychiatric examination and conducts an initial hearing to determine whether the acquittee is mentally ill or is suffering from a dangerous mental disorder.proc.law,mckinney hereafter cpl.based on the evidence at the initial hearing the nrrmdd acquittee receives one of three classifications.if the court finds that the nrrmdd acquittee has a dangerous mental disorder,it classifies the acquittee as track,and must order commitment to a secure facility for an initial term of six months.see cpl f.if the court finds that the nrrmdd acquittee is mentally ill but does not have a dangerous mental disorder,it classifies the acquittee as track,and must issue an order of conditions and an order committing the acquittee to the custody of the state commissioner of mental health,pursuant to new york mental hygiene law.cpl.if the court finds that the nrrmdd acquittee does not have a dangerous mental disorder and is not mentally ill,it classifies the acquittee as track,and must discharge the individual either unconditionally or subject to an order of conditions.see also in re david,describing new york statutory scheme for involuntary commitment of insanity acquittees.
at the expiration of a commitment order to a secure facility,the nrrmdd acquittee receives the first of a series of court reviews to determine his then current mental condition.if the court finds that the individual continues to have a dangerous mental disorder he must be recommitted under a first retention order for not more than one year.cpl g.second and subsequent reviews occur every two years.cpl h.if upon review a court finds that the nrrmdd acquittee no longer suffers from a dangerous mental disorder,it may direct transfer to a facility with an order of conditions if the individual is still mentally ill,or release with an order of conditions if the individual is no longer mentally ill.cpl.at any time during the period covered by an order of conditions,a court must conduct a hearing and issue an order of recommitment if it finds that the nrrmdd acquittee has a dangerous mental disorder.cpl.
the nrrmdd acquittee may appeal by permission a commitment order,retention order or recommitment order to an intermediate state appellate court,and may appeal by permission a final decision to the court of appeals.cpl.
ii.petitioner history 
from an early age,richard was the victim of repeated severe physical,sexual and emotional abuse by his mother and his older brother.between the ages of ten and eighteen he attempted suicide four times.at age,after his mother death,he began to abuse alcohol and drugs.later,after marriage,fatherhood and divorce,he began engaging in promiscuous and risky homosexual encounters.
in july richard met a male,took him home and after a night of sexual relations,stabbed him three times in the chest with a pocket knife while the youth was sleeping.richard turned himself in and was charged with several crimes,including attempted murder in the second degree.at the time of his arrest,he was on probation for manslaughter for the killing of another man whom he had stabbed to death after sex.he had no memory of engaging in any violence in the earlier case.his probation was revoked and he was incarcerated pending a competency hearing.he again attempted suicide.
richard was found competent to stand trial.he then underwent psychiatric examination to determine his mental state at the time of the crime.all examining psychiatrists agreed that at the time of the stabbing,richard lacked the capacity to appreciate the nature and consequences of his actions,and that he was in need of institutional treatment because of the danger he presented to himself and others.in re david,at.richard was adjudicated not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect,and committed to the custody of the commissioner of mental health,pursuant to cpl.id.based on the new york supreme court findings,richard was classified as track,and committed to a secure facility in.at the time of his initial commitment,richard received a diagnosis of atypical psychosis,psychosexual disorder and substance abuse disorder.id.
after a series of retention orders,the state supreme court in ordered richard transferred to a facility because,although he remained mentally ill,he was no longer dangerously mentally ill.in,based on allegations whose truth and significance is disputed,the state court ordered richard returned to a secure facility under an emergency transfer order.
in,the state supreme court again concluded that richard no longer suffered from a dangerous mental disorder,but still qualified as mentally ill,and should be placed in a facility.see id.at.on appeal from the appellate division affirmance of the hearing court decision,the new york court of appeals first confirmed 
that there is a constitutionally required minimum level of dangerousness to oneself or others that must be shown before an insanity acquittee may be retained in a facility,and that a finding that an individual is mentally ill as defined under cpl d contemplates a degree of dangerousness that satisfies due process concerns.
id.that minimum level of dangerousness may be supported by evidence of violence,id.at,but 
a part from evidence of violence,retention of an insanity acquittee in a facility is justified where the state shows by a preponderance of the evidence that continued care and treatment are essential to the physical or psychological welfare of the individual and that the individual is unable to understand the need for such care and treatment.retention also may be supported by the need to prepare for a safe and stable transition from commitment to release.thus,in addition to recent acts of violence and the risk of harm to the defendant or others that would be occasioned by release from confinement,a court may consider the nature of the conduct that resulted in the initial commitment,the likelihood of relapse or a cure,history of substance or alcohol abuse,the effects of medication,the likelihood that the patient will discontinue medication without supervision,the length of confinement and treatment,the lapse of time since the underlying criminal acts and any other relevant factors that form a part of an insanity acquittee psychological profile.
id.on remand,in the state supreme court applied the david standard,and found that richard was mentally ill and dangerous and required confinement in a facility see in re richard.the appellate division affirmed,concluding that richard meets all the criteria for retention in a nonsecure facility.id.at.it found that the lower court findings of mental illness and dangerousness were supported by a strong preponderance of the credible evidence,and that the lower court implicitly concluded that richard is not cured,treatment is essential for his psychological welfare and the safety of others,and he is unable to comprehend the need for such treatment.id.it rejected as without merit richard contention that his continued confinement is improper absent a showing of volitional impairment or difficulty controlling his behavior.id.the new york court of appeals dismissed richard appeal of that decision.in re richard,table decision.
richard filed a habeas corpus petition in the united states district court for the northern district of new york on december,challenging the state courts failure to apply the united states supreme court holding in kansas crane to his case.in addition he argued that he had established by clear and convincing evidence that he does not have serious difficulty in controlling his behavior.on march,the united states magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation recommending that the petition be denied and a certificate of appealability issue.the district court adopted the report and recommendation,and issued a certificate of appealability on october.see richard carpinello,d,order adopting report and recommendation richard carpinello,order granting certificate of appealability.the court found no merit in richard argument that in order to confine an insanity acquittee,crane requires the state to prove not only that he is mentally ill and dangerous,but also that he has serious difficulty controlling his behavior.because the district court concluded that the state was not required to prove that richard has serious difficulty controlling his behavior,it did not address his second argument in any detail,noting only that richard had not rebutted by clear and convincing evidence the presumption that the state court factual determination was correct.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision to deny a petition for writ of habeas corpus,henry ricks,cir.when a state court has adjudicated the merits of a petitioner claim,a federal court may grant an application for a writ of habeas corpus only if the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d see also,brown alexander,cir.under d,a decision is contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent if its conclusion on a question of law is opposite to that of the supreme court or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court decision on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.id.quoting williams taylor,d.richard concedes that the state courts decision was not contrary to clearly established federal law,but argues that it involved an unreasonable refusal to extend or apply clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court in crane.
a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent if it correctly identifies the governing legal principle but unreasonably applies or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to the facts of a particular case.see williams,at.ramdass angelone,d accord kennaugh miller,cir see also yarborough alvarado,d certain principles are fundamental enough that when new factual permutations arise,the necessity to apply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt.b ear ing in mind that unreasonable is not synonymous with incorrect,serrano fischer,cir,the unreasonable application standard requires s ome increment of incorrectness beyond error although the increment need not be great.francis stone,cir.
under d,a state court determination of a factual issue is presumed to be correct,and the petitioner bears the burden of rebutting the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.e see also,brown,at.
ii.due process claim 
the united states supreme court has long held that the due process clause allows an insanity acquittee to be confined as long as he is both mentally ill and dangerous,but no longer.foucha louisiana,d accord jones united states,d the committed acquittee is entitled to release when he has recovered his sanity or is no longer dangerous.although insanity acquittees may be initially committed based on a preponderance of the evidence rather than by clear and convincing evidence,see jones,at,with respect to the requirement that a state demonstrate both mental illness and dangerousness,the supreme court does not distinguish between civil commitment candidates and insanity acquittees.see id.at.citing donaldson,d,a civil commitment case,in support of its holding that an insanity acquittee is entitled to release when he has recovered his sanity or is no longer dangerous.
in and,the supreme court considered the constitutionality of civil commitment of dangerous sexual offenders under the kansas sexually violent predator act,in kansas hendricks,d,and kansas crane,d.the kansas act established procedures for the civil commitment of sexually violent predators,defined as persons who have been convicted of or charged with a sexually violent offense and who suffer from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes them likely to engage in the sic predatory acts of sexual violence.stat.ann.a see hendricks,at.
in hendricks,the court noted that it had consistently upheld state involuntary commitment statutes when they have coupled proof of dangerousness with the proof of some additional factor,such as a mental illness or mental abnormality.at.it reasoned that the statutory requirement of the existence of certain mental conditions that make one likely to engage in acts of sexual violence serve s to limit involuntary civil confinement to those who suffer from a volitional impairment rendering them dangerous beyond their control.id.it concluded that the kansas act requires a finding of future dangerousness,and then links that finding to the existence of a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes it difficult,if not impossible,for the person to control his dangerous behavior.id.the statutory requirement of a mental abnormality or personality disorder rendered the kansas act consistent with the requirements of other statutes upheld by the supreme court in that it narrows the class of persons eligible for confinement to those who are unable to control their dangerousness.id.
hendricks thus did not limit the availability of involuntary commitment to those suffering from mental illness.if the individual has a mental abnormality or a personality disorder that renders him unable to control his dangerousness,thus linking his mental condition to a determination of future dangerousness,he may constitutionally be confined until his condition no longer causes him to be a threat to others.id.at.
in crane,the supreme court addressed the degree of inability to control one dangerousness that will satisfy substantive due process.the court rejected the argument that a state must demonstrate complete lack of control,and it rejected the argument that a state need not make any determination.crane,at.acknowledging that inability to control one behavior is an imprecise concept,the court deferred to the science of psychiatry and the will of the legislature to define the mental conditions that allow the state to seek involuntary commitment.id.at.it held only that in cases where lack of control is at issue,there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior.id.because the state high court had held that civil commitment under the kansas act required a separate finding that an individual is unable to control his behavior,the united states supreme court vacated the judgment and remanded for further proceedings.id.at.
application of kansas crane to insanity acquittees 
we address first the state contention that kansas crane does not govern due process standards for insanity acquittees.although crane and its predecessor hendricks specifically addressed the involuntary commitment of two convicted sex offenders nearing the end of their prison sentences,the kansas act applies not only to convicted sex offenders,but also to those who have been found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty because of a mental disease or defect.see hendricks,at.describing the structure of the kansas act civil commitment procedures.
the supreme court began its analysis of the constitutionality of the kansas act by citing foucha,an insanity acquittee case,for the general principle that an individual due process right to freedom from phy
