on october,jackson filed his habeas petition,raising the atkins and asserting that 
jackson is retarded as that concept is defined in atkins subaverage intellectual functioning and also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication,and that became manifest before age.the facts and diagnoses delineated in jackson ineffective assistance claim demonstrate that jackson has both the functioning and adaptive problems required for the finding,as well as it being clear that this was established before age.
pet.quotation omitted.norris filed a motion for summary judgment,contending,as relevant here,that the atkins claim failed because it was procedurally defaulted as jackson did not invoke arkansas code annotated d,which provides a procedure by which a defendant can show that he is mentally retarded and avoid the death penalty,and without merit.on january,the district court dismissed the atkins claim as procedurally defaulted because jackson had not presented a mental retardation defense to the death penalty available to him under arkansas law.see ann.precluding the execution of the mentally retarded.the court denied jackson motion for a certificate of appealability.
we granted jackson a certificate of appealability solely on the atkins claim and,in jackson i,reversed the district court dismissal of the claim in light of simpson norris,cir,cert.denied,and remanded the matter to the district court for further proceedings.jackson i,app x at.on remand,the district court issued an order directing jackson to respond to norris summary judgment motion on the merits of the atkins claim.jackson filed a response and a motion for discovery and funds to retain experts.
on january,the district court granted summary judgment to norris,dismissing the atkins claim on the merits.the court correctly observed that there is no uniform federal standard for mental retardation,see sasser norris,cir,cert.denied.atkins actually does not define mental retardation,leaving the development of the new constitutional restriction to the states.citing atkins,at,and purported to apply arkansas definition of mental retardation,see ann.a.
the arkansas standard for mental retardation has three prongs s ignificantly subaverage general intellectual functioning manifest ing no later than eighteen years of age,a significant deficit or impairment in adaptive functioning manifest ing no later than age eighteen years of age,and a deficit in adaptive behavior.id.a.the defendant bears the burden of proving each prong by a preponderance of the evidence.id.c.the district court determined that jackson had arguably presented allegations sufficient to create a fact question as to the first prong.however,the court concluded that jackson had failed to show a fact question on the second prong.the court did not mention or address the third prong.
in addressing the second prong,the court correctly defined adaptive functioning according to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ed.text revision hereinafter adaptive functioning refers to how effectively individuals cope with common life demands and how well they meet the standards of personal independence expected of someone in their particular age group,sociocultural background,and community setting.at.the second prong is met if an individual has significant limitations in at least two of the following skill areas communication,home living,skills,use of community resources,functional academic skills,work,leisure,health,and safety.id.at.the district court determined that jackson allegations only demonstrated a significant impairment in one skill academic skills.the court further observed that jackson could drive,maintained a neat appearance,took the necessary steps to effect a legal name change,and made use of available resources such as administrative grievance procedures and federal laws to seek relief when he believes his rights have been violated.the court further noted that the transcript of jackson custodial interview relating to the colclasure murder as well as his deposition testimony in his litigation established that he was not mentally retarded within the meaning of atkins.
the district court determined that an atkins hearing was not warranted,concluding that,even if jackson factual allegations were true,he had failed to demonstrate that he was entitled to habeas relief.in addition,the court denied jackson motion for discovery and funds for investigation and testing,determining that further evidentiary development was unnecessary because,in light of the undisputed record,additional testing and investigation would not enable jackson to prevail.the district court granted jackson motion for a certificate of appealability.
in this appeal,jackson argues that the district court erred by denying him an atkins hearing because under sasser,he is entitled to such a hearing as a matter of law,and even if he is not entitled to an atkins hearing as a matter of law,he has made the requisite showing for such a hearing.alternatively,jackson contends that,even if he was not entitled to an atkins hearing,the district court erred in granting summary judgment to norris on the atkins claim because he had presented sufficient evidence to generate a genuine issue of fact as to whether he is mentally retarded within the meaning of atkins.
we first address whether jackson was entitled to an atkins hearing.where,as here,an atkins hearing is not barred by u.e we review a district court denial of an atkins hearing for abuse of discretion.see johnston luebbers,cir.a district court does not abuse its discretion where such a hearing would not assist in the resolution of the atkins claim.id.quotation omitted.
jackson asserts that he is entitled to an atkins hearing,as a matter of law,under sasser.because sasser relies heavily on our decision in simpson,we begin our analysis with simpson.in simpson,the petitioner,a prisoner under sentence of death in the state of arkansas,sought habeas relief on an eighth amendment claim under atkins that his mental retardation made him ineligible for the death penalty.at.after reversing the district court decision that simpson had procedurally defaulted his atkins claim,we remanded the matter for an atkins hearing,explaining 
where the facts are in dispute,the federal court in habeas corpus must hold an evidentiary hearing if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court.townsend sain,overruled on other grounds,keeney.simpson has alleged that he is mentally retarded as atkins defines that condition,which would entitle him to relief,and that matter remains in dispute.since his inability to present his atkins claim in state court precluded him from receiving a full and fair evidentiary hearing there,he satisfies the conditions outlined in townsend.
