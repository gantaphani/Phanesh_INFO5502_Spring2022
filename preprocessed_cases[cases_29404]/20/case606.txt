opinion of the court 
barry,circuit judge.
more than twenty years ago,jermont cox was convicted in the court of common pleas of philadelphia county of murder and related charges.in,he filed a petition in the district court for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court dismissed the petition in,finding that all but one of cox claims were procedurally defaulted due to counsel failure to pursue them in cox proceeding in state court and that the one preserved claim lacked merit.we affirmed.in,the supreme court of the united states decided martinez ryan,which announced an exception to longstanding precedent and found that,under certain circumstances,and for purposes of habeas review,counsel failure to raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims could excuse a procedural default of those claims.within three months of that decision,cox filed a motion under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure for relief from the order dismissing his habeas petition.the district court denied the motion,finding that the intervening change in law occasioned by martinez,without more,did not provide cause for relief.
we agree that,for relief to be granted under rule b,more than the concededly important change of law wrought by martinez is required indeed,much more is required.ultimately,as with any motion for b relief,what must be shown are extraordinary circumstances where,without such relief,an extreme and unexpected hardship would occur.sawka healtheast,cir accord budget blinds,white,cir.but what those extraordinary circumstances would or could be in the context of martinez was neither offered to the district court by the parties nor discussed by the court,although,to be sure,at that point there had been little case law to inform any such discussion.
we will vacate the order of the district court and remand to provide the court the opportunity to consider cox rule b motion with the benefit of whatever guidance it may glean from this opinion and from any additional briefing it may order.we note at the outset that one of the critical factors in the equitable and nature of the b analysis on which we now embark is whether the b motion under review was brought within a reasonable time of the martinez decision.see.c.it is not disputed that the timing of the b motion before us filed,as it was,roughly ninety days after martinez is close enough to that decision to be deemed reasonable.still,though not an issue before us,it is important that we acknowledge and,indeed,we warn that,unless a petitioner motion for b relief based on martinez was brought within a reasonable time of that decision,the motion will fail.
procedural history 
recognizing that more than twenty years of procedural history has brought us to this point,it is,nonetheless,important that that history be recounted.we will attempt to be succinct,if not laserlike,in our recitation.
on october,following a bench trial before the carolyn engel temin of the court of common pleas of philadelphia county,cox was convicted of murder,criminal conspiracy,and possession of an instrument of crime in connection with the july,shooting death of lawrence davis,and was sentenced to life imprisonment.
in a statement he gave to the police at the time of his arrest,cox confessed to shooting davis,but said that the shooting had been accidental.he and a friend,larry lee,he said,had gone to a drug house operated by lee.while they were outside drinking,lee got into a dispute with davis that escalated into a physical altercation.at some point,lee handed cox a gun that was already cocked.cox shot twice,hitting davis,and then handed the gun back to lee.according to cox,he later told family members that the shooting had been an accident.
to prove at trial that cox had the requisite intent for murder,the commonwealth presented the testimony of kimberly little,an eyewitness.little testified that cox and lee worked for a drug organization that was run out of an apartment in her building cox was a lookout and lee supplied the operation drugs.on the night of davis death,little saw from her window an argument erupt between davis and lee.according to little,cox then exited a local bar with a of beer,approached the two men,placed the on the hood of lee nearby car,retrieved a gun from the car,walked to within four feet of davis,and shot him three times.cox stopped to drink a beer,and he and lee left in lee car.
the commonwealth other witnesses were kimberly little sister,mary little the medical examiner and a ballistics expert.mary little confirmed that cox and lee were neighborhood drug dealers and that she saw them drive off together after the shooting.the medical examiner asserted that davis had four wounds caused by at least three bullets,and the ballistics expert explained that it was unlikely the shooting was accidental given the number of shots fired.
trial counsel filed motions on cox behalf.cox also filed a motion pro se alleging trial counsel ineffectiveness and requesting the appointment of new counsel.in february of,judge temin held a hearing on the motions.at the hearing,cox testified in support of his pro se motion and outlined trial counsel alleged failings trial counsel failed to present testimony from various character witnesses failed to find a witness,identified by cox,who would have testified that guys from the neighborhood forced kimberly little to give a false statement to the police,failed to review paperwork that cox provided him and dissuaded cox from taking the stand in his own defense.in response,trial counsel stated that he found himself in a very untenable position and asked that he be permitted to withdraw.judge temin denied the request as well as the pro se motion,finding cox claims of ineffectiveness to lack merit.she later denied the counseled motions.
cox,still represented by trial counsel,appealed his conviction,challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and the admission of evidence relating to uncharged drug activity.in june of,the pennsylvania superior court affirmed the judgment of sentence.cox then filed a pro se petition for allocatur in the pennsylvania supreme court,raising claims of trial counsel ineffective assistance at the trial and on appeal.new counsel was appointed for cox and submitted a supplemental allocatur petition.the supreme court denied allocatur in april of 
the following month,cox filed a pro se petition under pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.ann.the attorney who had represented cox in his petition to the pennsylvania supreme court was again appointed to represent cox in his collateral review proceeding under pcra.counsel filed an amended pcra petition asserting claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel judge temin,sitting as the pcra court,held a hearing at which pcra counsel chose to proceed on only one of the multiple claims of trial counsel ineffectiveness failure to impeach the littles with their criminal records and motive to curry favor with the commonwealth to gain leniency in their own cases.
on august,judge temin denied postconviction relief,finding that cox had not been prejudiced by trial counsel failure to impeach kimberly and mary little with their criminal records because evidence aside from their testimony established his guilt.the superior court affirmed in july of and the supreme court denied allocatur in december of that year.cox filed a second pcra petition pro se,alleging ineffective assistance claims against trial and pcra counsel.judge temin dismissed the petition as untimely,and the superior court affirmed after cox failed to file a brief.
in october of,cox,now represented by the federal defender,filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court.the petition raised eight grounds for relief six claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel one violation of brady maryland,and a claim of cumulative error.in july of,a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation r r in which he determined that the ineffective assistance claims abandoned by pcra counsel before the pcra court,as well as the brady and cumulative error claims,were procedurally defaulted.he reviewed the remaining claim of ineffective assistance trial counsel failure to impeach the littles with their criminal records and concluded that the superior court decision rejecting that claim was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of established federal law.quoting d.cox filed objections to the r r,arguing that pcra counsel unilateral decision to abandon claims constituted cause to overcome the procedural default bar.in august of,the district court rejected cox objections,adopted the r r,and dismissed the habeas petition we affirmed on appeal.cox horn,app x cir.
six years later,on june,cox filed a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b seeking relief from the district court order of dismissal due to the intervening change in procedural law occasioned by the march,decision of the supreme court of the united states in martinez ryan.the court held in martinez that,under certain circumstances,error by counsel can constitute cause to overcome the procedural default of claims alleging trial counsel ineffective assistance.cox argued that it was only due to pcra counsel ineffective assistance at the initial pcra proceeding that his claims of ineffectiveness against trial counsel had been abandoned and were now procedurally defaulted.
on may,the district court denied cox motion,finding that martinez change of law,without more,was not cause for relief.in a separate july,order,the district court issued a certificate of appealability on the legal question of whether the change in law resulting from martinez constitutes extraordinary circumstances that would warrant relief under rule b.

iii.analysis 
a.the martinez rule 
when reviewing a state prisoner petition for a writ of habeas corpus,a federal court normally can not review a federal claim for relief that has already been rejected by a state court on the basis of an independent and adequate state procedural rule.walker martin,coleman thompson.a petitioner may obtain federal review of a procedurally defaulted claim,however,if he demonstrates cause for the default and prejudice arising from the violation of federal law.martinez.at citing coleman,at.
when cox habeas petition was initially under review by the district court,the governing rule,as recognized in coleman,was that error by counsel in state proceedings could not serve as cause sufficient to excuse procedural default of a petitioner claim.see coleman,at sweger.chesney,cir.the supreme court carved out a significant exception to that rule nearly eight years after cox petition was denied when,in,it decided martinez.
in martinez,the supreme court held that,where state law requires a prisoner to raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in a collateral proceeding,rather than on direct review,a procedural default of those claims will not bar their review by a federal habeas court if three conditions are met a the default was caused by ineffective assistance of counsel or the absence of counsel b in the collateral proceeding,the first collateral proceeding in which the claim could be heard and c the underlying claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness is substantial,meaning the claim has some merit,analogous to the substantiality requirement for a certificate of appealability.martinez.at.the court adopted this equitable ruling for several reasons.id.at.first,t he right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial is a bedrock principle in our justice system vital to ensuring the fairness of an adversarial trial.id.at.second,a prisoner can not realistically vindicate that right through a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel without an effective attorney to aid in the investigation and presentation of the claim.id.finally,if the lack of effective counsel in an collateral proceeding could not excuse the federal procedural default bar,no court state or federal would ever review the defendant ineffective assistance claims,given that they were first brought in that collateral proceeding.id.at.
the majority in martinez noted that it was propounding a narrow,id.at,limited qualification to coleman,id.at.even so,what the court did was significant.see,id.at scalia,dissenting criticizing martinez as a radical alteration of habeas jurisprudence lopez ryan,cir martinez constitutes a remarkable if limited,development in the court equitable jurisprudence.citation omitted.
in trevino thaler,issued the following term,the supreme court clarified that the martinez rule applied not only to states that expressly denied permission to raise ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal such as arizona,which martinez addressed,but also to states in which it was virtually impossible,as a practical matter,to assert an ineffective assistance claim before collateral review.id.at quotation marks omitted.texas law,at issue in trevino,ostensibly permitted though it did not require criminal defendants to raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims on direct appeal.in practice,however,texas criminal justice system did not offer most defendants a meaningful opportunity to do so.id.at.as the texas courts themselves had observed,trial records often lacked information necessary to substantiate ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims,and motion filing deadlines,coupled with the lack of readily available transcripts,generally precluded raising an ineffective assistance claim in a motion.moreover,the texas courts had invited,and even directed,defendants to wait to pursue such claims until collateral review.the court conclude d that where,as in texas,state procedural framework,by reason of its design and operation,makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal,the holding in martinez applies.id.
cox rule b motion 
rule b is a provision that authorizes a court to grant relief from a final judgment for any reason other than those listed elsewhere in the rule.b.as we noted at the outset,courts are to dispense their broad powers under b only in extraordinary circumstances where,without such relief,an extreme and unexpected hardship would occur.sawka,at.
days after the supreme court issued its decision in martinez,cox filed a motion under rule b,seeking to reopen his federal habeas proceeding based on the significant change in procedural law caused by the decision.in ruling on cox motion,the district court noted that neither the supreme court nor our court had decided whether the rule announced in martinez constituted an extraordinary circumstance sufficient in and of itself to support a b motion and observed a divide among the courts of appeals that had addressed the issue.the court explained that the fifth circuit,in adams thaler,cir,held that a change in law,including the change announced in martinez,can never be the basis of b relief.in contrast,it said,the ninth circuit had left open the possibility that martinez,assessed together with other factors on a basis,could justify b relief.citing lopez.joining what it viewed to be the position of every other district court in our circuit to have opined on the impact of martinez,the court adopt ed the reasoning of the fifth circuit to hold that martinez change of law,without more,was insufficient to warrant relief under b.
although we agree with the district court ultimate conclusion that martinez,without more,is an insufficient basis for reopening a habeas petition,such as cox,we can not endorse the path it took to arrive at that conclusion.for one thing,adams is not concordant with our precedent applying rule b.for another,we can not determine from what it wrote whether the court considered factors if any there be beyond martinez jurisprudential change in assessing cox request for relief.to the extent the court adopt ed the reasoning of adams and there stopped its inquiry,it did not employ the full,analysis we require when faced with a b motion,although,as we have already noted,little was offered by the parties in that regard.
whether martinez is itself an extraordinary circumstance 
because it was a focal point of the district court reasoning,we begin with a discussion of the fifth circuit decision in adams thaler.in adams,as in this case,the district court dismissed a habeas petitioner ineffective assistance of counsel claims as procedurally defaulted under state law,finding that errors by state counsel could not excuse the default.following the supreme court decision in martinez,the petitioner,who had been sentenced to death in texas state court,filed a rule b motion seeking relief from the order dismissing his habeas petition.the petitioner pointed to several factors that,in combination,established extraordinary circumstances and entitled him to b relief the jurisprudential sea change in federal habeas corpus law occasioned by martinez the fact that his case had resulted in a death sentence and the equitable imperative that the true merit of his claims be heard.adams,at.he also filed a motion for a stay of execution pending the district court resolution of his b motion.the district court granted the stay of execution.
the fifth circuit vacated that order as an abuse of the district court discretion,given that the petitioner had not shown a likelihood of success on his rule b motion.the court determined that the b motion would not succeed because,under fifth circuit precedent,a change in decisional law after entry of judgment does not constitute exceptional circumstances and is not alone grounds for relief from a final judgment.id.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.that proposition flowed from prior fifth circuit cases,which stated that changes in decisional law do not constitute the extraordinary circumstances required for granting rule b relief.hess cockrell,cir accord hernandez thaler,cir per curiam.concluding that martinez was simply a change in decisional law and its development of procedural default principles was hardly extraordinary,the adams court denied b relief without examining any of the petitioner individual circumstances.adams,at internal quotation marks omitted.
adams does not square with our approach to rule b.
as an initial matter,we have not embraced any categorical rule that a change in decisional law is never an adequate basis for rule b relief.rather,we have consistently articulated a more qualified position that intervening changes in the law rarely justify relief from final judgments under b.see,reform party of allegheny cnty.allegheny cnty.dep t of elections,cir en banc i ntervening developments in the law by themselves rarely constitute the extraordinary circumstances required for relief under rule b.quoting agostini felton,emphasis added morris,at same.stated somewhat differently,we have not foreclosed the possibility that a change in controlling precedent,even standing alone,might give reason for b relief.see wilson fenton,cir per curiam a decision of the supreme court of the united states or a court of appeals may provide the extraordinary circumstances for granting a rule b motion.
even if there is not much daylight between the never position of the fifth circuit and the rarely position that we have staked out,adams differs from our precedent in yet another significant respect its failure to consider the full set of facts and circumstances attendant to the rule b motion under review.the fifth circuit in adams ended its analysis after determining that martinez change in the law was an insufficient basis for b relief and did not consider whether the capital nature of the petitioner case or any other factor might counsel that martinez be accorded heightened significance in his case or provide a reason or reasons for granting b relief.indeed,the court did not address in any meaningful way the petitioner claim that he was not offering martinez alone as a basis for relief.in diaz stephens,cir,the fifth circuit later acknowledged that adams and its other precedent had not cited additional equitable factors as bearing on the analysis of extraordinary circumstances under rule b.see also id.at.the fact that the petitioner b motion was predicated chiefly on a postjudgment change in the law was the singular,dispositive issue for the adams court.
we have not taken that route.instead,we have long employed a flexible,multifactor approach to rule b motions,including those built upon a change in the law,that takes into account all the particulars of a movant case.see coltec,hobgood,cir noting,in the context of a b analysis,the propriety of explicit ly considering equitable factors in addition to a change in law lasky cont l prods,cir citing multiple factors a district court may consider in assessing a motion under b the fundamental point of b is that it provides a grand reservoir of equitable power to do justice in a particular case.hall cmty.mental health,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a movant,of course,bears the burden of establishing entitlement to such equitable relief,which,again,will be granted only under extraordinary circumstances.mayberry maroney,cir.but a district court must consider the full measure of any properly presented facts and circumstances attendant to the movant request.
the commonwealth appellees contend that gonzalez crosby,effectively displaced our flexible approach in the habeas context and precludes rule b relief based on a change in law,including martinez.in gonzalez,the district court dismissed a petitioner habeas petition as barred by the statute of limitations of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,d.it found that the limitations period was not tolled while his second state motion was pending because the motion was untimely and successive and,therefore,had not been properly filed.id.at.the eleventh circuit denied a certificate of appealability and the petitioner did not seek subsequent review of that decision.several months later,the supreme court rejected the district court reasoning in artuz bennett,and held that an application for state relief can be properly filed even if it was dismissed by the state as procedurally barred.the petitioner then filed a b motion citing artuz as an extraordinary circumstance.the supreme court rejected his argument.noting that the circumstances warranting b relief would rarely occur in the habeas context,gonzalez,at,the court opined that not every interpretation of the federal statutes setting forth the requirements for habeas provides cause for reopening cases long since final,id.at.it was hardly extraordinary that the district court interpretation of aedpa,which was correct under the eleventh circuit precedent,was subsequently rejected in a different case.id.at.
the eleventh circuit,describing gonzalez,has observed that,in that opinion,the supreme court told us that a change in decisional law is insufficient to create the extraordinary circumstance necessary to invoke rule b.arthur thomas,th cir citing gonzalez,at.relying on gonzalez,the eleventh circuit in arthur,just as the fifth circuit in adams,went on to hold that the change in the decisional law affected by the martinez rule is not an extraordinary circumstance sufficient to invoke rule b.id.the commonwealth appellees cite the eleventh circuit decision in an effort to persuade us that,in light of gonzalez,we should abandon our approach to b motions.
we are not persuaded.we believe that the eleventh circuit extracts too broad a principle from gonzalez,which does not answer the question before us.gonzalez did not say that a new interpretation of the federal habeas statutes much less,the equitable principles invoked to aid their enforcement is always insufficient to sustain a rule b motion.gonzalez merely highlights,in action,the position of both the supreme court and this court that i ntervening developments in the law by themselves rarely constitute the extraordinary circumstances required for relief under r
