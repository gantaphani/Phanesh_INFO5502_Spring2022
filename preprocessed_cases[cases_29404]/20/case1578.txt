the incident for which johnson was tried involved the kidnapping of and assault on his former girlfriend,keesha groves.in september of,groves visited johnson mother,who had agreed to babysit groves son.johnson and his mother had just been in a big argument.his mother told groves about this altercation and suggested that groves take him somewhere for a little while to cool off.people johnson.
after groves and johnson ran some errands and had dinner,groves drove back to the home of johnson mother.instead of leaving the car when they arrived,however,johnson began to badger groves about their relationship and about groves recent purchase of a new home.johnson then grabbed the car keys and,when groves left to call her brother for a ride home,johnson threatened to kill her brother.id.
when groves attempted to walk away,johnson shoved her,blocked her way,and threatened her with a stick.id.groves then went into the house to make a telephone call,but left because she feared that johnson would strike his mother.johnson caught up with her when she tried to run away.after johnson threatened to kill groves if she did not return to the car,she and her son got in.johnson first drove to a gas station and then to a party store to buy some beer.with groves still in the car,johnson drank the beer in his mother driveway.he offered to return groves car keys if she had sex with him.although she did so,johnson still did not return the keys.id.
johnson then drove groves and her son to groves new house,where the three slept on the floor.in order to prevent groves from escaping,johnson physically restrained groves son.groves drove johnson to work the following morning at johnson insistence.a police officer pulled the vehicle over for a traffic violation,but groves did not alert the officer to her situation.when they arrived at johnson place of employment,johnson requested the day off and got back into the car.id.
the two of them continued to drive around,with johnson thwarting groves attempt to get help from a truck driver by holding groves son hostage and then attempting to choke her.id.at.finally,groves talked johnson into taking her back to his mother house.although johnson told groves to lie to the police about what had happened,groves promptly went to the police station and reported the incident.id.
procedural background 
johnson was charged with one count of criminal sexual conduct in violation of.stat.ann.f,one count of felonious assault in violation of.stat.ann,two counts of kidnapping in violation of.stat.ann,and one count of domestic violence in violation of.stat.ann.johnson,at.
during the questioning of potential jurors,which was conducted in april of,the trial judge asked them are there any among you who have been previously a victim of a crime id.at.juror said that she ha d been assaulted,but did not elaborate.id.when the district court then asked whether that experience would interfere with your ability to listen to the facts of this case and decide this case from the evidence here,the juror answered n o,i can keep it separate.id.
johnson counsel later asked whether any of the potential jurors had been threatened with a weapon.id.juror revealed that she had been hit in the head with a gun as a teenager but could disregard the experience.id.but she failed to disclose a domestic violence charge that she had filed in a michigan state court claiming that she was assaulted with a gun in november of,approximately five months before the voir dire.she was then years old according to an application for a order that she had filed approximately one year prior to the voir dire.
juror did not respond to several more general questions put to the panel of potential jurors.these questions included the trial court inquiry as to whether there was any reason that the jurors should not serve in the case,the prosecutor question as to whether any of the jurors would have difficulty sitting on a jury in a and domestic violence case,and the defense counsel questions about whether the potential jurors had anything weighing on their minds that would prevent the jurors full attention or whether they would want themselves as a juror if they were the one on trial.id.
although the jury acquitted johnson on the and charges,johnson was convicted on both counts of kidnapping and on one count of domestic violence.id.at.johnson subsequently learned that,at the time of his trial,juror was the complaining witness in a domestic violence case that was currently being prosecuted by the same prosecutor office.id.at.the state trial court denied johnson motion for a new trial,noting that although juror had disclosed that she had been a victim of an assault in the past,she had said that she would be able to judge the case fairly.id.at.
on appeal,the judgment was affirmed by the michigan court of appeals,which concluded that juror had not concealed information during voir dire.id.at.likewise,the court of appeals rejected johnson claim,stating that there was no reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been any different even if johnson attorney had inquired further about juror domestic violence experiences.id.at.the michigan supreme court,with two justices dissenting,denied johnson leave to appeal.people johnson.
johnson then brought a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.with the court permission,johnson introduced new evidence showing that juror had been the complaining witness in four other domestic violence cases in the years before the voir dire was conducted.juror assailant,who was the same in all five cases,was charged with domestic violence against juror in january of,domestic violence in march of,felonious assault in november of,domestic violence in december of,and both felonious assault and domestic violence in january of.he was convicted in every case except the first.
although the district court admitted evidence of the four additional charges,its opinion did not discuss any evidence beyond what johnson had submitted in his motion for a new trial before the state trial court.the district court reasoned that juror had not concealed her experiences because she was never specifically asked whether she had been the victim of a domestic assault,and concluded that johnson had failed to show actual bias.juror failure to disclose her experience of being threatened with a gun in november of was not explicitly addressed in the district court opinion.in ruling on johnson claim,the district court concluded that the failure of his counsel to further inquire about juror experiences did not constitute ineffective assistance.the district court therefore denied johnson petition for a writ of habeas corpus.it did,however,grant a certificate of appealability on the issues of juror bias and ineffective assistance of counsel.johnson timely appeal followed.
