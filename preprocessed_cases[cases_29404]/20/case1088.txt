randy edward goodrum appeals the district court summary judgment denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.goodrum petition was based solely on the state alleged denial of his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial.because we agree with the district court that the state court rejection of goodrum speedy trial claim was not objectively unreasonable,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on october,goodrum was charged in harris county under two separate indictments for aggravated sexual assault.another harris county indictment against goodrum for aggravated sexual assault was filed on may.before these indictments were issued,goodrum had been arrested in brazoria county for another charge of aggravated sexual assault.he was tried on that offense,and,on september,was adjudged guilty,sentenced to life in prison,and transferred to the texas department of criminal justice.
goodrum received a letter dated november,notifying him that harris county had lodged a detainer against him under the indictments.two days later,goodrum sent a letter to the harris county district attorney office in which he expressly invoked his right to a speedy trial and requested that he be bench warranted to harris county to answer to those charges.he also stated that the detainers were detrimental to his incarceration.goodrum sent similar letters to the district attorney on march,and may.he received no response.
on january,goodrum sent to the harris county district clerk a request for information regarding the pending indictments,in particular,the names of the complainants,the dates of the offenses,probable cause affidavits,the court number where the cases were pending,and copies of the indictments.the district clerk responded with a letter invoking a state law which exempts governmental bodies from complying with a request for information from,among other persons,an individual imprisoned in a correctional facility.
on october,goodrum sent yet another letter,this time addressed to the district attorney himself.in that letter,goodrum referenced his previous letters and again requested that he be bench warranted to harris county.he also mentioned that he was concerned about the impact of the delay on his ability to mount a defense.the district attorney did not respond.
by march,goodrum had been bench warranted to houston,had appeared in court,and had filed a motion to dismiss the indictments for violation of his right to speedy trial.the trial court conducted two hearings on goodrum motion on may,and june.goodrum and his mother testified that goodrum was worried and concerned about the charges while they were pending.the evidence presented by goodrum also reflects that the detainers rendered him ineligible for ssi approval for a job in the prison library,precluded him from taking vocational courses,and disqualified him from taking college classes for free.additionally,goodum testified that the presence of the detainers precluded him from being considered for trustee status.he conceded,however,that even without the detainers his qualification for such status was subject to the approval of prison officials.the state did not controvert any of these contentions.
goodrum asserted that the delay impaired his defense.goodrum contended that the brazoria county conviction became final in and therefore became available to impeach him if he were to testify in his own behalf however,the state stipulated that it would not use that conviction to impeach goodrum if he were to testify in his own defense,although it might rely on it to enhance his sentence.
the trial court ruled that goodrum had failed sufficiently to establish prejudice resulting from the delay and denied his motion to dismiss.goodrum later entered a plea of nolo contendere to three charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon,conditioned upon his ability to appeal the denial of his speedy trial claim and in exchange for a sentence of years in prison and the dismissal of a fourth charge.the trial court certified his right to appeal the ruling on the motion to dismiss 
goodrum appealed.the texas court of appeals applied the balancing test from barker and affirmed the trial court ruling that the state had not violated goodrum right to a speedy trial noting that goodrum had been indicted in october and may,but was imprisoned in and being tried in brazoria county until september,the court concluded that the length of the delay was well beyond that which triggered examination of the remaining barker factors and weighed this factor heavily against the state.the court then found the record to be silent as to the reasons for the delay,and declined to presume either intentional delay by the state or valid reason for the delay.accordingly,the court weighed the reasons for the delay against the state,but not heavily so.because the court agreed that goodrum persistently demanded his right to a speedy trial in a timely manner,it also weighed goodrum assertion of the right in his favor 
finally,the court addressed the various forms of prejudice alleged by goodrum.regarding goodrum asserted anxiety and concern over the pending charges,the court noted recent authority from the texas court of criminal appeals stat ing that as goodrum was incarcerated most of the time in question,we are mainly concerned with whether or not his ability to defend himself was prejudiced by the delay.in a footnote,the court also acknowledged goodrum asserted worsened prison conditions due to his loss of eligibility for certain jobs,trustee status,and free schooling the court distinguished goodrum circumstances from those in a state court case where the loss of trustee status and educational opportunities was associated with the defendant loss of good time credit and impliedly rejected these detriments as not probative of prejudice 
the final contention the court addressed was the alleged impairment of goodrum defense.goodrum had argued that during the relevant period his conviction in brazoria county became final and was therefore available to impeach his testimony.the court,however,focused on goodrum twelve to thirteen prior felony convictions,the last of which was in.although goodrum asserted that these prior convictions were too remote to be admitted under state rules of evidence,the court disagreed.the court reasoned that texas rule of evidence a excepts from the rule against admission of felony convictions over years old any such conviction if the witness lack of reformation is shown by evidence of an intervening felony conviction.thus,the admissibility of goodrum numerous other prior felonies for impeachment purposes greatly lessen ed any prejudice attributable to the brazoria county conviction having rejected all the forms of prejudice alleged by goodrum,the court weighed this factor in favor of the state,and concluded that the balance of factors weighs against a finding that goodrum right to a speedy trial was impaired.
the texas court of criminal appeals denied goodrum petition for review.goodrum did not file a state habeas petition,but filed a petition for habeas relief in federal district court.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the state and dismissed goodrum habeas petition.the court opinion largely tracked that of the state appeals court,except for the portion dealing with goodrum arguments relating to prejudice in that latter part of the opinion,the district court noted in pertinent part goodrum assertions of undue anxiety and concern caused by the delay that the state did not challenge and which the court viewed to have been established by goodrum pleadings regarding the availability of the brazoria county conviction for impeachment purposes,the district court deferred to the state court evidentiary ruling regarding the admissibility of goodrum numerous other prior convictions,explaining it was bound by that finding the court also noted the state stipulation that it would not use the conviction in brazoria county to impeach goodrum testimony if he chose to testify at trial.thus,goodrum had not shown that the delay resulted in the potential use of otherwise inadmissible criminal convictions against him for impeachment purposes.addressing goodrum ineligibility for job assignments,educational programs,and preferential custody status,together with his uncontroverted anxiety and concern,the court explained 
in short,the record shows that the delay resulted in petitioner experiencing anxiety and concern,and being ineligible to participate in certain prison programs.the importance of these results is not without significance but,in a balance of all four barker factors,it can not be said that petitioner constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated 
the district court concluded that the state court did not unreasonably reject goodrum speedy trial claim and granted the state motion for summary judgment it also denied goodrum motion for a certificate of appealability,but we granted the certificate and authorized goodrum to file the instant appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment denying a state petitioner request for habeas relief.salazar dretke we may affirm a summary judgment on any ground supported by the record,even if it differs from that relied upon by the district court our review of the district court legal conclusions is de novo,but we review the court factual findings only for clear error.busby dretke 
entitlement to habeas relief was restricted by congress in by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act.as will be clear to the reader,the severity of that statute is demonstrated in this case.now a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court failed in one of two grounds.first,relief may be granted if the state court resolution of a petitioner claim on the merits was contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law as declared by the supreme court.d.a decision is contrary to federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor a state court application of clearly established federal law is unreasonable within the meaning of aedpa when it correctly identifies the governing principle but applies it to the facts of the case in an objectively unreasonable manner.wiggins smith an unreasonable application may also occur if the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from supreme court precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.thus,b efore this court may grant habeas relief under the unreasonable application clause,the state court application of clearly established federal law must be more than merely incorrect or erroneous,it must be objectively unreasonable.young dretke 
second,habeas relief is appropriate if the state court decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented to the state court however,the state court factual findings are presumed correct unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.reed quarterman 
iii.discussion 
though not addressed by the district court,we first note that goodrum has exhausted his speedy trial claim as generally required under aedpa.a state prisoner must present his claims to the state court and exhaust state remedies before seeking federal habeas relief.martinez johnson the exhaustion requirement is satisfied when the substance of the federal habeas claim has been fairly presented to the highest state court,either through direct appeal or state habeas proceedings.morris dretke here,goodrum sole claim on federal habeas is the asserted violation of his right to speedy trial,a claim that he presented in state court and pursued on direct appeal to the state highest court.goodrum has therefore exhausted his state law remedies,and we will therefore review the merits of the speedy trial claim.
goodrum contends that the district court erred in holding the state court rejection of his speedy trial claim was not objectively unreasonable or contrary to federal law.specifically,goodrum argues that the state court failed to accord due weight to his repeated assertion of his right to speedy trial throughout the pendency of the indictments,and failed appropriately to presume prejudice,or,in the alternative,to construe the uncontroverted proof of his anxiety and concern and loss of certain prison benefits and privileges as an adequate demonstration of prejudice.for the reasons that follow,we agree with the district court conclusion that the state court neither contravened nor unreasonably applied federal law when it denied goodrum speedy trial claim.
the right to a speedy trial is guaranteed by the sixth amendment and applies to state criminal proceedings through the fourteenth amendment.const.amend.vi klopfer north carolina a violation of the speedy trial right,if found,requires dismissal of the indictment.see strunk united states in barker,the supreme court prescribed several factors to be considered when evaluating a speedy trial claim the length of the delay,the reason for the delay,the defendant assertion of his right to speedy trial,and prejudice to the defendant none of these factors is either necessary or sufficient to find a speedy trial violation r ather,they are related factors and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.the speedy trial inquiry therefore involves a difficult and sensitive balancing of these factors under the particular circumstances of a given case 
because the state appellate court properly identified the barker test as the framework for analyzing goodrum speedy trial claim,aedpa limits our focus to the objective reasonableness of the result of the state court balancing of the barker factors under the facts in goodrum case.see santellan cockrell nonetheless,to facilitate our evaluation of the reasonableness of the state court decision,we will conduct a limited review of the state court analysis of each barker factor.we keep in mind,however,the fact that the state court preliminary conclusions regarding one or more of the factors,even if contrary to or objectively unreasonable in light of controlling supreme court precedent,are insufficient to grant habeas relief,so long as we find the ultimate decision reached by the state court not objectively unreasonable.jackson ray 
length of the delay 
the first barker factor,the length of the delay,consists of a inquiry.first,the delay must be extensive enough to give rise to a presumption of prejudice that triggers examination of the remaining barker factors.see doggett united states as the supreme court has observed,courts generally view a delay of approximately one year as sufficient to require a full barker analysis this is the rule in the fifth circuit.united states if this threshold showing is made,the court must examine the extent to which the delay extends beyond the bare minimum required to trigger a barker analysis,because the presumption that pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused intensifies over time.
the parties agree that the year delay between goodrum conviction in brazoria county on september,and his initial appearance in harris county on march,both exceeds the threshold required to trigger full consideration of the barker factors and weighs in goodrum favor.however,the state contends that,in concluding that this factor should weigh heavily against the state,the appellate court must have erroneously calculated the delay as the nearly period after the first harris county indictment issued on october,until his march initial appearance,including that period during which goodrum was being tried in brazoria county for a separate offense.
the state contention is belied by the opinion of the state appeals court.although the court observed that the harris county indictments were handed down in october and may,it emphasized that until september,goodrum was incarcerated and being tried in brazoria county this statement strongly suggests that the court excluded from its calculation that initial period during which goodrum was being prosecuted for the charge in brazoria county and based its analysis only on the years following goodrum conviction for that offense.moreover,given that the delay was more than double the minimum necessary to trigger the barker analysis,the state appeals court reasonably weighed this factor heavily in goodrum favor.
reason for the delay 
the weight assigned to a state reasons for delay depends on the reasons proffered at one extreme,a deliberate delay to disadvantage the defense is weighted heavily against the state at the other end of the spectrum,delays explained by valid reasons or attributable to the conduct of the defendant weigh in favor of the state.see cowart hargett between these extremes fall unexplained or negligent delays,which weigh against the state,but not heavily.
although goodrum at oral argument characterized the conduct of the state as grossly and not merely negligent,in his briefs he does not challenge the appeals court conclusion that t his factor weighs against the state,but not heavily so.we agree with the state court analysis.the state clearly knew of goodrum whereabouts during the years before his initial appearance in harris county,as is reflected by the state notice to goodrum regarding the detainers for the harris county charges and the numerous letters goodrum sent from prison to the district attorney office inquiring about the indictments.but for this factor to weigh heavily against the state,goodrum must have shown that the state delayed the prosecution in order to gain an impermissible advantage at trial.because the state proffered no explanation to justify the delay,and goodrum did not demonstrate deliberate conduct by the state the state court correctly declined to presume the delay was either intentional or justified.as such,the state unexplained failure expeditiously to bring goodrum to trial on the harris county charges supports the court finding of official negligence that weighs against the state,albeit not heavily.
assertion of the right 
based on the numerous letters sent by goodrum to the harris county district attorney office in which he vigorously and repeatedly asserted his right to speedy trial,goodrum contends that the state appeals court contravened clearly established supreme court precedent by failing to weigh this third barker factor strongly in his favor.the state appeals court noted that goodrum had persistently demanded his right to a speedy trial in a timely manner,viewed this factor to weigh in favor of goodrum,but did not specifically assign it heavy or strong weight the district court did not address this issue.
barker instructs that t he defendant assertion of his speedy trial right is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right.this is because the vigorousness with which a defendant complains about the delay will often correspond to the seriousness of the deprivation moreover,one justification articulated in barker for adopting a flexible balancing test is the ability of courts to vary the weight assigned to a defendant invocation of the right depending on its frequency and forcefulness accordingly,we have applied these clearly articulated principles from barker and construed vigorous and timely assertions of the right to speedy trial as weighing strongly or heavily in the defendant favor 
the evidence presented in the state court proceedings reflects that goodrum,within days of receiving notice of the detainers in harris county on november,and throughout the next years,doggedly invoked his speedy trial right in numerous letters he sent to the district attorney office.when he was finally bench warranted to houston and brought to court for his initial appearance on march,goodrum immediately moved for dismissal on speedy trial grounds.under the supreme court precedent in barker,goodrum persistent invocation of the right must weigh strongly in his favor and hence,the state court failure to accord due weight to this factor is contrary to law.
the final prong of the barker test requires an assessment of prejudice in the light of the interests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect.these interests include prevention of oppressive pretrial incarceration minimizing the anxiety and concern of the accused and limiting the possibility of impairment to the defense stated differently,unreasonable delay between formal accusation and trial threatens to produce these recognized categories of harm 
goodrum first suggests that the supreme court decision in doggett relieves him of the burden of making a particularized showing of prejudice resulting from the delay.we have construed doggett to presume prejudice when the three initial barker factors weigh heavily in favor of the defendant goodrum has not been made this showing,however,based on our conclusion that only two of the three of delay and invocation of the right to speedy weighted heavily in his favor.
additionally,the year length of the delay in this case falls well short of the years attributed to official negligence in doggett and which warranted a presumption of prejudice in that case the presumption recognized in doggett stemmed from the court reasoning that the likelihood of evidentiary prejudice,though difficult to prove,increases in tandem with the length of the delay at least when the delay results from official negligence,doggett therefore does not clearly establish that prejudice is presumed except where length of the delay is exceptional.indeed,under our precedent,as well as that of other courts,the doggett presumption applies only where the delay is at least years because goodrum was not entitled to a presumption of prejudice under doggett,the state court therefore correctly required goodrum to make a particularized showing of how the delay impacted him.
alternatively,goodrum identifies four forms of prejudice he allegedly suffered due to the delay.each is discussed in turn.
admissibility of brazoria county conviction 
goodrum contends that his conviction in brazoria county became final during the pendency of the indictments and therefore became available to impeach his testimony at trial.as noted by the district court,the state appeals court reasoned that whatever prejudice may have resulted from the admissibility of the recent brazoria county conviction was substantially mitigated by goodrum to other prior felony convictions,which,though over years old,could also be used to impeach goodrum testimony under rule b of the texas rules of evidence goodrum,characterizing this ruling as an unreasonable determination of the facts unsupported by any evidence presented by the state,asserts the district court erred when it declined to review the state court conclusion that the prior convictions were not too remote to be admitted.we disagree.the admissibility of goodrum numerous other convictions for impeachment purposes involves a question of law,not fact.more importantly,it is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine determinations on questions such as the admissibility of evidence under state procedural rules.estelle mcguire goodrum neither asserts nor demonstrates that the evidentiary ruling itself violated a specific constitutional right or rendered his trial fundamentally unfair,the sole exceptions on habeas to the of such a ruling.see johnson puckett the district court did not err in deferring to the ruling of the state court regarding the admissibility of goodrum other convictions.
the availability of the brazoria county conviction in this case also resulted in no actual prejudice to goodrum.not only had the state stipulated that it would not use that conviction to impeach him,but the trial itself never occurred because goodrum pleaded nolo contendere to the harris county charges.to the extent that goodrum relies on the state initial threat to enhance goodrum sentence based on the conviction,the records reflect that the state later agreed to abandon the enhancement paragraphs in exchange for his plea.the prior conviction was therefore not used as a basis for enhancing goodrum sentence.in sum,the state court reasonably determined that goodrum was not prejudiced by the brazoria county conviction.
impediment to the ability to investigate 
goodrum additionally argues prejudice to his ability to investigate based on the district clerk denial of his request for information about the charges.the clerk relied on section of the texas government code,which exempts governmental agencies from complying with requests for information from,inter alia,a person who is imprisoned in a correctional facility goodrum asserts that his inability to obtain basic information regarding names of the complainants,dates of the offenses,dates of the indictments,probable cause affidavits,the court number,and a copy of the indictments severely impaired his defense by rendering him unable to file unspecified motions or to contact unnamed witnesses whose memories might otherwise fade.the state contends goodrum has waived this contention by failing to raise it before the state appeals or district courts.
even assuming that goodrum preserved this argument,his vague and conclusory allegations that the denial of information impeded his defense are insufficient to constitute proof of prejudice.see,united states hayes while faded memory of witnesses may result in prejudice,we have held that in order to prejudice the defense to the extent necessary to constitute a speedy trial violation,the faded memory must substantially relate to a material fact in issue.jamerson estelle goodrum has not identified those witnesses whose memories he might have refreshed or demonstrated the requisite nexus between their testimony and a fact material to his defense.in fact,goodrum has conceded that he can not show that the delay caused his witnesses to be unable to recall certain facts concerning the case.goodrum similarly does not explain what motions he would have filed if the state had provided the requested information,let alone what those motions would have accomplished.we conclude that goodrum has not shown prejudice to his case resulting from his inability personally to obtain information from the district clerk regarding the pending indictments.
anxiety and concern 
according to goodrum,the state court unreasonably discounted the relevance of evidence that he was generally worried and concerned about the pending charges,evidence that was not challenged by the state.the state responds that goodrum imprisonment for a life term on a separate charge undercuts his assertions of anxiety and concern stemming from the later indictments.
the state appeals court acknowledged goodrum asserted anxiety or depression but,citing a case from the texas court of criminal appeals,construed goodrum status as an individual incarcerated on another offense to shift the focus primarily to whether the delay affected his defense in doing so,the court impliedly viewed goodrum anxiety and concern as irrelevant to its prejudice analysis.without directly addressing this aspect of the state court opinion,the district court impliedly viewed goodrum uncontroverted anxiety or concern as some prejudice but ultimately deemed it inadequate to sustain his speedy trial claim 
the most serious form of prejudice occurs when the delay undermines a defendant ability adequately to prepare his case but we have already noted barker recognition of anxiety and concern of the accused as a type of cognizable harm that may result from a delayed trial,and other cases stress its independence from whatever impact the delay may or may not have on the defense it is equally established that one who is already in prison may nonetheless suffer the same degree of anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation as someone at large.smith hooey accordingly,the state court rejection of goodrum anxiety and concern as probative of prejudice was unreasonable.
nonetheless,we think goodrum generalized expressions of anxiety and concern amount to little more than a nominal showing of prejudice.hooey described the most corrosive effect a detainer may have on an incarcerated individual as the strain of having to serve a sentence with the uncertain prospect of being taken into the custody of another entity at the conclusion that interferes with the prisoner ability to take maximum advantage of his institutional opportunities.goodrum at oral argument attempted to associate the distress he felt with the added burden of having to defend himself against new charges when he was in the process of appealing the brazoria county conviction.we find nothing in the record indicating anxiety and concern of this nature.there is likewise no evidence that goodrum anxiety interfered with his participation in rehabilitative activities or undermined his efforts toward.we also take into account the fact that goodrum was already serving a life sentence,itself a grim prospect,which renders it unlikely that the detainers caused him severe anxiety or concern 
in short,goodrum has not demonstrated that the anxiety he felt was of such an extreme degree that it differed in any way from that which would naturally be expected to accompany a defendant awareness of pending charges.given this minimal showing,the state court did not unreasonably view goodrum generalized anxiety and concern as insufficient to sustain his speedy trial claim.
worsened conditions of confinement 
goodrum asserts that the conditions of his confinement were worsened because the detainers affected his classification and disqualified him from certain prison jobs and privileges.during the state court proceedings,goodrum presented evidence that the detainers rendered him ineligible to be considered for outside trustee status or for a position in the prison library,and disqualified him entirely from taking vocational classes and from taking college classes for free.goodrum argues that the state court unreasonably applied principles enunciated in hooey when it concluded that the detainers did not affect the length of his sentence and,hence,were insufficient to establish prejudice.the state views the language in hooey relied upon by goodrum as dicta.in the alternative,the state contends that the impact of goodrum lost privileges was de minimis and therefore inadequate to support a speedy trial claim.
in hooey,the supreme court held that a state was not exempted from the speedy trial requirement solely on the grounds that to bring a defendant to trial expeditiously would require it to seek the defendant transfer from a federal prison where he was serving a sentence central to the court reasoning was its recognition of ways in which a delayed trial could prejudice the interests of an individual already,much as it would a person jailed without bail on a charge the court discussed as one type of potential prejudice the possibility of undue and oppressive incarceration prior to trial 
first,the possibility that the defendant already in prison might receive a sentence at least partially concurrent with the one he is serving may be forever lost if trial of the pending charge is postponed.secondly,under procedures now widely practiced,the duration of his present imprisonment may be increased,and the conditions under which he must serve his sentence greatly worsened,by the pendency of another criminal charge outstanding against him 
thus,hooey,in critical part,identified negative effects on the conditions of incarceration as a form of prejudice the speedy trial right was designed to protect.the court decision to remand the case to the texas supreme court for further does not undercut in any way its emphasis on this and other identified interests as a basis for its holding that the state had a duty to provide a speedy trial.accordingly,we reject the state characterization of this language as mere dicta.
the state court deemed goodrum asserted loss of eligibility for certain jobs,trustee status,and educational opportunities to be insufficient to constitute prejudice stemming from worsened prison conditions its reasoning distinguished goodrum disqualification from these prison programs from a prior state court decision in which the loss of trustee status and schooling opportunities was directly linked to loss of good time credit.the court thus
