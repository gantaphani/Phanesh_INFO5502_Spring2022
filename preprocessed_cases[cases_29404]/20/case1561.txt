in december,george franklin was found guilty of two counts of aggravated burglary and one count of aggravated murder and was sentenced to death.he began a long process of appeals,with each state court affirming his convictions or dismissing his claims as res judicata.on petition for habeas corpus to the southern district of ohio,however,franklin was found to have two viable claims service of a biased juror and ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,neither of which the court found to be procedurally defaulted.the court granted a conditional writ of habeas corpus on these two issues.in addition,although denying franklin petition on the remaining claims,the district court granted a certificate of appealability coa on three issues ineffective assistance of trial counsel,discriminatory use of peremptory challenges by the prosecutor,and the prosecutor failure to provide the defense with material exculpatory and impeachment evidence at trial.because franklin did not object to the district judge denial of habeas on any other issues,all other claims are forfeited on appeal and are not before this court.united states walters,cir.the state appeals the conditional grant of habeas,and franklin the denial of habeas on the three issues certified for appeal.
franklin was convicted of the brutal murder of gerald strauss in his cincinnati home on the evening of july,and of the theft of a television from the nearby apartment of rosha winston seventeen days earlier.the jury recommended the death penalty,and the judge sentenced franklin to death in addition to two consecutive ten to terms of imprisonment for the aggravated burglaries at strauss and winston homes.state franklin,ohio.
represented by new counsel,franklin appealed his conviction through the ohio courts.after the ohio supreme court affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal,a third set of attorneys took up his case and further attempted to secure relief in the ohio courts,first by requesting that the ohio supreme court recall its mandate and permit supplemental briefing on direct appeal and,when that request was denied without an opinion,state franklin,wl,by seeking relief.the hamilton county common pleas court denied the petition for relief without an evidentiary hearing,a decision that was affirmed by the hamilton county court of appeals.see state franklin,wl ohio app,appeal not allowed,ohio,cert.denied,d.franklin also sought delayed reconsideration in the ohio court of appeals,and his motion was denied for failure to file within the time limit.state franklin,no.ohio app.
franklin then sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendations.the magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing and issued a comprehensive report.after amending the report slightly in response to objections filed by the parties,the magistrate judge recommended that the court grant the requested writ of habeas corpus with respect to franklin claim that his convictions and sentences were unconstitutional because one of the jurors could not impartially apply the law,a claim the magistrate found was not procedurally barred because franklin had received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel on direct appeal.the district court adopted the report and recommendation,granting a conditional writ of habeas corpus on the biased juror and ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims and dismissing all other claims as meritless.in this appeal,we are asked to consider five issues whether a juror,who was unable to follow the law,sat on franklin jury whether the prosecution dismissed prospective jurors for reasons of race whether the prosecution failed to provide franklin with exculpatory material and impeachment evidence whether franklin trial counsel was ineffective for failing to conduct adequate investigations during the trial and the mitigation phases and whether his appellate counsel was ineffective.
as franklin filed his petition for writ of habeas corpus on november,prior to the april,effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,we apply a standard of review.sowell bradshaw,cir.we review the district court judgment de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.carter bell,cir.in addition,absent clear and convincing evidence,we presume the state court findings of fact to be correct.see wainwright goode,d.we may issue a writ of habeas corpus only if we find that the state court proceedings were fundamentally unfair due to a violation of the constitution or other federal law.sowell,at.
franklin did not raise the issues under consideration in this appeal on his direct appeal in the state courts,but rather raised them for the first time in his motion to recall the mandate before the ohio supreme court and then later in his proceedings.therefore,the courts refused to consider the merits of all of the claims,other than several of the ineffective assistance of counsel claims,on the ground that they were barred by res judicata.in ohio,res judicata bars state courts from considering constitutional claims in collateral attacks when those claims have already or could have been fully litigated on direct appeal.monzo edwards,cir.absent cause or prejudice,when a habeas petitioner fails to obtain consideration of a claim by the state courts due to a state procedural rule that prevents the state courts from reaching the merits of the petitioner claim,the claim is procedurally defaulted and may not be considered by the federal court on habeas review.wainwright sykes,d lancaster adams,cir,cert.denied,d seymour walker,cir.demonstrating cause requires showing that an objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel efforts to comply with the state procedural rule.murray carrier,d.demonstrating prejudice requires showing that the trial was infected with constitutional error.see united states frady,d.
consequently,we must first decide whether franklin can show cause and prejudice to excuse his procedural default.we focus on franklin claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,because such a claim can serve as both cause and prejudice,excusing a procedural default in an underlying substantive claim,as long as the petitioner can also show cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default of the ineffective assistance claim itself.edwards carpenter,d.
to determine whether franklin had cause for his procedural default,we apply the test set forth in maupin smith.
first,the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner claim and that the petitioner failed to comply with the rule.
second,the court must decide whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction.
third,the court must decide whether the state procedural forfeiture is an adequate and independent state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim.
once the court determines that a state procedural rule was not complied with and that the rule was an adequate and independent state ground,then the petitioner must demonstrate that there was cause for him to not follow the procedural rule and that he was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.
cir citations and footnote omitted.we agree with the district court that franklin ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim is not barred from review under the maupin test because at the time he filed his motion for delayed reconsideration,in which he raised the claims he makes on appeal in the instant case,the ohio courts did not have a firmly established and regularly followed procedural rule governing the timeliness of such motions.james kentucky,d.
franklin filed a motion for delayed reconsideration with the ohio court of appeals on june,advancing assignments of error,including the claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.on that date,the ohio rules controlling the filing of claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel through motions for delayed reconsideration were somewhat unclear.one year earlier,the ohio supreme court had decided state murnahan,ohio,holding that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims had to be brought under ohio.later to become rule a,through an application for delayed reconsideration in the court of appeals in which the alleged error took place,id.at.prior to murnahan,such claims had been brought in the regular hearings before the trial court.ibid.however,murnahan did not establish a time period for filing rule motions.
under rule,as it existed at the time murnahan was filed,a petitioner had ten days from the date the previous opinion was filed to file an application for reconsideration of any cause or motion submitted on appeal.ohio.a.however,in deciding murnahan,the ohio supreme court had opined that the courts should take a more lenient attitude toward timeliness in ineffective assistance of counsel claims 
since claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel may be left undiscovered due to the inadequacy of appellate counsel or the inability of the defendant to identify such errors within the time allotted for reconsideration in the court of appeals or appeal to this court,it may be necessary for defendants to request delayed consideration.therefore,in an individual case where a defendant has put forth a colorable claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,where the circumstances render the application of res judicata unjust,and the time periods for reconsideration in courts of appeals and direct appeal to this court have expired,he or she must apply for delayed reconsideration in the court of appeals where the alleged error took place pursuant to app.and b,and if delayed reconsideration is denied,then file for delayed appeal in this court pursuant to section,rule ii of the rules of practice of the supreme court.before granting reconsideration,the court of appeals should determine whether there are substantive grounds for relief.
murnahan,at footnotes omitted see also henderson collins,d,concluding that neither the murnahan decision nor ohio app.b set an outer limit or absolute deadline that would have alerted petitioner to a certain deadline for filing a murnahan application pursuant to the rule announced in murnahan,vacated in part on other grounds,cir.furthermore,the murnahan court specifically noted that the state appellate rules as then written may have been insufficient to provide the remedy set forth in its opinion.the opinion stated 
i n light of the fact that ohio has no statutory authority or court rules dedicated to the procedure to be followed by defendants who allege ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,we recommend that the rules advisory committee appointed by this court review whether an amendment to app.b or a new rule should be adopted to better serve claimants in this position.
murnahan led to the creation of a special application to reopen procedure,codified at ohio.b.this rule includes a timeliness provision that requires the application to reopen to be filed within ninety days of the journalization of the appellate judgment unless the applicant shows good cause for filing at a later time.b.rule b went into effect on july,day after franklin filed his motion for reconsideration under.nonetheless,the ohio court of appeals applied the b standard to franklin motion,dismissing it because he had not filed within days of the journalization of his initial appellate judgment,and notwithstanding the fact that he was represented by the same counsel at his appeals before the ohio court of appeals and the ohio supreme court.in a footnote to the decision,the court noted that applying app.b was not unreasonable,even though it had not been in force on the day franklin filed his motion,because under the previous rule,he would only have had days to file,whereas under the new rule he had days.
if we follow the reasoning of this footnote,and take as our procedural starting point the rules that were actually in place on the day that franklin filed his motion for reconsideration,there would be no procedural default.as discussed above,murnahan placed no time limit on applications and specifically noted that the limit in the rule was too short.the state points to hicks collins,cir,as holding that in the area of the ohio first district court of appeals,in which franklin filed his motion for reconsideration,the rule was established that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims had to be brought according to the rule later a,and rule had an enforced limit on filing.however,hicks is inapposite here because it applies to a time before murnahan.in hicks,the defendant brought his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a proceeding,even though it was established in that district that the claim should have been brought in a motion for reconsideration.his claim was dismissed,and he waited approximately months to file the motion correctly.in the interim,the ohio supreme court ruled on murnahan,and the appeals court dismissed hicks motion as untimely.we,in upholding the procedural default,relied on the fact that there was a procedure that hicks could have followed in a timely fashion,so his failure to do so could not constitute cause for his later procedural default.at.
if,on the other hand,we consider the ohio court of appeal application of the new rule b to franklin motion,we must also find that the state does not fulfill the elements of maupin test necessary to bar review.the first maupin factor requires that there was a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner claim and that the petitioner failed to comply with the rule.at.for the rule b requirement to be applicable to franklin,it would have to have been applied retroactively.however,the united states supreme court has held that a petitioner relying on prior rulings can not be held to new procedural requirements that go into effect after petitioner raised his claim.ford georgia,d.furthermore,even if we were to find that the new rule b procedures were applicable to franklin,the supreme court in ford concluded that because the new rule had not been announced by the time ford could have raised his claim in a timely manner,it was inadequate to serve as an independent state ground for procedural default purposes because it was not firmly established and regularly followed by the time as of which it was to be applied.ibid.quoting james kentucky,d.therefore,the application of rule b would not meet the third prong of the maupin test that the rule be an adequate and independent state ground for foreclosing review.
rule b also fails to meet the second part of the maupin test,that courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction.at.a review of the relevant case law reveals that the ohio supreme court has been erratic in its handling of untimely rule b applications in capital cases.for several years following the enactment of amended rule b,the ohio supreme court regularly enforced the rule timeliness requirements.see,state mason,ohio,state dunlap,ohio,state ballew,ohio,state davis,ohio,state dennis,ohio,state fox,ohio,state hill,ohio,state whalen,ohio,state reddick,ohio.however,in it began ignoring the lower courts dismissals of rule b applications as untimely and affirming the dismissal of the applications on the merits.see state mack,ohio,state goff,ohio,state mitts,ohio,state,ohio,state sneed,ohio,state davie,ohio,state smith,ohio,state sanders,ohio.see state moore,ohio,state carter,ohio,state biros,ohio,state brooks,ohio,state jalowiec,ohio,state palmer,ohio,state hooks,ohio,state bradley,ohio,state sheppard,ohio,state hill,ohio,state jells,ohio.recently,in yet another reversal of practice,the ohio supreme court has renewed affirming the dismissal of rule b applications in capital cases as untimely.see state gumm,ohio,state lamar,ohio,see also state myers,ohio,court affirms dismissal as the application was both untimely and meritless.
in light of the fluctuating treatment of rule b applications by the ohio supreme court,we can not hold that the state courts have regularly followed and enforced the rule timeliness requirement.the ohio supreme court treatment of rule b applications does not constitute on occasional act of grace in excusing the rule requirements,hutchison bell,cir quoting coleman mitchell,cir,nor is the supreme court applying a clearly delineated exception to the timeliness requirement in these capital cases.see hutchison,at.while it could be argued that the rule was regularly established and followed at the time that the ohio supreme court ruled on franklin rule b application,such an interpretation would render an injustice as the ohio supreme court apparently would not have applied the timeliness bar if franklin had delayed even further in filing his rule b application and submitted it for review to the ohio supreme court after.therefore,rule b is not an adequate and independent state rule that can preclude consideration of franklin ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim.
as franklin has shown cause for procedurally defaulting his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,we turn now to the question of whether any of his claims rise to the level of constitutional defects such that appellate counsel failure to raise them amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.we first consider the claim that a juror who was biased because she could not follow the law sat on franklin jury.as explained below,we affirm the district court judgment that this case warrants a grant of a conditional writ of habeas corpus.since all of the claims on petitioner relate to claims of error,those claims are rendered moot by a grant of habeas corpus,and we will not consider them further.
franklin contends that one juror,patricia arthur,was biased because she misunderstood the presumption of innocence,franklin right not to testify,and the burden of proof in the case.franklin also asserts that arthur was predisposed to find that he had committed the crime just because he was the defendant in the case.the label biased is applied to two sorts of jurors.in the usual sense,a biased juror is one who has a predisposition against or in favor of the defendant.in a more limited sense,a biased juror is one who can not conscientiously apply the law and find the facts.wainwright witt,d.while we do not agree with franklin that juror arnold was biased,in the sense of having a predisposition or prejudice against him,we,nonetheless,do find that she was not an impartial juror because she demonstrated that she could not comprehend the legal standard she was supposed to apply.
to understand franklin claim,it is necessary to quote at length the voir dire and later questioning of juror arthur 
defense most people have a feeling somebody charged with a all watch television and you seen law.some of you put it down as your favorite program,so to speak.pretty good show.you see somebody charged get up there and say i did do it and here my side of the story.fairly common reaction for everybody.in this case is there anybody here that feels george franklin should get on that stand,testify and tell you his side of the story or whatever he may feel to be appropriate anybody feel that way nobody wants to hear george say anything 
arthur to prove he innocent.
defense do you feel he should get on the stand to prove he innocent 
arthur to me,i do,you know.i do.
court let me interject.three of the jurors have said what you have said and what you think.the law is that franklin does have to do anything at a trial,except be here.he not required to prove that he innocent.he not required to put on any evidence and if he chooses to follow that route,you not allowed,under the law,to consider that against him because the burden of proof is upon the prosecution.the three of you that answered the way you did,could you accept my explanation of that 
ja.the record does not reflect that any of the prospective jurors responded to the court question.during the subsequent individual questioning of arthur by the prosecutor,the following exchange occurred 
prosecutor considering all the questions that were briefly asked by counsel and the judge,do you have any answers at this point in time that would cause you to hold up your hand,anything different than before 
arthur no,i do.
prosecutor you understand it our burden of proof and we must prove each and every element of the crimes and specification charged beyond a reasonable doubt,do you understand that 
arthur yes,i do.
prosecutor do you have any problem with that 
arthur no,i do have any problem with it.
prosecutor if we fail to prove one or more of the elements of the offense,you would acquit the defendant or find him not guilty,is that correct 
arthur yes,that right,if it proven,yes.
prosecutor if we prove each and every one of those elements beyond a reasonable doubt,can you join with the rest of the panel and sign a verdict of guilty 
arthur yes,if it proven,if it proven guilty.
prosecutor so,if the facts warrant and the law allows it,can you join with eleven other jurors in a verdict of guilty,knowing that the verdict would lead to this man death 
arthur yeah,if he proven it the right thing,i can.
prosecutor do you know of any reason,searching your mind at this point,why you could not be a fair and impartial juror in this case 
arthur no,i do.
prosecutor you can be just as fair to the state of ohio as you can to the defendant 
arthur yes,i can.
prosecutor and you listen to all the evidence 
arthur yes,i will,closely to them.
ja.the state then passed arthur for cause.the following dialog took place between juror arthur and defense counsel 
defense as you sit there now,you consider george,well,he just george.he sitting there,he on trial.we officers of the court.he sitting there he the defendant,but as to being guilty,you have no idea whether he guilty of this crime 
arthur no,i do have no idea.but,just like the counselor said before,i would have to listen closely to why it happened.
defense or how it happened 
arthur yes,that right.
defense or whether george had anything to do with it 
arthur yes,that right.
defense in other words,one of the elements is to prove george has something to do with this crime do you understand that 
arthur uh huh.
defense and,although,if the prosecution was just to put on those pictures of the victim and say he dead,i mean george was sitting here,that,alone,would not bring you to an opinion of his guilt or innocence 
arthur no,because like i said,i mean like he says,testimony,but i would just wonder why would he do it,you know 
defense well,you say why would he do it,or if he did it,would you like to know that,too 
arthur if he did it or why did he do it.
defense first of all,you like to know if he did it 
arthur yes,if he did it.
defense if you saw those pictures and the prosecutor pointed and said he did it,would that be enough to convince you 
defense in other words,you want to know more,some evidence 
arthur that why i said what i did.
defense i guess what we asking for is just a fair trial.
arthur that right.
defense and as i say that,there this innocence,presumption of innocence,and you can accept that in other words,you said that one of the things you said that,i think,on the general questions was you sort of require george to get on the stand and prove his innocence.would you do that do you mean that really 
arthur i believe that he should bring himself out,if he did do it,just testify,tell what happened,you know.
defense and that is 
court it time for the court to interrupt.arthur,that not the law,okay i sat here plenty of times with a jury and i said to myself it would be nice if this guy would tell what happened.that not the law.he not required to do that and he not required to do anything.he comes in here cloaked with the presumption of innocence.as he sits here now he presumed innocent and under the constitution,he not required to do anything at all.now,having told you that,can you abide by that and in your mind not require him to do anything 
arthur no,i do require,but i just think,to tell you the truth,judge,i do require,but i just think if the jury would listen,like everybody says,he wants to have a fair trial.if the jury would listen to both of the lawyers,you know,and whatever evidence they had to prove him not guilty,i sit here and listen to it.
court okay,but my point is that some point the prosecution will stop presenting evidence.at that point,once the state has stopped producing evidence,then the defense may produce evidence,if they so desire.
arthur please 
court once the state has stopped producing evidence,then the defense,i talking about franklin,through his lawyers,may start producing evidence,if they wish,but they not required to do that.they not required to do anything.they could stop right there,if they wanted,have me give them the final instructions and have you go out and make your decision on the case.
arthur even if the evidence is not against him,that they have brought evidence to find that he not guilty.
court i missed that.i missing out.
arthur you said if the law would provide,stop providing evidence.i said even if they for him and they not against him,not saying he not guilty,but they proving,have brought evidence you see what i talking about 
court i see what you talking about,but do you see what i talking about that is,they not required to produce anything.the defendant is required to do anything in the trial except show up,do you understand that 
arthur uh huh.
court and you not allowed to hold it against him if he does produce anything.you might be sitting there thinking maybe he could clear something up or maybe another witness could clear something up,but they not required to do a thing.can you abide by that and understand that 
arthur i guess so,if that the law.
court that the law.schmidt,do you have any further questions 
defense i still not quite sure,your honor.in other words,i guess,arthur,and,again,this is in fairness,being fair to you,too,if we were to try the case and the state put on evidence and george did take the stand,would you hold that against him 
arthur no,i would hold it against him.
defense would you think that would have something to do with his guilt 
defense you would think you would consider that at all 
arthur no,i would.
defense the way this goes,arthur,by law and by rules of the court,the state of ohio has the burden of proving the elements of the crime,all right 
arthur uh huh.
defense the state will go first and the law also says that they will go last.they will have the final argument and then the judge will give you the law do you understand 
arthur uh huh.
defense actually,they will paint a very dark picture or try to paint a dark picture,if they able.that their duty.but you got to keep an open mind until you hear the defense,or you hear the law as it applies to what you heard.can you do that 
arthur yes,i could.
defense and if the right thing,if the death penalty was the right thing,you would do it,right 
arthur that right.
defense what do you consider to be the right thing 
arthur well,what i consider to be the right thing is if justice is done,either way.if he proven guilty,then justice is done.if he proven not guilty,then justice is done.
ja.defense counsel later passed juror arthur for cause.
after the jury was impaneled,a jury view of the scene of the crime was conducted.during the viewing,juror arthur asked where he got into the house.afterward,the judge called her into chambers,with the attorneys,and the following conversation took place 
court okay,arthur,the reason we called you in here is because it been reported back to me that when the jurors were out on the view that you might have asked some questions while you were out there and specifically the way it was put to me was that you may have asked a question something like this how did he get in did he get in through the window downstairs 
arthur no,the only thing i asked,i said,i did ask if he got in the window downstairs,i asked was that the window he got in,the window when they showed.that the only thing i asked.
court the thing i need to know from you is when you say he,when you talking about he getting in.i need to know have you formed a predisposition in your mind about this man out here,franklin 
arthur no,i had formed no position.all i just want to know is that was the house.i had formed anything.
court who were you talking about when you said that he 
arthur i was talking about him,but i had formed anything yet.
court when you talk about him,are you already assuming he broke into the house,franklin,the man out here 
arthur all i know is they told me he burglarized two places and i did know if those were the houses or not.
court well,the fact,if somebody told you he burglarized two places,can you accept the fact that does mean the man did it,just because somebody said he did it 
arthur all i know is what i was told.that all i know.
court schmidt defense counsel,you want to tell us what your version of it is 
schmidt yes,sir.when we were upstairs arthur said where did he break in and that was all she said.
arthur that all i said.that all i said.i did say anything else.
court okay,are you able to keep an open mind in this case and wait until you hear all the evidence in this case 
arthur yes,i will,because i had formed nothing.
court counsel,want to ask her any questions rosenwald defense counsel 
rosenwald miss arthur,who told you he burglarized two places 
arthur the only thing i heard,and i might have misunderstood it,i thought she said when we were talking in the room that he had burglarized two places.
rosenwald when we were asking the questions of the jurors 
arthur that all i know.nobody did tell me.that just what i got from you all.
rosenwald do you have the impression,feeling,from what you saying that george did break into two places 
arthur i really do know,sir.
rosenwald all right,that all.
court anything further anything you gentlemen want to ask her 
prosecutor we were saying that,also.do you understand that what he charged with and now the evidence will show whether he did it or not 
arthur right,that all i know,i do know,sir.that all i know.
ja.defense counsel made a motion for a mistrial based upon arthur comments at the jury view.the judge denied the motion,saying,i believe this jury can be fair and impartial and i heard her answers to the questions and i observed her demeanor 
relying on this record,the district court found that juror arthur was biased and that therefore a new trial was warranted.we agree with the district judge conclusion but point out that juror arnold was biased because she could not understand the law rather than because she had a preexisting opinion about franklin.
the supreme court has repeatedly held,that juror bias is a factual issue and that reviewing courts must give the factual assessments of the trial judge a presumption of correctness subject to the exceptions enumerated in d.see thompson keohane,d wainwright witt,d patton yount,d.the exception relevant in this case is whether the factual determination is not fairly supported by the record d,amended by d.
under this standard,we can not hold that the trial judge decision that juror arthur statement at the jury viewing and her subsequent statements in the conversation with the judge did not indicate bias was not fairly supported by the record.juror arthur stated unequivocally that she had not made up her mind about franklin guilt.as the warden points out,juror arthur comments at the viewing could well be understood to indicate that she was asking whether this was the window the prosecution said the defendant had climbed through,without that question indicating that she believed the prosecution story.after discussing the matter with juror arthur,observing her demeanor,and listening to her responses,the trial judge specifically stated that he believed she could be impartial and fair.as nothing on the record demands that we find otherwise,we are bound to defer to the trial judge finding.
juror arthur statements at voir dire,however,require a different conclusion because they leave us with the conviction that she so completely misunderstood the presumption of innocence and burden of proof that she could not have made a fair assessment of the evidence of franklin guilt.in her voir dire testimony,juror arthur made at least five statements indicating that she did not understand that franklin was not required to prove himself not guilty 
i think he needs to prove he innocent.
i believe that he should bring himself out,if he did do it,just testify,tell what happened,you know.
i just think,to tell you the truth,judge,i do require,but i just think if the jury would listen,like everybody says,he wants to have a fair trial.if the jury would listen to both of the lawyers,you know,and whatever evidence they had to prove him not guilty,i sit here and listen to it.
even if the evidence is not against him,that they have brought evidence to find that he not guilty.
if he proven guilty,then justice is done.if he proven not guilty,then justice is done.
three times the judge intervened to explain the law to her.the second two times,during her individual voir dire,she somewhat reluctantly,saying,i guess so,if that the law to understand the judge explanations.yet despite the judge repeated attempts to rehabilitate her,the last thing she said in her voir dire was if he proven guilty,then justice is done.if he proven not guilty,then justice is done.juror arthur assured counsel and the judge that she would consider all of the evidence before making a decision,and there is no reason to disbelieve her.yet,that she would consider all of the evidence does not remove the fact that she also seemed to expect some of that evidence to come from franklin by way of proof of his innocence.
in the witherspoon line of cases,the united states supreme court has addressed the question of prospective jurors excluded because of their insistence upon or unwillingness to find a sentence of death.wainwright witt,d adams texas,d lockett ohio,d witherspoon illinois,d.although these cases dealt with the exclusion of jurors who expressed the opinion that they could not,or might not be able to,follow the law,they also made the more general point that a jury should be composed of jurors who will consider and decide the facts impartially and conscientiously apply the law as charged by the court.adams,at.jurors who can not apply the law are not impartial.wainwright,at.
although we normally defer to the assessment of the trial judge,who hears the prospective juror tone of voice and sees her demeanor,in this case,the cold record alone is so extensive and so persuasive that it outweighs our presumptive deference.juror arnold five times gave the definite impression that she could not faithfully apply the law concerning the burden of proof because she failed to understand it.even after she was corrected three times by the judge,she still insisted with her last statement that the defendant had to be proven innocent.wainwright,at.juror who displayed inability to follow the law four separate times was correctly excused.while we appreciate the judge attempts to rehabilitate this juror,he had a duty to dismiss a prospective juror who could not follow the law.hughes united states,cir.as such,the trial court failure to dismiss her constituted manifest error and does not merit the presumption of correctness normally due trial court factual findings.see hill brigano,cir.
the seating of a biased juror who should have been dismissed for cause requires reversal of the conviction.hughes united states,cir citing united states,d.failure to remove biased jurors taints the entire trial,and therefore the resulting conviction must be overturned.ibid.quoting wolfe brigano,cir.there is no situation under which the impaneling of a biased juror can be excused.the impaneling of a biased juror warrants a new trial the presence of a biased juror can not be harmless the error requires a new trial without a showing of actual prejudice.ibid.quoting united states gonzalez,cir.accordingly,the state can make no argument that franklin trial counsel acted strategically in keeping juror arthur on the panel because she was,like franklin.to permit this would be to allow trial counsel to waive the defendant right to an impartial jury ibid.
the service of a biased juror was a constitutional defect that should have been,but was not,raised on direct appeal.consequently,the failure of franklin appellate counsel to appeal this issue amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel and allows franklin to show the prejudice required to overcome his procedural default.
the district court found that franklin appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance to him during his direct appeal to the ohio court of appeals and to the ohio supreme court by failing to consult with their client,failing to provide him with any real opportunity to participate or have input in his appeal,and failing to raise the issue respecting juror arthur bias on direct appeal.
a criminal appellant is constitutionally entitled to the effective assistance of counsel in his direct appeal.evitts lucey,d joshua dewitt,cir.in mapes coyle,cir,the court attempted to provide a list of factors to consider when defining deficient performance
