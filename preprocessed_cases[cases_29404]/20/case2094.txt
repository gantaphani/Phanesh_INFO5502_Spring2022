martize dellinger was convicted in illinois state court of two counts of attempted murder,two counts of armed violence,two counts of aggravated battery with a firearm,and two counts of aggravated battery.after unsuccessfully pursuing direct appeals and challenges within the state court system,dellinger filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in federal district court pursuant to.the district court denied his petition for habeas relief,but granted dellinger a certificate of appealability on several issues.dellinger raises those issues on appeal to this court,and we affirm.
in august,at about,martize dellinger,rhamal powell,and kareem muhammad shot into a group of people running away from them who were apparently rival gang members and their girlfriends.dellinger,powell and muhammad are all associated with the vice lords street gang.two of the women,patricia baker and cherie morris,were shot and suffered relatively minor injuries.at trial,both women testified that they were sitting on baker back porch with several friends when three men approached on foot and pulled out guns.when the women and their friends began to run,the men started shooting.baker was shot in the buttocks,and morris in the foot.both were taken to a hospital,treated and released around both women identified muhammad,powell and dellinger as the shooters.
these three men were tried in a separate,simultaneous bench trial for attempted murder and lesser crimes.at trial,the prosecution introduced,by stipulation,statements by powell and dellinger in dellinger statement,he stated that he was years old and a member of the vice lords street gang.he stated that his car had been shot up by a rival gang,and that on august,he,powell and muhammad went looking for the rival gang members.dellinger claimed that when they saw the people on the porch,the other defendants started shooting.he stated that he did want to shoot but he raised his gun and shot two times towards where the two guys from the porch had ran.dellinger did not call any witnesses in his defense.in closing,dellinger public defender argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove an intent to kill,as required for attempted murder,or to prove that he had caused great bodily harm,to support the underlying felony of aggravated battery and thus,armed violence 
the trial judge found each of the defendants guilty and,on october,he sentenced dellinger,powell,and muhammad to concurrent sentences of years each on the attempted murder and armed violence charges.the other convictions merged in the judgment.on direct appeal dellinger,now represented by a different assistant public defender,argued that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of attempted murder,that he did not cause great bodily harm as required for aggravated battery,and that the convictions for armed violence and aggravated battery arose from the same act as the attempted murder and should be vacated under illinois law as violating the one act,one crime rule.on september,the illinois appellate court rejected dellinger arguments,and affirmed his convictions.people dillinger sic,d,unreported order.with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence,the court concluded that the act of firing a gun was sufficient to support a finding of an intent to kill,and that under illinois law a gunshot wound was great bodily harm sufficient to support the underlying felony of aggravated battery and thus,armed violence.after rejecting dellinger one act,one crime argument,the illinois appellate court further concluded that the trial court was required to impose consecutive sentences under ilcs a the illinois appellate court concluded that the shooting of two women was sufficient to establish great bodily harm,and it also was sufficient to meet the severe bodily injury criterion set forth in ilcs a.defendant sentences for attempted murder and armed violence must be served consecutively.dillinger sic,slip op.at.the appellate court then vacated dellinger sentence and remanded the case for resentencing in accordance with its decision.
in october,assistant public defender robert drizin wrote dellinger,advising him of the appellate court ruling imposing consecutive sentences and informing him that an assistant public defender would represent him on resentencing.furthermore,the letter informed dellinger that if he wanted to file a pro se petition for leave to appeal the illinois appellate court decision,he could do so within days of the appellate court decision.dellinger sought leave to appeal pro se to the illinois supreme court twice thereafter although he did not raise the issue of consecutive sentencing either time,but both petitions were denied by the illinois supreme court as untimely.
at resentencing,dellinger was represented by another assistant public defender,susan smith,but she did not challenge the court imposition of two consecutive sentences,for a new total of years.dellinger then began a direct appeal of his new sentence,this time represented by assistant public defender thomas finegan.once again he did not challenge the issue of consecutive sentences,nor did he claim smith had been ineffective in failing to challenge that ruling.instead,his sole challenge involved the constitutionality of illinois statute,ilcs a ii,which limited credit to days for each month of sentence in january,the illinois supreme court declared the statute unconstitutional,people reedy,and in february,the illinois appellate court applied this ruling to dellinger case,concluding that he was eligible for one day of good conduct credit for each day served.people dellinger,d,unpublished summary order.
in the meantime,dellinger,powell,who was represented by appointed counsel,had also appealed his initial convictions.on june,the appellate court affirmed his convictions on all counts,but,unlike its action in dellinger case,did not remand the case for consecutive sentencing under ilcs a.people powell,d,of course,powell decision was rendered by a different panel of judges than the one that decided dellinger appeal.
meanwhile,dellinger filed a pro se petition for relief in illinois state court,raising several issues including the sufficiency of the evidence.however,he did not raise the consecutive sentencing issue at this point either,nor did he claim that smith or finegan were ineffective in failing to do so themselves.the circuit court of cook county denied this petition on august.the record does not indicate whether he appealed that determination.
in march,dellinger filed a pro se petition for habeas relief in federal district court.his present counsel was appointed for him at that time,and his attorney filed an amended petition raising the following issues whether his fourteenth amendment rights were violated when the illinois appellate court imposed consecutive sentences,and whether his sixth amendment rights were violated when his counsel failed to appeal that ruling,and whether there was sufficient evidence to support a finding of guilt for his convictions.dellinger counsel later filed a supplemental petition,raising for the first time the fact of powell disparate sentencing by the illinois appellate court.dellinger argued that the disparity between his and powell sentences violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,and that his counsel was ineffective under the sixth amendment for failing to raise this issue as well.
the district court denied in its entirety the petition,as amended and supplemented.dellinger haws,wl.dellinger moved to alter or amend the judgment under rule e,claiming that the district court had not specifically addressed the equal protection arguments raised in his supplemental petition.the district court denied dellinger motion to amend in an unpublished order,rejecting dellinger disparate sentence argument.dellinger then filed a notice of appeal and requested a certificate of appealability,which the district court granted on dellinger equal protection and ineffective assistance of counsel claims,as well as on the question of whether dellinger had procedurally defaulted those claims.dellinger appeals.
in reviewing the district court decision to deny habeas corpus relief,we review issues of law de novo and issues of fact for clear error.see,todd schomig,cir.a defendant may only obtain habeas relief from a state court conviction where he establishes that the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.see d.
in recognition of comity,a petitioner seeking federal habeas relief must establish that he presented fully and fairly his federal claims to the state courts chambers mccaughtry,cir.fair presentment requires the petitioner to give the state courts a meaningful opportunity to pass upon the substance of the claims later presented in federal court.id.citations omitted.failure to do so constitutes a procedural default,id.at,which bars federal review unless the petitioner demonstrates cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the failure,or demonstrates that the failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.see rodriguez scillia,cir.
given these principles governing a request for habeas corpus relief,we now turn to dellinger claims.
due process claim 
dellinger first claims that he was denied due process under the fourteenth amendment when he was sentenced to consecutive sentences under illinois law.specifically,dellinger argues that the illinois appellate court erred in concluding that he had inflicted severe bodily injury under ilcs a.he claims that the illinois appellate court improperly equated severe bodily injury with the great bodily harm element of aggravated battery.see ilcs a.in his request for a certificate of appealability,dellinger framed this argument in terms of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,whereas in his appellate brief,he claims a violation of the due process clause.it does not matter,however,because as we explain,we conclude that he has not presented a claim cognizable on a petition for federal habeas relief.
federal habeas relief is only available to a person in custody in violation of the united states constitution or laws or treaties of the united states,see a,and is unavailable to remedy errors of state law.see estelle mcguire,d it is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine determinations on questions.thus,an error in the interpretation of the illinois aggravated battery statute,or the application of state sentencing rules,does not present a cognizable claim for federal habeas relief.see,kurzawa jordan,cir.thus,to the extent that dellinger arguments are based on an incorrect application of illinois law,the district court correctly denied his claim under the standard set forth by d.
for the first time on appeal,however,dellinger characterizes his claim as falling under the supreme court decision in apprendi new jersey,d,where the court held that any fact other than a prior conviction which increases the maximum statutory penalty for a crime must be submitted to a jury,and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.without a finding of the infliction of severe bodily injury,illinois law provides that a defendant must receive concurrent sentences.see ilcs a.dellinger indictment did not contain the charge that he had inflicted severe bodily injury.nor did the trier of fact the judge make a finding of severe bodily injury.thus,dellinger argues,since he was sentenced to a greater penalty consecutive sentences without the requisite charges and findings,his apprendi rights were violated.the state responds that the illinois appellate court properly made the requisite finding by equating great bodily harm with severe bodily injury,that dellinger waived an apprendi claim by failing to raise it below,and that apprendi does not apply retroactively 
habeas appellants are required to obtain a certificate of appealability in order to preserve issues for appeal.see c fed.see also rodriguez united states,cir.dellinger did not raise this claim in his certificate of appealability,nor has he requested us to expand the certificate to include an apprendi claim.however,this is not necessarily fatal to his claim.we have previously held that if a certificate is granted as to certain issues,but the petitioner is later able to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right as to a different issue,we shall amend the certificate to include such a claim.ouska,cir.this is applicable even where the petitioner does not specifically ask us to expand the certificate,but also when a party implicitly makes such a request by simply including issues in its briefs that were not specified in the certificate.id.
therefore,in order to expand the certificate of appealability to include the apprendi issue,dellinger must still make a substantial showing that the illinois court sentence denied his constitutional rights.c rodriguez,at.he can not make such a showing.for apprendi to apply to his claim,it must be applied retroactively.we recently held that apprendi is not retroactive and thus does not disturb sentences that became final before june,the date of its release.curtis united states,cir.dellinger sentence became final well before this date,and therefore we reject his petition for habeas relief based on a violation of his rights under the fourteenth amendment based on apprendi.
finally,dellinger suggests that his fourteenth amendment due process rights were violated because his sentence was improperly vacated by the appellate court on its own initiative,thus effectively penalizing him for taking an appeal.this issue was not included in dellinger certificate of appealability either.however,we note that the illinois appellate court does not appear to have vacated his sentence on its own,but rather addressed the issue at the suggestion of the state in any case,dellinger argument is essentially a recharacterization of his contention that the illinois appellate court erred in its application of ilcs a.thus,he has made no showing that his constitutional rights were violated,and his fourteenth amendment argument on this issue fails as well.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
next,we address dellinger argument that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment.he points to several specific instances of ineffective assistance,including his counsel failure to challenge the imposition of the consecutive sentences,failure to discuss with him an appeal of the consecutive sentence issue,and failure to raise the issue regarding the disparity in sentence received by his,powell.the district court concluded that dellinger had procedurally defaulted these claims by failing to raise them in state court either on direct appeal or in his proceeding and that he had not established cause sufficient to justify the default,other than his youth and ignorance,which are insufficient 
dellinger admits that he failed to raise the ineffective assistance of counsel claim in state court,on direct appeal or in relief,but argues he established cause sufficient to justify that default and that he suffered prejudice as a result of the violation.we first turn to whether he established cause for the default.the heart of dellinger argument is that he received assistance from the public defender and that,from june forward,he was left on his own.he pleads that he was a young,uneducated person without the capacity or ability to recognize possible grounds for relief,including his own attorneys ineffectiveness.essentially,his cause for failing to raise this claim in the state courts is that he is young,uneducated and that he had ineffective counsel.the supreme court has defined cause sufficient to excuse procedural default as some objective factor external to the defense which precludes petitioner ability to pursue his claim in state court.murray carrier,d.we have held that youth and lack of education do not constitute the type of external impediment sufficient to excuse a procedural default.see,henderson cohn,
