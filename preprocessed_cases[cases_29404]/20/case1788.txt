this is an appeal from the district court order dismissing martin application for a writ of habeas corpus.the court dismissed martin application as untimely upon respondent bartow motion.martin contends that the court miscalculated the date upon which the applicable statute of limitations began to run because of an improper interpretation of the relevant sections of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d.we agree that the district court erred in its calculation and therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
in,the state of wisconsin successfully petitioned a state court to have martin civilly committed as a sexually violent person pursuant to a wisconsin statute allowing commitment.stat,of any person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense and is dangerous because he or she suffers from a mental disorder that makes it likely that the person will engage in one or more acts of sexual violence,id.the predicate offense for martin commitment was a conviction for second degree sexual assault.
the wisconsin civil commitment statute only allows for a person to be held in state custody until such time as the person is no longer a sexually violent person.id.thus,the state must reexamine each person committed pursuant to the statute at least once a year,id,and a committed person may petition for discharge at any time,id.the state decided anew that martin was a sexually violent person each year since his original commitment.then,in,after a number of challenges to his commitment in both federal and state court,martin filed his fourth petition for discharge,challenging the state reliance on two earlier convictions in justifying his commitment.the experts that testified at his original commitment trial based their testimony concerning the likelihood of recidivism in part on the fact that martin previously faced charges for sexual assault in and.however,in each of those cases,martin pleaded guilty to lesser,nonsexual crimes and the state dropped the charges of sexual assault.the state continued to rely on those convictions in its annual reevaluations.the state circuit court summarily denied martin petition because it found no change in the respondent condition to warrant a hearing.the state appellate court affirmed that denial,but addressed martin petition on the merits,rather than relying on martin failure to allege a change in the facts of his case,as the lower court had.finally,the wisconsin supreme court denied his petition for leave to appeal.thus,the state decision to continue martin confinement became final on august.
martin then filed a pro se federal habeas petition on september,pursuant to,arguing that the state reliance on his earlier convictions violated his plea agreements and his constitutional rights.the district court issued a sua sponte show cause order suggesting that his petition was untimely because he was originally committed in and aedpa provides for a statute of limitations.see d.martin then moved to amend his petition,and in his proposed amended petition he purported to challenge the state repeated use of his earlier convictions in its annual reevaluations.
upon respondent motion,the district court dismissed martin petition as untimely.the court concluded that the aedpa statute of limitations began running on the date of martin initial commitment order because martin was essentially challenging that decision.on appeal,martin argues that the applicable statute of limitations period actually began to run on the date of the most recent order continuing his commitment.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court dismissal of a habeas petition de novo.moore battaglia,cir.
iii.analysis 
aedpa provides a statute of limitations for an application brought by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.d.the statute states that the limitations period begins to run from the latest of four enumerated events,but in this case the parties agree that the triggering event was the issuance of a judgment and that the period began to run on the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.id.d a.what the parties dispute is which judgment martin is challenging.
martin constitutional right to due process limits his civil commitment to the period during which he is both mentally ill and dangerous,but no longer.foucha louisiana,d.as soon as the state lacks clear and convincing evidence that martin meets both conditions,it must release martin from custody.id.at.at.it is likely for this reason that the wisconsin statute provides for annual reevaluation and allows martin to challenge his commitment at any time.see.stat.recognizing that martin commitment is dependent on a finding that he is currently both mentally ill and dangerous,the district court accepted the parties conclusion that each state court order continuing martin commitment or denying his challenge to such commitment constitutes a new judgment for purposes of aedpa,and therefore starts a new statute of limitations period.we agree,as this seems to be the only logical conclusion.to hold otherwise would lead to one of two absurd results either martin could never challenge an order continuing his commitment that was entered more than a year after his initial commitment order or the statute of limitations applicable to his initial commitment order would never expire.
thus,the parties in this case dispute only whether the district court correctly interpreted martin habeas petition to be a challenge to the original commitment order,rather than to the order continuing commitment.martin argues that because his commitment in was only constitutional if it was based on a finding that he met the conditions for commitment at that time,he was in custody pursuant only to the most recent order extending his commitment for another year.thus,he contends that the limitations period began to run on the date of that order in.
respondent argues that if we were to accept martin interpretation,we would effectively allow persons adjudged to be sexually violent to repeatedly challenge their civil commitment on the same grounds.thus,respondent suggests that in order to determine what judgment martin is challenging,we must look to the substance of the claims he made in his application.respondent believes that an analysis of those claims leads to the inevitable conclusion that martin is challenging his initial commitment.in support of its arguments on this point,respondent looks to the language of aedpa,to the statute purposes,and to case law they believe to be relevant.after addressing each of these legal sources in succession below,we accept the principle espoused by the respondent,but find that it does not apply in martin unique case.
plain language of the statute 
respondent argues that martin interpretation of d does not square with a reading of d as a coherent whole.first,respondent points out that d tolls the limitations period while an applicant seeks state relief with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.respondent argues that,given this language,it is not logical to conclude that a petitioner in martin position always challenges the most recent judgment.respondent argues that such a conclusion would render the term pertinent in d a nullity.
second,respondent argues that martin interpretation would nullify d b d,which lay out the other circumstances that might delay the start date for the limitations period.as an example,respondent posits a situation where martin discovered new evidence related to claims he made in his original commitment trial after the issuance of a new judgment for continued commitment.in that instance,section d d would seem to set the statute of limitations for challenging the original judgment running after martin was already in custody pursuant to a new judgment.
there are two major flaws in respondent arguments.the first is respondent assumption that we can not accept an interpretation of d that,given a particular set of facts,nullifies a provision of the statute.of course,we always endeavor to construe statutes so as to
