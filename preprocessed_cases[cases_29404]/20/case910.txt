leon winston was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death by the circuit court for the city of lynchburg,virginia.after failing to obtain relief in state proceedings,he petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus.he now appeals the district court denial of the writ.winston presents the following issues,as authorized by the certificate of appealability whether he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the guilt phase of his trial whether the state trial court unconstitutionally denied his request for a lesser included homicide instruction whether atkins virginia,d,prohibits his execution because he is mentally retarded whether he received ineffective assistance when his counsel failed to argue that atkins prohibits his execution and whether he otherwise received ineffective assistance at the sentencing phase of his trial.
we affirm the district court denial of winston ineffective assistance claims for both the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial we also affirm the denial of his jury instruction claim.on winston atkins and claims,however,we conclude that further proceedings in the district court are required.as the district court recognized,because winston presented material evidence in his federal habeas hearing with respect to the claims that was not considered by the supreme court of virginia,these claims present complex questions concerning the application of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa.a district court may not consider additional evidence in a federal habeas proceeding unless the petitioner has satisfied aedpa dual requirements of exhausting state remedies and developing the factual record in the state courts.while these requirements present a high bar for the petitioner,we conclude in this case that winston cleared the bar.winston counsel for both his state and federal habeas applications did not find records of a test score relevant to proving his retardation until two weeks before the evidentiary hearing held by the district court.we hold that it was error for the district court to refuse to consider this evidence because the score does not fundamentally alter winston claims and because habeas counsel was diligent in searching for it.we therefore vacate the district court judgment insofar as it denies winston atkins and claims,and we remand for further proceedings on these claims.
on the morning of friday,april,two men broke into rhonda and anthony robinson house.after confronting the robinsons near their daughters bedroom,one of the men followed anthony robinson downstairs.there,the man shot anthony several times.he then returned upstairs and shot rhonda in front of her daughters,niesha and tiesha whitehead.after the shootings the men left,leaving rhonda and anthony to die from their wounds.leon winston was later arrested and tried for the murders.
at trial two witnesses gave essentially uncontradicted testimony that winston was present at the robinsons when the murders occurred.michelle lipford,who had been sexually intimate with winston,testified that she drove him and a man named kevin brown to the robinson house at about on the morning of the murders.after waiting nearby in the car for an indeterminate time,lipford heard gun shots and then drove off.tranika turner,winston girlfriend,testified that in response to a telephone request from winston at that same morning,she picked him up at a carwash near the robinson house.turner noted that when she picked him up,winston was wearing a black hoodie with gray stripes.
to establish that winston actually shot the robinsons,the prosecution offered physical evidence,eyewitness testimony,and a confession.for physical evidence,the prosecution introduced a gun that forensic experts had identified as the murder weapon and on which winston only winston found.robin wilson testified that shortly after the murders winston had given him the gun to keep.
for eyewitness testimony,the prosecution relied on niesha whitehead.while niesha witnessed many of the events that transpired the morning of the murders,her testimony was somewhat inconsistent,and she could not directly identify winston.she did,however,testify that her mother voice woke her on the morning of the murders and that upon waking,she saw two men outside her second floor bedroom.she saw one of the men,whom she called no name,follow anthony robinson downstairs.she then heard gunshots and saw no name return to shoot her mother,rhonda robinson.on direct examination niesha testified that no name had a tattoo that looked like a big dog,and wore all black.it is undisputed that winston has a tattoo on his arm matching the one described by niesha,but niesha could not remember whether no name clothing had any stripes on it.on cross examination she answered yes twice when asked whether one man wore all black and one wore black with white stripes.she also answered yes when asked whether the man in white stripes tried to stop no name from shooting her mother.finally,niesha contradicted her testimony on direct by identifying the man with white stripes as the one with the tattoo.
for evidence of a confession,the prosecution called nathan rorls,a friend of winston,as a witness.rorls testified that winston called him in april of and told him that he had slumped two people in he had murdered somebody,killed somebody.id.at.rorls further testified that the day after he received the call,he saw winston and winston cousin pego peyton carter at a friend house.there,rorls said that winston told him he had killed two people and robbed them and stuff.id.at.rorls recounted that winston proceeded to describe the crime in detail,noting that he winston and his codefendant had taken two thousand dollars and two ounces of cocaine from the robinsons.id.at.
winston did not take the stand.his counsel thus focused on undermining the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and highlighting inconsistencies in the physical evidence.pointing to niesha whitehead testimony concerning the shooter appearance,defense counsel contended that another man,tywan turner,was the likely shooter,and that winston had tried to prevent the shooting.counsel also challenged rorls testimony as fabricated and given to avoid the long prison term he was facing on drug charges.finally,counsel challenged the testimony of lipford and wilson as unreliable and implausible.
the jury returned a verdict of guilty,convicting winston of capital murder,robbery,and several lesser crimes.in the sentencing phase defense counsel presented testimony from winston family describing his troubled childhood.winston mother testified that he had never known his father,that she had been in and out of prison for much of his childhood,and that she regularly used pcp,marijuana,cocaine,and alcohol both before and after winston was born.winston grandmother testified that she had frequently taken a very young winston with her when she committed various larcenies.finally,defense counsel introduced three psychological evaluations of winston along with some related records,all from winston childhood.
the psychological evaluations,however,were not introduced to prove that winston was mentally retarded under virginia law.rather,they were admitted as ordinary mitigating evidence,describing winston intellectual functioning and troubled childhood.defense counsel took this approach despite the bounty of evidence in those evaluations and related records relevant to a determination of retardation under the applicable virginia statute.the evaluations were accompanied by scores of,and,respectively.in one of the evaluations the psychologist commented that winston was functioning in the b orderline range of abilities and that his ability to recall specific verbal facts which are typically acquired through education and experience is extremely deficient and falls within the mentally retarded range percentile.in another the psychologist found that winston had borderline intellect and severe verbal processing problems.id.the psychologist also noted that winston immaturity and passiveness place him at a risk to be easily manipulated by others.he is likely to always follow the easiest path,the strongest leader.id.
also in defense counsel possession,but not submitted to the jury,were additional records from the fairfax county department of student services and special education fairfax county.these records showed that winston was eligible for special education due to mild retardation,that he demonstrate d a reduced rate of intellectual development and a level of academic achievement below that of age peers,and that he concurrently demonstrate d deficits in adaptive behavior.id.at.unlike the psychological evaluations presented to the jury,these records did not include an score.an affidavit from a fairfax county special education long after winston that while an additional psychological evaluation and test would necessarily have accompanied the county conclusions about winston,these additional items had likely been destroyed.
in determining not to pursue a sentencing strategy based on mental retardation,defense counsel apparently relied primarily,if not solely,on the advice of evan nelson,the clinical psychologist appointed to assist winston during the sentencing phase.nelson did an assessment of winston for use at his sentencing.he reviewed the psychological evaluations and records forwarded to him by counsel and interviewed winston and members of his family.nelson did not interview winston teachers and social workers,and he can not recall whether he saw the fairfax county record changing winston disability classification to mild retardation.based on the materials before him at the time,nelson told defense counsel that he did not think they could prove that winston was mentally retarded as defined by the virginia statute.
defense counsel were almost completely dependent on nelson analysis.they did not read winston psychological records in their entirety before forwarding them to nelson,nor is there any evidence that they reviewed them after receiving nelson opinion.the lawyer tasked with gathering mitigation evidence admitted that he had been unable to review all the records and had relied on nelson to thoroughly review the records and tell him what he needed to know.at.neither of winston lawyers read the records containing fairfax county change of winston disability classification to mild retardation.
after considering the evidence relevant to sentencing,the jury recommended a sentence of death for each of the murders,years for the robbery and related crimes,and in fines.the trial court sentenced winston according to the jury recommendations,except for suspending the fines.the supreme court of virginia affirmed winston convictions and sentence,winston commonwealth,and the united states supreme court denied certiorari,winston virginia,d.
winston later petitioned for habeas relief in the supreme court of virginia.winston warden of the sussex i state prison,wl.in his petition winston requested an evidentiary hearing and raised multiple claims centering on actual innocence,atkins,and ineffective assistance of counsel.the virginia supreme court denied all relief without allowing an evidentiary hearing.id.at.it concluded that winston actual innocence claim was not cognizable in habeas,that his atkins claim had not been raised on direct appeal and therefore was procedurally defaulted,and that his ineffective assistance of counsel claims failed on the merits.id.at.the virginia supreme court did not then have before it winston claim that the trial court erred in denying his requested jury instruction on lesser included homicide charges.
following the denial of his state habeas petition,winston filed the pending petition in federal district court.in its first opinion,dated may,the district court rejected on the merits winston claims of actual innocence,ineffective assistance of counsel at the guilt phase,failure to instruct the jury on lesser offenses,and ineffective assistance of counsel in presenting mitigation evidence at the sentencing phase.however,with respect to winston atkins and ineffective assistance of counsel claims,the court reserved decision and ordered an evidentiary hearing.the district court d id not decide that winston wa s entitled to an evidentiary hearing,but rather exercise d its discretion to order one.
at the hearing the district court heard from nine witnesses over two days and received documentary evidence not presented to the state courts.of particular importance was the introduction of winston missing psychological evaluation and test score from fairfax county.just two weeks before the hearing,winston habeas counsel found marilynn schneider lageman,the psychologist who administered the test.lageman testified that she had kept personal copies of winston records,and she produced documentation reflecting winston score of.daniel reschly,a mental retardation expert,testified for winston,opining that to a reasonable degree of psychological certainty,winston was mentally retarded under virginia law before he reached the age of.after reschly made what he concluded were proper adjustments for both the standard error of measurement sem and the flynn effect,the low ranges for winston other scores were more than two standard deviations below the mean.reschly further opined that winston had conceptual,social,and practical adaptive deficits before age.in response to reschly,the commonwealth offered an expert,leigh hagan.hagan opined that winston was not mentally retarded before age,that there was no basis for adjusting winston scores due to sem or the flynn effect,and that limitations in winston adaptive behavior did not significantly impair his functioning.
winston trial counsel and mitigation expert also testified at the district court hearing.counsel admitted that if they had seen the additional score of,they would have argued that winston was retarded and therefore ineligible for the death penalty under atkins.nelson testified that,in addition to not having access to the fairfax county records and score,counsel had not provided him with information from certain teachers,social workers,and family members that was relevant to winston adaptive functioning.nelson acknowledged that his prior a mental retardation defense was not have been different had he possessed this information.
following the hearing the district court issued a second opinion,dated march,denying winston remaining claims.while the district court reaffirmed its decision to grant an evidentiary hearing,it refused to consider the additional records from fairfax county,including the score of,because winston had failed to exhaust that aspect of his ineffectiveness claim in the state courts.the district court further noted that while winston had diligently pursued his ineffectiveness claim in the state courts,he had failed to subpoena lageman or the records of winston fourth test.after rejecting the additional records from fairfax county,the district court concluded that nothing excused winston procedural default of his atkins claim and that his ineffective assistance claim failed on the merits.this appeal followed.
we first consider winston claims that his conviction should be vacated because he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the guilt phase of his trial or because the trial court erroneously refused to give a homicide instruction.we affirm the district court decision to reject these claims.
winston claims that his sixth and fourteenth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated during the guilt phase of his trial.he argues that his trial counsel failed to prove,as they easily could have,that rorls testimony was a lie and to pursue effectively their strategy of t ying tywan turner to this crime any and every way they could.appellant br.at.we agree with the district court that the state court did not unreasonably apply federal law in denying this ineffective assistance claim.
when a state court has adjudicated a claim on the merits,a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.we review de novo the district court application of the standards of d to the findings and conclusions of the state court.mcneill polk,cir.to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim,a petitioner must establish that counsel performance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced the defense.strickland washington,d.to establish deficient performance,a petitioner must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.courts indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance to avoid the distorting effects of hindsight.yarbrough johnson,cir quoting strickland at.to establish prejudice under strickland,the petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.
rorls,in a recent affidavit,said that his testimony at winston trial was made up to get a bigger sentence cut in his own drug case.at.winston argues that rorls fabrication would have been apparent to the jury if his counsel had presented testimony from winston cousins,peyton carter and joe lewis.carter and lewis attest in affidavits that they were present at the small gathering at which,according to rorls trial testimony,winston confessed his role in the murders to rorls for the second time.both carter and lewis swear that they were with or within earshot of winston the entire time at the gathering,and they did not witness a confession or overhear any private conversation between winston and rorls in which winston confessed.counsel failure to interview carter and lewis and call them as witnesses,winston argues,constituted deficient performance that prejudiced his defense.
as the district court observed,winston claim that defense counsel should have called carter and lewis boils down to the argument that counsel should have further emphasized that rorls lied about winston admissions in order to reduce rorls own prison time.defense counsel devoted considerable effort to attacking rorls credibility.the very first questions to rorls on were successful in getting him to admit that he was facing a potential life sentence on cocaine conspiracy charges and that he had dangle d out information to the authorities about the robinson murders in an effort to shorten his sentence.rorls,who had been released from custody,admitted to the jury that he had bought his freedom with his cooperation.defense counsel clearly and repeatedly used rorls admissions to press to the jury the theme that rorls was lying to reduce his prison time.
it is easy for winston to argue now that the testimony of carter and lewis should have been offered as part of the attack on rorls credibility.but trial strategy decisions are not evaluated through the distorting effects of hindsight.yarbrough,at.defense counsel strategy of attacking rorls credibility in the manner chosen,which was undeniably focused and aggressive,falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.id.
winston challenges another strategy decision of defense counsel in arguing that they did not sufficiently develop the theory that tywan turner committed the murders.specifically,winston argues that counsel should have called patti whitehead,the sister of one of the victims and the mother of turner children,because she had made a statement to police that turner was in lynchburg at the time of the murders.however,one of winston defense counsel explained by affidavit that while he and his had subpoenaed whitehead,they did not call her as a witness because they were unable to talk to her beforehand and were unsure what she would say.on habeas review,a federal court generally credits plausible strategic judgments in the trial of a state case.vinson true,cir.here,because defense counsel could not determine beforehand what whitehead testimony would be,their decision not to call her was a plausible strategic judgment.
we conclude that defense counsel representation was not deficient at the guilt phase of winston trial.we likewise conclude that the state court did not unreasonably apply strickland in denying winston ineffective assistance claim with respect to the guilt phase.
winston next argues that his due process rights were violated when the state trial judge refused to instruct the jury on lesser included homicide charges.although winston did raise this claim on direct appeal,he did not raise it with the supreme court of virginia in his state habeas petition.the state did not argue in the district court,however,that the claim was unexhausted.because we conclude that the claim should be denied on the merits,we need not reach exhaustion.see b.
in capital cases,due process requires the court to give an instruction on any lesser included offense when the evidence warrants such an instruction.bates lee,cir citing beck alabama,d.beck requires a offense instruction when the evidence at trial casts some doubt on a necessary element of the capital charge.hyatt branker,cir.because each state inevitably has its own rule for when its courts should instruct a jury on lesser included offenses,a federal court first determines whether the state rule offends the federal rule.see hopper evans,d see also beck,at.here,there is no material distinction between the virginia rule and the federal one.see remington commonwealth,a second degree murder instruction is only appropriate where it is supported by the evidence briley commonwealth,noting that beck left the virginia rule unchanged.the virginia rule therefore poses no constitutional problem on its face indeed,its application is equivalent to application of the federal rule for the purposes of aedpa.accordingly,we consider only whether the state courts application of the virginia rule was reasonable.
winston argues that the evidence permitted the inference that he was not the triggerman and therefore supported an instruction on murder.except in the case of murder for hire,virginia law bars conviction of a capital crime when the accused was not the actual perpetrator.frye commonwealth.given tranika turner unrebutted description of winston clothing that evening as being black with grey stripes,winston contends that a reasonable jury could have concluded from niesha whitehead testimony that his accomplice fired the fatal shots.winston points specifically to niesha testimony that the shooter wore all black and the other man present wore black with white stripes.the jury could therefore have credited niesha testimony and disqualified winston as the triggerman.
winston ignores the fact that the state court considered this slice of testimony in the context of a wealth of evidence indicating that he was the shooter.as the virginia supreme court held on direct appeal,i n light of the overwhelming evidence indicating that winston was the triggerman responsible for rhonda death,we can not say that a short passage excerpted from niesha testimony was sufficient to merit jury instructions on first or second degree murder,or accessory after the fact.winston,at.the evidence at trial pointing to winston included rorls testimony that winston confessed to being the shooter testimony that the gun used in the killings was in winston possession and had his dna on it niesha testimony that a man with a tattoo matching winston was the shooter and winston own admission that he was present when the shootings occurred.when the several pieces of evidence pointing to winston guilt are measured against the small portion of niesha testimony concerning the shooter is itself can not conclude that the trial court unreasonably applied controlling law by failing to give the offense instruction.
the dissent reaches the opposite conclusion by minimizing the significance of relevant evidence and failing to exercise sufficient deference under aedpa.the dissent argues that niesha whitehead testimony was consistent with winston not being the triggerman.however,there is little doubt that niesha testimony was inconsistent,with even the dissent noting that niesha identified both the man in black and the man with stripes as having the big dog tattoo.this inconsistency tends to undermine niesha testimony as a whole rather than provide reliable evidence supporting the inference that winston was not the triggerman.similarly,niesha initial failure to remember whether the shooter wore white stripes undermines the black and white distinction defense counsel tried to draw between the two perpetrators.
the dissent appears not to be troubled by the weaknesses in niesha testimony because it concludes that o ther than the testimony of rorls,whose credibility was questioned at trial,no evidence relied on by the majority can be characterized as overwhelming evidence that winston was the triggerman.infra at.while the dissent is quick to minimize rorls testimony,it was properly admitted into evidence and clearly implicates winston as the shooter.the fact that rorls later recanted is irrelevant to our analysis under aedpa.see holland jackson,d w hether a state court decision was unreasonable must be assessed in light of the record the court had before it.similarly,the presence of winston dna on the murder weapon,which was itself entrusted to another by winston after the murders,permits an inference that winston was the triggerman.in light of this additional evidence,it was not unreasonable for the virginia supreme court to characterize as overwhelming the evidence that winston was the triggerman.
we can not see how the dissent can conclude otherwise under aepda deferential standard.the dissent states that the state court made an unreasonable determination of the facts when it found that there was overwhelming evidence that winston was the triggerman.infra at.the finding that the dissent points to is a legal determination that the evidence did not support giving a lesser included homicide instruction.proper consideration of this determination is under d rather than d.but even if the dissent has identified the correct standard,it has not demonstrated why the state court determination was not only incorrect but also unreasonable.the virginia supreme court concluded that no rational juror could have discounted rorls testimony,the evidence concerning the murder weapon,and winston presence at the scene and still credited niesha testimony that a man with clothing and a tattoo tried to stop the shooting.assuming this conclusion was error because it crossed the line between making the legal determination of whether an inference is rational and weighing the evidence,it was not an unreasonable conclusion at variance with aedpa 
finally,we disagree with winston that we should grant him relief because the facts here closely resemble the facts of beck.in beck the evidence was sufficient to establish that the defendant was guilty of a serious,violent offense but left some doubt as to whether he had committed a capital offense.the jury,however,was instructed only on the capital charge.thus,the jury potentially faced the choice of either convicting the defendant of capital murder because it believed that he was guilty of some serious crime and should be punished an impermissible acquitting because whatever his crime,the defendant does not deserve death an equally impermissible reason.beck,at.the supreme court held that an instruction on the lesser included offense was necessary in these circumstances.winston jury,however,did not face the choice of death or acquittal because it was also instructed on robbery and related charges.more important,unlike the state court in beck,the supreme court of virginia concluded that the evidence against winston on the capital charge was overwhelming.this reasonable conclusion did not leave room for the quantum of doubt required by beck.accordingly,beck did not mandate a offense instruction.
we next consider winston claims that his sentence should be vacated because atkins virginia,d,bars his execution he received ineffective assistance when his counsel failed to argue that atkins barred his execution and he received ineffective assistance when his counsel failed to adequately present mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase.our treatment of winston ineffective assistance claim renders analysis of winston atkins claim unnecessary.winston concedes that his atkins claim is procedurally barred absent a valid excuse,and ineffective assistance is one such excuse.because we vacate the district court decision and remand on winston ineffective assistance of counsel claim,we need not decide on this appeal whether any other excuse applies.
winston claims that he received ineffective assistance when his counsel failed to mount a defense under atkins virginia,d.in atkins the supreme court held that the eighth amendment prohibits the execution of the mentally retarded,but it left to the states the task of enforcing the constitutional restriction.id.at.the virginia legislature enacted a statute defining mental retardation shortly after atkins was decided.to prove mental retardation under the statute,the accused must establish a disability,originating before the age of years,characterized by both 
i significantly subaverage intellectual functioning as demonstrated by performance on a standardized measure of intellectual functioning administered in conformity with accepted professional practice,that is at least two standard deviations below the mean and ii significant limitations in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual,social and practical adaptive skills.
ann.a.the supreme court of virginia later held that w hether a defendant is mentally retarded is a factual issue for the jury to determine.atkins commonwealth.
the district court rejected winston ineffective assistance claim,concluding that strickland prejudice requirement had not been satisfied.proving prejudice required winston to demonstrate a reasonable probability that a would have determined he was mentally retarded under virginia law.in rejecting winston claim in his state habeas proceeding,the virginia supreme court focused on whether winston had demonstrated significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.to this end,winston had presented the state court with scores of,and as well as evidence that fairfax county had diagnosed him with mild retardation in.the virginia supreme court rejected the three scores as evidence of retardation because it had previous held that the maximum score for a classification of mental retardation was an score of.the court rejected the fairfax county diagnosis because it had been made for the purpose of establishing special education eligibility,and the definition of mental retardation used by the county did not require an score below.the district court concluded that the virginia supreme court determination was not objectively unreasonable.
in reaching its decision,however,the district court refused to consider new evidence that fairfax county did indeed give winston an test and that the score was below.in winston state habeas proceedings,the virginia supreme court had denied,without explanation,his motion for discovery and an evidentiary hearing to further develop the factual basis of his claims.consequently,it was not until two weeks before the evidentiary hearing scheduled by the district court that winston,through the efforts of his counsel,was able to obtain the additional test score.the district court noted that the new evidence rais ed interrelated questions of whether winston failed to develop in state court proceedings the factual basis he now relies on to support his ineffective assistance claim and whether winston has failed to exhaust that claim.after the evidentiary hearing,however,the district court concluded that both questions were perhaps best viewed analytically as exhaustion questions.id.it determined that the potentially dispositive new evidence should not be considered on the merits because it rendered winston claim unexhausted.
the application of aedpa is,of course,implicated in the question of whether the district court should have considered winston new evidence.we agree with the district court original observation that the question raises both an exhaustion issue and a issue.we disagree that the two issues should be collapsed into an exhaustion issue post hearing,and we therefore consider each in turn.see boyko parke,cir.finally,we note that because mental retardation is at bottom a factual issue,review of winston new evidence implicates d and e,both provisions of aedpa governing federal habeas review of state court factual findings.because we conclude that the district court should have considered the evidence,we will discuss the appropriate application of these provisions on remand.
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state.b.the exhaustion requirement applies as much to the development of facts material to a petitioner claims as it does to the legal principles underlying those claims.see breard pruett,cir.for a claim to be exhausted,both the operative facts and the controlling legal principles must be presented to the state court.matthews evatt,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.if the rule was otherwise,petitioners could expedite federal review by deliberately withholding essential facts from the state courts,thus upsetting the careful balance struck by congress between respecting the finality of state court judgments and enforcing federal rights.vasquez hillery,d.the exhaustion requirement does not,however,prohibit a district court from considering evidence not presented to the state courts.s upplemental evidence that does not fundamentally alter the legal claim already considered by the state courts can properly be considered by a district court.id.the question of when new evidence fundamentally alters an otherwise exhausted claim is necessarily case and fact specific.morris dretke,cir.
in vasquez hillery the supreme court addressed the tension between the exhaustion requirement and consideration of new evidence.in that case the petitioner alleged that had been systematically excluded from the grand jury that indicted him.in the federal habeas proceeding,the petitioner introduced two categories of evidence that had not been presented to the state courts affidavits stating that qualified had been available but had not been called and statistical on census data that had been available to the state the mathematical probability that chance could have accounted for the exclusion of from grand jury panels.the court held that the affidavits supported a proposition already by the record before the state courts and that the statistical analysis added nothing to the case that th e court had not considered intrinsic to the consideration of any grand jury discrimination claim.at.without further explanation,the court concluded that this evidence could be considered because it did not fundamentally alter the petitioner equal protection claim.
we read vasquez to permit a district court to consider new evidence if it supports factual allegations for which there is already at least some support in the state record.the evidence in vasquez was supplemental insofar as there was already evidence in the state record from which a could reasonably determine the existence of facts essential to the petitioner claim.this reading is consistent with circuit precedent requiring petitioners to present the operative facts of their claims to the state courts.matthews,at.we note that the strength of the evidence in the state court record is irrelevant to our interpretation.suppose,for example,that a petitioner on federal habeas introduces new evidence to establish the existence of fact x,a fact required to prove his claim.the claim will inevitably be stronger,regardless of the evidence the petitioner presented to the state courts.however,if the petitioner presented no evidence to the state courts to establish the existence of fact x,the claim will be fundamentally altered by the new evidence presented to the district court.
the district court concluded that the addition of winston score of fundamentally altered his ineffective assistance of counsel claim under vasquez.it relied primarily on two rationales,the first centering on the potentially dispositive nature of the evidence 
had the supreme court of virginia confronted a score of,it might have viewed the strickland prejudice prong differently.instead,winston presented three scores over and evidence that a likely fourth score might have been under.therefore,there is a substantial difference between the operative facts that the supreme court of virginia confronted and the operative facts here.
as an alternative rationale,the district court cited counsel failure to ask the virginia supreme court for subpoena power.with that power,counsel could have subpoenaed lageman and discovered the score during state habeas proceedings.because counsel could have obtained and presented the score to the state court,the district court reasoned that they can not now present it to the federal courts.
we conclude that the district court erred in its analysis.first,it is irrelevant to the fundamentally alters inquiry whether the virginia supreme court would have decided the claim differently had it seen the new evidence presented by winston.as noted above,whether new evidence fundamentally alters a claim does not depend on whether it makes the claim stronger.the key is whether winston offered some evidence in state court to support the factual claim that he possesses significantly intellectual functioning as measured by a standardized test.winston presented evidence to the virginia supreme court that fairfax county had diagnosed him as mentally retarded based on standardized testing,that one score should be considered below due to the flynn effect,and that he possessed substantial deficits in adaptive behavior.while the virginia supreme court was unpersuaded in the absence of an actual score below,the court determination was based on the weight of the evidence rather than the lack of any evidence to support winston claim.
wise warden,maryland penitentiary,cir,a case cited by the district court,does not preclude our analysis.in wise the petitioner claimed that the prosecution had violated giglio united states,d,by withholding a cooperation agreement with a key witness.in the state courts the petitioner had offered little more than bald assertions and the affidavit of a fellow inmate attesting to the existence of the agreement.wise,at.in the district court,however,the petitioner presented the agreement itself as well as statements by the to the police.wise held that the claim had not been exhausted,noting that there was a world of difference between conjecture and proof and that mere conjecture was all that supported the petitioner claim when it was presented to the state courts.id.at.while wise did refer to the significantly different and stronger evidentiary posture of the petitioner claim in the district court,id.at quoting brown estelle,cir,it used the words significantly different and stronger to distinguish a claim without evidentiary support from one with evidentiary support.unlike the case before us today,no reasonable in wise could have found the facts necessary to support the petitioner claim from the evidence presented to the state courts.
the district court alternative rationale fares no better.winston failure to request a subpoena from the virginia supreme court is simply not relevant to the fundamentally alters inquiry.indeed,considering this failure conflates the exhaustion inquiry with the standard for obtaining an evidentiary hearing under e,which we discuss below.we note,however,that even if winston efforts in the state proceedings were relevant,the district court would have been wrong to hold winston responsible for failing to seek a subpoena.death penalty habeas petitioners seeking discovery in virginia are required by statute to request an evidentiary hearing from the virginia supreme court.see.c see also hedrick warden of the sussex i state prison.only if that court grants the hearing request and refers the petitioner to a circuit court for discovery would a subpoena request be appropriate.here,winston did request an evidentiary hearing from the virginia supreme court,and that hearing was denied.requesting a subpoena directly would have been procedurally improper,and winston can not be faulted for failing to take that step.
in district court the state did not argue that the introduction of the score fundamentally altered winston ineffective assistance claim.instead,it argued that the court could not consider the score because winston had failed to develop the factual basis of his claim in the state courts.at oral argument before us,the state continued to advance this argument despite tacit acknowledgment that the district court had correctly applied the fundamentally alters test.we agree that the question of whether winston failed to develop the factual basis of his claim in the state courts is independent of the exhaustion question.we conclude,however,that winston did not fail to develop the factual record in state court.
the requirement that petitioners develop the factual basis of their claims in the state courts has its source in e 
if the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings,the court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows that 
a the claim relies on 
a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable or 
ii a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence and 
b the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
the supreme court has held that the word failed in the opening line of this section connotes fault.michael williams taylor,d.specifically,it held that a failure to develop the factual basis of a claim is not established unless there is a lack of diligence,or some greater fault,attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner counsel.id.at.if a district court concludes that the petitioner was diligent in developing the factual basis of his claim,it may grant an evidentiary hearing as an exercise of discretion.schriro landrigan,d prior to aedpa,the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing was generally left to the sound discretion of district courts.that basic rule has not changed.this discretion should,however,be exercised with restraint.f ederal evidentiary hearings ought to be the exception,not the rule.pike guarino,cir.they are not intended to provide a forum in which to retry state cases,but rather their prototypical purpose is to fill a gap in the record or to supplement the record on a specific point.id.as the supreme court has said because the deferential standards prescribed by aedpa control whether to grant habeas relief,a federal court must take into account those standards in deciding whether an evidentiary hearing is appropriate.schriro,at.
in its first opinion the district court concluded that it had discretion to grant winston a hearing on his atkins and ineffective assistance claims,and it exercised that discretion.after citing to the requirements of e,the district court held that winston diligently pursued his habeas corpus claims that atkins bars his execution and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel through the failure to investigate this claim and it is not wholly implausible that he could establish his claims even in light of aedpa deferential standards.in its second opinion the district court declined to reconsider its finding of diligence.it is therefore somewhat puzzling that the state goes so far as to declare in its brief that t he district court finding with respect to winston failure to develop this claim is exceptionally clear winston did not exercise due diligence.appellee br.at.the state is wrong.
perhaps the district court confused the state by considering winston failure to seek a subpoena in its analysis of the exhaustion question.whether winston could have or should have sought a subpoena is relevant to the issue of winston diligence,not the issue of exhaustion.in any event,we do not read the district court discussion of the subpoena matter as a retreat from its otherwise clear finding of diligence.moreover,as we have noted,whatever fault the district court assigned to winston for failing to seek a subpoena was simply misplaced.
finally,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in holding an evidentiary hearing.the district court specifically considered whether to hold a hearing in light of aedpa deferential standards,and the court concluded that it was not implausible that winston would succeed if he proved the facts alleged in his petition.winston had never had a hearing on his atkins and ineffective assistance claims because the virginia supreme court denied him one,and the district court acted properly to provide him such an opportunity on a colorable claim.the district court narrowly tailored the hearing to supplement the record on a particular issue,and there was no attempt to retry the entire case against winston.
because we can find no legitimate justification for the district court exclusion of winston score,we conclude that remand is appropriate so that the court can reconsider winston ineffective assistance claim with the score in evidence.the district court was wrong to exclude the score on the ground that it rendered winston claim unexhausted,and the state is wrong that the score should have been excluded because the hearing in which the score was introduced was improperly granted.winston is entitled to a decision on his claim based on all of the admissible evidence in the record.we remand for the district court to make this decision in the first instance.
the issue remains as to what standard of review the district court should apply on remand.winston insists that the district court should apply e because that provision applies exclusively when an evidentiary hearing is appropriate in federal court.the state counters that the district court was right to apply d.while we reject winston argument that d will never apply once the district court has granted an evidentiary hearing,we conclude that it does not apply in this particular case.the district court should still apply e to any factual findings made by the state court and make any additional findings necessary to resolve winston claims.once the facts are determined,the district court should apply strickland standards without any deference to the decision of the supreme court of virginia.the virginia court had its opportunity to consider a more complete record,but chose to deny winston request for an evidentiary hearing.accordingly,comity and finality do not require deference when material evidence later surfaces in a federal habeas hearing.
section d provides aedpa framework for reviewing habeas petitions 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
section d describes the standard of review to be applied to claims challenging how the state courts applied federal law,while d describes the standard to be applied to claims challenging how the state courts determined the facts.both provisions direct federal courts to assess the reasonableness of the state court determinations,and both assessments must be made in light of the evidence the state courts had before them.holland,at.the only limitation on d application is that the claims submitted must have been adjudicated on the merits in state court.when a claim has not been adjudicated on the merits by the state court,a federal court reviews the claim de novo.cone bell,d monroe angelone,cir wilson workman,cir pike,at drake portuondo,cir.
a state court judgment is unreasonable under d if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal principle from supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case.mcneill polk,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.the state court application,however,must have been more than incorrect or erroneous it must have been objectively unreasonable.wiggins smith,d quotation marks and citations omitted accord terry williams taylor,d.a similar analysis naturally applies to the analogous and adjacent language in d.for a state court factual determination to be unreasonable under d,it must be more than merely incorrect or erroneous.schriro,at.it must be sufficiently against the weight of the evidence that it is objectively unreasonable.
an apparent tension between d and e arises because the latter section provides an alternate and seemingly inconsistent standard for review of state court factual determinations 
e in a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.the applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.
this section does not concern itself with the reasonableness of factual determinations by the state courts but with the correctness or incorrectness of those determinations.it further assigns a burden of proof to the and convincing negating them.finally,unlike d,there are no limitations on the application of e.the precise interplay between these provisions has split the courts of appeals.see lambert blackwell,cir a comprehensive interpretation of aedpa factual review scheme has yet to emerge from the federal courts wood allen,cir teti bender,cir guidry dretke,cir taylor maddox,cir.
the supreme court has held that d and e provide independent requirements for review by the federal courts.cockrell,d.the sections should not,for instance,be merged to require the petitioner to prove that a decision is objectively unreasonable by clear and convincing evidence.id.both provisions apply independently to all habeas petitions.to secure habeas relief,petitioner must demonstrate that a state court factual finding was incorrect by clear and convincing evidence,e,and that it was objectively unreasonable in light of the record before the court.id.at.emphasis added accord dretke,d.the supreme court has nevertheless left open the precise question of when and how e presumption of correctness applies.see rice collins,d.
given these principles,we conclude that d and e will both ordinarily apply even after a district court has properly held an evidentiary hearing.first,we can discern nothing inconsistent with the concurrent application of d and e after a district court has held an evidentiary hearing.if a petitioner succeeds under e,he has merely proven that the state court finding was incorrect.to satisfy d,the petitioner must prove that the state court was not only incorrect,but also objectively unreasonable.second,e should apply because there is no limitation in the section text.while there might a situation when it would be improper to apply a presumption of correctness to state court factual findings,for example,when the state proceedings violated due process,this would be the exception rather than the rule.see taylor,at see also randy hertz james liebman,federal habeas corpus practice and procedure third,the only limitation on d that the claim have been adjudicated on the not automatically apply simply because the district court held an evidentiary hearing.if the record evidence after the hearing is substantially the same as the evidence presented to the state court,there is no reason why the district court can not assess whether the state court made an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented to it.
when,however,the petitioner offers,for the first time in federal habeas proceedings,new,material evidence that the state court could have considered had it permitted further development of the facts,an assessment under d may be inappropriate.the requirement that d be applied only to claims adjudicated on the merits exists because comity,finality,and federalism counsel deference to the judgments of state courts when they are made on a complete record.michael williams,at.in this respect,the exhaustion and adjudicated on the merits elements of federal habeas practice are mirror images.wilson,at.exhaustion requires that the state courts have an opportunity to apply the law and consider all the evidence relevant to the petitioner claim.baldwin reese,d vasquez,at.when a state court refuses to opine on the merits of a claim properly presented to it,exhaustion is satisfied.cone.at pike,at.similarly,when a state court forecloses further development of the factual record,it passes up the opportunity that exhaustion ensures.wilson,at drake,at see also monroe,at.if the record ultimately proves to be incomplete,deference to the state court judgment would be inappropriate because judgment on a materially incomplete record is not an adjudication on the merits for purposes of d.wilson,at drake,at.new,material evidence,introduced for the first time during federal habeas proceedings,may therefore require a de novo review of petitioner claim.
our conclusion is not new to this circuit.in monroe angelone,we held that aedpa deference requirement does not apply when a claim made on federal habeas review is premised on brady material that has surfaced for the first time during federal habeas proceedings.id.at.in monroe the petitioner had sought habeas relief from the supreme court of virginia for violations of brady maryland,d,based on nine categories of exculpatory evidence allegedly withheld by the prosecution.the petitioner had also sought discovery to seek disclosure of additional evidence that might have been withheld.the state court denied his claims and refused,without explanation,to authorize discovery.monroe,at.the federal district court,however,granted discovery and an evidentiary hearing,and the petitioner uncovered several additional categories of withheld exculpatory evidence.on appeal we held that de novo review was appropriate for those portions of petitioner brady claim that were based on the new evidence.id.at.in addition,we held that it was necessary to consider all the evidence in the just the new the materiality element of a brady claim requires a collective assessment of whether introduction of the exculpatory evidence might have affected the outcome of the trial.as a result,we could not accord aedpa deference on an basis to the items of exculpatory material considered in state court.id.at.
our conclusion in this case is also consistent with holdings reached in similar cases in the second and tenth circuits.in drake portuondo,cir,the second circuit concluded that de novo review of the petitioner due process claim was appropriate when the state courts did not permit the development of the factual record and therefore relied on an incomplete record in denying the claim.id.at.indeed,the second circuit actually remanded the case for discovery and an evidentiary hearing.in wilson workman,cir,the tenth circuit,sitting en banc,concluded that de novo review of the petitioner ineffective assistance claims was appropriate because the oklahoma state courts denied the claims based on a factual record that was,solely as a result of a state procedural rule,incomplete.id.at.like the virginia supreme court in this case,the oklahoma court of criminal appeals denied the petitioner an evidentiary hearing and therefore passed up any opportunity to consider evidence material to the petitioner ineffective assistance claim.
the court in wilson also addressed what might be an additional concern with our conclusion today that habeas petitioners seeking de novo review of their claims need only produce some small sliver of new evidence in federal court.like the wilson court,we conclude that this concern is greatly exaggerated.id.at.as we have emphasized above,the requirements that petitioners exhaust their state remedies and diligently develop the record in state court are exacting burdens.even if the state courts deny a petitioner request for an evidentiary hearing,new evidence surfacing in federal court that fundamentally alters a claim will render the claim unexhausted.similarly,while requesting an evidentiary hearing from the state courts may be necessary to satisfy e diligence requirement,it may not always be sufficient.see michael williams,at.diligence will require in the usual case that the prisoner,at a minimum,seek an evidentiary hearing in state court in the manner prescribed by state law.emphasis added.in light of these safeguards,we see little risk that habeas petitioners will misapply our holding to obtain unwarranted de novo review in the federal courts.wilson,at.
turning more specifically to this case,we hold that d does not apply to winston ineffective assistance claim and that the district court should not afford deference to the supreme court of virginia application of strickland.winston additional score is material to whether he is retarded under virginia law and therefore material to whether he was prejudiced under strickland by his counsel conduct.moreover,like the petitioner in our monroe opinion,winston requested discovery and an evidentiary hearing from the state court to further develop the factual record.like the state court in monroe,the virginia supreme court denied winston request and passed on the opportunity to adjudicate winston claim on a complete record.finally,as in monroe,the state court adjudicated a claim that was materially incomplete.the deficient performance and prejudice inquiries under strickland present mixed questions of law and fact,smith moore,cir,that require a collective evaluation of the evidence rather than an analysis confined to a subset of the facts.see kyles whitley,d see also cargle mullin,cir.consequently,the virginia supreme court legal conclusions are not neatly separable into those based on a complete record and those based on an incomplete record.accordingly,on remand the district court should not afford any deference under aedpa to the virginia supreme court application of the strickland standards.
aedpa deference under e,however,will be appropriate to any relevant factual findings made by the virginia supreme court.while that court does not appear to have found that winston was not mentally factual note that it did make several factual findings concerning the tests winston took and the fairfax county assessment procedures.on remand these findings are entitled to a presumption of correctness,and should winston wish to overcome this presumption,he will have to do so by clear and convincing evidence.where the virginia supreme court did not make a factual finding,the district court must make its own without regard to what the state court might have done.
finally,in making its factual determinations,the district court should not only consider winston score,but also decide whether to consider winston proffered evidence concerning the flynn effect and sem.the only time the virginia supreme court has even mentioned the flynn effect in a published opinion was in this case,and it has never considered the effect of sem.the virginia court did not discuss the flynn effect beyond stating that winston had offered evidence concerning it.the court concluded that 
this court has previously held that the maximum score for a classification of mental retardation is an score of.petitioner provides no documentation that he was diagnosed as being mentally retarded before the age of in accordance with the legal definition of mental retardation established by the legislature.thus,petitioner has failed to satisfy the requirements of strickland.
citations omitted.the most that can be reasonably inferred from this holding is that the virginia supreme court was unconvinced by winston evidence concerning the flynn effect and sem.while a federal court sitting in habeas could not conclude that such a holding violated d,see green johnson,cir,the district court will not be applying section d on remand.instead,it will be weighing winston expert evidence,documentary evidence,and proffered e into account when determine the facts.once determined,the district court will consider de novo whether there is a reasonable probability that,but for his counsel deficient performance,winston would have succeeded on his atkins claim.
lastly,we affirm the district court denial of winston claim that he received ineffective assistance when his counsel failed to present an adequate case in mitigation.the supreme court of virginia held that winston had failed to demonstrate deficient performance and prejudice,and the district court held that this was not an unreasonable application of strickland.we affirm because it was not unreasonable to conclude that there was no prejudice.
because a verdict recommending death in virginia must be unanimous,ann.e,the prejudice inquiry requires winston to demonstrate that there was a reasonable probability that,but for his counsel failures,a single juror would have voted against death.each juror has discretion to vote for death provided that the prosecution proves one of virginia statutory aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and the jury considers all the evidence in mitigation.see watkins virginia.winston does not argue that either of these requirements was not satisfied.accordingly,we consider whether the supreme court of virginia unreasonably applied federal law when it concluded that no juror would have exercised his or her discretion to vote against death.
winston argues that the virginia supreme court unreasonably applied federal law because at least one juror would have exercised his or her discretion to vote against death if his trial counsel had elicited facts concerning his intellectual functioning through live witnesses rather than through the written psychological reports that were submitted to the jury the jury had seen winston psychological records and score of and his trial counsel had presented a more detailed narrative of his traumatic childhood.in rejecting these arguments,the virginia supreme court emphasized that winston does not identify the substance of any additional evidence he contends counsel should have presented and does not explain how such evidence would not have been cumulative.accord id.at.
in rejecting winston first argument about the need for live witnesses on the issue of low functioning intelligence,the virginia supreme court rested its determination primarily on the rich content of the written psychological reports.the reports contained many assessments easily understood by the lay juror,including findings that winston was of mentally deficient to average intelligence with extreme problems maintaining attention and effort and many emotional concerns resulting from his abandonment and rejection from various family members.id.at.hence,the core of winston mitigation case was before the jury.also,winston had not shown that any particular testimony would have materially added to the reports.
winston responds by arguing that the manner rather than the substance of counsel mitigation case is the critical factor.he argues that the district court treats manner of presentation as a complete irrelevancy.appellant br.at.winston does not,however,cite any case law in this circuit to support his argument.moreover,what case law winston does cite does not stand for the proposition that ineffective assistance follows from a failure to present evidence through live witnesses.see,gray branker,cir prejudice found when counsel offered no medical explanation for defendant behavior williams allen,cir prejudice found when counsel failed to discover evidence that paint ed a vastly different picture than that presented to the jury.while we acknowledge that there might be a case when the manner in which counsel presents evidence is so abysmal that it supports a finding of prejudice,the line would have to be drawn carefully so as not to conflate deficient performance with prejudice.we simply can not conclude in this case that the virginia supreme court unreasonably applied federal law by discounting the manner in which counsel presented mitigation evidence.
winston second on counsel failure to introduce his psychological records and not survive a careful comparison of the psychological records the jury did see and the records it did not.winston psychological evaluation reads very much like his previous evaluations.both his and evaluations agree that winston was cooperative but very immature.where winston largely disclaims responsibility for his own bad acts in the evaluation,he reports that he does not feel guilty after doing something wrong in the evaluation.with regard to scores,his verbal for both the and evaluations was consistent at,which both evaluations describe as being within the range of mild mental retardation.his performance scores on his and tests were actually lower than his score on the test,and his and evaluations both describe his nonverbal skills as borderline.finally,each of the evaluations describes his intellectual functioning at various points as limited,borderline,or mentally deficient.
despite these similarities between what was introduced and what was not,winston argues that the information possessed by the jury was tremendously incomplete.appellant br.at.the question,of course,is whether the information possessed by the jury was materially incomplete.although the jury did lack certain details,winston can not suggest prospects for the material omission category except for the single document in which fairfax county changed his primary disability classification to mild retardation,and the score of.while winston classification and score are material to his atkins claim,there is no reason to believe that these items would have been persuasive to the jury as ordinary mitigating evidence.with all of the similarities between the submitted and unsubmitted evaluations described above,the question is whether the classification and the additional low score would have made a difference.because the reports before the jury had already classified winston verbal abilities as mildly retarded,we can not conclude that a more general classification of mild retardation would have made a material difference.similarly,we can not conclude that the difference between a score of and,while perhaps critical to a finding of mental retardation under atkins,would have made a material difference to a lay juror considering a broader range of mitigation evidence about intellectual functioning.
the dissent contends that the jury did not possess at least ten items of material information.in most of the instances cited,however,the jury either had the information or had information that was essentially indistinguishable.items deficient verbal skills and twice failing kindergarten cited in the dissent were noted in winston and evaluations.items,and all comment on various specific deficiencies,some of which were discussed in the other evaluations,items and to understand social expectations or properly handle money,while others such as item evenly delayed functioning in all areas are merely syntheses of previous observations.this again leaves only fairfax county retardation classification and the score,and,as explained above,these omissions were not material.
winston third and final his trial counsel did not adequately present the jury with evidence of his traumatic fails.defense counsel called four witnesses to illustrate his traumatic childhood a social worker who testified as to his itinerant experience in foster care and his mother,grandmother,and,who testified as to his poor upbringing and his exposure to drugs and crime at a very young age.while we have no doubt that winston counsel could have painted a more detailed picture of his childhood,we can not conclude that the picture they did paint was somehow materially incomplete.winston argument appears to be that further embellishments,greater detail,and more forceful advocacy would have changed at least one juror mind.he does not argue,however,that the mitigation case or traumatic childhood his counsel did present to the jury was misleading or that it left out critical facts.williams,at finding prejudice when counsel put on testimony describing defendant childhood beatings as ordinary parental discipline that occurred occasionally,rather than testimony describing the beatings as serious assaults involving deadly weapons that occurred on a near constant basis.the jury heard testimony concerning winston abandonment by a mother and his exposure to criminal life by his grandmother.it also saw documentary evidence describing his many difficulties coping with his intellectual functioning.because the jury still recommended death in light of this evidence,we can not conclude that the supreme court of virginia unreasonably applied strickland when it held that a more detailed mitigation case would not have changed even a single juror mind.
in reaching a contrary conclusion,the dissent gives inadequate consideration to aedpa standard of review.the dissent does argue that it can find no reasonable theory under which the evidence disregarded could be considered cumulative,infra at,because winston counsel left out even the most basic details of winston childhood,infra at.as we explained above,however,we do think that such a reasonable theory existed and that counsel did present the basic details of winston admittedly troubled childhood to the jury.again,the virginia supreme court may have been wrong to adopt such a theory,but we can not conclude that it acted unreasonably.
in summary,even if we assume deficient performance by winston counsel,we conclude that the supreme court of virginia did not unreasonably apply federal law when it held that counsel performance did not prejudice winston case in mitigation.
for the foregoing reasons we affirm the district court denial of winston claims except with respect to his atkins and ineffective assistance claims.with respect to the atkins and claims,we vacate the district court decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
affirmed in part,vacated in part,and remanded 
today decision overlooks the prejudice that leon jermain winston suffered from the utter failure of counsel to investigate and present mitigating evidence at the penalty phase where he received a capital sentence.if we are to safeguard the sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel in criminal cases,then we must conduct a meaningful review of the record when,as here,there is a vast quantity of unquestionably mitigating evidence that was never presented to the jury.moreover,while it appears that winston failed to raise the issue in his state habeas petition,i disagree with the majority denying winston claim that his due process rights were violated by the state court refusal to instruct the jury on lesser included homicide charges.the majority misinterprets the evidence at trial by equating evidence placing winston at the scene with evidence that winston was the triggerman.only the latter satisfies virginia requirement for a capital conviction.therefore,i respectfully dissent from the portions of this opinion denying those two claims,but i concur in the majority judgment as to the remaining issues.
in section,the majority concludes that winston due process rights were not violated when the state court denied his request for instructions on lesser included homicide charges.i agree that winston did not raise this issue in his state habeas petition.because the majority proceeds to reach the merits and because the commonwealth did not raise the issue of exhaustion in the district court or before this court,i note my disagreement with the majority assessment.
the merits inquiry is guided by the supreme court decision in beck alabama,d.in beck,the court announced the principle that 
capital defendants have a constitutional right to receive a jury instruction on a offense when the evidence unquestionably establishes that the defendant is guilty of a serious,violent leaves some doubt with respect to an element that would justify conviction of a capital offense.
hyatt branker,cir quoting beck,at.bates lee,cir.the court concluded that finding otherwise would enhance the risk of an unwarranted conviction.beck,at.
the supreme court subsequently explained that due process requires that a lesser included offense instruction be given only when the evidence warrants it.hopper evans,d.i agree with the majority that virginia rule poses no constitutional problem because it is consistent with the federal rule and that the application of the two rules is identical.what the majority fails to appreciate is that this court has found that whether the evidence warrants the instruction is not a sufficiency of the evidence question.see hyatt,at.instead,beck requires a offense instruction when the evidence at trial merely casts some doubt on a necessary element of the capital charge.taylor workman,cir finding that beck clearly holds that courts are not to determine which instruction they feel is most warranted but instead must give the lesser included offense instruction in every case where the evidence supports it.
under virginia law,the element that would justify conviction of a capital offense,beck,at,in this case is that winston is a principal in the first degree.frye commonwealth.winston argues that because there was evidence that he was not the triggerman,and therefore not a principal in the first degree,he was constitutionally entitled to lesser included offense instructions on murder.the majority today agrees with the supreme court of virginia that there was overwhelming evidence that winston was the triggerman responsible for rhonda death.winston commonwealth.when a state court has decided whether a lesser included offense instruction is necessary,this court has unmistakably affirmed that federal court review in the habeas context is limited by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of.see hyatt,at.even given this deferential standard,i find the state court determination of the facts to be unreasonable 
evidence at trial supported winston requested instructions for lesser included homicide charges and his theory that he was present at the scene but was not the triggerman,casting some doubt on one element necessary for his capital conviction.niesha whitehead,the only eye witness,testified on direct and cross to facts showing winston was not the triggerman.in fact,niesha,the government witness,did not identify winston.on the stand,niesha testified that it was the man wearing all black that shot her mother.she also testified that the other man was wearing stripes and tried to stop the shooter.unrebutted evidence existed that winston was wearing stripes.winston,at.contrary to the majority contention,niesha testimony was not inconsistent concerning the clothing of the two men.when first asked what the shooter was wearing,niesha responded,all black.at that time,on direct,she stated that she could not recall whether the clothing had stripes in it.throughout the rest of her testimony,niesha stated that there was one man in all black and one wearing stripes.she testified that it was the man in all black that pulled the trigger.
niesha also testified that the shooter was taller than her father,anthony robinson.winston was shorter than robinson.the majority relies on niesha testimony that a man with a tattoo was the shooter.however,niesha was shaky on which man in the house had a tattoo,testifying both that it was the shooter and the.thus,that winston had a tattoo is not determinative of which person was the triggerman 
the majority finds that i am not troubled by the weaknesses in niesha testimony.supra at.however,the fact that niesha testimony is inconsistent on which man had a tattoo does not signify that it lends no support to winston requested instructions.in fact,the main inconsistency in niesha testimony,which person had the tattoo,undermines the majority position,not winston.if niesha testimony were truly undermined as a whole,as the majority suggests,supra at,it seems unusual that the majority cites to her testimony in support of its position.thus,given the dearth of evidence directly proving that winston was the triggerman,niesha testimony cast some doubt on an element necessary for winston capital conviction 
other than the testimony of rorls,whose credibility was questioned at trial,no evidence relied on by the majority can be characterized as overwhelming evidence that winston was the triggerman on april,the majority cites to evidence that only places winston at the scene,which is insufficient for a capital conviction under virginia law.while there was testimony that winston dna was on the gun used,this does not prove that winston pulled the trigger on the date in question for example,winston could have supplied the gun or he could have simply hidden the gun after the shootings to cover up his complicity.neither of these scenarios would have made winston.additionally,niesha testified that both men were wearing gloves.
because the evidence in this case casts some doubt that winston was the triggerman,an element necessary for conviction of the capital offense in virginia,winston was entitled to an instruction on the lesser included homicide charges.some doubt is all that is required.in finding that there was overwhelming evidence that winston was the triggerman responsible for rhonda death,winston,at,the state court made an unreasonable determination of the facts.
in section,the majority inadequately considers winston claim that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective by not reading relevant records in his possession,passing along four incomplete psychological reports to jurors without explanation,failing to mention winston classification as mentally retarded,failing to present evidence of winston adaptive deficits and cognitive difficulties,and presenting extraordinarily minimal mitigating evidence about winston childhood in a generalized and unpersuasive manner given the reasonably accessible material available.rather,the majority puts forth alleged arguments made by winston that fail to represent his entire claim.looking at the whole record and winston complete argument,i must depart from the majority and find that the state court was unreasonable in dismissing winston claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase of his trial.
in this case,the performance prong of strickland entails assessing whether counsel satisfied his duty to consider and investigate mitigating evidence for sentencing in a capital case.it is a norm that investigations into mitigating evidence should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence.wiggins smith,d quoting american bar association aba,guidelines for the appointment and performance of counsel in death penalty cases c hereinafter guidelines.according to the aba guidelines in effect at the time,counsel had a duty to consider presenting medical evidence,educational history,and family and social history,especially in a capital case.guidelines.counsel plainly can not perform this duty when not reasonably informed about the case.
although courts can not the strategic choices of counsel,counsel must be informed to act strategically.see,rompilla beard,d concluding a decision not to pursue certain mitigating evidence can not be strategic if it is based on inadequate investigation wiggins,at.finding a cursory investigation insufficient to support any tactical decision.here,counsel was in no way informed.counsel testified he had no strategic reason for not pursuing further mitigating evidence.furthermore,counsel failed to read records in counsel possession and made no reasonable effort to discover mitigating evidence that was unmistakably available.while winston counsel had the assistance of an investigator,no mitigation investigation occurred nor was a mitigation specialist provided.instead of reviewing the records regarding winston case in his very possession,counsel abdicated his constitutional duty by relying on nelson,who had been appointed to evaluate winston,to review them.
when analyzing whether counsel deficient performance was cause for the procedural default of winston atkins claim,the district court correctly recognized that capital trial counsel can not outsource their fundamental responsibilities.winston kelly,d.the court added that a lthough counsel strategic choices made after thorough investigation are virtually unchallengeable,strickland washington,d,contextually,simply not reading essential documents that are facially significant to competent capital defense counsel did not seem to this court to be any choice at all.id.at.the court inexplicably and inappropriately failed to apply this logic when deciding whether the same counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence.see winston kelly,d.
while the supreme court has recognized that the duty to investigate does not force defense lawyers to scour the globe on the off chance something will turn up,the court has also found failure to review relevant files that are easily accessible can be objectively unreasonable and that reasonable counsel would investigate further in the absence of good reason to think further investigation would be a waste.rompilla,at.without reading the records,counsel had no strategic reason to think further investigation was unnecessary.additionally,unreasonableness can be heightened by the easy availability of the mitigating evidence.see id.at.here,counsel had the documents in his possession containing mitigating evidence and leads to evidence.even a cursory review of this record shows that the district court erred when it held that the state court was reasonable in finding that counsel limited efforts at sentencing were not deficient.
on the second prong of strickland,the state court unreasonably determined that winston was not prejudiced by counsel deficient performance.a thorough review of the record demonstrates that but for counsel deficient conduct,a reasonable probability exists that at least one juror would have voted against the death penalty.at sentencing,counsel presented a few witnesses,asked them yes or no questions spanning less than thirteen transcript pages,threw several incomplete psychological evaluations at the jury without explanation or context,and hoped for the best.the minimal evidence counsel did present is at stark contrast with the mountain of mitigating evidence that was readily available,including evidence of mental deficiencies and evidence of winston emotional distress,neglect,and abandonment throughout childhood.
setting aside whether winston satisfies the virginia definition of mental retardation evidence of mental deficiencies is certainly mitigating.counsel here indisputably failed to present to the jury a classification of winston as mentally retarded that was in counsel possession.the majority apparently finds this harmless,reasoning that there is no reason to believe that these items the classification of mental retardation and score of would have been persuasive to the jury as ordinary mitigating evidence.supra at.this assertion misses the mark,and despite the majority labeling the classification a single document,supra at,it is the only classification of winston as mentally retarded that existed and was thus supremely relevant to assessing mitigating evidence.while a specific score may or may not be influential to a lay juror a classification as mentally retarded certainly would have been materially significant to the jury when considering evidence about winston subaverage intellectual functioning.the majority finds the classification immaterial by characterizing it as more general than the classifications of winston verbal abilities that the majority assumes the jury read and could correctly interpret.supra at.however,the evaluation in pertinent part states that 
leon earned a verbal iq score of and a performance iq score of,resulting in a full scale iq score of.based on his full scale score,leon is currently functioning in the mentally deficient range of intelligence,and might be expected to achieve better than one percent of his age group in academic areas.
thus,it is clear that a juror reading such evaluation would place more importance on a full scale classification and score than that of a.it is the full scale score that is used to classify a person as mentally retarded.
beyond the failure to present the classification,counsel did not provide the jury with information from certain teachers,social workers,and family members whose input would have been essential to evaluate winston mental state and adaptive functioning.the majority concludes that winston is asserting that his counsel was constitutionally inadequate purely because live witnesses did not present the information.supra at.this conclusion is incorrect.winston argument is that the information was not presented at all because counsel investigation was unreasonably wanting,petr.br,and the information possessed by the jury was tremendously incomplete,id.at.it is undisputed that,as discussed above,counsel did not read records in his possession nor conduct a full investigation.
as for information regarding winston low intellectual functioning,the majority relies heavily on the psychological reports entered into evidence.the majority finds that the reports contained rich content describing winston many difficulties coping with his intellectual functioning.supra at.however,to clarify,the evaluations constantly referenced external documents and therefore,the jurors received incomplete information even if we assume that they read and understood the evaluations.counsel presented crystal carper from the fairfax county department of family services to authenticate the evaluations.as carpenter had no personal knowledge of the evaluations,she could not speak to their information,and the documents were merely entered into evidence.simply sending incomplete records back with the jury without explanation or context does not save counsel constitutionally deficient performance in this case.see johnson bagley,cir finding that an unreasonably truncated mitigation investigation is not cured simply because some steps were taken prior to the hearing and because some evidence was placed before the jury.
the information before the jury concerning winston subaverage intellectual and adaptive functioning was also materially incomplete because counsel failed to seek out those most familiar with winston in these areas.if the jury had this information,there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have voted against the death penalty.that the state court found otherwise is unreasonable.as an example,two of the people that counsel did not speak with were kirsten jackson and denise king.jackson,winston aunt,who was three years his junior,was never contacted by counsel despite living with winston for almost ten years until winston was age seventeen.among jackson testimony at the evidentiary hearing is the following 
you could tell him to wash the dishes,and you would come back and the dishes were done,and he was just standing there trying to figure out what he was supposed to be doing.anything,any chore he was supposed to be doing,you had to constantly go back and remind him 
his hygiene was good when he lived with us because my mom constantly made sure he took a bath and afterwards,it he moved out,it was something totally different.he always looked dirty,like just smelled nasty,just untouchable.you did want to touch him that how dirty he looked.
i think my mom bathed him until he was about.he had to be watched until he was about that age.
we had one incident where he fell asleep in the tub and had a bowel movement in the tub.and we were trying to figure out where he was at and what was going on.we went upstairs,and he told us it was just toys,and he started playing with it.
you could have a conversation with him.he could comprehend what everyone was saying.talking to him was talking on a different level.it was like you were talking to someone was five or six years old,that he constantly he would joke at the wrong times,or he he could comprehend,like,or have the conversation that we were having,he would like sort of mimic what everyone was saying and converse in that way,and was impossible.
his idea of friendship was if he did something for them,that that was his way of getting them to like him.
he was never able to do his homework.things that his teacher would send him home with,he could comprehend it,he did understand it.even if it was told to him how to do it at school,he would still come home and could figure it out,and i would have to explain to him what the teacher meant and what he was supposed to be doing.and he would generally get frustrated,agitated,and get upset,want to fight just because he did know it.just spelling and all of that,he did have a good subject in school.
denise king was winston teacher for four years at the leary school,a school of last resort for students in fairfax county who were experiencing learning and behavior difficulties.king spent on average seven hours a day with winston,then age eight,and yet she was never contacted.at the evidentiary hearing,she testified that winston had great difficulty reading and following directions.among king testimony about winston at the hearing is the following 
he posed a particular dilemma to me because i thought i came equipped to help students with special needs,and i could not teach leon to read he was a particularly difficult student to teach 
i always felt like leon was not very well cared for.he was interested in school,but i think he had a lot of things going on at home i think even his physical needs were taken care of.his clothes did seem to be his own they appeared too big for him.and we did have a lunch program at the school,and leon did come with food.
i think he had auditory processing problems.he did understand a lot of what he heard.if it was more than one or two directions,he had trouble following it.he misinterpreted social cues.he misinterpreted what people said.he took things very literally.i think his abstract reasoning and memory were probably very limited as well.
leon was the lowest student for the whole four years that i had him 
i do think he knew what a reciprocal friendship was like.a friend was somebody who was,if you were hungry,would give you a cookie,or if you were thirsty,would give you a soda.but other than that,i do think that he even understood what friendships and that kind of thing were all about.
he had no real sense of time.you know,it dark outside or it light outside,but other than that,not really.
and leon did not have any idea where the school was in reference to where he lived and he would leave early because he did know how to get home.
i saw very small changes in his academics there are students that,yes,would adapt to the situation,and once they got into sort of the groove of how the school goes,that when they catch on and they really start to learn.that was not the case with leon.he never got it.he never understood how school went and was every day was a new day,every day.
in addition to testimony from kirsten jackson and denise king,other evidence of mental deficiencies not presented due to counsel failures includes the following 
fairfax schools classified winston as mentally retarded in,as mentioned above,
the classification,as well as other documents in counsel possession,identified marilynn schneider lageman lageman as a psychologist and a member of the special education committee that recommended the evaluation.winston produced a evaluation by lageman conducted on winston,which included a verbal score of sixty and a score of.this score is more than two standard deviations below the mean,compelling evidence of mental retardation under the virginia definition.lageman was never contacted,
by,sixteen winston demonstrated verbal cognitive skill development within the mild range of mental retardation for his age,
winston evaluation showed a fairly evenly delayed profile of cognitive,social,and emotional functioning,generally within the mild range of mental retardation,
winston failed kindergarten twice and had severe academic struggles,
by age,winston had not developed ability to tell time or learn the months of the year,
lageman noted i t was particularly surprising how little leon appear ed to understand social expectations and the reasons behind social practices.
after being placed in the custody of fairfax county,winston had extremely low intellectual functioning and experienced severe emotional distress,
winston handling of money was inadequate by almost any standard and he never had a checking account,a savings account,a credit card,an lease or ownership in his name,
winston never had a job of any type other than selling drugs on the street even at this,other persons gave him instructions and the drugs in quantities with set prices,
additionally,because not reasonably informed,counsel failed to present consequential evidence of winston childhood of emotional distress,neglect,and abandonment,including the following 
winston mother could not stand to be around him and was violent with her children,
the void left by his mother absence was never filled,and the negative influence s of her criminal activity were never replaced with positive ones,
while the jury did hear that winston grandmother ran a shoplifting operation,it did not hear that it was winston who blew the whistle on the operation when he was picked up by fairfax county juvenile detention after his family left him behind and fled as the operation was busted,
because winston had no real caretaker in his life,he was denied a real feeling of family and belonging,
at age fifteen,winston was struggling significantly with trust versus mistrust issues due to all the abandonment and loss in his lifetime.
at the leary school,winston was struggling to make sense out of the world because of his abandonment and upbringing,
a teacher at leary noticed that leon concept of right and wrong never stood a chance,
winston was easily manipulated,had few or no friends,and was never fully accepted by any peer group,
winston was consistently described by family,counselors,and teachers as a child characterized by gullibility,immaturity,passiveness,a lack of,and a desperate need for peer acceptance,
winston was diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome.
in spite of all the above evidence not presented to the jury,the state court found no prejudice on the ground that the evidence was cumulative.i can find no reasonable theory under which the evidence disregarded could be considered cumulative.
the negligible evidence of winston childhood that was before the jury gave an incomplete and misleading understanding of winston life history.williams allen,cir.as i found previously,the evaluations were both unexplained and incomplete.also,counsel presented three witnesses to speak solely on winston social history his mother,grandmother,and great grandmother.in totality,these witnesses represent less than thirteen transcript pages and provided only vague generalities about winston upbringing,generally through yes or no answers.consider an excerpt from winston mother testimony at sentencing 
and how old was he when you went to the penitentiary 
six and a half.
okay.and what are you in the penitentiary for 
malicious wounding,firearm and robbery.
was leon with you when that crime was committed 
has leon father ever been involved in his life 
q.when you became pregnant with leon,what were some of your habits 
a.you mean as 
well,did you stick strictly to drinking tea and milk and things like that or did you drink something else 
alcohol.i did drugs.
when contrasting the one or answers by three witnesses with the mitigating evidence available,the state court unreasonably determined that but for counsel deficient conduct,a reasonable probability did not exist that at least one juror would have voted against the death penalty.for example,winston mother never described him as a child,never told a story of him growing up,nor provided any examples to humanize him.astoundingly,she was never asked to.this dearth of even the most basic details of winston childhood stands in stark contrast to his mother affidavit,submitted two years later 
i was years old when i got pregnant with leon.i was never in a relationship with his father,leon johnson.i knew his father because he was a junkie and i was doing a l
