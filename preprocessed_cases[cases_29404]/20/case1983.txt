years ago,kenny miller went to visit his brother,tommy,who lived with his pregnant wife,kimberly,in a trailer near kokomo,indiana.when he arrived,he discovered a gruesome scene tommy and kimberly had been shot to death,tommy with six bullets and kimberly with three.marvin bieghler was eventually tried,convicted,and sentenced to death for the two murders in.his convictions and death sentence were upheld by the indiana supreme court,both on direct appeal years later,bieghler indiana,and years after that on appeal from the denial of a petition for postconviction relief,bieghler indiana.bieghler moved to federal court in and is here today appealing the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought pursuant to.
first,the senseless facts as determined by the state courts,which we accept as true on this collateral review.bieghler was a major drug supplier in kokomo.he obtained his drugs in florida and had others,including tommy miller,distribute them in the kokomo area.several witnesses,including a bieghler bodyguard named harold scotty brook,testified that prior to the murders,someone within bieghler operation gave information to the police which led to the arrest of a distributor and the confiscation of some dope.an incensed bieghler declared repeatedly that when he found out who blew the whistle,he would blow away the informant.eventually,bieghler began to suspect that tommy miller was the snitch he told associates that he was going to get him.
a major portion of the state case rested on the testimony of brook,who was not prosecuted for his role in the events.according to that testimony,bieghler and brook spent the day of the murders drinking beer and getting high on marijuana.during the evening,bieghler spoke of getting tommy miller.around or they left a tavern and drove to tommy trailer.bieghler got out of the car and went inside carrying an automatic pistol.brook followed and saw bieghler pointing the weapon into a room.bieghler and brook then ran back to the car and drove away.later that night,a distraught bieghler tearfully announced that he was leaving for florida.tommy and kimberly bodies were discovered the next morning.police learned that nine shell casings found at the murder scene matched casings from a remote rural location where bieghler fired his pistol during target practice.at trial,an expert testified that the two sets of casings were fired from the same gun.
bieghler contends that the prosecution violated his due process rights by exploiting,at trial,his failure to talk to the police after his arrest.he also claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.because bieghler petition was filed after april,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa governs our analysis.under the aedpa,a federal court may not grant a writ unless a final state court decision in the case was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,id.d.a state court decision is contrary to established supreme court precedent when the state court reaches a legal conclusion opposite to that of the court or decides a case differently than the court despite materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent occurs when the state court identified the correct rule of law but applied it unreasonably to the facts.id.
according to bieghler,the prosecution,during its of him and again during closing argument,exploited the fact that,after being advised of his miranda rights,he elected to remain silent and not give arresting officers the version of the night events he related on the witness stand.if so,this was a constitutionally impermissible tactic under doyle ohio,d.as applicable here,doyle holds that the prosecution violates a defendant due process rights when it uses silence to impeach an exculpatory story told at trial.see united states shue,cir.this is so because it is fundamentally unfair to assure a defendant,with miranda warnings,that his silence will not be used against him,and then turn around and do exactly that.
bieghler cites several references by the prosecutor to his,silence.his trial counsel,however,did not object to these references and therefore forfeited subsequent challenges to them,united states jacques,cir.ordinarily,when a claimed error is forfeited,we only analyze whether the trial court plainly erred by allowing the prosecutor comments.id.but here we evaluate bieghler claim without the screen of the plain error standard because the state has not argued that it applies.united states cotnam,cir internal quotations omitted united states leichtnam,cir.
at trial,bieghler took the stand and denied complicity in the murders.he testified about being at other places with other people when the millers were killed.on this appeal,he complains about several questions put to him by the state attorney during.the prosecutor asked p rior to the beginning of this trial,did you ever tell the story that you told today to anyone besides your attorneys,were you ever given any opportunity to tell the story to anyone,and did you give it in response to the last question,bieghler answered,no,i exercised my miranda rights.the prosecutor then asked three questions concerning bieghler understanding of his miranda rights before moving on to another subject.it is the state contention that no reference was made to bieghler silence.he was merely fairly,says the state,about his direct testimony for the purpose of testing his credibility as a witness.
in an argument that a little hard to follow,bieghler contends that this snippet from the prosecutor closing remarks to the jury ran afoul of the rule announced in doyle 
kenny cockrell the one that took the fifth.kenny cockrell the one that would answer when i asked if he was doing something to bobby nutt because a deal went bad.he took the fifth.did want to be discriminated against.i growing to hate that train.as a matter of fact,that train came by during my examination of the defendant.i do know,maybe it was my imagination,maybe i wanted to see it,but did you see him,about right before the train came by started to get,his voice was a little different about the time when he left dusty you can talk about that.maybe i only saw it because i wanted to.
a little later,bieghler sees error in this statement from the prosecutor closing argument 
the defendant denies that he was there.and even though it not testimony,looking through it in the opening statement,defense counsel scruggs said that he,the defendant went there that night to bobby nutt.now the only person that important to me is,i was looking,i was listening,waiting to hear so that i would know what the defendant was going to say.you know,i did hear him until he sat up here,and you heard him just like i did.he had everything i had but i could never talk to him.i could use prior inconsistent statements to impeach him because i did have any.he never said anything 
the state contends that the prosecutor statements in closing argument were meant to show that bieghler had an opportunity to hear the state evidence,and make an assessment of it,before he elected to take the stand and give his testimony.it was fair game,the state says,to argue that it gathered and presented its evidence without knowing what bieghler version of the events would be until he revealed it during the trial.
we do not believe that the questions and closing argument comments ran afoul of doyle.in none did the prosecutor equate bieghler silence with guilt,the evil condemned in doyle as undermining the privilege against.the prosecutor,in closing argument,did say that bieghler never said anything,which runs close to the doyle line,but we do think he crossed it,and we emphasize there was no explicit invitation for the jury to infer guilt from bieghler decision to stay quiet after he was arrested at best,any reference was very indirect.
indeed,the prosecution conduct in this case was a far
