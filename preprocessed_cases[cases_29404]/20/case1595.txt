victor turner appeals from the district court denial of his petition for habeas corpus under.turner argues that the exhaustion requirement of b a should be excused due to the failure of his attorneys and the ohio state court of appeals to adjudicate his direct appeal for more than eight years following his conviction.the respondent state of ohio argues that turner petition was properly dismissed because the ohio court of appeals subsequently affirmed his conviction while his appeal from the district court dismissal of the petition for habeas corpus was pending in this court.in addition,the respondent contends turner did not exhaust his state remedies by failing to go to the ohio supreme court.the issue on appeal is whether the district court properly dismissed turner habeas corpus petition for lack of exhaustion.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that dismissal was not proper.therefore,we reverse the judgment of the district court and grant an unconditional writ of habeas corpus.
factual background 
state court proceedings prior to turner habeas corpus petition 
on may,turner was convicted of four counts of aggravated robbery,with firearms specifications as to each count,by a jury in the mahoning county,ohio court of common pleas.on may,turner filed a direct appeal in the ohio seventh district court of appeals court of appeals through his appointed trial counsel.on june,turner requested appellate counsel.the trial court granted turner request and appointed appellate counsel attorney.on november,based on disagreements with attorney,turner moved to file his own assignments of error.on november,the court of appeals ordered that turner pleading be filed as part of the record of his appeal.
on february,turner filed a motion to compel his attorney to produce certain documents and complained to the court of appeals that his attorney was not representing him.the court of appeals denied turner motion and ruled that attorney should continue to represent him.
one year after filing his direct appeal,turner continued to disagree with attorney.on june,turner moved for leave to file a supplemental brief with the appellate court,seeking to raise assignments of error he felt his attorney may not raise.the court denied turner motion on june,ruling that turner and attorney should work together to file a brief.
on october,turner wrote a letter to attorney in which he stated that he was completely lost,and did not know what to do,or just how to proceed.
on september,more than two years after being appointed to represent turner on appeal,attorney moved to withdraw,citing irreconcilable differences but giving no details.apparently the differences between turner and attorney centered on counsel expectation that turner would draft his own brief on the speedy trial issue,despite turner insistence that he did not feel qualified to write a brief on the issue.the court of appeals granted attorney motion to withdraw.as of the time of his withdrawal,attorney had not filed any assignments of error or a brief on turner behalf.on september,the court of appeals appointed a second appellate attorney attorney.
on january,turner wrote a letter to attorney stating,i am at my wits end.i feel as if i am a ship stuck in the middle of the ocean please,please help me 
nearly four months later,and approximately three years after turner filed his direct appeal,attorney filed a motion to withdraw based on irreconcilable differences but giving no details.attorney had written one letter to turner,on december,but did not otherwise contact him,much less attempt to speak with him,during the eight months in which she was his attorney.on september,the court of appeals granted attorney motion to withdraw and appointed a third attorney attorney to represent turner on appeal.
on may,the court of appeals ordered that turner direct appeal would be dismissed on june,if not prosecuted further.
on october,the court of appeals again ordered attorney that it would dismiss turner direct appeal unless he filed assignments of error and a brief on or before november.on march,the court of appeals ordered that it would dismiss the appeal if turner did not file assignments of error and a brief by march.as of may,neither of these pleadings had been filed.nevertheless,the court of appeals did not dismiss turner appeal.
on august,the state of ohio filed a motion to dismiss turner appeal for failure to prosecute.attorney filed a brief in opposition to the state motion on august,and asked for a continuance to september.at that time,he had been turner appointed lawyer for approximately five years,but had failed to file an appellate brief.
six months later,on february,the court of appeals granted the state of ohio motion to dismiss turner direct appeal for want of prosecution.
on march,turner,through attorney,moved to reinstate the appeal.attorney also requested to withdraw as counsel the only basis for attorney motion to withdraw was his desire to become a college student in the fall semester of.the record indicates that attorney did not contact turner at all during his years as turner attorney.
two years later,on march,the state court of appeals granted turner request and reopened the appeal.the state court also granted attorney request to withdraw.the state court then named the ohio public defender attorney as counsel for turner,but attorney moved to withdraw less than a month following its appointment.
the state court of appeals granted the public defender motion and immediately appointed a fifth attorney attorney to represent turner.on june,attorney filed a brief on turner behalf,following one motion for extension of time.on october,turner was paroled.
federal court proceedings 
on march,turner filed a petition for habeas corpus under.at that time,turner direct appeal in state court had been dismissed for want of prosecution.turner petition raised nine grounds.grounds one and two alleged denial of his right to a speedy trial.ground three alleged racial discrimination in jury selection.ground four alleged denial of a speedy appeal and ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.ground five alleged excessive delay in considering turner petition.ground six alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel.ground seven alleged due process violations regarding evidence at trial.ground eight alleged denial of a fair trial regarding eye witnesses.ground nine alleged breach of an agreement not to prosecute turner.
magistrate judge jack streepy recommended that turner petition be conditionally granted.on the question of exhaustion under b a,magistrate judge streepy concluded 
in this case,three different attorneys were appointed to represent turner,none of whom filed assignments of error or a supporting brief.while the appellate court docket has not been provided,it reasonably appears that in the elapsed time each attorney was appointed should have filed these documents.nonetheless,during most of the seven and years,the appellate court did not order counsel to follow the rules and did not sanction any of the three attorneys.although turner filed eight assignments of error in november of approximately six months after he filed his direct appeal,and the appellate court stated that filing was part of the record,thereafter the court denied turner motion to file a supplemental brief to raise errors that his first appointed attorney might not raise,stating turner and his attorney should work together.the court ultimately sanctioned turner by dismissing his appeal despite the fact the failure to file was due almost exclusively to the failures of his appointed attorneys.
the above delay must be attributed to the state,and it constitutes an inordinate delay.thus,the failure of turner to exhaust state remedies is excused.
fn.any alleged state procedural violation is not well taken since turner appellate attorneys on direct appeal failed to file an assignment of errors or supporting brief for over seven years,and the appellate court ultimately refused to permit turner to raise issues pro se.
joint appendix.
as to the merits of turner petition,magistrate judge streepy only addressed ground four,which alleged excessive delay in turner direct appeal and ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.the magistrate judge concluded that the right to a speedy appeal has not been established by a decision of the supreme court.however,the magistrate judge recommended that turner petition should be conditionally granted because each of turner three appointed attorneys on appeal rendered ineffective assistance by repeatedly failing to file a brief in his direct appeal.
on december,the district court rejected the magistrate judge report and recommendation and dismissed tuner petition for failure to exhaust state remedies.the district court did not address the merits of the petition.
turner timely appealed the dismissal of his petition to this court.on appeal in this court,turner is represented by counsel attorney 
c.the decision of the ohio court of appeals following the dismissal of turner habeas petition by the district court 
nearly eleven years after filing his direct appeal,on march,the ohio court of appeals affirmed turner conviction,apparently without oral argument.see state turner,wl ohio app.the ohio court of appeals held that turner was not denied a statutory right to a speedy trial turner was not denied a constitutional right to a speedy trial turner conviction was supported by sufficient evidence turner conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence turner was not deprived of a fair trial by the prosecutor statements concerning a prior prosecution against turner the prosecutor adequately supported peremptory strikes with explanations and turner did not establish that he was denied a speedy appeal.turner has not sought leave to appeal in the ohio supreme court.
procedural time line 
the foregoing factual background results in the following procedural time line 
ii.standard of review 
in reviewing the district court denial of turner petition for a writ of habeas corpus,we review its legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.towns smith,wl cir.
iii.discussion 
a.the exhaustion requirement 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a state prisoner shall not be granted unless the petitioner has exhausted available state court remedies,there is an absence of available state corrective process,or circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to protect the petitioner rights.b and c.this court has also held that a habeas court should excuse exhaustion where further action in state court would be an exercise in futility.lucas people of the state of michigan,cir holding that such a judicial runaround is not mandated by the exhaustion requirement.in this case,we are concerned with whether the delay in the adjudication of turner appeal,accompanied by the failure of his appointed attorneys to file a brief on his behalf,rendered the state process ineffective or inadequate to protect his federal constitutional rights such that the exhaustion requirement should be excused.
the exhaustion requirement is based on principles of comity and federalism.it provides state courts an opportunity to address alleged flaws in their criminal procedures.the requirement is based on the presumption that states maintain adequate and effective remedies to vindicate federal constitutional rights.workman tate,cir t he principle that federal courts should defer to state courts in the interest of comity assumes that the state courts will give prompt consideration to claims of violation of constitutional rights.the record indicates that the ohio state courts did not give prompt consideration to turner claims.therefore,turner petition defeated the presumption of adequate and effective remedies at the state level.the district court dismissal of turner petition undermined the fundamental purpose of the exhaustion requirement by denying federal review to claims that were wrongfully ignored by the ohio courts.
in workman tate,supra,this court held that a habeas corpus petitioner failure to exhaust state remedies should be excused where his petition for relief has languished in state court for more than three years.workman,at.this court reasoned that the state court inordinate delay in adjudicating the petitioner claims rendered the state procedures ineffective or inadequate and thus undercut the foundation of the exhaustion requirement.id.at see also moore egeler,holding that in order to render petitioner state remedies truly effective the exhaustion requirement should be excused for the purposes of court habeas jurisdiction.
in harris champion,cir,the court of appeals for the tenth circuit held that the failure of the oklahoma public defender to pursue the petitioner state court appeal excused the petitioner from satisfying the exhaustion requirement of where such failure resulted in a projected delay in the petitioner case.
in this case,based on the reasoning of this court in workman and the tenth circuit in harris,the magistrate judge recommended that turner failure to exhaust state remedies be excused and that his petition for habeas corpus be granted on grounds of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.in rejecting the magistrate judge report and recommendation,the district court distinguished the present case from workman based on the fact that in this case,the state court had dismissed turner appeal.the district court concluded 
the workman exception does not appear to have been extended to circumstances where the state court has ruled on a petitioner appeal,despite taking an inordinate amount of time to do so.
ja.we conclude that the district court improperly distinguished workman because in this case,the state court dismissed turner direct appeal for want of prosecution rather than addressing his appeal on the merits.
the district court decision to dismiss turner petition rests on two young,cir and schandelmeier cunningham,cir.both cases are inapposite because at the time of the district court decision in this case,the state court of appeals had not ruled on turner appeal by addressing the merits of the appeal.
in carpenter young,cir,the court of appeals for the tenth circuit applied the rule stated in harris champion,supra and held that the exhaustion requirement should be excused and the petitioner entitled to habeas relief unless the state could justify the delay in adjudicating his appeal.carpenter,at.
in schandelmeier cunningham,cir,the court of appeals for the third circuit held that because the petitioner motions had been ruled upon by the state trial court during the pendency of his federal appeal,the exhaustion requirement should not be excused.
turner case is entirely different from those of the petitioners in carpenter and schandelmeier.at the time of the district court decision in this case,turner state court appeal had been dismissed for failure to prosecute and had not been considered on the merits.the district court conclusion that the state court of appeals ruled on turner appeal was erroneous in light of the posture of turner state court appeal at the time the district court reviewed his habeas corpus petition.
the remaining issue before this court is whether the subsequent decision of the state court of appeals,which affirmed turner conviction on the merits,constitutes a ruling which renders turner speedy appeal claim and effective assistance claim moot,that is,whether the exhaustion requirement has been met by providing turner with an opportunity to obtain redress in state court.see state turner,ca,wl ohio app.march.the state court decision was too late.we hold that it does not render the speedy appeal or effective assistance of appellate counsel issues moot,and exhaustion should be excused as to all issues raised.
like the petitioners in workman and harris,supra,turner claim of appeal in the ohio state court system languished for years without adjudication.the attorneys appointed by the state failed to prosecute his appeal,and the state court of appeals failed to insure timely representation.on the contrary,the state court continually postponed turner appeal by allowing four different attorneys to withdraw from the case without filing briefs.it allowed turner appeal to remain on the docket for nearly eleven years
