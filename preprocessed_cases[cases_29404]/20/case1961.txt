an illinois jury convicted alejandro ruvalcaba of the first degree murder and attempted murder of rival gang members.he unsuccessfully appealed to the appellate court of illinois.the supreme court of illinois later denied review.he then timely filed a petition for federal habeas relief.see.in that petition,he asserted,among other matters,that his confession was involuntary and that he had been unduly prejudiced by prosecutorial misconduct.the district court denied his petition on the ground that the state court decision was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of federal law.the district court granted a certificate of appealability with respect to the involuntary confession issue,and a certificate was issued on the prosecutorial misconduct claim after the case was docketed in this court.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
when he was sixteen years old,ruvalcaba,together with two other members of the latin kings gang,juan meneses and juan alvarez,encountered rival la raza gang members,carlos flores,hiram martinez and luis sanchez.this confrontation took place in a chicago alley on november.earlier in the day,someone had broken a window on meneses car,an act of vandalism that he attributed to la raza.meneses and ruvalcaba were both armed.the two groups exchanged gang signs.according to the la raza survivors,meneses and ruvalcaba drew their firearms flores,martinez and sanchez attempted to run away.according to ruvalcaba,meneses and flores began shooting at each other,and he joined in.regardless of who initiated the altercation,meneses and ruvalcaba both fired.the latter testified that he fired only one round towards a fence in the direction of the fleeing rivals.martinez was killed in this exchange of gunfire.
a police investigation indicated ruvalcaba involvement,and two officers went to his residence.ruvalcaba brother informed them that he was not there.the officers left,arrested alvarez and meneses,and then returned.no one answered the door at ruvalcaba residence so the officers left a business card.they learned that ruvalcaba had a girlfriend,diana caguana,and they arrested ruvalcaba at her residence at approximately.the police then returned to ruvalcaba residence to notify his parents of his arrest,but,when officers arrived there,no one was home and their business card remained in the door.
ruvalcaba was placed in a interview room and read his miranda rights by the interrogating officers,detectives william moser and albert graf.a youth officer was not present initially,but one later arrived and was in the room during a brief conversation in which ruvalcaba denied knowing anything about martinez murder.detective moser sent officers a second time to locate ruvalcaba parents,but again the officers were unsuccessful.ruvalcaba participated in a lineup with alvarez and meneses just after midnight.thereafter,ruvalcaba was returned to the interview room detective moser testified that he checked on the suspect through the night and asked ruvalcaba whether he was hungry or needed to use the restroom.detective graf testified that he purchased food for ruvalcaba and the other suspects at approximately and 
diana caguana,ruvalcaba girlfriend,along with the couple infant child,arrived at the station sometime that morning.at approximately,detective moser and a youth officer were present while the assistant state attorney,thomas biesty,again issued miranda warnings and questioned ruvalcaba.he denied knowledge of the murder.at approximately,detective moser took a picture of caguana and the baby the detective testified that he took the picture at ruvalcaba request to prove to ruvalcaba that caguana was present at the station,but ruvalcaba denies knowing that she was there.detective moser testified that he allowed caguana to speak to ruvalcaba at.ruvalcaba denies that the visit took place.indeed,ruvalcaba testified that detective moser showed him the picture of caguana and the baby,and told him to confess or detective moser would get caguana and get the truth out of her.and if she tried lying detective moser would make sure he put her in jail and take the baby,and make sure the baby ended up in at.
at,assistant state attorney biesty again issued the miranda warnings to ruvalcaba and again questioned him in the presence of detective moser the parties disputed whether the youth officer was present throughout the interview.ruvalcaba claims that he received warnings but did not waive his miranda rights.ruvalcaba asked what alvarez and meneses were saying,and biesty showed him that his codefendants had given statements.ruvalcaba thereafter confessed to the events in the alley and gave a statement at.he claims that biesty pressed him to conform the statement to those already rendered by alvarez and meneses.however,ruvalcaba did not have access to his codefendants statements while giving his own.at the end of his statement,ruvalcaba said that he had been treated well,understood his rights and had not been given promises in exchange for the statement.
state and federal proceedings 
state trial 
ruvalcaba was charged with first degree murder in the death of martinez and with the attempted first degree murder of flores and sanchez.before trial,he sought to suppress the confession on the grounds that the police had failed to notify his parents of his arrest,that he did not intelligently waive his right to an attorney after police told him that he did not need one and that officers coerced him into making a statement.the trial court heard testimony from the officers and ruvalcaba and denied his suppression motion,
basing its determination on the witnesses credibility.the court found that the officers had substantially complied with the requirements contained in the juvenile court act.the court further found that ruvalcaba had not been subjected to intense psychological pressures and had voluntarily given his statement after being advised of his constitutional and juvenile rights.
opinion of appellate court of illinois at.
after the denial of his suppression motion,ruvalcaba was tried before a jury and relied upon a claim of.the jury acquitted ruvalcaba of the attempted murder of sanchez,but could not reach a verdict on the other charges.he was tried a second time.the second jury found ruvalcaba guilty of the first degree murder of martinez and the attempted murder of flores.
state appellate proceedings 
ruvalcaba appealed to the appellate court of illinois he argued,among other grounds,that his confession was involuntary and that he had been denied due process of law because of prosecutorial misconduct during the assistant state attorneys closing arguments.the court affirmed his conviction in an unpublished opinion.
the appellate court rejected ruvalcaba contention that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress his confession.ruvalcaba had sought suppression on the ground that he had been questioned without his parents present and had made a statement under coercion.considering the totality of the circumstances and taking special care because ruvalcaba was a minor,the court noted that certain factors,such as ruvalcaba age,his lack of experience with the criminal justice system,and the alleged threats against his girlfriend and child,supported a determination of involuntariness.
on the other hand,the appellate court continued,several factors supported the conclusion that ruvalcaba statement was voluntary.notably,he had raised the alleged threats for the first time on appeal and never had mentioned the threats in his statement or trial testimony he had offered no evidence to corroborate his claim to have been psychologically or physically coerced he had been fed and was allowed to use the restroom,and he said in his statement that he had been treated well by the police he acknowledged at every stage that he understood his rights he did not have access to any codefendants statements when giving his confession and had not argued at trial that he was forced to change his statement to conform with the statements of the other arrestees.moreover,the appellate court noted certain personal traits of ruvalcaba that indicated that his statement had not been involuntary.for example,he was a high school student of at least average apparent intelligence and was an admitted gang member who was presumably streetwise,at.
the court also noted that,although ruvalcaba was detained for up to thirteen hours,he was interrogated only three times,for intervals ranging from only a few seconds to minutes.the appellate court finally determined that the police had complied with illinois juvenile court act by calling a youth officer shortly before ruvalcaba arrived at the station and by making a reasonable attempt to notify ruvalcaba parents.ilcs.the appellate court accordingly held that the totality of the circumstances indicated that ruvalcaba offered his confession voluntarily.
the state appellate court also rejected ruvalcaba prosecutorial misconduct claims.ruvalcaba had argued that an assistant state attorney offered an incorrect statement of law by informing the jury that first degree murder required the state to prove only two elements,the mens rea and the actus reus,and by subsuming the third element,lack of justification,into the requirement for second degree murder.under illinois law,the substantive offense of first degree murder requires that the state prove that the defendant lacked justification.ruvalcaba contended that the prosecutor misstatements had the effect of placing the burden on him to prove that the killing was justified.
the appellate court held that,taken in context,the prosecutor statements merely describ ed the process involved in determining whether defendant was guilty of either first degree murder or second degree murder and did not improperly shift the burden to ruvalcaba,at.the court held,in the alternative,that the trial court instructions to the jury,which included the elements and the burden of proof,cured any prejudice resulting from the statements.
ruvalcaba also argued that an assistant state attorney comments in rebuttal shifted the burden of proof by stating that ruvalcaba was attempting to put the state witnesses on trial.the appellate court found this argument unpersuasive because ruvalcaba counsel invited the comments in his own closing statement.
the supreme court of illinois denied a petition for leave to appeal.
federal habeas proceedings 
ruvalcaba then timely filed a federal petition for habeas corpus.see.his petition raised four claims of error,only two of which have been appealed to us.
first,he submitted that the appellate court decision was contrary to and an unreasonable application of the supreme court guidance for evaluating juvenile confessions as established in fare michael,d,and applied in hardaway young,cir.
the district court rejected this argument because neither fare nor hardaway established a per se rule of involuntariness in evaluating a minor confession,but rather held that youth is one factor in a totality of the circumstances analysis.given this standard,the district court held that the appellate court analysis was not an unreasonable application of fare because it adequately considered ruvalcaba age as well as other circumstances.
ruvalcaba also renewed his claim of prosecutorial misconduct.the district court evaluated the submission that he had raised before the state appellate court and rejected his claim for relief.
the district court granted ruvalcaba a certificate of appealability on his involuntary confession claim.after ruvalcaba filed his appeal,a certificate of appealability was issued for his additional claim of prosecutorial misconduct.
discussiona.standard of review 
we review the district court denial of a petition for habeas relief de novo.barrow uchtman,cir.a petition for a writ of habeas corpus by an individual incarcerated pursuant to a state court judgment shall not be granted unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.the state appellate court findings of fact are presumed correct.that presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence.id.e mendiola schomig,cir.
ruvalcaba grounds his appeal on both the contrary to and the unreasonable application prongs of.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law when the court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from its precedent.williams taylor,d.an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law results when a court correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case.id.at.this reasonableness determination is quite deferential,such that a state decision may stand as long as it is objectively reasonable,even if the reviewing court determines it to be substantively incorrect.uchtman,at.we presume the state court factual determinations to be correct,unless ruvalcaba rebuts that presumption with clear and convincing evidence.e.
involuntary confession 
ruvalcaba first asserts that the state appellate court acted contrary to and unreasonably applied supreme court precedent when it determined his confession to be voluntary.he notes that the record must be scrutinized with care in cases involving a juvenile confession,and he claims that the state court did not exercise that care in evaluating his statements.he argues that the totality of the circumstances,but particularly his youth,indicates that police coercion over the course of a long interrogation overcame his will to resist.consequently,ruvalcaba argues,the admission of his statement violated his rights under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the united states.
at the outset,ruvalcaba challenges several of the state court factual findings.see d.in particular,he disputes that police interrogated him only three times while he was in custody and that he understood the miranda warnings.however,he offers no evidence beyond his own assertions to refute the evidence from officers that he was interrogated three times.in short,he fails to offer the clear and convincing evidence necessary to rebut the statutory presumption that the state court factual findings are correct.similarly,he offers no evidence at all to rebut the officers testimony that he appeared to understand the miranda warnings.accordingly,we must accept the state court factual determinations.see id.e.furthermore,the state trial court factual determinations largely were based on its view of the credibility of the witnesses.federal courts do not reevaluate the credibility of witnesses when conducting habeas review of state trials.stone farley,cir.
we turn now to a determination of whether the decision of the appellate court of illinois can be characterized as a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.the applicable standard is established firmly in the jurisprudence of the supreme court in evaluating whether a defendant offered a voluntary statement,a court must examine the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation.schneckloth bustamonte,d.this approach is adequate to determine whether there has been a waiver even where interrogation of juveniles is involved.fare,at.in juvenile cases,the inquiry includes evaluation of the juvenile age,experience,education,background,and intelligence,and considers whether he has the capacity to understand the warnings given him,the nature of his fifth amendment rights,and the consequences of waiving those rights.see also hardaway,at.the appellate court of illinois recognized that it was required to evaluate the totality of the circumstances surrounding ruvalcaba confession and undertook that task,at.therefore,the court was not acting contrary to clearly established law.hardaway,at.
our next concern is whether the state court unreasonably applied supreme court precedent.as we already have noted,the voluntariness of a statement is determined by considering whether,in light of the totality of the circumstances,the statement was the product of a rational intellect and free will,or whether it was obtained by the authorities through coercive means,united states brooks,cir citing mincey arizona,d,and colorado connelly,d.ruvalcaba minority at the time is an important factor to consider,but his age alone does not render the confession involuntary.see fare,at.noting that the inquiry includes evaluation of the juvenile age emphasis added.the supreme court in fare held that a could make a statement intelligently and voluntarily,even without the presence of a friendly adult see also hardaway,at t he mere absence of a friendly adult is by itself insufficient to require suppression of a juvenile confession.
with respect to the other fare factors,ruvalcaba had reached his sophomore year in high school by the time of the offense,and there is no evidence that he was of abnormally low intelligence or otherwise was highly vulnerable.the trial court had an opportunity to assess his demeanor when he testified at the suppression hearing.ruvalcaba admittedly had no previous experience with the criminal justice system,a fact that the appellate court noted in his favor.however,ruvalcaba was an admitted gang member,and the district court can not be said to have erred in presuming that he was streetwise,a factor that reduces the importance of his lack of experience and indicates the capacity to appreciate his fifth amendment rights.see correll thompson,cir noting that defendant was streetwise and thus was capable of understanding his rights and of giving a voluntary statement,despite an iq of.in short,t here is no indication that he was of insufficient intelligence to understand the rights he was waiving,or what the consequences of that waiver would be.fare,at.
in addition,there is relatively little evidence of official coercion in this case.ruvalcaba was detained for up to fourteen hours,but the evidence shows that he was not interrogated repeatedly during this period and that he was questioned for a total of less than two hours over the course of three separate sessions.nor is there evidence that he was denied food,rest or bathroom facilities during the period of his detention.although he claimed that assistant state attorney biesty forced him to conform his statement to mirror those of his codefendants,the state trial court,basing its conclusion on its assessment of the witnesses credibility,found that ruvalcaba gave his statement before he was informed in any way of the substance of his codefendants statements.
the only evidence of coercion that ruvalcaba offered was the alleged threat to his girlfriend and child.see johnson trigg,cir.the state trial court appraised this story when it made credibility findings and concluded that ruvalcaba will was not overborn by intense psychological pressure at the time he confessed.in sum,the appellate court of illinois reasonably applied the standard set forth by the supreme court in fare for evaluating a juvenile confession.
waiver of miranda rights 
ruvalcaba submissions may be construed as independently challenging the state court determination that he voluntarily waived his right to remain silent and to have counsel present during his interrogation.see miranda arizona,d.in evaluating whether a suspect voluntarily waived his miranda rights,we consider the same factors that we considered above in assessing the overall voluntariness of a confession.see united states huerta,cir factors considered in the analysis include the defendant background,experience,and conduct.any argument that ruvalcaba involuntarily waived his miranda rights would reiterate the identical factual assertions that the district court rejected with respect to h is voluntariness claim.id.the state court determination that ruvalcaba voluntarily waived his rights is compatible with the standards enunciated by the supreme court of the united states.
prosecutorial misconduct 
ruvalcaba further submits that he was denied a fair trial through prosecutorial misconduct.he alleges that the state attorneys misstated the law to the jury and improperly shifted the burden of proof although his submissions to this court do not specify the challenged statements,we understand ruvalcaba claim to assert the same error that he argued before the state courts.
in illinois,lack of justification is an element of the offense of first degree murder that must be proved by the state.ilcs a a person who kills an individual without lawful justification commits first degree murder if emphasis added.the defendant bears the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,a mitigating factor such as to reduce the offense to second degree murder.when such a defense is raised,t he state still bears the burden to prove,beyond a reasonable doubt,the elements of first degree murder and,when appropriately raised,the absence of circumstances at the time of the killing that would justify or exonerate the murder.people jeffries.
in her closing statement,an assistant state attorney told the jury 
the judge will instruct you,ladies and gentlemen,that to sustain the charge of first degree murder,the state must prove the following propositions,that the defendant or for one for whose conduct he is legally responsible,the accountability language,perform ed the acts which cause d the death of hiram martinez.
second,that when the defendant or for one for whose conduct he is legally responsible did so intend to kill or do great bodily harm to hiram martinez or he knew that such act would cause death to hiram martinez or you know that such an act created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to hiram martinez.
t here are two propositions here in order for the charge of first degree murder in this case,ladies and gentlemen.we have proven each and every one of them.first,that the defendant or one for whose conduct he is legally responsible performed the acts which caused the death.
we know that is what happened.we know that shooting in the alley caused the death of hiram martinez,the second proposition which give you three separate propositions.we have proven each and every one of those.
when you fire a millimeter handgun and a caliber weapon into the direction of two living human beings,what else could you possibly intend except to cause death or great bodily harm.
ladies and gentlemen,this is like a road map.ladies and gentlemen,we have proven first degree murder.
the judge will also struck sic you,ladies and gentlemen,as to the law of second degree murder,and that would be the third proposition that you will read on this instruction.
the third proposition states that the defendant or one for whose conduct he is legally responsible was not justified in using the force in which he used.
defendant was not justified in using the force in which he used.he was not justified in using that force by his own admission,that nobody had a gun in the alley,that he went into enemy territory,ladies and gentlemen,as aggressor looking for revenge.
do let this fool you,ladies and gentlemen,the only way to get to this third point is for the defense to show mitigating factor language.there is sic no mitigating factors.
at see also,at.the trial court sustained an objection to this last point and instructed the jury to disregard it,at.
in the state rebuttal,another assistant state attorney added 
defendant wants to get out from underneath the crushing,damning evidence of his guilt well,you saw it over the last few days,ladies and gentlemen.he tries to shift the spotlight over to the police,put the witnesses on trial,try to put the assistant state attorney from review on trial.it is called a defense of desperation.
objection sustained 
they never told us what to do in law school when the law is not on your side and when the evidence is not on your side.well,you got to see it first hand over the last few days.what you do is come up with the alejandro ruvalcaba defense that puts everybody else on trial.
objection overruled
