frazier crockett is currently serving sentences of natural life in prison without parole and years imprisonment for his convictions for two counts of first degree murder and two counts of robbery.after unsuccessful appeals to the illinois appellate court and illinois supreme court,crockett filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the northern district of illinois.the court denied his petition,and he filed a notice of appeal.the district court granted crockett motion for a certificate of appealability on one issue were crockett constitutional rights denied when he was not timely informed that the jury had sent a question to the trial judge during deliberations 
background 
crockett convictions arise from the robbery and fatal shooting of two men,javier guzman and jorge torres,in an alley in chicago rogers park neighborhood.upon crockett arrest,he gave a statement to police describing the crimes he and james swansey,with a gun drawn,followed two men into an alley and demanded that the men lie down.swansey asked the men if they had any money on them,but the men claimed they did not.crockett pointed the gun at the men while swansey searched them.crockett then also searched the men and found money in one man pocket.he suggested to swansey that they pop the men for lying,and swansey shot them both in the head.
at trial,it was undisputed that swansey was the.three of crockett acquaintances testified for the state that crockett told them that he and swansey robbed the men and swansey shot them.crockett theory of defense was that he was present and watched the commission of the crimes but did not participate.crockett testified at trial that on the night of the murders he had been walking around with swansey and kenneth henry.henry was one of the state witnesses at trial and the person who initially provided the tip to police that crockett had been involved in the crimes.crockett claimed that he stopped to talk to a friend on the street when swansey and henry followed two men into the alley.he was attempting to catch up to swansey and henry and was standing in the entrance to the alley sixty feet away when henry and swansey robbed the men.he began to run away after swansey fired the first shot.he later accepted hush money from henry to keep quiet about what he had witnessed.crockett explained that his prior statement to police implicating himself which did not mention henry was a lie to protect henry,whom he feared,because henry was a drug dealer for whom crockett sold drugs.
during deliberations,the jury sent three notes to the judge.the first two notes asked for a dictionary and for the reports of police detectives.the judge directed the sheriff to contact defense counsel by telephone about the notes,and the court conferred with counsel about the appropriate response.after the parties conferred,the judge declined the jury requests and directed the jury to continue deliberating.later,the jury sent a third note to the judge asking for a definition of the word abet.the judge again directed the sheriff to contact defense counsel,but for unknown reasons the sheriff either did not contact defense counsel or was unable to reach them.the judge did not respond to the jury,and the jury eventually reached a guilty verdict.the judge did not inform defense counsel before or after the verdict that the jury had asked a third question.
after the trial,defense counsel discovered the third note from the jury in the court case file.in a motion for acquittal or a new trial,defense counsel included affidavits from three jurors.all three jurors stated that they had requested a dictionary to look up the word abet but received a response from the trial judge to keep deliberating.all three jurors stated that they later sent a note specifically asking for the definition of abet but received no response.one juror explained 
some of the jurors sent out a note asking for the definition of the word abet.we waited for a response but never received one.eventually some of the jurors came up with their own definition because we had no legal definition.we decided that frazier crockett was guilty of aiding and abetting kenneth henry and james swansey because,while he observed the robbery and murder from feet away,frazier crockett did nothing to stop them,he kept the hush money after the fact,and he never went to the police.the jury did not determine that frazier crockett encouraged,solicited,promoted or facilitated the commission of the armed robberies and murders.
in less detail,the other two jurors provided similar accounts of the deliberations,stating that they concluded crockett was guilty because he observed the crime and never went to the police.the jurors made conflicting estimates as to how much time had passed between sending the note and reaching the verdict one estimated fifteen minutes,another estimated between thirty minutes and one hour,and a third estimated one hour.
the trial court denied crockett motion for a new trial.on appeal,the illinois appellate court found that the definition of the word abet was central to crockett defense because if the jury mistakenly believed that abet could encompass less culpable behavior than the other terms in the jury instruction,such as being present at the commission of a crime and doing nothing about it,the defendant defense was precluded.people crockett,d.the court noted that the jury was entitled to clarification,but crockett shouldered the burden of demonstrating factors such as how much time elapsed before the verdict was reached and what attempts were made to reach counsel if the jury reached a verdict before the court could reasonably answer,then there was no reversible error.id.at.the court concluded that crockett failed to construct a record that demonstrated that the trial court unreasonably delayed in responding to the jury prior to the verdict.id.at.the court found,however,that the trial court erred in not informing crockett after the verdict was reached that the jury had asked a third question,but it determined that the error was harmless because crockett had discovered the note within a period in time to move for acquittal or a new trial,the argument on the motion did not occur for several more months,and he was able to obtain affidavits from three jurors.id.the illinois supreme court denied crockett petition for leave to appeal.people crockett,
crockett filed a habeas petition under with the district court.the court noted that it does not violate a defendant constitutional right to a fair trial when a deliberating jury asks a question but reaches a verdict before the court can reasonably respond.crockett contended that the situation was different where the trial judge entirely failed to inform the defense counsel before the verdict that the note even existed the court agreed the distinction could be important but found it to be irrelevant in light of the illinois appellate court finding that the trial judge did attempt to contact the defense counsel.while noting that crockett had never appealed the state court decision to place the burden upon him,the district court inquired as to whether the illinois appellate court did so in error.the court reasoned that if there were a constitutional error,then the illinois appellate court should have applied the harmless error analysis of chapman california,d,and placed the burden on the state.the district court concluded,however,that it was appropriate for crockett to bear the burden until he established that a constitutional violation had occurred,which he failed to do.finally,the court concluded that crockett could not sustain his burden on habeas review with respect to the illinois appellate court determination that it was harmless error for the trial court to fail to tell defense counsel about the note after the jury verdict.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.rizzo smith,cir.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,which applies to this case,julian bartley,cir,prohibits a federal court from issuing a writ of habeas corpus on any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in the state court,unless it resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court reached a result opposite to that reached by the supreme court on materially indistinguishable facts.virsnieks smith,cir.a state court decision is an unreasonable application of federal law if it identified the proper legal principle from supreme court precedent but unreasonably applied that principle to the facts of the petitioner case.rompilla beard,d.to be unreasonable,the decision must not only be incorrect,but so incorrect that it lies outside of the range of reasonable conclusions.jones wallace,cir.in analyzing the reasonableness of the state court decision on a factual matter,we assume that the state court factual determinations are correct unless the defendant rebuts them with clear and convincing evidence.mack mccann,cir e.
crockett appeal implicates both the legal and factual components of aedpa.he argues that the illinois appellate court erred in concluding that the trial judge did not commit constitutional error when it failed to notify defense counsel about the question and respond to the jury prior to the verdict the illinois appellate court determination that the trial judge did not unreasonably delay in answering the jury question prior to the verdict was unreasonable in light of the evidence and the illinois appellate court found that the trial judge erred in not informing defense counsel of the note after the verdict but applied the wrong burden analysis,contrary to supreme court precedent 
a.the trial court actions prior to the verdict 
crockett legal challenge focuses upon his right to a fair trial,his right to counsel,and his right to be present during all stages of trial.he cites several supreme court cases maine moulton,d holding that the sixth amendment is violated when the state obtains incriminating statements by knowingly circumventing the accused right to have counsel present in a confrontation between the accused and a state agent united states wade,d holding that a defendant was entitled to counsel at a lineup united states gagnon,d holding that the failure by a criminal defendant to invoke his right to be present at a conference which he knows is taking place between the judge and a juror in chambers constitutes a valid waiver of that right and rogers united states,d holding that it was error for the trial judge to answer a jury question without giving defendant counsel an opportunity to be heard before the trial judge responded.
the illinois appellate court first noted that it would have been improper for the trial judge to respond to the jury before contacting counsel,and the trial judge appropriately did not do so.this is consistent with the principle set forth by the supreme court in rogers.the court then held that it is not error for a trial judge to fail to respond to a question by the jury if the jury reaches a decision before a response can reasonably be provided.crockett does not cite a case in which the supreme court held the opposite on materially indistinguishable facts to show that this decision was contrary to supreme court precedent nor does he show that the decision involved an unreasonable application through the appellate court unreasonable refusal to extend a rule to a context where it should have applied.virsnieks,at.in fact,he does not show that the decision was incorrect,let alone so incorrect that it lies outside of the range of reasonable conclusions.jones,at.therefore,crockett has not satisfied his burden under aedpa.see rizzo,at rejecting habeas petition and noting that rizzo claimed constitutional violations but stop ped short of stating which supreme court case provides clearly established precedent for his position lieberman thomas,cir nowhere in the petition does lieberman demonstrate how the state appellate court opinion conflicts with,or unreasonably applied,relevant supreme court precedent.
crockett factual challenge focuses upon the illinois appellate court determination that crockett failed to show that the trial court unreasonably delayed in informing defense counsel of the note prior to the verdict.crockett claims that the record shows the trial court did unreasonably delay,and the illinois appellate court conclusion to the contrary was unreasonable in light of the evidence.applying the standard from brecht abrahamson,d holding that an error must have a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict to entitle a petitioner to habeas relief,he claims that the error had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury verdict because the juror affidavits showed that they accepted his trial testimony,which would very likely have resulted in an acquittal if they had received clarification on the meaning of abet.the district court disagreed with crockett,finding the illinois appellate court decision that the trial court did not unreasonably delay was a reasonable determination based on the facts in the record.
factually,we agree with crockett that the record shows that the trial judge had the telephone number for the defense counsel,the sheriff successfully contacted defense counsel by telephone for the previous jury notes,and defense counsel asserted that they remained available by telephone during the time period of the third question.crockett argues that this demonstrates there were means and opportunity to tell defense counsel about the third note however,they were not told.the illinois appellate court findings of fact did not contradict crockett version of the court never claimed that defense counsel were unavailable or had been told about the note.however,the court accepted the trial judge statement that an attempt to contact counsel was made because the trial judge directed the sheriff to call counsel,and crockett does not provide us with clear and convincing evidence that the judge did not give the sheriff this direction.see e.armed with that conclusion,the illinois appellate court then assessed whether the delay in responding to the jury was unreasonable.the affidavits of the jurors show that the trial judge received the note from the jury and did not respond for fifteen minutes to one hour.the illinois appellate court cited several cases in which a judge did not respond to a jury question people sims,d,holding that it was not reversible error to fail to answer the jury question where the trial judge was presiding over closing arguments in a case when the question was asked and the jury reached a result before the judge could confer with the parties people chandler,holding that it was not reversible error for a trial court to fail to answer a jury question for fifty minutes after which the jury returned a verdict people hall,holding that it was reversible error for a trial court to fail to answer a jury question on the burden of proof for two hours after which the jury returned a verdict.the court concluded that crockett did not construct a sufficient record to show the trial judge acted unreasonably.
crockett notes that to the extent the reasonableness inquiry was based upon a factual determination,the illinois appellate court did not make a finding that the trial court acted reasonably instead it refused to find that the trial court acted unreasonably.while this is true,it does not help crockett in satisfying his burden under aedpa.the illinois appellate court accepted the facts that crockett developed on appeal.its decision was not based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence rather,its decision was based upon the lack of evidence that would have been used as factors in determining whether reversible error was committed.crockett,at.although initially couched as a factual argument,crockett later claims that the reasonableness inquiry made by the illinois appellate court was a question of law,but
