background 
factual background 
the facts of the present case turn on the events of january,when adams was shot and killed during a altercation.dorchy,who owed adams in drug money,claimed that he shot adams in.but dorchy immediately fled to florida,and was not located until years after the killing.once apprehended,he was charged with murder,assault with the intent to murder,and being a felon in possession of a firearm.
although all parties agree that dorchy was directly involved in adams death,disagreement persists over the exact sequence of events.a number of individuals who witnessed various parts of the altercation testified at dorchy trial.melody hurst,adams cousin,related that she got into a van on january,with dorchy,ira oldham,and damien martin.martin was subsequently charged with and convicted of murder in connection with adams death.melody testified that,during the van ride,oldham was paged by adams,prompting dorchy to call adams back on his cellular phone.she stated that she overheard dorchy say,nigger,i kill you,and nigger,i ai got nothing,in a belligerent way.melody then said that dorchy asked martin to hand him the mag,and that in response martin handed him a semiautomatic gun.she concluded by saying that the van parked about two or three minutes away from adams house,and that dorchy and martin exited.
two other relatives of adams also testified at dorchy trial.one was stephanie hurst,who said that she walked by dorchy,adams,martin,ernest knox,and dion mccrary as they stood outside on the sidewalk when she went from her house to her house on january.she noted that the men were not arguing or fighting,but that adams had a serious look on his face.stephanie walked away and entered her house,but immediately went back outside when she heard gunshots.she stated that she then saw adams lying face down on the ground,his hands in his pockets.
the other relative was robin hurst,stephanie niece,who testified that she was inside stephanie house when she saw the same group of men standing outside.according to robin,no one seemed upset or angry.when she heard gunshots,she looked outside to see adams lying on the ground.
the jury also heard from lieutenant james thompson,the first officer on the scene.he testified that,on the night in question,he had been dispatched to an apartment complex where shots were reportedly fired.when he arrived,lieutenant thompson found adams body on the ground,his hands tucked into his coat pockets.he noted that adams had a semiautomatic pistol in his right waistband,and that scattered around were several shell casings and one spent bullet.lieutenant mike thomas,the forensics expert who examined the bullets and casings found at the site,testified that three of the cartridge cases were from a handgun.mark fischione,the county medical examiner who performed an autopsy on adams,opined that the first wound adams suffered came from the end of the muzzle being held up against the back region.
the primary controversy in this appeal surrounds the transcribed testimony of ernest knox,one of the five men who were standing outside when adams was killed.because knox could not be located at the time of dorchy trial,a court reporter instead read the transcribed testimony given by knox in the earlier trial of damien martin.knox had stated in his prior testimony that he was with adams and dion mccrary when dorchy and martin arrived.according to knox,dorchy and adams discussed a drug debt that dorchy owed,following which the group of men moved outside.the transcript of the direct examination then reads as follows

just kept talking.

okay.charles dorchy shot adams in the back of the head 
the only other unindicted eyewitness,mccrary,had earlier testified outside of the jury presence and had stated that,if called as a witness during dorchy trial,he would assert his fifth amendment right against.in response,the prosecution moved to have a tape containing the statement that mccrary had made to the police immediately after the shooting admitted into evidence.the state trial court agreed.mccrary statement to the police was then played to the jury.on the tape,mccrary said i think adams was talking to somebody and then dorchy came right in and shot him about three times.if i not mistaken he shot him three times in the head and i just seen adams just fall straight and then dorchy turned to me and shot at me.
the jury also heard from dorchy himself,who admitted that he owed adams in drug money and was therefore avoiding him.he further said that he had spoken to adams earlier on his cellular phone,and that adams had told him to b ring my mother fuckin money.according to dorchy,his life was in danger and he felt scared and threatened.he stated that,once the men were outside,they began conversing.dorchy testified that,after things got tense,knox pulled a gun.i thought he was going to shoot me.he then pulled his own gun out and immediately ducked and fired,thinking that adams would also turn around and shoot since he was going for something.throughout his testimony,dorchy repeated that he feared for his life,and that both knox and adams were acting in a threatening fashion toward him.
procedural background

dorchy subsequently appealed to the michigan court of appeals,which affirmed his conviction and sentence.people dorchy,wl,unpublished.his delayed application for leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court was denied.people dorchy.dorchy then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,asserting that his sixth amendment rights were violated when the testimony by knox and the statement by mccrary were admitted into evidence.the district court agreed,granting dorchy a conditional writ on may.dorchy jones,d.this timely appeal by the state followed.
