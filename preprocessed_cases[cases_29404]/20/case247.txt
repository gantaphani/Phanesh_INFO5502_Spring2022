the case at bar presents a question of first impression in this circuit regarding the circumstances under which a state prisoner may use rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure as a vehicle for resurrecting a previously dismissed habeas petition.there are three principal schools of thought on this controversial subject.some courts have held that rule b remains fully velivolant in the habeas context.others have held that the restrictions imposed on the filing of second or successive applications for habeas relief by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa of,stat,codified as amended in,make rule b unavailable to habeas petitioners.a third camp consists of courts that,with slight variations,advocate a course somewhere between these extremes.
we align ourselves with the third camp.aedpa restrictions on the filing of second or successive habeas petitions make it implausible to believe that congress wanted rule b to operate under full throttle in the habeas context.but even though state prisoners seeking habeas relief should not be able to use rule b as a means of avoiding aedpa carefully calibrated limitations on habeas petitions,we see no justification for throwing out the baby with the bath water.consequently,we hold that a rule b motion should be treated as a second or successive habeas petition if and only if the factual predicate set forth in support of the motion constitutes a direct challenge to the constitutionality of the underlying conviction.in other cases cases in which the factual predicate set forth in support of the motion attacks only the manner in which the earlier habeas judgment has been procured the motion may be adjudicated under the jurisprudence of rule b.
in this instance,the petitioner rule b motion is the functional equivalent of a new habeas petition.because that triggers the aedpa requirements for second or successive habeas petitions,we affirm the district court order of dismissal.
travel of the case 
since this appeal turns on a question of procedure,the travel of the case comprises the relevant background.
in november of,james rodwell stood trial in a massachusetts state court on a number of charges,including first degree murder,armed robbery,and unlawful carriage of a firearm.one of the key witnesses against him was a fellow inmate,david nagle,who testified that,while awaiting trial,the petitioner had admitted to the murder and furnished many details.the jury found the petitioner guilty.the court thereafter imposed a mandatory term of life imprisonment on the murder charge and lesser sentences on the other counts.
in,the petitioner filed an unsuccessful motion for a new trial.two years later,the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc affirmed both his conviction and the denial of his new trial motion.see commonwealth rodwell.the following year,the petitioner filed another unsuccessful motion for a new trial.this time,the sjc denied his application for further appellate review.
having exhausted his state remedies,the petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.he named,as the respondent,a state correctional official his petition alleged that nagle was,in effect,an undercover government agent while he and the petitioner were incarcerated together that nagle inquiries about the crime amounted to a state interrogation without his lawyer present that nagle testimony should have been excluded as procured in violation of the sixth amendment and that,therefore,his conviction could not pass constitutional muster.the district court denied the petition.rodwell fair,slip op,unpublished.we affirmed the denial,holding that the petitioner had not shown cause for failing to present evidence in support of his sixth amendment claim in the state court.rodwell fair,cir per curiam.
the petitioner was not deterred.following a lull,he filed three more motions for a new trial in the state courts.each of these was denied,and further appeals in the state system proved fruitless.
at that juncture,the petitioner again eyed a federal forum but an obstacle loomed.the aedpa had taken effect and,under its terms,state prisoners can not file second or successive federal habeas petitions as a matter of right.see b.rather,a state prisoner who desires to file a second or successive habeas petition must secure from the court of appeals.see id.b a.on october,the petitioner invoked this provision and requested permission to file a second habeas corpus petition.
a panel of this court carefully considered his application and concluded that the petitioner had failed to produce any new facts,sufficient to show his actual innocence clearly and convincingly,which could not have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence at or before the time when he filed his first federal habeas petition.rodwell pepe,slip op.at cir,unpublished.consequently,the panel refused the petitioner request to file a second federal habeas petition.id.under the aedpa,this decision was final and unappealable.see b e.
attempting to find a crack in the wall that congress had erected to guard against the profligate filing of successive applications for relief,the petitioner repaired to the district court.on july,he filed a motion to reopen his original federal habeas case.asserting that the prosecution had suppressed exculpatory evidence that shed doubt on nagle status and that it was not until well after his conviction,direct appeal and habeas denial that th is significant impeachment information was unearthed,he asked the district court to reverse its earlier denial of habeas relief.
the district court,rodwell pepe,d,reasonably construed the petitioner motion as one brought pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b a characterization that the petitioner enthusiastically embraced.turning to the question of whether a rule b motion seeking vacation of a judgment denying habeas relief should be treated as a second or successive habeas petition for aedpa purposes,the district court answered that question affirmatively.id.at.on that basis,the court ruled that it was without jurisdiction to hear the motion.id.at citing b.in a subsequent order,the court,recognizing that the pertinent authorities were in some disarray,granted a certificate of appealability coa,see c,thus allowing this appeal to proceed.
ii.analysis 
the coa poses a single question does a motion for relief presented pursuant to rule b constitute a second or subsequent petition under the aedpa despite its narrowness,this question has significant implications for habeas procedure and the courts of appeals that heretofore have grappled with it have reached divergent conclusions.
we begin by addressing the certified question.after answering it,we proceed to apply the answer to the case at bar.
determining the rule of law.
as said,the decisions elsewhere have yielded three lines of cases.we turn first to the polar extremes.
the second circuit has ruled categorically that a motion under rule b to vacate a judgment denying habeas is not a second or successive habeas petition and should therefore be treated as any other motion under rule b.rodriguez mitchell,cir.the court reasoned that a rule b motion does not seek the relief requested by a habeas petition,but,rather,seeks only to vacate the federal court judgment dismissing the habeas petition.id.that is merely a step along the way to habeas relief.id.at.consequently,affording rule b its customary scope does not offend the aedpa.id.
at the other end of the spectrum,several courts have concluded that a rule b motion in a habeas case must always be treated as a second or successive habeas petition under the aedpa.see,mobley head,cir lopez douglas,cir per curiam mcqueen scroggy,cir.the eleventh circuit is the leading proponent of this proposition.in that court view,according rule b its customary scope in habeas cases would allow prisoners to cloak collateral attacks in the raiment of motions for relief from judgment under rule b and thereby evade the limitations that congress so painstakingly crafted in the aedpa.see mobley,at felker turpin,cir per curiam.based on this rationale,t
