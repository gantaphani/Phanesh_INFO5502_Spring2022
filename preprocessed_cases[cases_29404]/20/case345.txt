background 
this appeal arises from the dismissal of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.in resolving the present appeal,however,we must begin with another,earlier conviction and prison term.in,petitioner was convicted of robbery in state court and sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of seven to fourteen years.he was released on parole in in,he was arrested again,this time for murder.in,petitioner pled guilty to two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.
the court imposed two terms of years to life for the two counts of murder,pursuant to new york state penal law.because of petitioner previous robbery conviction,the attempted murder counted as a second violent felony under new york law,and the court imposed a sentence of years under penal law.the trial court imposing sentence in directed that these three terms were to run concurrently.where,however,a sentence is imposed pursuant to on an individual who is subject to a prior undischarged prison term,that sentence must run consecutively to the previous term.penal law a.therefore,the new york state department of correctional services docs,in calculating the total period of incarceration,determined that the undischarged portion of the robbery prison term should be added to the sentence,minus the two years served by petitioner between his second arrest and second sentencing.
petitioner appealed his conviction to the appellate division,first department,which affirmed in october.the court of appeals denied leave to appeal on december.petitioner did not petition for certiorari to the supreme court,and the period in which he was entitled to do so expired on march.the following day,therefore,the statute of limitations for filing a habeas petition began to run.see u.d.
between march,and the filing in of his habeas petition petitioner filed a number of state motions.his first filing was a petition under new york civil practice law and rules article,claiming that docs determination that the and sentences ran consecutively was contrary to law he also later filed a motion to renew that petition.petitioner additionally filed a motion under new york criminal procedure law to vacate his conviction,and he filed two motions under to set aside his sentence.the first of the two motions also requested in the alternative that petitioner be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea and stand trial.
petitioner habeas corpus petition alleged that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel,and that the evidence supporting his conviction was tainted by various alleged violations of petitioner fourth and fifth amendment rights.the habeas petition did not mention the docs sentencing calculation that was the subject of the earlier article petition.
following the filing of the petition for habeas corpus,on april,the district court hellerstein,directed respondent to file an answer.on july,respondent filed a motion under.b to dismiss the petition as under d.petitioner,proceeding pro se,filed his opposition to the motion to dismiss on or about october.the district court granted the motion to dismiss the petition as on march,and denied a certificate of appealability 
petitioner timely filed a notice of appeal and motion for a certificate of appealability with this court a panel of this court granted that motion on october,limited to the issue of whether the limitations period of d had been tolled by petitioner filing of article petitions in new york state court.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the legal question on appeal is straightforward.under the anti terrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,petitioner was required here to file his petition for habeas corpus within one year of the expiration of the time for seeking direct review of the state court judgment at issue.see d a.as set out above,petitioner filed his habeas petition three years after that period ended in march.the limitations period,however,is tolled during the pendency of certain proceedings in state court.d.
of the five motions filed in state court by petitioner between and,respondent agrees that the motion and the two motions tolled the limitations period.petitioner contends that the article petition,and the motion to renew that petition,tolled the period as well.if petitioner is correct,then it is undisputed that his habeas petition would be timely filed.the district court,however,concluded that the article filings did not satisfy the requirements of d,and held that the habeas petition was therefore.
the facts material to this appeal are undisputed,and our review of whether the petition was filed outside the limitations period as a matter of law is de novo.saunders senkowski,cir per curiam.
we begin with the text of the statute.aedpa tolling provision states that the statute of limitations is tolled during the adjudication of a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment.d.the pertinent judgment in this case is petitioner conviction and sentence for double murder and attempted murder 
on its face,the article petition in this case was not made with respect to the pertinent judgment.indeed,petitioner did not challenge any aspect of his conviction or sentence.rather,he argued that docs,the new york agency charged with administering the prison system,wrongly determined that his unchallenged sentence should run consecutively,rather than concurrently,to a previous unchallenged sentence imposed pursuant to a separate conviction for robbery.
the article petition argued,in essence,that docs had erred in failing to conclude that notwithstanding penal law a,petitioner judgment required that his sentences for murder and attempted murder run concurrently with the undischarged portion of his sentence for robbery.thus,petitioner did not seek review or reconsideration of the pertinent judgment.he sought,instead,a recalculation of his prison term,supposedly in accordance with that judgment.
petitioner argues that the supreme court recent decision in wall kholi,suggests that his article petition was nevertheless made with respect to the pertinent judgment for tolling purposes.we disagree.properly read,wall in fact demonstrates that the article petition at issue here did not toll the aedpa limitations period.
in wall,a prisoner moved under rhode island law to have his sentence reduced,without challenging the legality of that sentence.id.at.the court held that such a motion tolled the limitations period.in wall,however,the pertinent judgment challenged in habeas proceedings was the respondent conviction and sentence for sexual assault his application for review sought a reduction in that same sentence.id 
the wall court treatment of review in d,moreover,makes clear that the article petition here did not satisfy the requirements for tolling.in the court words,to trigger the tolling provision,a collateral proceeding must involve a form of review.at.several federal circuit courts had concluded,prior to wall,t
