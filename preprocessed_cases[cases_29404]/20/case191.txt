in this opinion we address some issues new to this circuit about practice under the federal habeas corpus statute.joseph teti appeals from the denial of his federal petition for habeas corpus relief the primary question in this appeal is whether the federal district court erred in applying the presumption of correctness under e to the state appellate court findings of facts and in denying discovery and an evidentiary hearing.
substantively,teti argues that the state court erred in denying his claim that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of his sixth and fourteenth amendment rights because,inter alia,his original defense attorney bradford keene had an actual conflict of interest.
we affirm the denial of habeas corpus relief by the district court.
we describe the facts as they appear from the state court record.teti was convicted in massachusetts superior court in april on charges stemming from two cocaine trafficking incidents in.see.laws ch,b.as he had provided cocaine to an undercover agent,teti primary defense was entrapment.commonwealth teti.he testified that he was an addict and had been pressured by the agent to make the sale.id.
on the third day of teti trial the prosecutor raised an issue of possible conflict that defense attorney bradford keene had also represented a witness hostile to teti.id.at.teti originally hired attorney keene in may but replaced him with attorney john mcbride in january.id.at.after forwarding his file on teti to mcbride,keene was no longer involved in the case,although he never formally withdrew his appearance and he sat at the defense counsel table during teti trial.id.at.sometime around april,a year before teti trial,keene had represented a man named leo lobello in some limited matters.lobello,a convicted federal felon,was the informant who had introduced teti to the undercover agent who bought the cocaine from teti.id.at.keene insisted,however,that he did not know lobello was the informant in teti case until a week before teti trial.id.at.
mcbride,who did know as early as february that lobello was the informant,had called lobello as a hostile witness in the vain hopes that lobello would bolster the entrapment defense by demonstrating that teti was not predisposed to sell cocaine and by appearing himself to be the instigator of the drug transactions,as well as a reprobate and liar,testifying to curry favor with the federal authorities,id.at.
upon hearing the prosecutor concern about a potential conflict,the court immediately questioned both keene and mcbride.that questioning,which has been the only hearing on this issue,underlies the description of the facts by the massachusetts appeals court mac discussed below.initially,the state trial judge stated her impression that keene had a conflict of interest she required him to withdraw,but allowed the trial to continue.the jury convicted teti,and he was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment.
two and a half years later,teti moved for a new trial and,on denial of the new trial motion,moved for reconsideration.that motion was also denied.the same state judge who tried the case,in denying the motion for a new trial,concluded that contrary to her initial impression,there was no actual conflict of interest and no showing that any prejudice had resulted,even if there had been a conflict.because massachusetts law largely leaves the decision to grant an evidentiary hearing on a new trial motion to the sound discretion of the trial judge,and because teti had not presented any substantial question of fact warranting an evidentiary hearing,the state judge declined to grant one.see.c commonwealth stewart.
the mac in affirmed the conviction as well as the denial of teti motion for a new trial.the mac rejected teti claims that keene had an actual conflict of interest in violation of teti federal and state constitutional rights,teti,at that keene actions had caused teti any prejudice,making it irrelevant whether keene had a potential conflict of interest,id.at,and that teti had been denied his right to effective assistance of counsel under the federal and state constitutions for other reasons,id.at.
the mac made certain key findings of fact,which the federal habeas court later presumed were correct that,contrary to what the prosecutor had initially believed,keene had not represented lobello in seeking a rule b motion in federal court to reduce lobello federal sentence,id.at,that keene representation of lobello was fully in the past and was limited to a few,unanswered phone calls to a south carolina prison facility approximately one year before teti trial in an effort to have lobello transferred to another facility,and that keene had never spoken to or met lobello,id.at,that keene was not aware that lobello was the informant in teti case until one week before trial a point by which keene activities on lobello behalf had long since ended,id.at,that keene did not participate in the preparation of teti case and that his involvement with the trial was essentially nonexistent,id.at,and that mcbride learned of keene representation of lobello only on the third day of teti trial,id.at.based on these factual determinations,the mac concluded that teti failed to establish the existence of an actual conflict of interest.id.at.
the mac then considered whether apart from an actual conflict,teti counsel had a potential or,as state law phrases it,a tenuous conflict.it determined that,whether or not there had been a conflict,there was no prejudice in any event.id.at.as the mac sensibly reasoned,keene participation in the trial preparation and the trial itself was de minimis.further,any privileged information that keene did have would not have harmed teti,as i t would have been to the defendant benefit for mcbride to know more about lobello,a hostile witness.id.
teti had also presented to the mac a claim of ineffective assistance by mcbride,based on several alleged deficiencies.teti argued that mcbride was ineffective in failing to investigate keene potential conflicts and to tell teti about keene prior representation of lobello,but the mac held there was no ineffectiveness and no prejudice.id.at.the mac also noted that when the trial judge had questioned teti about keene alleged conflict,teti said he was quite satisfied with mcbride representation.id.the mac,accordingly,rejected teti assertion that had he been informed more fully of the conflict,he would have insisted on new counsel.id.
teti also argued that mcbride was ineffective for failing to move to sever the indictments against him for introducing evidence of additional,uncharged drug transactions and for promising in his opening statement but then not providing testimony about the effects of teti psychological and drug dependency problems on his state of mind.the mac concluded that none of these actions constituted ineffective assistance.see id.at.
the supreme judicial court denied further appellate review.commonwealth teti.
in february,teti filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal court under,raising the same arguments he had made to the mac.
in an able opinion,the district court denied teti requests for discovery and an evidentiary hearing and denied habeas relief.the court applied the statutory presumption of correctness to the state court factual determinations and viewed the claims actually ruled upon by the mac through the deferential lens of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat.see d,e.
the district court held that the state court there was neither an actual conflict nor any not an unreasonable application of federal law under aedpa.see d.under federal law,an ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires demonstrating a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland washington,d.if,however,a defendant can show that his attorney actively represented conflicting interests in breach of the attorney duty of loyalty,and if the defendant can show that this actual conflict of interest adversely affected the lawyer performance,then the stricter prejudice showing required by strickland does not apply.id.at.quoting cuyler sullivan,d internal quotation marks omitted see also allison ficco,cir.in mickens taylor,d,the supreme court emphasized that an actual conflict of interest does not result in an automatic reversal in almost all cases,some showing of an adverse effect is still required.id.at.lesser potential conflicts of interest can also be the basis of an ineffective assistance claim,but the more stringent prejudice prong of strickland then applies.
although the mac had relied on state law in concluding there was no actual conflict,the district court noted that state law is more favorable than federal law to the defendant on this issue because under state law,if there were an actual conflict of interest,that conflict would result in automatic reversal regardless of whether any prejudice could be shown.see commonwealth croken.for habeas purposes,where state law is explicitly more favorable to defendants than the federal standard,we will presume the federal law adjudication to be subsumed within the state law adjudication.mccambridge hall,cir see also commonwealth shraiar,noting that the state constitutional standard on this issue is more protective of defendant interests than the federal constitutional standard.
as for teti claim that mcbride shared keene conflict of interest,the district court determined that the mac had not adjudicated that claim on the merits,even though teti had presented it to the court it thus reviewed the claim de novo instead of applying d highly deferential standard.see dibenedetto hall,cir fortini murphy,cir.again utilizing the presumption that the state court factual findings were correct,the district court concluded that attorney mcbride had no conflict and that teti could not establish any prejudice that would have resulted even if a conflict had existed.finally,the court found no basis for habeas relief in the state court rejection of the remaining ineffective assistance claims.
the federal habeas court denied a later motion to amend or to alter its findings.it granted a certificate of appealability sua sponte regarding issues related to the effectiveness of teti counsel.
in addressing these issues,we recite only so much of the case and underlying facts as needed for analysis of the denial of federal habeas relief.
we review the district court legal conclusions de novo further,w hen the district court undertakes no independent factfinding in a habeas case,we are effectively in the same position as the district court the state court record,so we review the district court factual conclusions de novo as well.pike guarino,cir,cert.denied,d.
deference under d 
under aedpa,our review of state court legal and factual determinations is highly deferential.when a petitioner presses a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court,federal habeas courts must defer to the state court determination unless it 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
section d applies to teti claim that keene provided ineffective assistance of counsel due to an actual or potential conflict of interest because the mac adjudicated that claim on the merits.a matter is adjudicated on the merits if there is a decision finally resolving the parties claims,with res judicata effect,that is based on the substance of the claim advanced,rather than on a procedural,or other,ground.sellan kuhlman,cir.contrary to teti argument,d applies regardless of the procedures employed or the decision reached by the state court,as long as a substantive decision was reached the adequacy of the procedures and of the decision are addressed through the lens of d,not as a threshold matter.see,lambert blodgett,cir no procedural requisites before d applies wright sec y for dep t of,cir d applies equally to summary dispositions valdez cockrell,cir bell jarvis,cir en banc harris stovall,cir aycox lytle,cir.
since an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a mixed question of law and fact,strickland,at.scarpa dubois,cir,teti can not be granted relief unless the mac decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,terry williams taylor,d mixed questions are reviewed under d unreasonable application clause.a decision can still be reasonable even if the reviewing court thinks it is wrong unreasonable here means something more than incorrect or erroneous.terry williams,at.
based on the facts as described by the mac,it was not unreasonable for the mac to conclude that keene representation was not constitutionally deficient.even assuming that keene representation of lobello and teti overlapped for some period of time and even assuming that keene was actively engaged in teti trial,keene had stopped representing lobello a year before the trial and long before he knew that lobello was the informant in teti case.further,the mac found that keene representation of lobello was very limited and would not have related in any way to teti case.based on these facts,there were no competing loyalties and no possible detrimental effect on teti representation.to press this claim,then,teti must challenge the factfinding on which the mac conclusion rested.we turn to e.
our mode of analysis does not suggest,however,that habeas courts should always consider the reasonableness of the state court determination under d before considering the validity of the state court factfinding under e.to suggest a set order of analysis would unnecessarily constrain habeas courts.accord lambert blackwell,cir acknowledging that different circuits have suggested different orders of analysis and declining to adopt a rigid approach.others disagree.see hertz liebman,federal habeas corpus practice and procedure c ed concluding that courts should apply d reasonableness review before applying e.
deference under e 
under e,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.the petitioner bears the burden of overcoming that presumption by providing clear and convincing evidence.e.
the relationship between d and e,both of which apply to state court fact determinations,has caused some confusion.the supreme court has suggested that e applies to determinations of factual issues,rather than decisions,while d applies to the granting of habeas relief itself.cockrell,d.that is,under this approach,d reasonableness standard would apply to the final decision reached by the state court on a determinative factual question,while e presumption of correctness would apply to the individual factfindings,which might underlie the state court final decision or which might be determinative of new legal issues considered by the habeas court.see,blackwell,at section d reasonableness determination turns on a consideration of the totality of the evidence presented in the proceeding,while e contemplates a challenge to the state court individual factual determinations quoting d valdez,at coombs state of maine,cir suggesting but not explicating this distinction.
this question has not yet been definitively resolved,nor do we attempt our own resolution here since,the supreme court has not further clarified this issue.see rice collins,d.as the third circuit noted in blackwell,d espite the supreme court pronouncements in and wiggins smith,d,a comprehensive interpretation of aedpa factual review scheme has yet to emerge from the federal courts.specifically,the relationship between the standards enunciated in d and e remains unclear.at see also blodgett,at fallon et,hart wechsler the federal courts and the federal system ed charles wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice and procedure jurisdiction ed.
for now we follow the supreme court lead in and apply e to the mac individual factfindings.the decision to do so is not determinative,however,for not only do both provisions express the same fundamental principle of deference to state court findings,blackwell,at,but were we to apply d,we would also find the mac factual conclusions to be not unreasonable in light of the record before it.
presumption of correctness under e 
the presumption of correctness is equally applicable when a state appellate court,as opposed to a state trial court,makes the finding of fact.norton spencer,cir quoting sumner mata,d internal quotation marks omitted.contrary to teti arguments,it is for the habeas petitioner to provide the clear and convincing evidence that can overcome that presumption of correctness.
there is some disagreement about whether the presumption of correctness always applies or if there are instead certain procedural prerequisites.see,mayes gibson,cir if there was no full,fair,and adequate hearing in the state court,the presumption of correctness does not apply taylor maddox,cir if a state court makes evidentiary findings without holding a hearing and giving petitioner an opportunity to present evidence,such findings clearly result in an unreasonable determination of the facts under d.hertz liebman c d reasonableness standard applies to both the process and the substance of state court factfindings.
while the policy arguments underlying these conclusions are reasonable,we must look first to the language of the statute.when congress revised under aedpa,it removed language that had limited the presumption to determinations made after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue,as well as the statute list of procedural defects that previously deprived state court factfinding of the presumption.as professors fallon,meltzer,and shapiro have noted,these changes suggest that the presumption of correctness now applies across the board.fallon et at see also valdez,at mendiola schomig,cir wright et noting change of statutory language,raising concerns,and predicting that courts might read some of the procedural requirements back into the statute.
the third circuit has taken the position that the extent to which a state court provides a full and fair hearing is no longer a threshold requirement before deference applies but it might be a consideration while applying deference under d and e.blackwell,at.we agree with this approach.while it might seem questionable to presume the correctness of material facts not derived from a full and fair hearing in state court,the veracity of those facts can be tested through an evidentiary hearing before the district court where appropriate.valdez,at,evidentiary hearing can aid in federal court assessment of reasonableness under d when state did not hold a full and fair hearing.
teti does not attempt to argue that he has clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption here.instead he tries to refute the mac factual determinations by employing the same documents already considered by the state courts.that approach fails.describing how different parties stated different versions of events does not constitute the needed showing of clear and convincing evidence rather,the state trial judge implicit credibility determinations,adopted by the mac,are exactly the type of factual determinations to which we defer,at least short of any indication of serious error.rice,at.reasonable minds reviewing the record might disagree about the prosecutor credibility,but on habeas review that does not suffice to supersede the trial court credibility determination.
teti also argues that the trial judge conclusion that there was no relevant conflict of interest contradicts her statements.that argument does not work either.first,the judge statements were not final determinations and thus not inconsistent with her later ruling.teti,at that the judge,on first impression,believed there was a conflict did not prevent her from considering the issue further,and then specifically finding,in a reasoned and reflective memorandum,that there was,in fact,no conflict.second,such a determination by the state trial judge would be a and thus not relevant to the e inquiry.
because the presumption of correctness applies to all the state court factfindings,and because teti does not point us to any clear and convincing evidence that refutes those factfindings,we turn next to whether he should have been allowed discovery or an evidentiary hearing.
discovery under rule 
habeas corpus proceedings under are civil in nature,but they are governed by a discrete set of procedural rules.mayle felix,d.thus unlike in normal civil cases,there is no entitlement to discovery in habeas proceedings the availability of discovery is instead circumscribed by rule of the rules governing cases.bracy gramley,d bader warden,cir.under rule,the federal habeas judge has discretion to grant discovery for good cause.rule a.the party requesting discovery must not only provide reasons for the discovery,but also must specify any proposed interrogatories and requests for admission and any requested documents.rule b.we review the district court denial of discovery for abuse of discretion.see bader,at.
teti did not comply with the specific requirements of rule b his request for discovery is generalized and does not indicate exactly what information he seeks to obtain.a habeas proceeding is not a fishing expedition,stanford parker,cir rich calderon,cir.
in addition,as the district court noted,teti did not meet the rule requirement of good cause.the supreme court has defined good cause in this context as specific allegations that give a court reason to believe that the petitioner may,if the facts are fully developed,be able to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief.bracy,at.quoting harris nelson,d internal quotation marks omitted.the district court carefully reviewed the documents submitted to it and concluded they did not suggest that discovery would help establish any claim for relief.the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying discovery.
evidentiary hearings 
we also review the decision whether to grant an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion.pike,at see also schriro landrigan,d.
before aedpa,law governed the decision whether to grant an evidentiary hearing.under townsend sain,d,district courts generally had discretion to grant such hearings when they deemed it appropriate.id.at.in every case the district judge has the power,constrained only by his sound discretion,to receive evidence bearing upon the applicant constitutional claim.in some situations,an evidentiary hearing before the district court was mandatory where the facts are in dispute,the federal court in habeas corpus must hold an evidentiary hearing if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in state court,either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding.id.at.townsend specified six situations which would necessitate a hearing under this standard,including a category for any reason the petitioner might not have received a full and fair hearing on the issue before a state court.id.at.
but townsend was significantly qualified by later case law and congressional action,leaving the circuit courts in some uncertainty about when new federal factfinding for state prisoners is appropriate bader,at.there is debate over whether evidentiary hearings are still mandatory in some circumstances,or whether they are simply within the district court judge discretion when not prohibited.some courts have concluded that keeney,d,and aedpa only modified townsend six categories of mandatory hearings,leaving the rest of townsend intact,conaway polk,cir insyxiengmay morgan,cir smith bowersox,cir matheney anderson,cir miller champion,cir.and some commentators agree.see hertz liebman b even after aedpa townsend standards continue to govern all situations save those in which the petitioner procedural default accounts for the state courts failure to develop the material facts.lafave et,criminal procedure c ed.indeed,the advisory committee notes for rule of the rules governing cases,regarding evidentiary hearings,suggest that townsend still applies except to the extent it is specifically superceded by e.the third circuit,on the other hand,has read aedpa as rendering all evidentiary hearings purely discretionary,campbell vaughn,cir aedpa,unlike townsend and kee
