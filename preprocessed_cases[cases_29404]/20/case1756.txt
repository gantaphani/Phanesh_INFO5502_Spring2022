pursuant to,petitioner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing arguments to the jury and that his counsel performance was constitutionally ineffective because he failed to object during the prosecutor closing argument.finding merit to the prosecutorial misconduct claim,the district court granted the writ on the condition that the state of ohio petitioner within ninety days.respondent timely filed a notice of appeal and filed a motion for a stay of the judgment pending appeal,which the district court granted.petitioner has appealed the stay and the district court decision to deny him release pending the outcome of this appeal.for the reasons that follow,we will reverse the district court judgment conditionally issuing the writ.accordingly,we have no occasion to consider petitioner.
factual and procedural background 
on direct appeal the ohio court of appeals provided the following factual background regarding the indictment and trial of petitioner james hinkle 
on april,the perry county grand jury indicted appellant,james hinkle,on three counts of rape in violation of a b.said charges arose from allegations that appellant had sexual intercourse with his niece,amanda patterson.amanda had become pregnant and had named appellant as the father.amanda received an abortion and the fetal tissue was preserved for analysis.
a jury trial commenced on april.appellee,the state of ohio,presented the testimony of various individuals including amanda doctors,hall canter,and mervyn samuel,two molecular biologists from cellmark diagnostics,robin cotton,and paula yates,and amanda herself.appellant presented the testimony of his father and himself.the jury found appellant guilty as to one count of rape but hung as to the other two counts.
on may,the trial court sentenced appellant to an indeterminate term of ten to years.
state hinkle,no,at ohio,unpublished.at trial cotton testified,based on a comparison of dna samples from the aborted child and hinkle,that she was satisfied to a reasonable scientific certainty that hinkle had fathered amanda patterson child.the record also reflects that the jury returned a guilty verdict against hinkle on the one count in support of which the prosecution had introduced the dna evidence.
closing arguments 
petitioner claim of prosecutorial misconduct arises from statements concerning the accuracy and reliability of dna evidence made by the prosecutor during rebuttal.defense counsel began his closing argument with an attack on the dna evidence introduced by the state.he charged that the science,then still in its infancy,amounted to little more than guesswork based upon arbitrary rules and an unscientific methodology that precluded an accurate determination of whether hinkle fathered patterson child 
in rebuttal,the prosecutor responded to defense counsel attack on the accuracy and reliability of dna evidence by assuring the jury that ohio courts have accepted the scientific validity of dna testing and that the trial judge would not have admitted the evidence without such a foundation.specifically,he gave the following rebuttal to defense counsel argument about the reliability and accuracy of dna evidence 
collins spent a great deal of time attacking the scientific reliability or accuracy of dna testing and,as he said,in recent years it has reached a state of general acceptance,not only in this state,but in the united states as a whole.and i am sure collins did intend to do so,but by attacking it and its reliability,he may have even impinged upon the integrity of this court,because of the things that judge lewis does as a judge,as does any other court in this state or any other state,is make certain,absolutely certain,that juries can not ever hear opinions expressed by experts unless the basis for those opinions has,in fact,been firmly established as scientifically reliable and accurate.
dna testing has been scientifically established as accurate and reliable in the courts of ohio for some years,and i think you can have faith in this court,that you would not have been permitted to hear any of that evidence unless that was the case.
i think you are all familiar,for instance,with the use of polygraphs or lie detector tests,but would be surprised if any of you knew that,in fact,polygraphs are not admissible in ohio because their reliability has never been scientifically established to the satisfaction of the courts.and yet,i think the public at large thinks those are commonplace but the reverse is true.
you have to first establish a history of scientific reliability and accuracy before you can ever use those things in court.and collins full well knows that that the case,and he knows that there is an established history of scientific reliability and accuracy of dna.
defense counsel did not object to these remarks.the trial court instructed the jurors that the attorneys closing arguments were not evidence that they could consider in their deliberations.
petitioner direct appeal 
on direct appeal to the ohio court of appeals,petitioner raised two assignments of error.first,he maintained that various actions of the prosecutor,including the rebuttal argument regarding the reliability of dna testing,constituted misconduct that denied him a fair trial.second,hinkle argued that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor remarks during rebuttal 
addressing the prosecutorial misconduct claim first,the appellate court held that it could review only for plain error under ohio law because defense counsel had failed to lodge a contemporaneous objection to the prosecutor argument in rebuttal.under the plain error standard,the ohio court of appeals analyzed each of hinkle claims of misconduct and concluded that,even where the prosecutor comments constituted error,that error did not rise to the level of undue prejudice or meet the exacting standard necessary to excuse the failure of hinkle counsel to object to the prosecutor rebuttal argument.therefore,the ohio court of appeals overruled this assignment of error.
with respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the ohio court of appeals reviewed under the standard announced in state bradley,ohio,the ohio analog to strickland washington,d.having found no prejudice to hinkle from the prosecutor statements,the court then applied the standard and rejected petitioner ineffective assistance of counsel claim,insofar as it related to the failure to object to the prosecutor closing argument,since he could not show prejudice 
when the ohio court of appeals denied petitioner motion for reconsideration,hinkle petitioned the ohio supreme court for review.in a brief order dated january,the ohio supreme court denied leave to appeal and dismisse d the appeal as not involving any substantial constitutional question.
c.the district court judgment 
pursuant to,petitioner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus on january.hinkle based his petition on the prosecutor misconduct in closing arguments and ineffective assistance of counsel due to the failure to object to the prosecutor statements in rebuttal.considering the claim of prosecutorial misconduct first,the district court agreed that the prosecutor remarks concerning the reliability and accuracy of dna testing were inappropriate.viewing the dna evidence against hinkle as critical in the trial in state court,the district court held that the prosecutor rebuttal argument prejudiced hinkle and conditionally issued the writ.accordingly,the court declined to address the remainder of petitioner claims.
ii.prosecutorial misconduct 
we have held that ohio contemporaneous objection rule constitutes an adequate and independent state ground that bars federal habeas review absent a showing of cause and prejudice.see,scott mitchell,cir citing engle isaac,d.moreover,we view a state appellate court review for plain error as the enforcement of a procedural default.see,seymour walker,cir controlling precedent in our circuit indicates that plain error review does not constitute a waiver of state procedural default rules.citing paprocki fol
