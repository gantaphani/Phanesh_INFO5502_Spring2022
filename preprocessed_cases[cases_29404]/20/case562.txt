background 
on march,new york city undercover police officer the officer participated in a buy and bust operation in an area designated by the police for the investigation of the sale of drugs.at about on that date,the officer saw brown standing beneath an awning in the vicinity of sutphin boulevard and archer avenue in the borough of queens,city of new york.the officer approached brown and asked him for four nicks of crack,slang for twenty dollars worth of.in response,brown led the officer to a nearby bar located at sutphin boulevard.once inside the bar,brown introduced the officer to shirelle evans and instructed her to give the officer four nicks.evans gave the officer four plastic vials that contained,and he gave her twenty dollars in prerecorded money.the officer then left the bar,and immediately radioed the details of the sale,including descriptions of brown and evans and their location,to his team.after receiving the call,the team entered the bar and arrested brown and evans.the officer drove past the scene shortly after the arrest and recognized brown and evans as the people who had sold him the four vials of.
following an indictment by a queens county grand jury,brown was charged with one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and one count of criminal sale of a controlled substance on or near school grounds.penal law.a jury trial was held in the new york state supreme court,queens county.on the first day of trial,the people moved to close the courtroom to the public during the upcoming testimony of the officer.in response to the people motion,the court held a closed hearing pursuant to people hinton.the hinton hearing consisted solely of the testimony of the officer.
on direct examination at the hearing,the officer testified that he had been a member of the new york city police department for seven and years,serving as an undercover detective for the last three and years.as an undercover detective,the officer was assigned to purchase narcotics.the officer testimony revealed that he was currently working undercover in queens,new york,in the areas of sutphin boulevard and archer avenue,street and south road,jamaica avenue and sutphin boulevard,and jamaica avenue and hillside avenue.the officer also testified that he had worked undercover in the area of sutphin boulevard and archer avenue,an area one block from the courthouse,the day before brown trial began,and expected to work undercover in that area the very next day.the officer also explained that he had about five open cases in the new york supreme court,about five cases pending in the grand jury,and a number of unapprehended subjects.
testifying with regard to the dangerous nature of undercover work,the officer explained that during previous undercover operations he had been shot at and had bottles thrown at him.the officer testified that he had taken certain precautions to conceal his identity the day of the hearing,such as wearing a different type of clothing and entering the courthouse through a nonpublic doorway.the officer then explained that he feared testifying in open court because m y safety will be blown.my cover will be blown.my safety will be shot basically.on the officer revealed that in the last seven months he had dual status,meaning that he was employed as both an arresting investigator and as an undercover officer.when asked to explain his dual status,the officer stated i have been an investigator for the last seven months.i have dual status which means in certain areas i make buys and in certain areas i make apprehensions.
following the officer hearing testimony,the court granted the people motion for a limited closure of the courtroom,over brown objection 
after hearing the testimony of the officer,this court will grant the people application to close the courtroom during his testimony.we think that his safety that has shown sic that this is the area that he works in.although he has made any buys at this address,sutphin boulevard,since that time,he is working in that neighborhood.
he says that he expects to return to sutphin boulevard and archer a venue which is the next block tomorrow,that he has five pending open cases,and five in the grand jury,and this is the locale that he is operating in,the sutphin boulevard,jamaica avenue,archer avenue area,so that the safety of this officer,and his identification will not be,to use his words,blown,we will close the courtroom during testimony.
at trial,the prosecution witnesses consisted of the officer,the arresting officer,and the chemist who analyzed the drugs sold by brown to the officer.brown did not offer any witnesses of his own.the jury convicted brown on both counts,and,on january,he was sentenced in the supreme court as a predicate felon to a prison term of nine to eighteen years.
on december,brown filed an appeal with the new york state appellate division of the supreme court,second department.in his appeal brown argued that i the court should have instructed the jury on an agency defense,ii the court erred in closing the courtroom during the testimony of the officer,iii the prosecution engaged in discrimination during jury selection,and iv his guilt was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.on september,a panel unanimously affirmed brown conviction in a short published opinion that concentrated on brown argument that his guilt was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.see people brown,dep t brown i.as to his other claims,the appellate division stated that brown remaining contentions are without merit.id.by letter dated october,brown sought review by the new york court of appeals on all of the issues advanced before the appellate division.on november,the new york court of appeals denied brown motion for leave to appeal.people brown.
in december,brown filed a pro se application for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york brown petition included claims that were raised on his appeal to the appellate division,including the sixth amendment claim,and also a new claim of excessive punishment.in an unpublished memorandum and order dated july,the district court denied the petition.however,upon finding that brown had made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right with his claim of improper trial closure,the district court granted brown a certificate of appealability on the sole issue of whether the courtroom closure violated brown sixth amendment right to a public trial.in granting the certificate,the district court noted that the questions presented in brown closure argument are deserving of further proceedings because the second circuit has recently granted en banc review on this very issue for the second time in three years.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision to grant or deny a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.clark stinson,cir.prior to the passage of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat,state court factual findings after a hearing on the merits were presumed correct in federal habeas corpus proceedings with certain exceptions,such as the failure of the procedure to afford a full and fair hearing.d.however,federal courts were not required to defer to state court determinations of law and of mixed questions of law and fact.thompson keohane,d.when presented with these types of questions,federal courts were empowered to conduct an independent review of the record.id.at.the aedpa required a new,more deferential standard it placed a new restriction on the power of federal courts to grant writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners.williams taylor,d.
under the aedpa,a writ of habeas corpus may not issue with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d in addition,the aedpa instructs that state court findings of fact shall be presumed correct,rebuttable only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence.id.e.if a state court has failed to adjudicate a claim on the merits,does not apply,and we apply the standard of review,reviewing both questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact de novo.washington schriver,cir.
accordingly,in order to determine which level of deference to apply,we must decide whether brown sixth amendment claim was adjudicated on the merits.a state court adjudicates a petitioner federal constitutional claims on the merits whenever it disposes of the claim on the merits,and reduces its disposition to judgment.sellan kuhlman,cir.in analyzing this test,we consider what the state courts have done in similar cases whether the history of the case suggests that the state court was aware of any ground for not adjudicating the case on the merits and whether the state court opinion suggests reliance upon procedural grounds rather than a determination on the merits.id.at quoting mercadel cain,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in applying these three considerations,we have given a broad reading to state court dispositions,explaining that a state court need only dispose of the petitioner federal claim on substantive grounds,and reduce that disposition to judgment.no further articulation of its rationale or elucidation of its reasoning process is required.aparicio artuz,cir citing sellan,at.
we have held that the state court need not mention the argument raised or cite relevant case law in order for its ruling to constitute an adjudication on the merits.id.at sellan,at explaining that n othing in the phrase adjudicated on the merits requires the state court to have explained its reasoning process.here,the appellate division only discussed brown sufficiency of the evidence argument.see brown i,at.the court dismissed brown other arguments,including his sixth amendment claim,by stating d efendant remaining contentions are without merit.id.because there is no basis either in the history of the case or the opinion of the appellate division for believing that brown sixth amendment claim was denied on procedural or any other nonsubstantive grounds,we find that his claim was adjudicat ed on the merits by the state court,and therefore review his sixth amendment claim under the more deferential standard set forth in.see sellan,at.
ii.the right to a public trial 
the right to a public trial stems from a belief that a trial witnessed by members of the community improves the quality of witness testimony and boosts community trust in the administration of justice.brown kuhlmann,cir.the right to a public trial exists not only for the accused,as articulated in the sixth amendment but also for the press and public as a first amendment right.see richmond newspapers commonwealth of virginia,d.this right is of such importance that any error affecting it is deemed structural,making the denial of the right one of the limited class of cases where reversal is automatic.johnson united states,d.however,the entitlement to a public trial is not absolute t he right to an open trial may give way in certain cases to other rights or interests,such as the defendant right to a fair trial or the government interest in inhibiting disclosure of sensitive information.waller georgia,d.the supreme court has instructed that the instances where courtroom closure will be warranted are rare,cautioning that the balance of interests must be struck with special care.id.
waller dealt with the constitutional implications of a state trial court decision to close the courtroom for the entirety of a suppression hearing.the supreme court there set forth a test for evaluating the constitutionality of courtroom closures during criminal proceedings,requiring that 
the party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced,the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest,the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding,and the court must make findings adequate to support the closure.
id.at.applying this test to the facts in waller,the court held the closure unconstitutional.id.
since the court decision in waller,we have on numerous occasions applied its test.in the context of buy and bust cases,we have interpreted waller to impose specific requirements on trial courts in order to justify courtroom closures during the testimony of undercover police officers.for example,we have held that the trial court must require persuasive evidence of serious risk to an important interest in ordering any closure,ayala speckard,cir en banc ayala,and that the more extensive the closure requested,the greater the gravity of the required interest and the likelihood of risk to that interest,id.we have also recognized a special concern for assuring the attendance of family members of the accused.vidal williams,cir holding that a trial court is not permitted to deny a defendant family access to his trial simply because the family lives in the same borough in which the undercover officer seeking closure works.
our interpretation and application of the waller test in buy and bust cases have not been an altogether consistent endeavor.for example,we first held that a trial court was required to consider alternatives to closure sua sponte under the third prong of waller,see ayala speckard,cir,adhered to on rehearing,cir per curiam,and at least two other panels of our court followed that holding,see pearson james,cir okonkwo lacy,cir.in an en banc rehearing of ayala,pearson,and okonkwo,we reversed our previous holdings,concluding that waller does not require a trial court to consider further alternatives sua sponte once the trial judge has determined that limited closure as an alternative to complete closure is justified.ayala,at we also convened an en banc rehearing to determine the degree of particularity with which an undercover officer must testify in order to satisfy the first waller prong.brown andrews,cir per curiam en banc.before reaching a conclusion in that case,however,the rehearing was dissolved and our previous opinion vacated,leaving that question unsettled.id.
thus,as the district court noted,we have recently convened two en banc rehearings in an effort to further clarify what is constitutionally required under waller in regard to courtroom closure during the testimony of an undercover officer.however,with the passage of the aedpa we are now constrained to apply waller under a more deferential standard,which only permits a writ of habeas corpus to issue if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.accordingly,our review of courtroom closures by state courts for undercover officer testimony is now significantly restricted by virtue of the new,more deferential standard.
iii.courtroom closure in this case 
under the aedpa,we must first determine whether the principle of fe
