in this death penalty case from ohio tried in the state criminal court in cleveland,the primary issue is whether counsel for the defendant provided an adequate defense under the sixth amendment as incorporated in the due process clause.fred jurek was counsel for the defendant,hamblin,the petitioner in this habeas corpus case.jurek had no experience trying capital cases,and he was later disbarred from the practice of law in ohio.after the defendant was found guilty of murder by a jury at the guilt phase of the case,jurek did not prepare for the penalty phase of the bifurcated trial.he did not try to find out any family history or any facts concerning defendant psychological background and mental illness,nor did counsel seek any advice or expert consultation for the penalty phase of the case.despite a large body of mitigating evidence,counsel did nothing to discover what was available or introduce it in evidence.we will first set out the standards governing the assistance of defense counsel in capital cases at the sentencing phase of the case and then apply those standards to the facts of this case 
ineffective assistance of counsel in capital cases has been a persistent problem in the united states.see james liebman,the overproduction of death,colum.it was only years ago in the notorious but seminal scottsboro boys case,powell alabama,that the supreme court finally decided that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment requires the appointment of competent counsel capable of the giving of effective aid in the preparation and trial because a defendant facing capital punishment requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceeding against him.at.
not until years later in strickland washington,d,did the court begin to define specifically what the effective assistance of counsel means.there the court said that counsel in such cases must act with reasonableness under prevailing professional norms as guided by american bar association standards and the like.this standard includes counsel duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.but the court went on to say that under this standard judicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential,and that the defendant must overcome a strong presumption that counsel action is reasonable because any detailed guidelines would encourage the proliferation of ineffectiveness challenges.
in the most recent case on ineffective assistance,wiggins smith,d,decided june,the court held by a vote that counsel investigation and presentation fell short of the standards for capital defense work articulated by the american bar association standards to which we have long referred as guides to determining what is reasonable.at.at.in its discussion of the aba guidelines for counsel in capital cases,the court held that the guidelines set the applicable standards of performance for counsel 
i nvestigations into mitigating evidence should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor.aba guidelines for the appointment and performance of counsel in death penalty cases c,despite these norms,however,counsel abandoned their investigation of petitioner background after having acquired only rudimentary knowledge of his history from a narrow set of sources.
id.at emphasis in original.the court then also adopted aba guideline,which it described as stating 
that among the topics counsel should consider presenting are medical history,educational history,employment and training history,family and social history,prior adult and juvenile correctional experience,and religious and cultural influences.
id.emphasis in original.thus,the wiggins case now stands for the proposition that the aba standards for counsel in death penalty cases provide the guiding rules and standards to be used in defining the prevailing professional norms in ineffective assistance cases.this principle adds clarity,detail and content to the more generalized and indefinite language of strickland quoted above.
prior to the wiggins case,our court in a series of cases had dealt with the failure of counsel to investigate fully and present mitigating evidence at the penalty phase of the case.our analysis of counsel obligations matches the standards of the guidelines quoted by the supreme court in wiggins.in glenn tate,cir,judge nelson for himself and judge guy judge siler dissenting set aside the death verdict on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase.the court held that counsel must perform a full and complete investigation of mitigating evidence including the defendant history,background and organic brain damage.at.the court also held that this investigation should be conducted before the guilt phase of the case.it said that the time consuming task of assembling mitigating witnesses should not wait until after the jury verdict id.quoting blanco singletary,cir.the court faulted the lawyers because they made no systematic effort to acquaint themselves with their client social history for example,they never spoke to any of his numerous brothers and sisters,and never examined school records or medical records or records of mental health counseling.id.at.in a similar case,austin bell,cir,judge suhrheinrich,for a panel including judges martin and merritt,relied on judge nelson opinion in glenn tate to explain that prevailing standards require a full and complete investigation of mitigating evidence.then in coleman mitchell,cir,judge clay for himself and judge cole judge batchelder dissenting,reviewed the holdings of glenn and austin and reached a similar conclusion.like the supreme court in wiggins,judge clay explicitly relied on the aba guidelines.
the guidelines adopted as prevailing norms in wiggins reinforce and support our court previous rulings in glenn,austin and coleman applying similar norms to cases tried in the.although the instant case was tried before the aba edition of the standards was published,the standards merely represent a codification of longstanding,principles of representation understood by diligent,competent counsel in death penalty cases.the aba standards are not aspirational in the sense that they represent norms newly discovered after strickland.they are the same type of longstanding norms referred to in strickland in as prevailing professional norms as guided by american bar association standards and the like.we see no reason to apply to counsel performance here standards different from those adopted by the supreme court in wiggins and consistently followed by our court in the past.the court in wiggins clearly holds at at.at,that it is not making new law on the ineffective assistance of counsel either in wiggins or in the earlier case on which it relied for its standards,williams taylor,d.
new aba guidelines adopted in simply explain in greater detail than the guidelines the obligations of counsel to investigate mitigating evidence.the aba guidelines do not depart in principle or concept from strickland,wiggins or our court previous cases concerning counsel obligation to investigate mitigation circumstances 
in sum,we recognize that we must measure counsel performance in this case against the prevailing standards at the time of hamblin trial.we cite the and aba guidelines simply because they are the clearest exposition of counsel duties at the penalty phase of a capital case,duties that were recognized by this court as applicable to the trial of the defendant in glenn tate,cir.since that trial took place even before the trial in the present case,the same standards regarding counsel duty to investigate mitigating evidence,as articulated in the aba guidelines,are relevant here.
this case begins in in cleveland,ohio,when metropolitan park ranger john english was investigating alleged homosexual activity in a local park.he was shot in the leg by an unknown assailant.his injuries were not life threatening.just prior to the shooting,ranger english and other witnesses observed petitioner david hamblin sitting in his car at the park.twenty minutes after the shooting,lillian merrick was found unconscious in her car in the parking lot of a store near the park,suffering from a blow to the head inflicted by a blunt object.she also sustained a wound to her hand,described as a defensive wound.she had been robbed of her purse and groceries.she died three days later from her injuries without regaining consciousness.investigation clearly established that defendant hamblin wounded the park ranger and killed lillian merrick.
a jury in the common pleas court of cuyahoga county convicted hamblin of aggravated murder,aggravated robbery,attempted murder and having a weapon under disability and sentenced him to death.the conviction was affirmed by the cuyahoga county court of appeals and the ohio supreme court.state hamblin,wl ohio app,aff,ohio,cert.denied,d.
hamblin filed a petition pursuant to in november after exhausting his state proceedings.state hamblin,wl ohio app,dismissed,appeal not allowed,ohio,may.hamblin filed his petition for habeas review prior to the enactment of the and effective death penalty act,which permits reviewing federal courts greater latitude in examining the proceedings than is permissible under cases.see williams taylor,d applying the stricter aedpa standard to petitions filed after april,lindh murphy,d.
the district court denied hamblin request for a writ of habeas corpus,for an evidentiary hearing and for discovery.on the basis of the papers before the court,it held that counsel was not ineffective and labeled the lack of investigation as strategic,finding that counsel relied on the now defunct residual doubt theory during the penalty phase.the residual doubt theory seeks to convince the jury to impose a less severe sentence by reinforcing any lingering doubt the jury may have about the guilt of the defendant.residual doubt was rejected by the ohio supreme court as a mitigation strategy after hamblin trial.state mcguire,ohio.mcguire held that because the jury must find guilt at the culpability phase beyond a reasonable doubt,a residual doubt theory makes no sense.if the jury has residual doubt,it must not convict.therefore,residual doubt can no longer be used as a mitigating factor in ohio at sentencing.
the record reveals that defense counsel representation of hamblin at the penalty stage of the case fell far short of prevailing standards of effective assistance of counsel as outlined in wiggins,our previous cases and the and aba guidelines.
the cuyahoga county court of common pleas appointed fred jurek and arthur lambros to serve as hamblin attorneys.neither lawyer had previously tried a capital case.jurek admitted in his affidavit that he did essentially nothing by way of preparation for the penalty phase of this trial.aff.of fred jurek,at,state hamblin,ex.to state petition ohio app.july.jurek stated in his affidavit that he did not treat hamblin case any differently than other criminal cases he had handled and he was unaware of the special preparation that was needed for the penalty phase.id.at.he stated he did not prepare for the penalty phase until after the guilty verdict was a period of only six days from wednesday,april,until tuesday,april to prepare for the penalty phase.id.jurek affidavit states that he did not seek any advice or expert consultation for the penalty phase.counsel explanation for doing nothing in preparation for the sentencing phase was his belief that the case would plead out and not go to trial.id.at.he acknowledged a lack of strategy.he stated that he did not present the jury with any mitigating evidence,therefore the closing statement consisted of a plea for mercy.id.at.
if counsel had investigated his case,he would have found a large body of mitigating evidence.the evidence of hamblin unstable and deprived childhood presented at the proceedings is extensive.hamblin grew up in extreme poverty and neglect,surrounded by family violence and instability,had a poor education and likely suffers from mental disability or disorder.he grew up in appalachian kentucky where his father had a still.his father was very violent and beat hamblin mother and hamblin regularly.hamblin father was arrested on several occasions for public intoxication,manufacture of moonshine and child neglect.hamblin mother abandoned her children on several occasions,leaving them to fend for themselves,and at times resorted to prostitution.hamblin tried to provide for himself and a younger sister by stealing and he first stole food as a very young child.he was never educated.he did not attend elementary school with regularity and did not receive any education past the seventh grade.he started getting in trouble with the law as a teenager,resulting in a criminal record as a juvenile.he first left home at and left permanently at.
hamblin first showed signs of mental disorder when he was a resulting from his poor family situation and possibly from a severe blow to the head at about age,inflicted by his father with a dog chain,and from a severe infection his mother suffered while pregnant with him,the result of a stabbing inflicted on her by hamblin father.aff.of james eisenberg,state hamblin,ex.e to state petition ohio app.while an earlier mental evaluation did not show signs of organic deficiency,such as retardation,further testing since hamblin has been in prison shows psychological problems,but whether their origin is psychological,organic or both is not known.
jurek did not obtain any family or social history nor did he contact any of hamblin family members except rhonda lezark,the mother of hamblin daughter.jurek aff.at.family members and friends filed affidavits with hamblin state petition relating the violence and deprivation of hamblin childhood,each stating that they would have been available and willing to testify at the penalty phase but had never been asked to do so.
counsel also failed to gather any medical information,including psychological information,on hamblin.earlier psychiatric evaluation of hamblin had shown him competent to stand trial and not to be mentally retarded.counsel believed,incorrectly,that the issue of competency to stand trial was the only admissible psychological evidence for mitigation purposes.relying solely on what he was told by hamblin and the mental competency to stand trial was the only relevant did not evaluate hamblin mental condition at the time of trial or inquire further into his mental health.counsel did not review the earlier reports concerning hamblin mental status,which were prepared for a previous criminal case involving hamblin.an evaluation done in when hamblin was and had been arrested on juvenile charges stated that hamblin tends to alienate himself from other people and appears mistrustful and suspicious of everyone.school records and iq tests,among other records,were also available but were not collected or reviewed.nor did counsel contact a mental health professional to help him evaluate the existing reports or to give him advice on using the psychological information previously acquired on hamblin or to inquire about further psychological testing.jurek aff.at.
only two witnesses were offered at the penalty phase rhonda lezark and hamblin himself.the entire proceeding consists of about pages and could not have taken more than minutes to present.the prosecution closing argument at the penalty phase consumes pages out of the,while defense counsel closing argument consists of pages.
witness rhonda lezark was in a relationship with hamblin and they have one daughter from that relationship.lezark had testified for the prosecution during the guilt phase.in her testimony at the penalty phase she stated that hamblin relationship with their child was good.she had nothing else positive to say during her short testimony.she told the jury about hamblin previous prison time and explained that she did not want to testify on his behalf.hamblin counsel did not prepare her for her testimony at the penalty phase or interview her in advance.
the only other testimony by the defense during the penalty phase was a relatively short,rambling,almost incoherent,unsworn statement given by hamblin to the jury in an attempt to explain his background.counsel admitted he did nothing to help hamblin prepare or give this statement.jurek aff.at.
obviously,counsel failure to investigate and prepare for the sentencing phase of the case violates the aba standards and applicable case law discussed above,unless there is some other justification for counsel performance.
the district court below found two justifications for counsel performance.first the court found that defense counsel did not further investigate hamblin mental condition for the strategic reason that such an investigation might not reveal any psychological problems or brain injury,thereby preventing a mitigation theory based on those factors.the court said mitigation evidence could hurt him as easily as help him if exposed to a jury,and so hamblin attorneys made a strategic decision not to investigate or present mitigating evidence about hamblin deplorable childhood and wretched upbringing,vol.i.second,the court found that counsel did not investigate or prepare mitigation because his client told him not to present evidence in mitigation.
the first reason for not investigating is not asserted by defense counsel in the record before us and,even if it were,does not make sense.because counsel does not know what an investigation will reveal is no reason not to conduct the investigation.counsel was obligated to find out the facts,not to guess or assume or suppose some facts may be adverse.counsel admitted he was not sure what further investigation or testing might reveal about hamblin psychological health or any organic brain damage.in addition,because the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing or allow any discovery,many details of why counsel failed to investigate are not known.and between the time the habeas petition was filed in late and the issuance of the district court order in early,fred jurek,the lawyer responsible for the penalty phase,died.this complete failure to investigate simply can not be condoned and constitutes a clear constitutional violation.
as to the second justification,the district court said that counsel can not be ineffective when counsel is simply following a defendant wishes not to investigate or prepare for the mitigation phase of the case.there is no evidence in the record that counsel informed hamblin about the importance of mitigation to the penalty phase or the consequences of limiting the penalty phase to his unsworn statement and the testimony of rhonda lezark.since the district court did not permit an evidentiary hearing or discovery in this case,it is not clear what hamblin said to jurek about investigating the case or what jurek advised hamblin.but aba and judicial standards do not permit the courts to excuse counsel failure to investigate or prepare because the defendant so requested,assuming that this finding is factually accurate.the guidelines state that the investigation regarding penalty should be conducted regardless of any statement by the client that evidence bearing upon penalty is not to be collected or presented,because 
c ounsel can not responsibly advise a client about the merits of different courses of action,the client can not make informed decisions,and counsel can not be sure of the client competency to make such decisions,unless counsel has first conducted a thorough investigation 
aba guidelines at.this guideline is supported by our decisions in austin bell,supra,at,and coleman mitchell,supra,at,as well as by a number of cases from other circuits,see,blanco singletary,cir counsel ineffective for latching onto client assertions that he did not want to call penalty phase witnesses and failing to conduct an investigation sufficient to allow client to make an informed decision to waive mitigation united states gray,cir counsel can hardly be said to have made a strategic choice against pursuing a certain line of investigation when has not yet obtained the facts on which such a decision could be made knighton maggio,cir petitioner entitled to relief if record shows that counsel could not make a valid strategic choice because he had made no investigation.
therefore,the two strategic justifications for failing to investigate mitigating factors by the court below are insufficient to excuse counsel performance.counsel performance fell well below minimum standards in capital cases.
the strickland and wiggins cases in the supreme court also require us to examine whether counsel deficient performance prejudiced defendant.this is the second or prejudice prong established by strickland.defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.hamblin must demonstrate that counsel errors were serious enough to deprive him of a proceeding the result of which was reliable.glenn tate,cir.hamblin has sufficiently demonstrated that the utter failure of his counsel effectively to present at sentencing the wealth of mitigating evidence undermines confidence in the outcome of the sentencing phase of his trial.
under federal law,one juror may prevent the death penalty by finding that mitigating factors outweigh aggravating factors.as the supreme court recently said in wiggins,the prejudice prong is satisfied if there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance.at.at.
ohio is a weighing state,which means that the aggravating circumstances must outweigh the mitigating factors in order to impose the death penalty.hamblin has presented substantial evidence of a childhood in which abuse,neglect,violence and hunger were common.in light of the quantity of mitigation evidence available,we find ourselves unpersuaded that there is a reasonable probability that a jury would have returned the same sentence had the evidence been introduced.our confidence in the outcome of hamblin trial has been undermined by counsel failure to include the details of hamblin background during their penalty phase presentation.in our view,had the available evidence been hamblin mental history and abusive least one juror would have voted against the death penalty.he is therefore entitled to a new trial at the penalty phase.the sentencing phase of the trial under ohio law is obviously a critical stage of the criminal proceeding which can result in the sentence of death and did so in this case.yet hamblin counsel performed virtually no investigation to prepare a defense.counsel presented no meaningful evidence by way of mitigation as a result of the failure to investigate and prepare,not as a result of trial strategy after thorough research.it is not just that the defense presented on hamblin behalf at the sentencing phase was ineffective rather,hamblin counsel did not present any meaningful mitigation evidence at the sentencing phase because he was not prepared due to his lack of knowledge and understanding of the sentencing phase of a capital case.this total lack of preparation,investigation and understanding of sentencing caused counsel deficient performance and extreme prejudice to hamblin.
because we find that counsel failure to investigate possible mitigating circumstances constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel warranting a new penalty phase trial for hamblin,we pretermit any other sentencing issues raised in the habeas petition concerning the sentencing phase of the case,including whether hamblin counsel was ineffective in other aspects of the sentencing phase and whether prosecutorial misconduct at the sentencing phase undermined hamblin constitutional right to a fundamentally fair trial.we will now turn to the issues raised by hamblin concerning the guilt phase of his trial.
ineffective assistance of counsel at culpability phase 
hamblin contends that his counsel should have put on an expert pathologist to counter the testimony of the prosecution expert.the cuyahoga county coroner testified that lillian merrick was killed by one or more blows to the head.hamblin claims that an independent pathologist might have show
