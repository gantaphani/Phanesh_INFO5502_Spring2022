this appeal presents the question of whether the petitioner is mentally competent to be put to death under the rationale of ford wainwright,d.kelsey patterson was convicted in the texas courts of capital murder and sentenced to death.in an unpublished opinion in may,this court affirmed the district court denial of federal habeas relief.we granted a certificate of appealability for patterson claim that he was then incompetent to be executed,but dismissed that claim without prejudice in order to allow the state court to consider patterson claim of incompetency to be executed,in the light of the evidence presented at the federal evidentiary hearings in,as well as any evidence of his condition subsequent to that time,after an execution date had been scheduled.
on december,the convicting court ordered the issuance of a death warrant,setting patterson execution date for may.on january,patterson counsel filed a motion in the convicting court to determine patterson competency to be executed under article of the texas code of criminal procedure a supplement to that motion was filed on march.in support of the motion,patterson counsel submitted his medical and psychiatric records from the texas department of criminal justice,affidavits from a psychologist and a spiritual counselor,and recent letters written by patterson.
patterson medical and psychiatric records indicate that,since july,patterson has been evaluated every days and that he is not taking any psychotropic medications.as his counsel acknowledged in the motion,patterson prison records reflect that he remains docile when left alone.the spiritual advisor stated in her affidavit that patterson told her that he had received a stay in and that in,the texas court of criminal appeals had acquitted him on an innocence claim.he also told her that his only friend is the state of texas.the psychologist stated in his affidavit that,based on his review of patterson recent writings,patterson continues to have bizarre delusions that there is no credible evidence that he is malingering his delusions or their effects on his functioning that it is likely that his chronic delusions impair his rational understanding of his conviction and pending execution and that his statements raise serious concerns whether he has a factual understanding of his pending execution.patterson handwritten letters to various courts and the texas board of pardons and parole contain references to his rights in amnesty and a permanent stay of execution based on innocence.however,they also contain references to the execution date told to me by major miller and requests to stop and remove and prevent the execution.for example,in a letter to the texas court of criminal appeals in february,patterson states that he needs to conduct my legal work needed to stop the execution murder assaults injury execution date murder machines grave graveyard murder 
the convicting court conducted a hearing on the motion on march.the court noted that it had reviewed the documents submitted by patterson in support of his motion,and that it was taking judicial notice of the records of prior proceedings in patterson case,including the fact that hearings were conducted in december and january,and that the court had made a factual finding that patterson mental illness did not prevent him from realizing that he was going to be executed and the reason for his execution.at the march hearing,the court questioned patterson

patterson no,i do for the reason of this i have been told i have been stayed from execution based on innocence by the texas court of criminal appeals and stayed,stayed,stayed,always stayed from execution.

patterson no,i do not 
on march,the convicting court entered an order denying patterson motion and his request for appointment of two mental health experts to examine him.the court concluded that patterson had failed to raise a substantial doubt as to his competency to be executed.because article does not provide for an appeal from such a decision,patterson has exhausted his state remedies.see ex parte caldwell.
patterson filed a petition for federal habeas relief and a motion for stay of execution,raising only the claim that he is incompetent to be executed.the state does not contend that patterson petition should be treated as successive under b.in a memorandum opinion filed on may,the district court denied habeas relief,concluding that the state court decision that patterson had failed to make a substantial showing of incompetency to be executed was not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in the light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings.the district court observed that patterson has consistently expressed the delusions that he killed the victims only because devices implanted in his body by conspirators made him do it,and that he has received a permanent stay of execution based upon his innocence.however,the district court also noted that,in his recent writings,patterson has made numerous requests that his execution be halted.the district court referred specifically to two of patterson pro se petitions,one filed in march,and one filed in march,copies of which are attached to the district court memorandum opinion.in each of these form petitions,patterson filled in the blanks that he was requesting relief from the sentence of death,and stated that he received that sentence for having been convicted of capital murder.in his march petition,patterson asked the court to stop and remove and prevent the execution murder death warrants execution date execution hell that is being did to me can i get free from death row the district court concluded that this evidence shows that patterson understands both the fact of his execution and the reason for it and consequently denied relief.the district court then granted patterson application for a certificate of appealability.

resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
