early in benn trial,the prosecution moved in limine to exclude questioning of the complainant,regarding prior allegations that family members had sexually assaulted her and one allegation made after the date of benn alleged assault that a had sexually assaulted her.the source of the prosecution information regarding these allegations was the medical records of,who suffered from schizophrenia.defense counsel proffered that he believed these accusations were false because of history of hallucinations and delusions of persecution and his unconfirmed belief that no criminal charges were filed in connection with any of these claims.apparently accepting the prosecution argument that questioning concerning these charges would be improper under new york rape shield law.proc.law,the trial court granted the motion in limine after inquiring if the defense had any other basis than mental illness to suppose that the allegations were false.it ruled that defense counsel could elicit information concerning hallucinations and past alleged assaults,but not the specific allegations of sexual abuse.
admitted at trial that she had suffered from schizophrenia since.at the time of the attack at issue at trial,she was taking psychotropic drugs which controlled but did not completely suppress hallucinations that she would otherwise experience.she testified that she had received inpatient treatment in the past following suicidal feelings,and that she had experienced hallucinations of demonic possession,of her throat being cut,and of unknown people following or attempting to control her.she admitted having used marijuana and cocaine in the past but denied using drugs after and denied abusing alcohol.she admitted that in,she pleaded guilty to sexual abuse in the first degree for placing her nephew against her naked breast.she testified that she had never filed a criminal complaint against another person besides benn.
with respect to the charged conduct,testified that on the night of the attack,benn,who was unknown to her,approached her on the street and asked her if she smoked crack and wanted to hang out.he then grabbed and kissed her and,when she resisted,pulled and dragged her and then marched her along the street,holding a screwdriver to her throat.taking her to a darkened building entryway,he threatened her with a small lit blowtorch while this was happening,squatting,saw people passing by on the sidewalk and extended her hand toward the door to try to attract their notice silently.benn subsequently forced her to put her mouth on his penis and,when she struggled,repeatedly punched her,choked her and smashed her head against the floor,possibly causing her to lose consciousness briefly.testified that,although she was dizzy and disoriented,she believed benn paused to smoke crack with the blowtorch during the assault.as she lay on the floor,he removed her pants and underwear from one leg,fondled her breast and attempted to insert his penis into her vagina.she began to kick and struggle again and benn punched her and threatened that he would kill her as she struggled she rose to her feet.she testified that she was not wearing a hood.
two sisters and their male friend,none of whom knew either benn or,testified at trial that they had walked by the entryway during the attack and saw the blowtorch flame.one of the three saw a hand suddenly reach out of the darkness towards her knee.they walked on and,when they met a fourth witness the sisters brother driving toward them,asked him to chase away the people they had seen because they believed they were smoking crack with the blowtorch.the brother drove to the entryway and after yelling at the people inside,he heard a faint cry for help.illuminating the entryway with his car headlights,he saw pinned against the wall as benn was pulling down her pants and underwear.the other three witnesses returned to the entryway following the brother,and all four witnesses saw benn,holding a blowtorch,drag forcibly from the entryway on her knees and saw that her pants and underwear were pulled off of one leg.they saw that her head,neck and knees were injured and that she had leaves in her hair.cried for help and said that benn was trying to rape her.none of the witnesses saw benn force to put her mouth on his penis.
the witnesses fought with benn,who brandished a screwdriver that he pulled from his bag,and when benn fled,the men pursued him,ultimately subduing him with the assistance of an corrections officer.the sisters took to a friend house and called the police.testified about the eyewitnesses intervention consistently with their accounts.a police officer and a physician who saw her shortly after the attack testified that had extensive injuries to her head,including large bumps,an eye swollen completely shut,and bloody lacerations on her throat and knees.the physician gave expert testimony that the injuries were consistent with being savagely beaten multiple times.he testified that the injuries were inconsistent with falling to the ground because such a fall would not explain the trauma to the back of head.the doctor also testified that was lucid and in touch with reality and that her pupils did not show clinical signs of cocaine or narcotics use.
benn testified at trial that had asked him to buy crack for her and that they smoked it together.he suggested that they should go a motel but she invited him to her place and they continued to smoke crack with the blowtorch as they walked together for twenty minutes before entering the vestibule.when someone approached the vestibule in a car and asked them what they were doing,became hysterical.benn testified that he told the stranger,whom he feared might be husband or lover,that she was his woman and pulled,who was fully clothed,from the entryway,at which point she fell to the ground.because the people who interrupted them were threatening him,benn fled.he acknowledged ownership of the screwdriver and blowtorch but denied menacing with them.he acknowledged that he might have kissed but denied attempting to rape her or hitting or choking her.he testified that she was wearing a hooded garment and that although he could see her face he did not notice any facial injuries,bruises or swelling and saw no blood on her face.benn admitted to a conviction for attempted sexual abuse for restraining a woman in a car and touching her breast but testified that the complainant had lied and that the encounter was consensual.
