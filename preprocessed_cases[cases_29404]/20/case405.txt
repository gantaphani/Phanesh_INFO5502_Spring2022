james ventry appeals from the district court denial of his motion to vacate,set aside,or correct his sentence imposed for witness tampering in violation of b.ventry habeas petition alleged that his conviction resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel arising from his trial counsel conflict of interest.in its decision and order below,the district court arcara,denied ventry motion without a hearing,concluding that no conflict of interest existed.because we believe that the district court conclusion is not supported by the record,we vacate the district court denial of ventry habeas petition and remand for an evidentiary hearing to determine the merits of ventry conflict of interest claim.
background 
factual basis for ventry witness tampering charge 
an investigation into an august,attempted armed robbery in the niagara falls region of new york led the government to suspect the involvement of ventry then a high school history teacher,wared abdellatif and robert james bobby vitagliano.on september,ventry was called to testify before a federal grand jury regarding the robbery attempt.some time thereafter,he told his,christine janik of his involvement in the robbery attempt.fbi special agent robert utz subsequently interviewed janik on february.during this interview,janik recounted what ventry had told her about his involvement in the robbery attempt,and eventually signed a statement to that effect,prepared by utz.janik later described her interview as unpleasant,due to what she considered to be utz sometimes aggressive interrogation technique.trial tr.at one point she also indicated that the fbi pressured her into making a statement.id.at.following her february,interview with utz,janik called ventry to inform him of her statement.later that same day,ventry and janik had a confrontation during which janik told him that she did not want to see him again.
at that time,ventry had apparently not yet met with or spoken to the attorney subsequently retained by ventry father to serve as ventry trial lana ventry did,however,speak to another attorney,thomas eoannou,on february,in an effort to obtain advice regarding what ventry had learned from janik about her fbi interview 
it is uncontested that on february,day after ventry meeting with sent the following email message to janik redacted by the government to protect janik personal information,in which ventry mentioned his discussion with eoannou,without referring to eoannou by name 
chrissy,i just want you to know that i spoke to a lawyer last night and they said that if you made that statement under deress that they can not hold you to that and that all you have to do is call anthony bruce who is the prosecutor and tell him that the statement was made under deress and that it is not true and that is what you will say if they make you testifie in front of a grand jury.you should get a lawyer to make the call but if you ca just call yourself.he said it is absolutely legal to do and they can not get you in any trouble for it no matter what they say.anthony bruce number is.they have not one bit of physical evidence or 
bobby would be arrested for something other than threatening a witness.also when and if you go to the grand jury you can remain silent after you change your statement.listen i know you hate me but i am a very good person and i know you do want me to go to jail.but i want you to know that if you do this that my lawyer will have to try and destroy your reputation and i will have to tell him some potentially embarrassing information about you.now i know your thinking i hate this asshole but believe me i love you more than anything and it would break my heart to ever have to do something like that but i can not go to jail for something i did not do.i really sorry for having to say those things to you,i know i hurt you enough,but i will have no choice.i do think you understand i can go jail for years and when i get my life will be over.i will be years old,no job,no chance of ever getting married or having kids.so please call him today,i know you were trying to protect me and yourself but its not to late that statement is not binding.take care of yourself and again i am sorry for saying those things to you.love always,james 
app.text break and errors appear in the version provided by government.
ventry was arrested on february,after sending the email,and was arraigned the following day.
in an indictment dated february,ventry,abdellatif,and vitagliano were charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the hobbs act,a one count of attempted hobbs act robbery,a and one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime,c.vitagliano was also charged with several other counts not relevant here,and ventry was charged in a superseding indictment with one count of witness tampering,b,based on his february,email to janik.
the janik email also prompted a motion by the government for a hearing on a potential conflict of interest affecting ventry counsel.the government motion asserted that,
u pon information and belief,which is based upon conversations with thomas eoannou,counsel for defendant wared abdellatif,and anthony lana,counsel for defendant james ventry,the a lawyer and the they who spoke to ventry and whose advice ventry gave to janik were eoannou and lana.in the government view,the advice that ventry says he received borders on advice that he tamper with janik,and thus potentially calls the conduct of messers eoannou and lana into question and might require them to become unsworn witnesses.
mot.for inquiry into potential conflict of interest,app.footnote omitted.
in essence then,the government was concerned that a conflict might exist between ventry and his counsel potentially with respect to both eoannou and lana because one or both of the attorneys may have encouraged ventry to tamper with a witness.
b.the district court hearing on possible conflict of interest 
in the ensuing hearing conducted by the district court,assistant united states attorney anthony bruce,as well as lana and eoannou,were present.during the hearing,the district court established that eoannou was the lawyer to whom ventry referred in the janik email.indeed,in response to the court inquiries,eoannou twice confirmed that there was n o question of this fact,and recalled that he was alone in his office when he received the phone call from ventry.hr g tr,june,furthermore,eoannou proclaimed that his advice was entirely appropriate.eoannou said he a bsolutely wanted the jury to hear his advice,id.at,and stood by the statement,id.at.indeed,the defense theory was that the advice attributed to eoannou in the first paragraph of the janik email was legal and proper.as lana explained,the 
defense to count nine is that he says in the email,if he said if you made that statement under duress.he did say tell them you made it under duress,or let make this story up.he said if you made it under duress,call the assistant united states attorney.
furthermore,the email says,call the prosecutor,if this is what happened.he not saying let make up a story,give a statement he saying call the prosecutor and tell him that if you made your statement under duress,tell him that.i do see where there any impropriety there.
id.at emphasis added.
in other words,lana interpreted the statements as innocuous legal advice premised upon a hypothetical,even taking ventry email statement to be a true and accurate reflection of the advice ventry received from eoannou,lana maintained the email could only support an inference that eoannou had suggested that janik could claim duress if that claim were true.lana pursued the same defense theory at trial,in both his of janik and in his closing statement as well as in argument before the district court eoannou,meanwhile,did not shy away from taking credit for these statements.in his own words,he had no problem with the jury knowing that i sent the witness to the a ttorney office to tell the truth.id.at.
with respect to the statements in the second paragraph of the janik email,to janik that,if she refused to inform the assistant united states attorney that her statement was made under duress,it could lead to certain embarrassing revelations during her trial flatly denied any responsibility.the defense theory regarding those statements was that they simply foreshadowed the potentially unfortunate consequences that might result from janik character assassination that lana viewed as the normal collateral damage incident to.id.at.
during the course of the hearing,the focus upon the source of the potential conflict sometimes seemed to drift.rather than pursuing an inquiry solely into the possible role of counsel in the alleged witness tampering as had been the original purpose of the government motion,the district court shifted its attention to the conflict that might arise from ventry potentially inconsistent account of his discussion with eoannou if ventry were to testify,the district court reasoned,ventry own rendition of his conversation with eoannou might contradict eoannou.for instance,while ventry may have had an interest in asserting an advice of counsel defense,eoannou may have had a conflicting incentive to suggest that his advice to ventry was narrower in scope.the court posed the following scenario to eoannou what if the defendant takes the stand and starts contradicting what you allegedly said to him.you become a witness,eoannou or an unsworn witness,either on of him,or to refute what he says.id.at.the district court explained,further 
ventry has a right to take the stand.he has a right to say hey,i was operating on my lawyer advice.i just relating to what my lawyer said.and let assume for the purposes of discussion,that it a lie,that you never said these things,you never made these claims,okay then you possibly become a witness,eoannou.because in effect,he maybe suggesting that you may have been involved in some activity that you will absolutely deny,and is not true.
so now you going to him on what the statement is or,two,you going to be called as a witness by the government,to rebut it.
as the district court saw it,eoannou testimony would undoubtedly put his own credibility at issue.in that event,the district court wondered,w hat are you going to do,eoannou you going to get on that witness stand as the active lawyer in this case,and the prosecutor is going to you.your credibility now becomes an issue before the jury.id.at.the government was able to confirm,in fact,that if ventry did testify,and adopted an advice of counsel defense,the government would inevitably call eoannou as a rebuttal witness 
significantly,while the district court clearly recognized a possible problem involving ventry and eoannou,it dismissed the possibility of a conflict between ventry and lana arising from lana relationship with eoannou.although the two attorneys apparently shared building or office space,and utilized a firm name of eoannou,lana,the district court explicitly discounted the possibility of an imputed conflict,stating on the record that it saw no problem in lana representation of ventry 
lana,i do have such a problem with you,and i do have a real problem with had this thing about the two of you sharing office space.i not so concerned about that.that does we done this many times,and i obviously will have to go into it more on the record as to why.
later in the proceedings,however,the district court evidenced curiosity at lana zealous defense of eoannou right to remain as abdellatif counsel.lana explained his interest in the most general terms,without ever acknowledging a partnership relationship with eoannou 
the court can i ask you a question why do you care 
lana why do i care,judge because i do want prosecutors intimidating defense attorneys into who can represent who and who can do what and who ca do what.
the court this does relate to you though.
lana it does,judge,because i a defense attorney 
the court if i do think there a problem with the fact that you share an office,okay,and everything else is separate,and we gone through this issue a number of times,and i think you have successfully persuaded me that there not a problem,that there is enough of a separation.and let assume that i do feel that you have a conflict problem,so you no longer in it.why do you care i mean,you the champion of defense lawyers in this case 
lana no,judge,but first of all,i care because it involves my client.secondly,if something is wrong,and i can speak out to that wrongfulness,why should i keep my mouth shut 
the court do you have any standing talking about eoannou.
lana it referring to my client and the email that my client sent.
the court whether he stays in the case or not 
lana ultimately,judge,again,ultimately you right,it does affect me.
the court did not pursue this inquiry further.the hearing concluded with the court agreeing to permit counsel to brief the conflict issue.eoannou,however,subsequently withdrew voluntarily as counsel to abdellatif.
ventry witness tampering conviction,motions,sentencing,and direct appeal 
neither ventry nor eoannou testified at trial.ventry was convicted solely on the witness tampering charge,for which he was sentenced by the district court to months imprisonment,to be followed by three years of supervised release.prior to sentencing,however,ventry moved,under federal rules of criminal procedure and,for a judgment of acquittal or a new trial.lana later amended the rule motion to add a letter exhibit,submitted by a juror who claimed that the guilty verdict on ventry witness tampering charge was the product of juror compromise resulting from time pressure.by decision and order dated february,the district court denied ventry motions.
on direct appeal to this court,ventry challenged,inter alia,the sufficiency of the evidence for his witness tampering conviction.see united states vitagliano.cir summary order.we affirmed ventry conviction.id.at.
d.the district court denial of ventry habeas petition 
following his direct appeal,ventry initiated a collateral habeas corpus proceeding in the district court under.ventry pro se motion to vacate,set aside,or correct sentence,raised,inter alia,a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel premised upon allegations of his trial counsel conflict of interest specifically,ventry alleged that eoannou should have advised ventry not to contact his sic since she was now a witness for the government.habeas mot,app.ventry also alleged that he had called eoannou to seek legal advice as to what could be done since his sic was threatened into giving this statement.id.emphasis omitted.finally,ventry argued that,s ince the defendant lawyer,lana,works in the same building and in the same law firm of eoannou,lana and,there is a crystal clear conflict of interest between ventry,eoannou,and lana.id.at,app.
in opposition to ventry motion,the government submitted an affidavit provided by lana,in which lana denied the connection to eoannou alleged in ventry motion.lana affidavit states 
i,in fact,work in the same building as eoannou the cornell mansion,delaware avenue.however,and contrary to ventry assertion,i am a sole practitioner and i am not,nor have i ever been,a member of the firm of eoannou,lana,and.my only relationship with eoannou is that he owns the cornell mansion and i rent office space from him landlord and tenant.
aff.of anthony lana at,gov t app.
in its decision and order below,dated june,the district court adopted lana statement,rejecting ventry conflict of interest claim in the following two paragraphs 
petitioner argues that his sentence should be overturned because a conflict of interest existed between attorney thomas eoannou and petitioner trial counsel,anthony lana.ventry sought legal advice from eoannou concerning the statements janik made to the fbi.although eoannou did provide some legal advice,petitioner claims that eoannou should have advised him not to contact janik,who was,by then,a potential government witness.petitioner asserts that because eoannou gave legal advice to him that,in effect,led him to commit a crime,and because both eoannou and lana work in the same law firm,there was a conflict of interest.this claim is without merit.
even assuming arguendo that eoannou provided bad advice or neglected to provide certain information to petitioner,there was no conflict of interest.as stated in lana affidavit,lana and eoannou are not in the same law firm.rather,lana is a sole practitioner and merely rents office space from eoannou.the extent of their relationship is.therefore,even assuming eoannou provided petitioner with erroneous legal advice,eoannou error can not be imputed to lana as petitioner argues.thus,petitioner conflict of interest claim fails.
dist.op.at,app.
in an order dated december,a motions panel of this court granted ventry a certificate of appealability solely on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel premised upon the alleged conflict of interest,but dismissed ventry other claims as not ma king a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.see ventry united states,order dated,quoting c.the panel directed the appointment of counsel for ventry,and briefing and oral argument followed.
discussion 
on an appeal from the denial of a motion,we review a district court conclusions of law de novo but will accept its factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.sapia united states,cir.
a defendant sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel includes the right to representation by counsel.locascio united states,cir quoting united states schwarz,cir see also united states williams,cir noting that the sixth amendment right to counsel includes a correlative right to representation that is free from conflicts of interest quoting wood georgia,d.in williams,we identified three particular kinds of conflicts per se conflicts,actual conflicts,and potential conflicts.at.
per se conflicts are so severe that they are deemed per se violations of the sixth amendment.such violations are unwaivable and do not require a showing that the defendant was prejudiced by his representation.id.actual conflicts occur when the interests of a defendant and his attorney diverge with respect to a material factual or legal issue or to a course of action,id.quoting schwarz,at,and violate the sixth amendment when counsel representation of the client is adversely affect ed by the existence of the conflict.id.citing united states levy,cir.potential conflicts exist if the interests of the defendant may place the attorney under inconsistent duties at some time in the future,id.quoting united states kliti,cir,and violate the sixth amendment when they prejudice the defendant.id.
thus,depending on the type of conflict if any between ventry and his trial counsel,the fact that ventry may not have been prejudiced by the conflict might not cure the conflict of constitutional error.if ventry could demonstrate,for instance,that there existed an actual conflict between himself and lana that adversely affected lana performance,then the conflict would have been presumptively prejudicial.see locascio,at.if,on the other hand,ventry could prove only a potential conflict between himself and lana,proof of prejudice to ventry would be required for him to prevail.the nature of the conflict potentially at issue here is not something we can determine on the present record.
ventry habeas petition presents three theories for relief,all relating to the business relationship.before the district court,ventry identified a potential conflict arising from eoannou and lana possible partnership,and premised his ineffectiveness argument on eoannou failure to counsel ventry against contacting janik.habeas mot,app.that theory is not before us.
on the benefit of appointed seeks review of his two remaining and related conflict contentions.ventry second ground for relief is that both lawyers should have been barred from further representation of petitioner based on their close association as apparent,if not actual,partners and the fact that one of them gave the advice to petitioner which formed the basis for his conviction on witness tampering charges.appellant br.in other words,ventry asserts that whatever conflict eoannou incurred was imputed to lana.
this claim as construed by the district court was premised on an assertion that eoannou had given ventry illegal or improper advice that eoannou advice was imputable to lana because eoannou and lana shared the same office and that ventry,not knowing such conduct to be illegal or improper,acted upon that advice and proceeded to threaten janik in good conscience.without resolving this advice of counsel defense,the district court rejected ventry habeas claim on the basis of its finding that eoannou and lana had no partnership relationship.
although we have significant reservations about the district court factual resolution of ventry second claim,we are hard pressed,as a matter of law,to view ventry trial counsel failure to advance this defense as a basis for concluding that lana efforts at trial were ineffective.this defense amounted to an ignorance of the law argument,which,by definition,would not have helped ventry.ignorance of the law is not usually a defense.although ignorance of the law may be a defense in certain circumstances,such as when specific intent to violate the law is an element of the crime,see united states george,cir,that kind of specific intent was not an element of ventry witness tampering charge.ventry habeas claim in this regard is therefore without merit.
that leaves us with ventry third conflict failure to call eoannou as a it raises an intriguing question.assuming consistent with the district court conclusion that lana and eoannou were not members of the same law firm,eoannou could have properly testified on behalf of ventry.similarly,even if lana and eoannou were members of the same firm contrary to the district court conclusion,there would still have been no problem with eoannou testifying on ventry behalf.an attorney may continue to represent his client even though he,or his partner,may be called to testify on the client behalf see regs.tit,b,d dr b,d.
thus,if nothing precluded eoannou from testifying on ventry behalf,why did lana not call eoannou as a witness eoannou,after all,was the individual who could best support the defense lana employed at trial.eoannou,furthermore,had vociferously pronounced his eagerness for his advice to ventry to be presented to the jury.could lana decision not to call eoannou have arisen from lana relationship with eoannou if so,this might raise grave conflict concerns.
throughout the district court proceedings lana either failed to mention any partnership relationship with eoannou at the conflict hearing or explicitly denied the existence of a partnership in his affidavit.lana insisted that he was merely eoannou tenant.while the actual state of that relationship may not have been relevant to the quality of defense provided ventry,representations concerning the nature of the relationship may have been.
lana name appears in the title of the law firm identified in his affidavit submitted by the government in response to ventry motion.as ventry notes in his reply brief on as is evident from our review of the trial signed a trial memorandum,dated november,immediately above the following identifying and contact information 
anthony lana,lana for defendant,james delaware avenuebuffalo,new york 
trial mem.supp.reference to theory of defense during summations,app.letters submitted by lana to the district court on more than one occasion were typed on letterhead from the law firm of eoannou,lana.the top of the letterhead,in bold calligraphic font,identifies the name of the law firm eoannou,lana above a line reading attorneys at law.roa,doc.
there is an obvious inconsistency between lana use of the firm name eoannou,lana and his statement that he is not,nor has he ever been,a member of the firm of eoannou,lana,and and his assertion that he is a sole practitioner.aff.of anthony lana at,gov t app.
ventry indicates that he called the number for his lawyer office,lana the phone was answered by eoannou.appellant br.the fact that the phone number dialed by ventry was answered by eoannou suggests that the two attorneys share the same law office telephone number.
public representations of eoannou and lana professional relationship are easily found.for example,an electronic westlaw profile search for attorneys thomas eoannou and anthony lana indic
