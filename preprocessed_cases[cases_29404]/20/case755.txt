opinion of the court 
the district court judge who dismissed appellant petition for a writ of habeas corpus had been the state court judge who presided over his criminal trial.the principal question we consider is whether the judge should have sua sponte recused from the habeas proceeding.
appellant charlie clemmons conviction arose out of a incident of road rage,in which clemmons shot and killed another motorist following an altercation stemming from a traffic incident.app.at.clemmons was convicted by a jury in the court of common pleas of dauphin county,pennsylvania of murder.judge william caldwell presided over the state court trial and,following clemmons conviction,judge caldwell sentenced him to life imprisonment for murder.const.stat.ann.clemmons filed a series of four petitions in state court for collateral relief under the post conviction relief act pcra.ann.et,and its predecessor statute.each petition was denied,and the denials of the first three petitions were affirmed by the state superior court.the fourth petition was dismissed.
on february,clemmons filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court pursuant to.his petition was eventually assigned to judge caldwell,who by then had been appointed to the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.on september,clemmons applied for appointment of counsel.on november,judge caldwell issued an opinion in which he acknowledged that he had presided at petitioner trial in state court.app.at.he then denied clemmons habeas petition as untimely and all other pending motions as moot.there was no specific reference to clemmons request for counsel.
clemmons filed an application for a certificate of appealability coa to this court.we granted the coa directed to the following question whether the district court judge was required to recuse himself from hearing the federal habeas corpus proceedings attacking the trial and conviction over which he presided when he was a state court judge.the same day we appointed counsel to represent clemmons in this matter against appellees william wolfe,district attorney of the county of dauphin,and pennsylvania attorney general gerald pappert three months later we amended the coa to add the following issue whether the district court judge abused his discretion by deciding the merits of appellant petition for writ of habeas corpus without first addressing appellant request for counsel.
on appeal,clemmons contends that judge caldwell was required to recuse himself sua sponte in clemmons habeas action challenging the trial and conviction over which judge caldwell formerly presided as a state court judge.although clemmons does not explicitly so state,it appears he argues that this presents a legal question over which we would have plenary review.second,clemmons contends that the district court abused its discretion by failing to address the merits of clemmons application for appointment of counsel before dismissing the motion as moot.
the relevant federal statute,a,provides that a ny justice,judge,or magistrate judge of the united states shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.a the supreme court has stated that the purpose of this provision is to promote public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process.liljeberg health servs.acquisition,d.
clemmons claims that judge caldwell created the appearance of impropriety by failing to recuse himself in the habeas proceeding because he had presided over the state trial.because clemmons did not object to judge caldwell failure to recuse in the habeas proceeding,a plain error standard of review applies.united states dalfonso,cir citations omitted.we may overlook the failure to object where the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states olano,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.on its face,the error complained of in this federal judge sitting in review of the propriety of the state proceedings conducted by that affects the fairness and public reputation of the judicial proceedings,and thus we proceed to consider whether the habeas judge should have sua sponte recused notwithstanding clemmons failure to raise the issue in the habeas proceeding.we have previously stated that the public confidence in the judiciary may be irreparably harmed if a case is allowed to proceed before a judge who appears to be tainted.in re kensington int l,cir emphasis in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
when congress amended section a in,it replaced the statute formerly subjective standard with an objective one,stating 
subsection a of the amended section contains the general,or catchall,provision that a judge shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.this sets up an objective standard,rather than the subjective standard set forth in the existing statute through use of the phrase in his opinion.

the bedrock principle of a hierarchal judiciary that n o judge shall hear or determine an appeal from the decision of a case or issue tried by him is embedded in,a statute inapplicable here because its plain language only applies to cases on appeal,rather than habeas petitions.the absence of a directly applicable statute in no way diminishes the importance to a litigant of review by a judge other than the judge who presided over the case at trial.of course,a habeas action is not an appeal from the state court action.the state courts provide the appeal process.however,a habeas action provides the criminal defendant with the opportunity to have a federal court review the state proceedings for constitutional infirmities.in this respect,there is no reason why the same rules governing independence,conflict of interest,or appearance of partiality should not apply.
although this court has not confronted the precise issue at bar,at least two other circuits have addressed this issue and stated that a federal judge should recuse himself or herself from hearing habeas petitions if participated in the petitioner state court proceedings.an almost identical issue was considered by the seventh circuit in russell lane,cir.in that case,the district court judge considered a habeas petition even though that judge had previously been a member of the panel of the state appellate court that affirmed the conviction.on appeal,the court of appeals for the seventh circuit stated that the judge in question 
was being asked to find that he had affirmed an unconstitutional conviction,and,implicitly,that by doing so he had become complicit in sending petitioner to prison in violation of petitioner constitutional rights a federal habeas corpus proceeding brought by a state prisoner is not a request to a state judge to reconsider his ruling.it follows the exhaustion of the petitioner state remedies and is addressed to a judge who was not a member of the panel that affirmed the petitioner conviction and who had no emotional commitment to vindicating state justice as administered in the petitioner case.
id.at.the court concluded that the petitioner was entitled to have his habeas corpus petition heard by a judge who had not participated in his conviction and thus it remanded the matter to permit the petitioner the opportunity to file a motion to vacate the order of the district judge that dismissed several of petitioner claims.id.
similarly,in rice mckenzie,cir,the fourth circuit considered whether a federal district judge,who formerly presided as the chief justice of the state supreme court that reviewed the defendant claim,could consider those claims in the context of a habeas proceeding in the federal forum without running afoul of section a.the court noted that under a federal judge may not adjudicate the appeal of an issue or case which tried as a lower court judge because a reasonable person might doubt the impartiality of a judge in such a position.id.at to say the least,it would be unbecoming for a judge to sit in a united states court of appeals to participate in the determination of the correctness,propriety and appropria
