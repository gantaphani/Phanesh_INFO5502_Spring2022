opinion of the court 
marcresse mccoy appeals from the order of the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania denying his motion for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.the sole substantive issue on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion by denying an evidentiary hearing.
a police officer in the erie area gang and law enforcement task force was informed by a reliable source that a man named joseph barnette would be arriving in erie,pennsylvania,from detroit,michigan via greyhound bus on march,at approximately.according to the source,barnette would be traveling with friends,would be armed,and would be carrying crack cocaine.based on this information,task force agents established surveillance at the bus station.
when the scheduled bus arrived,a man matching barnette description exited the bus with no bags and made his way to the front door of the bus terminal.shortly thereafter,three other black males carrying garbage bags and a blue canvas duffel bag left the bus,exited the bus terminal through the front door,and set their bags on the sidewalk next to barnette.police sergeants joseph kress and robert liebel observed that marcresse mccoy carried the blue duffel bag,while two other individuals,later identified as kendrick grier and michael mcqueen,carried the trash bags.once outside,the four men were observed sharing cigarettes and talking as if they knew each other.
officers approached the group of men,identified themselves,and questioned each of the four men separately.the officers received conflicting answers in response to inquiries of whether the men knew each other,whether they had traveled together,and the purpose of their visit.barnette,for instance,initially identified himself as ardell griffen and denied knowing the other individuals.mccoy represented that his name was mark chin and stated that he knew ardell griffen,but denied knowing grier,who was traveling under the name carlton davidson.grier,in contrast,admitted traveling with both barnette and mccoy.
because of these inconsistent responses,the officers inquired as to the ownership of the garbage bags and blue duffel bag.mccoy claimed ownership of two garbage bags and gave officers permission to search them they contained shoes,shoe boxes,wet clothing,and a screwdriver.mcqueen claimed ownership of the remaining garbage bag,which contained clothing.all four men denied ownership of the blue duffel bag.mccoy specifically denied carrying it from the bus.a search revealed that the duffel bag contained individually packaged plastic baggies of crack cocaine,forty plastic baggies of crack cocaine,a large bag containing one pound of marijuana,a pistol wrapped in a towel,and a caliber pistol hidden inside a pair of jeans.
all four men were arrested and taken into custody.individual searches revealed that all four bus tickets,issued under fictitious names,were purchased at the same ticket counter within four minutes of each other and approximately ten minutes prior to the scheduled departure.a search incident to mccoy arrest revealed that he had possession of barnette bus ticket in the fictitious name of ardell griffen,along with his own ticket in the fictitious name of mark shinne.mccoy also had a pager in his possession.a number retrieved from the pager matched a number written on a piece of paper found in barnette pocket.
on april,a grand jury in the western district of pennsylvania returned an indictment charging mccoy and barnette with violating federal drug and gun laws.a five count superseding indictment was filed on june,count one charged that beginning on or about march,the day of the arrest,the defendants had conspired to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine base and marijuana in violation of.count two charged that the defendants possessed with the intent to distribute in excess of fifty grams of cocaine base in violation of a,b a iii.count three charged the defendants with possession with the intent to distribute less than grams of marijuana in violation of a,b c.counts four and five charged barnette and mccoy,respectively,as convicted felons in knowing possession of firearms in violation of g.
prior to trial,the government provided notice of its intent to introduce.b evidence against both barnette and mccoy.the government sought to introduce evidence of barnette prior state felony drug conviction.as for mccoy,the government sought to introduce his felony conviction for carrying a concealed weapon.beyond these convictions,the prosecution also intended to introduce testimony of the parties prior bad acts specifically,it proffered that it had testimonial evidence establishing that barnette and mccoy had been involved in the sale of drugs in erie on a number of occasions prior to march,and that the drug transactions perpetrated by the two were unique because the drugs were distributed in small baggies identical to those found in the duffel bag the government argued that collectively the rule b evidence would establish that the defendants had knowledge of the contents of the bag,intended to distribute the drugs,and did not act by mistake or other innocent reason.in addition,the government argued that the prior convictions were admissible as predicate convictions for the firearms charges that were the subject of counts four and five.
following a pretrial hearing,barnette attorney filed a jemal stipulation seeking to prevent the introduction of his prior felony conviction for dealing cocaine and the testimonial evidence of his prior drug dealing activity.see united states jemal,cir holding that district court should ordinarily refuse to admit evidence of defendant prior bad acts to show knowledge and intent when defendant has proffered stipulation that removes issues of knowledge and intent from jury consideration.
the stipulation was signed by barnette on october,and provided that 
a with regard to the two charges of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana,i agree and stipulate that in the event the jury finds as a matter of fact that i possessed the blue duffel bag seized at the greyhound bus station in which the drugs were found,then the jury may also find without further evidence that i would know that the substances which were contained in the bag were cocaine and marijuana and further that i intended to distribute them.my defense in this case is that i was not in possession of the bag or the drugs or guns found in it.
app.at.notably,barnette jemal stipulation did not extend to the conspiracy charged in count one the burden remained on the government to prove that there was in fact an agreement between barnette and mccoy.
in a second notice of intent,the government declared its intention,notwithstanding barnette jemal stipulation,to introduce the rule b prior bad acts and signature drug packaging evidence as relevant to the agreement element of the conspiracy charged in count one.at a pretrial hearing held on october,the district court ruled that the prior bad acts evidence was inadmissible because its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value,and because the bad acts conduct occurred too remote in time to the conspiracy charged to have occurred on march.although the court stated it would allow the government to offer evidence about some prior personal association between barnette and mccoy,it excluded evidence of drug dealing altogether.
the court also rejected the government attempt to introduce signature drug packaging evidence associated with barnette and mccoy alleged previous drug transactions on the ground that the evidence was not sufficiently unique to warrant the inference that an individual who was a perpetrator in one case is a perpetrator in another.app.at.finally,the court held that,given barnette jemal stipulation,the government would be restricted from discussing the nature of barnette prior felony at trial it could only introduce evidence of his status as a convicted felon for purposes of the firearms charge in count four.the court did not explicitly rule whether the nature of mccoy prior felony was admissible.
at the same pretrial hearing,mccoy trial attorney,khadija diggs,expressed her reluctance to enter into a jemal stipulation similar to that entered into by barnette.mccoy prior state felony conviction was for carrying a concealed weapon,not for drug distribution,and thus carried far less probative value relative to the drug charges in counts one,two and three.further,the government specified the prior bad acts evidence closely tying barnette to the guns and drugs found in the bag.in contrast,the bad acts evidence allegedly implicating mccoy was never specified before the trial,and that which was referred to appeared relatively sparse.nonetheless,at some point following the october,hearing,diggs entered into a jemal stipulation on behalf of mccoy mccoy also entered a separate written stipulation,admitting his status as a convicted felon for purposes of the firearms charge in count five 
the jury trial began on october,and lasted through november.the government evidence was heavily weighted towards barnette.the government presented terry siegworth,the government informant who had identified barnette as the person who was to arrive in erie with crack cocaine.siegworth also testified that he had seen barnette on various occasions with a caliber handgun similar to the one seized from the blue duffel bag,and that he had taken barnette to a location in anderson,indiana,where the hand gun was stipulated to be registered.this testimony was corroborated by marion smith,who testified that he had seen barnette in possession of the caliber handgun on several instances in the past.belinda peterson testified that the handgun found in the duffel bag was similar to one she had observed barnette carrying in late november or early december of she also turned over to the prosecution a holster that fit the handgun,which she testified barnette had stored in her apartment.
kendrick grier,one of the four men who traveled on the bus,testified for the government that he had escaped from a halfway house when barnette offered to take him to erie.when grier met barnette at the home of barnette aunt,he observed the packed blue duffel bag on the floor.barnette and grier picked up mcqueen and mccoy and then doubled back to barnette aunt house to pick up the duffel bag before traveling to the bus station.grier testified that barnette carried the duffel bag into the terminal and paid for each person ticket.grier also testified that barnette stated he had a pair of shoes inside the duffel bag similar to the shoes that grier was wearing on the day at issue.this remark was particularly significant because a pair of shoes was recovered from the blue duffel bag,in barnette size,which were the same make as the shoes grier was wearing.
the government evidence against mccoy was relatively weak in comparison.several witnesses,including sergeant kress,sergeant liebel,and grier,testified that mccoy carried the blue duffel bag from the bus to the location on the street where it was seized.when questioned by police,mccoy acted nervously and gave inconsistent responses.furthermore,there was evidence that mccoy and barnette had traveled together and that they had a prior relationship.finally,the government rebutted mccoy purported innocent purpose for his bus a girl named chereka the testimony of jackson herself,who stated that she knew mccoy but was not expecting him in erie on march.notably,the government presented no evidence to demonstrate that mccoy helped pack the blue duffel bag or knew of its contents.
mccoy,in turn,sought to refute the government case against him by presenting evidence of a prior back and leg injury which purportedly precluded him from lifting heavy objects.mccoy grandmother,rayven chinn,testified that mccoy walked with a limp and utilized a leg brace,and opined that mccoy would be unable to carry the blue duffel bag.she also explained the use of his alias,stating that mccoy was called mark by family members and had been known to use her last name,which was sometimes mistaken for chin,or shinn,or shinne.chinn further testified that mccoy had received the pager,which was found in his possession on the day of arrest,from his uncle.finally,chinn testified that mccoy had told her he was traveling to erie to meet a girl.further,mccoy attempted to undermine the credibility of sergeants kress and liebel through the testimony of their former supervisor,gregory dollinger.dollinger stated that kress and liebel would do anything necessary to secure a drug conviction,including lying under oath.
given the jemal stipulations entered by both barnette and mccoy,the jury was read the following instructions regarding the substantive drug charges in counts two and three 
in this case,the defendants have stipulated to certain elements of each of the offenses.that is,with regard to the crimes of possession with intent to distribute marijuana and possession with intent to distribute cocaine.if you should find from all of the evidence that the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that joseph barnette marcresse mccoy were in possession of the blue duffel bag seized by the law enforcement officers at any time,then you may conclude without further evidence that joseph barnette and marcresse mccoy knew that the blue duffel bag contained cocaine and marijuana and that they or he intended to distribute them.however,you may conclude this only in the event that you find that the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that joseph barnette marcresse mccoy were in possession of the blue duffel bag.the defense of each defendant in this case is that they were not in possession of the blue duffel bag.
app.at emphasis added.
on november,the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to both barnette and mccoy on counts one,two and three the drug counts.barnette was found guilty on count four of the indictment,the firearm charge against him.mccoy was found not guilty on the firearm charge at count five.on march,mccoy was sentenced to concurrent terms of months imprisonment at counts one and two and sixty months imprisonment on count three.
on direct appeal,this court in a opinion,affirmed the judgment of the district court,holding that there was no plain error in the above jury instruction.we stated that the district court merely held barnette and mccoy to the bargain that they made when they entered into the jemal stipulation and thereby avoided the introduction of other crimes evidence that was probative of their knowledge and intent.app.at.however,pursuant to united states tobin,cir refusing to entertain ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal,we declined to reach the merits of mccoy ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
on may,mccoy filed a timely motion under for a writ of habeas corpus,alleging that his trial counsel decision to enter into the jemal stipulation constituted ineffective assistance of counsel because there was no reasonable or tactical basis for counsel to stipulate away the elements of knowledge and intent on the drug charges.app.at.on may,the district court sua sponte joined mccoy action with the separate and independent action of barnette,which was filed on june.the district court granted barnette relief on a issue that was wholly independent of mccoy claim mccoy ineffective assistance claim was denied outright.
on may,mccoy filed a notice of appeal.on february,we granted a certificate of appealability coa as follows 
the foregoing request for a certificate of appealability is granted with regard to the appellant claim that trial counsel was ineffective for stipulating that if the jury found the appellant was physically in possession of the blue duffle bag,it could,without more,find that he both knew that the bag contained the drugs which were the subject of his conviction and that he intended to distribute them.
barnette was not pursuant to the district court may,order until may,and this court has not yet issued a decision as to whether he will be given a coa.the government argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear mccoy appeal from the district court may,order because barnette had yet to be as of the date mccoy filed his notice of appeal.see andrews united states,d holding that order vacating sentence does not become final until.
we reject the government challenge to our jurisdiction.when barnette was on may,mccoy notice of appeal,filed on may,ripened into an appeal from a final order.see lazy oil witco,cir reiterating our position in cape may greene,warren,cir,that a premature notice of appeal,filed after disposition of some of the claims before a district court,but before entry of final judgment,will ripen upon the court disposal of the remaining claims see also welch cadre capital,cir.
the consolidation of mccoy case with barnette case in the district court does not deprive mccoy case of its finality.see united states in united states currency,cir the consolidation of two cases does not automatically preclude the appealability of an order in one.we have consistently rejected a rule,preferring a approach that examines the overlap among the claims,the relationship of the various parties,and the likelihood of the claims being tried together.their cases on ineffective assistance of counsel are markedly different.at the time mccoy motion was filed,and for the entire course in which it was pled,answered,and argued,it was kept separate and distinct from barnette motion.the two actions were joined sua sponte by the district court for what appears from the record to be administrative convenience.moreover,this court granted a coa limited to mccoy claim.thus,for the above reasons,we hold that we have jurisdiction of this appeal under.
we thus turn to the only issue before us whether the district court erred by denying an evidentiary hearing on mccoy ineffective assistance of counsel claim.we review the district court decision for an abuse of discretion.solis united states,cir.
provides that 
a prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by act of congress may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate,set aside or correct the sentence.unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief,the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the united states attorney,grant a prompt hearing thereon,determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto 
emphasis added.
we have held that a district court failure to grant an evidentiary hearing when the files and records of the case are inconclusive on the issue of whether movant is entitled to relief constitutes an abuse of discretion.solis,at see also smith united states,cir citing fontaine united states,d per curiam 
the district court devoted the entirety of its discussion to the prejudice prong of strickland washington,d finding that based on the record before it,mccoy has not established a reasonable probability that,but for the alleged errors of his trial counsel,he would have been acquitted on counts,or of the superseding indictment.app.at emphasis added.that misstates the appropriate standard.instead,under the statute the district court was required to grant an evidentiary hearing unless the record before it conclusively show ed that mccoy was not prejudiced by diggs decision to enter the jemal stipulation.
mccoy argues that diggs decision to enter into the jemal stipulation relieved the government of its burden to prove the most difficult elements of the drug and intent.the jury instructions provided that i f you should find from all of the evidence that mccoy was in possession of the blue duffel bag then you may conclude without further evidence that mccoy knew that the blue duffel bag contained cocaine and marijuana and that he intended to distribute them.app.at.the district court concluded that mccoy was not prejudiced by the jemal stipulation because of the permissive nature of the jury charge.
although these instructions did not jury to find the elements of knowledge and intent,consistent with the stipulation,app.at,they focused the jury on possession of the duffel bag rather than mccoy knowledge and intent.we are not convinced that the permissive nature of the jury instructions conclusively show s that mccoy was not prejudiced.
as a result of the jemal stipulation,the prosecution was left with the relatively simple burden of proving that at some point mccoy was in possession of the blue duffel bag.three witnesses,two of them police officers,testified that mccoy carried the duffel bag from the bus to the sidewalk outside the erie bus station.although mccoy attempted to rebut this testimony through evidence of his physical ailment,which he alleged would have prevented him from carrying the bag,and through impeachment of the government witnesses for bias,the issue of possession vel non amounted to a determination of credibility.faced with overwhelming accounts of multiple witnesses observing mccoy carrying the blue duffel bag,and no witnesses contesting these accounts,the jury could easily have reached its conclusion that the government satisfied its burden with respect to the possession element.however,even if the jury believed that mccoy carried the duffel bag from the bus to the erie station,it would not be dispositive of the key issue of whether mccoy was aware of the contents of the bag.
the knowledge and intent elements presented a far greater burden for the government.mccoy contends,and we agree,that the government evidence against him in this regard,was no different in any meaningful respect than the facts the g overnment had against the other two men grier and mcqueen who were not even indicted.appellant br.at.although mccoy used a fictitious name on his bus ticket,so did grier and mcqueen furthermore,all four tickets were purchased by barnette.grier testified that barnette already had the blue duffel bag packed and prepared when he met barnette at barnette aunt house on the day of the arrest.there was no evidence that mccoy assisted in packing the bag or that he made any statements implying that he knew of its contents.further,grier testified that mcqueen had handled the bag during a stop over in cleveland.all four men had denied possession of the bag during the police questioning.finally,although there was testimony that mccoy and barnette had a prior relationship,it is evident that both grier and mcqueen had a similar,if not more substantial,prior relationship with barnette.grier had called barnette upon escaping from his halfway house and mcqueen had fathered a baby with barnette aunt.
we need not decide on this appeal whether there exists a reasonable probability that the government would have been unable to meet its burden on the elements of knowledge and intent without the jemal stipulation.that is an issue for the district court in the first instance after an evidentiary hearing when it considers whether mccoy suffered prejudice.
we do note that in several cases with facts even more compelling than those in the present case,this court has held that there was insufficient evidence to support the element of knowledge in a drug conspiracy.in united states wexler,cir,the government presented evidence that defendant had driven a lookout car in a drug delivery,had gestured to and spoken to active conspirators during the conspiracy,and was in possession of a stolen cb radio.at.we stated that while there is ample circumstantial evidence from which the jury could have concluded that wexler was involved in a conspiracy.w hat is missing is any evidence that wexler knew that a controlled substance was couched behind the doors of the ryder truck.id.at.accordingly,we reversed the defendant conviction on the ground that it was supported by insubstantial evidence.id.at.
the principle enunciated in wexler,that the government bears the heavy burden of proving the knowledge element of a drug possession charge,is reflected in our subsequent decisions reversing convictions because of insufficient evidence of knowledge.see united states cartwright,cir reversing conviction where armed defendant functioned as lookout for conspirators and had messaging device similar to others arrested united states thomas,cir reversing conviction where defendant arrived at hotel room where drug package was dropped,used key to enter,carried handgun,and contacted drug source by p
