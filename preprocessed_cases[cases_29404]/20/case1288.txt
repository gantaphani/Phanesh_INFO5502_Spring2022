johnny joe martinez,gary etheridge,and napoleon beazley challenge the district court judgment dismissing,for lack of jurisdiction,their complaint alleging claims under.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.due to the exigencies of time,we construe this appeal alternatively as an application for permission to file a successive habeas corpus petition,which we deny.
johnny joe martinez,gary etheridge,and napoleon beazley collectively,the plaintiffs are all prisoners under sentence of death in the state of texas.each of the plaintiffs was convicted of capital murder.each plaintiff has directly appealed his conviction,and has collaterally attacked his conviction by filing petitions seeking a writ of habeas corpus in both state and federal court none of these challenges has been successful.martinez sentence of death is scheduled to be carried out tomorrow,on may.etheridge sentence of death is scheduled to be carried out on june.beazley sentence of death is scheduled to be carried out on may.
on may,the plaintiffs filed the instant action in federal district court against the texas court of criminal appeals,the judges comprising that court,and the director of the institutional division of the texas department of criminal justice collectively,the defendants.the essential theory of the complaint is that the texas court of criminal appeals has violated the plaintiffs rights under the sixth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments by engaging in a policy of knowingly and intentionally appointing incompetent lawyers to represent indigent death row inmates in their state habeas proceedings.specifically,each of the plaintiffs alleges that he had obvious and potentially meritorious claims of constitutional error including,inter alia,claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel prosecutorial misconduct that were not raised in his petition for state habeas relief due to the incompetence of his appointed state habeas counsel.each plaintiff was unsuccessful in his subsequent attempt to secure federal habeas relief,because the federal courts were procedurally barred from considering the constitutional claims omitted from the state habeas petition.see supra note.accordingly,the plaintiffs were never afforded an opportunity to present these claims to any state or federal court.
the plaintiffs allege that texas policy of appointing incompetent state habeas counsel deprived them of their right of meaningful access to the courts,as provided by the fourteenth amendment,as well as their sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.the plaintiffs further contend that these procedural inadequacies render their death sentences unreliable,and thus constitutionally suspect under the eighth amendment.they seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing the defendants from executing them during the pendency of this litigation a permanent injunction directing the defendants to appoint competent state habeas counsel in all texas death penalty cases and a declaratory ruling from this court that federal courts need not apply the procedural bar of to procedural defaults occasioned by incompetence of state habeas counsel if the state does not authorize filing of a successive state habeas application.
the district court dismissed the plaintiffs complaint.relying on this court suggestion that the core issue in determining whether a prisoner must pursue habeas corpus relief rather than a civil rights action is whether the prisoner challenges the fact or duration of his confinement or merely challenges the rules,customs,and procedures affecting conditions of confinement,cook texas dep t of criminal justice transitional planning dep t,cir quoting spina aaron,cir,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs claims in the instant case were properly construed as requests for writs of habeas corpus under.the district court determined that dismissal was thus appropriate because,pursuant to b a,district courts lack jurisdiction to consider second or successive habeas petitions unless this court has granted the petitioners express permission to file such a petition.the plaintiffs timely appealed the district court dismissal of their complaint,requesting that this court enjoin state officials from carrying out any executions until the merits of this litigation are resolved and remand this case to the district court for development of the factual record.we review a district court dismissal of a complaint for lack of jurisdiction de novo.see bazrowx scott,cir.
the plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in construing their action as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.they contend that their action can not be a de facto habeas action because they are not asking the federal courts to set aside their state convictions or sentences,as they would in a habeas action.the plaintiffs maintain that their only goal in pursuing this action is to obtain a forum in which to litigate their sixth,eighth,and fourteenth amendment claims.
the supreme court has determined that state prisoners may not obtain equitable relief under when the federal habeas corpus statute is the exclusive remedial mechanism for obtaining the requested relief.in preiser rodriguez,d,the court considered a action brought by state prisoners alleging that state prison officials had unconstitutionally deprived them of credits.the petitioners sought injunctive relief compelling restoration of the credits,which would entitle them to immediate release from prison.id.at.while the court acknowledged that the petitioners claims fell within the literal language of,id.at,the court determined that the specific language of the federal habeas corpus statute,explicitly and historically designed to provide the means for a state prisoner to attack the validity of his confinement,must be understood to be the exclusive remedy available in a situation like this where it so clearly applies.id.at.the court accordingly held that habeas corpus is the exclusive remedy for state prisoners seeking immediate release or speedier release from prison.id.at.the court reasoned that to hold otherwise would permit prisoners to circumvent the exhaustion requirement of b,thus undermining the considerations of comity that underlie this exhaustion requirement.id.at.
the court subsequently extended this holding to claims challenging method of execution.in gomez united states district court for the northern district of california,d,the court considered a claim brought by a capital offender alleging that the state of california method of execution,lethal gas was cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.the court determined that the suit was an obvious attempt to avoid the application of the court prior holding in mccleskey zant,d,barring assertion of claims in subsequent habeas petitions that could have been raised in prior habeas petitions.gomez,at.thus,the court implicitly determined that the petitioner challenge to his method of execution was properly considered a de facto habeas challenge rather than a action 
the court also clarified its preiser holding in edwards balisok,d.in edwards,an inmate challenged the procedures used by state prison officials in his disciplinary hearing,alleging that these procedures violated his fourteenth amendment due process rights.he requested declaratory relief and monetary damages he did not,however,request restoration of his credits.the supreme court found that habeas corpus was the exclusive remedy for this claim because the principal procedural defect complained of by the petitioners,deceit and bias on the part of the decisionmaker would,if established,necessarily imply the invalidity of the deprivation of his credits,and,thus,necessarily imply a need for immediate or speedier release from prison.id.at.however,in considering the petitioner related due process claim for prospective injunctive relief requiring state prison officials to witness statements in disciplinary proceedings,the edwards court clearly held open the possibility that a prisoners complaint challenging the procedures of a disciplinary proceeding could be maintaine
