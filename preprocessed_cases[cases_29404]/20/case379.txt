yick man mui appeals from judge johnson denial of his petition for habeas corpus brought pursuant to,and denial of his motion under federal rule of civil procedure b to reopen that decision.on direct appeal from his conviction,mui raised various instances of alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel.his section motion raised yet more ineffective assistance claims.the district court held that the new ineffective assistance claims were procedurally barred because appellant had not provided reasons for failing to raise the claims on direct appeal and had not shown any resulting prejudice or actual innocence.
we hold that a defendant who raises on direct appeal ineffective assistance claims based on the strategies,actions,or inactions of counsel that can be,and are,adjudicated on the merits on the trial record,is precluded from raising new or repetitive claims based on the same strategies,actions,or inactions in a section proceeding.however,such a defendant is not precluded from raising new ineffective assistance claims based on different strategies,actions,or inactions of counsel in a subsequent section proceeding.
we vacate the district court order and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
a jury convicted appellant of committing violent crimes in aid of racketeering,in violation of a.prior to sentencing,appellant,represented by new counsel,moved unsuccessfully for a new trial in part on the ground that trial counsel had provided unconstitutionally ineffective assistance.in particular,appellant attacked trial counsel i concession of petitioner guilt in counsel opening statement ii failure to present a planned for defense iii failure to call petitioner as a witness iv failure to the government key cooperating witness and v misuse of evidence favorable to petitioner.
at appellant sentencing hearing,the district court denied his motion for new trial.the court ruled that appellant failed to show either that trial counsel performance fell below objectively reasonable standards or that appellant had a reasonable probability of a different result but for counsel errors.see strickland washington,d.the district court then sentenced appellant to life imprisonment followed by a consecutive sentence on firearms charges.
on direct appeal,appellant again raised ineffective assistance claims predicated on the same facts as those raised in his motion for new trial,but with two additional allegations,that trial counsel failed to object to an erroneous jury charge and failed to file certain motions.we affirmed appellant conviction in a summary order that rejected on the merits appellant claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.united states mui,wl table cir.
thereafter,appellant filed the present section proceeding,claiming various instances of ineffective assistance of both trial and appellate counsel in his section motion,appellant again raised trial counsel concession in the opening statement,counsel failure to present an agreed upon defense,and counsel failure to file certain motions.all of these claims were disposed of on direct appeal.however,appellant also raised a host of other allegations of ineffective assistance not raised on direct appeal.specifically,appellant claimed for the first time that i trial and appellate counsel failed to communicate with him effectively due to his cantonese language ii he had difficulty understanding any of the proceedings due to the trial court interpreter mandarin accent iii trial counsel did not examine certain evidence or file motions iv trial counsel made false assertions in his opening statement v trial counsel failed to investigate any defense witnesses vi trial counsel failed to raise jurisdictional challenges and vii trial counsel failed to file motions to preserve or disclose exculpatory evidence.
the district court denied appellant motion.it ruled that appellant was procedurally barred from raising ineffective trial counsel claims that he had raised on direct appeal.as for the ineffective assistance claims raised for the first time in the section motion,the court concluded that these claims were also barred because appellant did not show cause for not raising the claims on direct appeal or any prejudice resulting therefrom,and that appellant could not show factual innocence that would otherwise create an exception to the procedural default rule.mui united states,cv,wl at,citing bousley united states,d.
on february,appellant,proceeding pro se,filed a motion to reconsider under federal rule of civil procedure b,claiming,among other things,that he was entitled to relief under massaro united states,d.he asserted that massaro constituted an i ntervening change in law that required reconsideration of his petition.the district court held that massaro was not an intervening change in law and that its february,order was consistent with massaro.
appellant then sought a certificate of appealability,which we granted on the issue of whether appellant ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims were procedurally barred in light of massaro or were actually raised and resolved on direct appeal.
discussion 
we review a district court findings of fact for clear error,and its denial of a section petition de novo.rega united states,cir.
prisoners may seek collateral review of a federal conviction or sentence that was imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states.a.because collateral challenges are in tension with society strong interest in the finality of criminal convictions,the courts have established rules that make it more difficult for a defendant to upset a conviction by collateral,as opposed to direct,attack.ciak united states,cir abrogated on other grounds by mickens taylor,d.
in the case of a collateral challenge based on constitutional claims,two separate rules regarding claim preclusion based on a prior adjudication apply.first,the mandate rule bars of issues already decided on direct appeal.burrell united states,cir united states minicone,cir.the mandate rule prevents in the district court not only of matters expressly decided by the appellate court,but also precludes of issues impliedly resolved by the appellate court mandate.see united states ben zvi,cir.to determine whether an issue may be reconsidered on remand,a district court should look to both the specific dictates of the remand order as well as the broader spirit of the mandate.id.internal quotation marks omitted.of course,the law of the case rule governs of an issue at the appellate level.
in the context of section proceedings involving claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,we have applied the mandate rule to bar claims raised and resolved on direct appeal.see,united states pitcher,cir united states,cir douglas united states,cir superseded by statute on other grounds schwamborn united states,d.we have also applied the mandate rule to bar ineffective assistance claims in a section proceeding when the factual predicates of those claims,while not explicitly raised on direct appeal,were nonetheless impliedly rejected by the appellate court mandate.see pitcher,at rejecting petitioner section ineffective assistance claims because they were premised on the same facts and rest on the same legal ground as the argument made on direct appeal.
a second rule that applies in the section context prevents claims that could have been brought on direct appeal from being raised on collateral review absent cause and prejudice.see marone united states,cir in order to raise a claim that could have been raised on direct appeal,a petitioner must show cause for failing to raise the claim at the appropriate time and prejudice from the alleged error.campino united states,cir f ailure to raise a claim on direct appeal is itself a default of normal appellate procedure,which a defendant can overcome only by showing cause and prejudice.
however,where as here,a petitioner collateral challenge includes claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,there is an important exception to the procedural default rule,which requires a brief discussion of recent legal history.in united states,cir abrogated by massaro united states
