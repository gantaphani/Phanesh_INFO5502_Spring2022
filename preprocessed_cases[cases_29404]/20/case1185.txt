movant yokamon laneal hearn is a state prisoner on death row in texas.he moves pursuant to b a for an order authorizing the filing and consideration of a second petition for writ of habeas corpus.hearn application is based on the new rule of constitutional law set forth in atkins virginia,d.he claims he is ineligible for execution under atkins because he is mentally retarded.id.
this court may allow the filing of a second habeas application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of this subsection.b c.hearn must make a prima facie showing that his claim has not previously been presented in a prior application to this court,his claim relies on a decision that stated a new,retroactively applicable rule of constitutional law that was previously unavailable to him,and that he is mentally retarded.in re johnson,cir.texas concedes that hearn satisfies the first two requirements,that is,his atkins claim was not previously presented in any prior application to this court,and atkins represents a new,retroactively applicable rule of constitutional law that was previously unavailable.the issue before this court is whether hearn has made a prima facie showing that he is mentally retarded.
a prima facie showing of mental retardation is simply a sufficient showing of possible merit to warrant a fuller exploration by the district court.id.quoting in re morris,cir.mental retardation is a disability characterized by three criteria significant limitation in intellectual functioning,significant limitation in adaptive behavior and functioning,and onset of these limitations before the age of.american association on mental retardation aamr,mental retardation definition,classification,and systems of supports ed.
hearn motion includes expert reports from pablo stewart,mary alice conroy,and james patton.stewart report does not address the question of whether hearn is mentally retarded.rather,it assesses hearn for fetal alcohol syndrome fas.stewart concludes that hearn suffers from fas and further notes that o ne of the frequently occurring consequences of fas is mental retardation.indeed,fas is the most case of mental retardation.stewart report offers an explanation for the cause of hearn alleged mental retardation it neither diagnoses nor excludes mental retardation.
conroy psychological evaluation addresses the first prong of the mental retardation diagnosis,that is,it was conducted in order to obtain an assessment of hearn general intellectual functioning.conroy makes no conclusions regarding whether hearn is mentally retarded her findings relate only to hearn limitations in intellectual functioning.
the third expert,patton,interprets conroy findings and determines that hearn has significant limitations in intellectual functioning.based on testing he administered,patton further opines that hearn has significant limitations in adaptive behavior and functioning.finally,patton determines that the onset of these limitations occurred before hearn was.patton concludes in summary,it is my professional opinion,based on the materials reviewed,the test results recently obtained,and the interviews with key respondents,that hearn meets the criteria of mental retardation,as defined by the american association of mental retardation.
texas argues that patton opinion is facially invalid and can not constitute a prima facie showing of mental retardation because patton is not a licensed psychologist and hearn presents no proof that patton is certified by texas to diagnose mental retardation.in patton assessment of mental retardation,he summarized his numerous qualifications and significant experience.based on these qualifications,we decline to conclude that patton is not qualified to assess and diagnose mental retardation for the purposes of hearn prima facie showing.
we reject the dissent argument that we can not consider patton opinion because he does not meet the texas health and safety code standard for those who may determine mental retardation.this standard,found in texas persons with mental retardation act pmra,provides that mental retardation may be diagnosed only by a physician or psychologist licensed in this state or certified by the texas department of mental health and mental retardation.health safety code ann.enacted before atkins.this standard,however,has not been made applicable to atkins proceedings.
the supreme court in atkins left to the states the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon its execution of sentences.ex parte briseno,quoting atkins,at.in briseno,the texas court of criminal appeals held that until the texas legislature provides a statutory definition of mental retardation,it will use the definition of mental retardation promulgated by the aamr and mirrored by subsection of the pmra when addressing atkins claims.id.at.neither the aamr definition nor subsection of the pmra addresses who is qualified to render an opinion on whether a particular person is mentally retarded.briseno neither explicitly nor implicitly endorses subsection of the pmra,upon which the dissent relies to argue for patton exclusion indeed,briseno itself relied upon lay opinion to determine retardation.id.at.
the dissent surmises that the majority is saying that even if patton is unqualified under texas law to testify as an expert,he can state his opinions as a lay witness.the dissent condemns this as an astonishing notion that would eviscerate the reasonable restrictions of federal rule of evidence.we have no such notion.this criticism evinces a fundamental misunderstanding of both the reasoning in briseno and the majority argument.
pointing to briseno adoption of the aamr and standards,the dissent concludes that it follows logically that if the state of texas,through its highest criminal court,has decided to use its statutory definition of mental retardation in atkins proceedings,it would be a no brainer that the statutory definition of who is qualified to opine as to mental retardation would also apply.this conclusion,however,is belied by briseno itself.in briseno,the court observed that 
a lthough experts may offer insightful opinions on the question of whether a particular person meets the psychological diagnostic criteria for mental retardation,the ultimate issue of whether this person is,in fact,mentally retarded for purposes of the eighth amendment ban on excessive punishment is one for the finder of fact,based upon all of the evidence and determinations of credibility.
id.at emphasis added.the court catalogued a number of evidentiary factors that a finder of fact may consider when determining whether an defendant is mentally retarded,including whether family,friends,teachers,employers and authorities believed him to be mentally retarded during the developmental stage,whether he responds coherently,rationally,and on point to oral or written questions,and whether his conduct in response to external stimuli is rational and appropriate.id.at.
the court then affirmed the lower court determination that the applicant was not mentally retarded.in doing so,the court relied in part on the lay testimony of texas department of criminal justice officers regarding the applicant behavior while in jail.id.at in sum,we conclude that,while there is expert opinion testimony in this record that would support a finding of mental retardation,there is also ample evidence,including expert and lay opinion testimony,as well as written records,to support the trial court finding.if the texas court of criminal appeals was willing to ground its atkins determination in part on the testimony of lay witnesses,it could a pure matter of tacitly adopted the standard in as a litmus test for qualification to opine on an applicant mental condition 
the purpose of the pmra is to provide social services to and guarantee rights of persons with mental retardation.the pmra,by its own terms,is irrelevant to the application of atkins.for eighth amendment purposes,it neither defines mental retardation who may diagnose mental retardation.laying aside whether,or how much,texas may,in implementing atkins,restrict expert testimony according to the standards of subsection of the pmra or other standards,there is no indication that it has done so.reliance on subsection of the pmra to exclude patton testimony is therefore misplaced this court relies on patton report for the limited purpose of assessing whether hearn has made a prima facie case of mental is,whether he has raised questions of possible merit which justify further exploration below 
texas further argues that patton opinion on adaptive functioning improperly relies upon the adaptive behavior assessment edition.hearn responds that patton correctly used and relied upon the in making his determination.we will not address this factual dispute over patton methods and findings.we hold only that hearn,through patton report and its incorporation of the reports of stewart and conroy,has put forth minimally sufficient evidence to make a prima facie case that he may be a person with mental retardation.
in accordance with the supreme court mandate in atkins,because there is sufficient,albeit slight merit in hearn motion to warrant further exploration by the district court,it is hereby ordered that hearn motion for permission to file a successive petition for writ of habeas corpus is granted.
largely for the reasons i expressed in dissenting from the opinion appointing counsel and staying execution,see in re hearn,cir smith,dissenting,i continue to disagree with the panel majority handling of this matter,which has been prolonged by misapplication of the standards set by congress and the applicable caselaw this is a desperate attempt to salvage something from nothing,to manufacture an claim of retardation to stave off execution.every member of this panel any protestations to the contrary surely knows well that hearn is not retarded,and the district court eventually will so find,yet this minuet is played again and again to satisfy fanciful notions of procedural nicety 
in its most recent stanza,the song includes hearn obvious inability to find an expert qualified under state law anywhere in the state of texas who is willing to say that he is retarded.two of the three experts he presents after ample time and funds to find them indeed appear to be qualified under texas law,but both decline to opine that hearn is retarded.the panel majority evades this barrier by a bizarre parsing of state law and of state and federal caselaw,to find a way to allow hearn third but unauthorized expert,professor patton,to testify.
we are faced today with the same quandry discussed in in re morris,cir per curiam.there,in addressing another request to file a successive habeas corpus petition,this court discussed the conflicting evidence one judge acknowledged that he was confessedly dubitante on whether there was enough merit to warrant further exploration by the district court.id.at higginbotham,concurring.to the extent we are dubitante here,we should follow the lead of the panel that issued binding fifth circuit authority in in re johnson,cir per curiam.in evaluating a request to file a successive habeas petition on an atkins claim,the johnson panel was faced with facts strikingly similar to those presented by hearn.much like hearn,petitioner johnson presented equivocal letters from a psychologist expressing the belief that his verbal intelligence level might be as low as.johnson presented a seventh grade transcript showing failure in all his academic courses.the panel decided that the two letters and seventh grade transcript offered by johnson are simply insufficient to suggest that further development of his claim has any likelihood of success under the atkins criteria.id.
hearn and perhaps the panel majority of course would counter that hearn has presented the opinion of an expert who says he is retarded,and that that important evidence distinguishes this case from johnson.but that could not possibly be so unless hearn new affiant is qualified to speak to mental retardation under texas law.it is at this point that the panel majority most seriously misses the mark.
hearn relies almost exclusively on the assessment of a witness,professor patton,who has an degree and who is as an educational consultant and author in the field of special education and disabilities and has served as a mental retardation specialist.one of the many problems with hearn proffer,however,is that texas law provides that mental retardation may only be determined by a physician or psychologist licensed in this state or certified by the texas department of mental health and mental retardation to make a determination of retardation.that is the specific requirement of section of the texas health and safety code.it is undisputed that patton is neither a physician nor a psychologist,in texas or elsewhere.
the panel majority excuse for considering patton opinion is that the texas health and safety code standard for those who may determine mental retardation has not been made applicable to atkins proceedings.this reasoning is so shabby as to seem contrived,though i am sure that,instead,it is presented in good faith.
both parties in this case,and all three judges on this panel,agree that texas has not yet formally adopted procedures for handling claims of mental retardation in the wake of atkins.this vacuum has been dealt with successfully,however,by the texas courts.recently in in re briseno,texas highest criminal court recounted that in atkins the supreme court left to the individual states the substantive and procedural mechanisms to implement that decision.id.at.the texas legislature has not yet enacted legislation to carry out the atkins mandate.id.accordingly,the court of criminal appeals recognized that it must act to provide the bench and bar with temporary judicial guidelines in addressing atkins claims.id.footnote omitted.
the court of criminal appeals then proceeded to set out judicial standards for courts considering atkins claims.id.it noted that the texas legislature had passed,but the governor had vetoed,legislation prohibiting execution of the mentally retarded that adopted the definition of mental retardation contained in of the health and safety code.the court of criminal appeals also observed that it previously had employed the definition from.id.citing ex parte tennard.the court reasonably concluded that u ntil the texas legislature provides an alternate statutory definition of mental retardation for use in capital sentencing,we will follow the american association on mental retardation or section criteria in addressing atkins mental retardation claims.id.at.only a few days ago,this court recognized that indeed in briseno the court of criminal appeals has adopted the texas health and safety code section as an alternative standard for a petitioner to show his mental retardation.morris dretke,cir.
it follows logically that if the state of texas,through its highest criminal court,has decided to use its statutory definition of mental retardation in atkins proceedings,it would be a no brainer that the statutory definition of who is qualified to opine as to mental retardation would also apply.in fact,reaching a contrary conclusion is unreasonable to assume that the legislature or court of criminal appeals would apply the one provision but not the other.
an examination of the two subsections of section reveals why this is so.subsection,which the panel majority blesses in today missive,states that mental retardation means significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning that is concurrent with deficits in adaptive behavior and originates during the development period.subsection of the same statute,which the panel majority dismisses as not properly ensconced as a texas atkins standard,reads,almost identically,as follows person with mental retardation means a person determined by a physician or psychologist licensed in this state or certified by the department to have subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive behavior.
in fact,it is difficult to imagine how mental retardation under subsection can be determined accurately without some sort of standard for how its various components subaverage gene
