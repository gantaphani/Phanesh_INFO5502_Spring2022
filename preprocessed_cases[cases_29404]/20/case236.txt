we first give a brief summary of the circumstances of the offense and some pretrial history.we then recount the facts relevant to the request for a continuance and the ineffective assistance of counsel claims.
a.the offense and some pretrial history 
at about on october,two police officers for the city of lynn received a radio report of a disturbance at cottage street.upon arrival,the residents of the first floor apartment let the officers into the building and directed them upstairs.the officers proceeded to the second floor,which was empty and unlit,where they heard footsteps coming from the third floor.officer griffin proceeded to the third floor apartment and knocked on the door,identifying himself as policia.officer hogan went up the back stairs to the third floor,where he heard the back door unlock and saw castillo begin to emerge from the doorway.castillo then turned and went back into the apartment.officer hogan entered through the back door,saw a second man in the apartment bathroom holding a plastic bag containing a white substance,and heard the toilet flushing.the officer then saw a third man in the kitchen making a throwing gesture towards the window.on the ground beneath the kitchen window,the police later recovered two clear plastic bags containing approximately grams of cocaine.castillo and a fourth man were standing next to the kitchen table,on which officer hogan observed a partially open brown paper bag containing several plastic sandwich bags filled with a white powder,and two digital scales.castillo was never seen in physical custody of any controlled substance.the officers arrested castillo and brought him to the police station,where officers found a beeper and in cash on his person.
on december,a massachusetts grand jury indicted castillo for trafficking in grams or more of cocaine,and conspiracy to violate the controlled substances act.laws ann.ch.at castillo arraignment on january,attorney kirk bransfield was appointed to represent him.after deciding a variety of pretrial motions and after a number of continuances,the trial court scheduled the beginning of trial for december,castillo failed to appear on december,and an arrest warrant issued.approximately six months later,castillo was arrested at a new york airport and remanded to massachusetts for trial.trial was scheduled to begin on september.
attorney fernandez appearance 
on august,christine fernandez,an attorney with the new york law firm of aranda guttlein,filed a motion to appear pro hac vice in this matter.on the same day,attorney andres aranda,a partner of the aranda guttlein law firm,also moved to appear pro hac vice but his motion was not docketed or acted upon by the court.in an affidavit filed in support of her motion,fernandez stated that she had been a member in good standing of the new york bar since and that she specialize d in criminal and federal law.on september,fernandez appeared in person before a superior court judge,who allowed the motion to appear pro hac vice on the express condition that the trial date of september,remain the scheduled trial date and that the allowance of this motion not delay the trial.on that same day,fernandez filed a notice of appearance,and attorney bransfield,the counsel,withdrew.
on september,attorney jorge guttlein guttlein,another partner of the aranda guttlein law firm,sent a letter to the court together with an undated motion to appear pro hac vice.in the letter,guttlein acknowledged that castillo trial was scheduled for september,but requested that trial be continued until october because he had a scheduling conflict.the trial court treated this letter as a motion for a continuance,which it denied.castillo case was subsequently transferred from essex superior court to lawrence superior court for trial on september.guttlein appeared before the lawrence superior court on september,and his motion to appear pro hac vice was allowed that day.castillo case was not called for trial that day but was continued to the next morning.
fernandez appeared in court the next morning and informed the judge that guttlein had been called back to new york late yesterday afternoon because his wife was ill.fernandez stated that she was appearing on castillo behalf and that she had reviewed all the pretrial motions and was prepared to argue them,but that she had a series of requests regarding her late entry into the case this morning.she sought a further delay in the trial 
i arrived in massachusetts last night at about four because the roads were awful with the rain and everything else.i have had very little opportunity to review this file.i understand that we scheduled to go forward,and i prepared to at least go forward with jury selection.however,i would ask your honor please not to go forward with any testimony until i had an opportunity to further review this file.
the trial judge responded that fernandez motion to appear was allowed several weeks ago with the specific condition that it not delay the trial.fernandez argued that at the time she was admitted to appear pro hac vice,she was not under the impression that she would be trying this case since guttlein has been slotted to try this case.the judge replied 
y our firm was on notice that whoever was going to try this case was going to be prepared for it.and the court does look behind appearances when you have two or three people,all of whom are on there.everyone is presumed to be ready,willing and able to try the case.
however,the judge stated that he did not know how far they would get that day,although it seemed likely they would get through impanelment and opening statements.he deferred ruling on the request to delay any testimony until later in the day.after impanelment and opening statements,the judge recessed the proceedings for an hour and a half,stating that the commonwealth would call its first witness following the recess and fernandez would be called on to the witness.although this statement implicitly denied the request for a delay of testimony,fernandez did not voice any further objections to the schedule.
castillo trial strategy 
castillo was charged with trafficking in a controlled substance,an offense with the following elements knowing or intentional possession of a controlled substance,with the specific intent to distribute the controlled substance,and if the controlled substance is cocaine as defined in.laws.ann.ch,the controlled substance has a net weight of fourteen grams or more.laws ann.ch,b.the statute sets out escalating penalties for amounts in excess of the fourteen grams necessary for conviction.specifically,the statute sets a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for grams or more but less than grams,and a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years for grams or more.laws ann.ch.two lesser included offenses of trafficking are possession with intent to distribute and simple possession.to gain a trafficking conviction rather than the lesser offense of possession with intent to distribute,the prosecution must establish possession with intent to distribute a minimum weight of fourteen grams of cocaine.simple possession is merely knowing or intentional possession of a controlled is no intent to distribute or minimum weight requirement.laws ann.ch.the sentence for simple possession is imprisonment for not more than one year.
castillo trial strategy was to win a not guilty verdict by defeating the prosecution proof of the first element of the trafficking offense knowing or intentional possession of a controlled substance.thus,attorney fernandez did not contest that the substance in question found at the apartment was cocaine and that the amount of the substance was grams or more.instead,she argued that castillo did not know there were any drugs in the apartment or that the other people in the apartment were engaged in drug dealing.castillo was merely present in someone else apartment where drugs happened to be found.
the commonwealth opened its case by calling officer hogan to the stand,who testified to the activities he witnessed in the apartment.in accordance with her trial strategy,fernandez established through her of officer hogan that he did not see castillo handle any of the drugs and that in order to be able to see the drugs inside the bag on the kitchen table,a person had to be standing over the bag.she further established that if castillo had been sitting at the kitchen table he would not have been able to see into the bag that was on the table.
the following morning,the commonwealth called officer griffin,who testified in a manner similar to officer hogan about the events leading to castillo arrest and added that at the police station a beeper and in cash were recovered from castillo person.on,fernandez established that not all beepers are used to conduct drug transactions and that no drugs were ever found in castillo possession.the commonwealth also called lieutenant stevens who testified generally about the drug trade in lynn at the time of castillo arrest.
at the conclusion of the commonwealth case,fernandez moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the commonwealth evidence established only castillo mere presence in an apartment where narcotics were seized and that this was insufficient to establish guilt under massachusetts law.the judge denied the motion.fernandez then called castillo to the stand to explain the circumstances of his presence in lynn and to offer his account of what transpired on the night of his arrest.castillo testified that he was a resident of the bronx,new york,where he lived with his wife and daughter.he worked in manhattan delivering clothes for a weekly income of to.he had come to lynn to help his former locate his missing son,and the cash he brought with him was to buy clothes and gifts for his son.while in lynn he met rodriguez,a resident of the apartment,at a telephone place a business providing inexpensive long distance telephone service as an alternative to pay phones,where they spoke on several occasions.on october,rodriguez invited castillo to his apartment at cottage street.after being at the apartment for ten or fifteen minutes,castillo testified that he got up to leave and was confronted by a police officer as he attempted to exit the back door.castillo denied having any knowledge of any drugs in the apartment prior to the arrival of the police officers.
after the examination of witnesses,the court reviewed the jury charge.fernandez rejected an instruction on simple possession offered by the trial judge.although she initially requested a joint venture instruction fernandez immediately objected to the judge decision to offer such an instruction when she fully comprehended the significance of it.after receiving instructions from the judge,the jury returned a verdict that castillo was guilty of trafficking in grams or more of cocaine.
the standard of review for this habeas corpus petition is set forth in the aedpa statute.on the grounds pertinent to this case,a federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner if it finds,inter alia,that the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law d.this section defines two categories of cases in which a state prisoner may obtain federal habeas relief with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court.williams taylor,d.under the contrary to prong,a federal court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.id.at.under the unreasonable application prong,a federal court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.in the latter case,the state court determination must be unreasonable,not simply incorrect,and unreasonableness is an objective standard.id.at.if it is a close question whether the state decision is in error,then the state decision can not be an unreasonable application.mccambridge hall,cir en banc.
denial of request for a continuance 
castillo contends that the trial court denial of a continuance was so arbitrary as to violate due process.in his challenge to the state court failure to grant his motion for a new trial on this basis,he claims that this denial constituted an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court because it 
gave no weight to counsel lack of preparation and experience,drew an improper presumption that counsel was ready willing and able to try the case from the fact of her appearance in the face of her representation to the contrary,and misrepresented the roles of the various members of the law firm in a way that is misleading and beside the point.
we disagree.
the only supreme court precedent that castillo identifies for purposes of the unreasonable application analysis is ungar sarafite,d.the supreme court held that a trial judge decision not to grant the defendant in a contempt hearing a continuance did not offend the requirements of due process.
the matter of continuance is traditionally within the discretion of the trial judge,and it is not every denial of a request for more time that violates due process even if the party fails to offer evidence or is compelled to defend without counsel.contrariwise,a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay can render the right to defend with counsel an empty formality.
id.internal citations omitted.the court added that t here are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process.id.instead,reviewing courts must examine the circumstances present in every case,particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied.id.however,n ot every restriction on counsel time or opportunity to investigate or to consult with his client or otherwise to prepare for trial violates a defendant sixth amendment right to counsel.morris slappy,d.
we recently applied ungar inquiry to a denial of a continuance,holding that a reviewing court must look at the reasons contemporaneously presented in support of the request for the continuance.we also identified a number of relevant factors 
the amount of time needed for effective preparation,the amount of time actually available for preparation,the amount of time previously available for preparation and how assiduously the movant used that time,the extent to which the movant has contributed to his perceived predicament,the complexity of the case,the availability of assistance from other sources,the probable utility of a continuance,the extent of inconvenience to others should a continuance ensue,and the likelihood of an injustice or unfair prejudice attributable to the denial of a continuance.
united states saccoccia,cir.
due to the summary nature of the appeals court affirmance,our review of the state courts application of federal law to the request for a continuance requires us to review the decision of the trial court denying castillo motion for a new trial.in its denial of castillo motion for a new trial,the trial court noted that the trial originally had been scheduled for september,that fernandez had presented a motion to appear pro hac vice and had made a corresponding appearance almost two months before the scheduled trial date,and that,in allowing the motion,the court put fernandez on notice that the impending trial would not be delayed.thus,counsel had ample time to prepare.even in pressing her last minute request for a brief continuance,fernandez made no representations to the trial judge that she had never before tried a case and that her inexperience might make it difficult for her to try this case under the circumstances.furthermore,in its order denying castillo motion for a new trial,the trial court found that counsel performance during the trial did not reflect that of an attorney noticeably lacking in either experience or competence sufficient to meet constitutional standards.commonwealth castillo,cr,slip op.at.
in submitting her motion to appear,fernandez represented to the court that she was ready to try the case.moreover,that motion was allowed on the express condition that the trial date remain as scheduled and the trial not be delayed.at no time did fernandez indicate to the judge that this was her first trial.to the contrary,in her motion to appear,fernandez explicitly stated i specialize in criminal and federal law.in light of the information before the trial judge at the time he made his decision and the great deal of latitude necessarily afforded judges in scheduling trials,morris,at,the decision not to grant castillo a new trial on the basis of the denial of his request for a continuance was not an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
in rejecting castillo motion for a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel,the trial court found that attorney fernandez performance was not measurably below that of an ordinarily fallible lawyer and defense counsel theory of the case was not manifestly unreasonable.commonwealth castillo,cr,slip op.at.castillo argues that the manifestly unreasonable standard that the trial court applied in assessing trial counsel tactical judgment is contrary to the standard the supreme court prescribed in strickland.castillo also argues that the state court evaluation of fernandez performance was an unreasonable application of strickland.after a brief explanation of the strickland standard,we explain our reasons for rejecting these arguments on the merits.
the strickland standard 
in strickland washington,the supreme court set forth the controlling principles for deciding ineffective assistance of counsel claims.under these principles,a defendant alleging ineffective assistance of counsel must establish two elements 
first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.
strickland,at.in addressing the first element,judicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential.id.at.a reviewing court must leave ample room for variations in professional judgment,ouber guarino,cir citing strickland,at,and every effort must be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.id.at.only if,in light of all the circumstances,the identified acts or omissions of counsel were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,can a finding of deficient performance ensue.id.at.
even if counsel performance is constitutionally deficient,the second element of the strickland standard requires the petitioner to demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.while such prejudice may be presumed in a few limited circumstances,such cases are the exception.see bell cone,d.generally,the petitioner must carry the devoir of persuasion and prove that he was prejudiced,that his attorney parlous conduct may have altered the outcome of the case.ouber,at.however,there is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to approach the inquiry in order or even to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.strickland,at.hence we address primarily the performance component of the strickland standard.
contrary to strickland 
in evaluating castillo ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the state court used the following standard 
castillo must demonstrate that defense counsel performance fell measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer and that such inadequacies likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available defense.commonwealth saferian.counsel tactical judgment must be manifestly unreasonable to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.commonwealth white.
commonwealth castillo,cr,slip op.at.in his brief on appeal castillo argues that this manifestly unreasonable standard is contrary to the federal standard set forth in strickland.ordinarily,we would not address this argument,as it was not raised before the district court in either castillo original habeas petition or in his application for a certificate of appealability.malave carney,cir it is a bedrock rule of appellate practice that matters not raised in the district court can not be hawked for the first time on appeal.see kramer kemna,cir in an appeal from a denial of a writ of habeas corpus,the court declined to consider issues not raised before the district court,holding that the f ailure to give the district court a first opportunity to decide the merits of an argument constitutes a waiver of that argument.yohey collins,cir same depree thomas,cir same.
however,an appellate court has discretion,in an exceptional case,to reach issues that were not raised below.united states la guardia,cir united states krynicki,cir.we have found the exercise of such discretion to be appropriate where the appellant challenge raises an issue of constitutional magnitude which,if meritorious,could substantially affect the appellant,and future defendants la guardia,at see ti federal credit union delbonis,cir c ases involving important constitutional or governmental issues may be exceptional and,as such,there should be a full treatment of all legal issues involved,whether squarely introduced by the parties or not.castillo argument that the state court manifestly unreasonable standard is contrary to strickland raises an important question of law that can be resolved on the existing record and that is almost certain to be presented in identical terms in other cases.la guardia,at.the issue has been fully briefed on this appeal and was covered exhaustively at oral argument.if this constitutional claim were otherwise meritorious,failure to reach it because of a procedural default could result in a miscarriage of justice.see id.therefore,we address the merits of castillo claim.
in evaluating whether castillo was denied effective assistance of counsel,the trial court differentiated between allegations concerning the quality of counsel performance and those concerning the reasonableness of her tactical judgments.commonwealth castillo,cr,slip op.at.the trial court cited commonwealth saferian,for the proposition that castillo was required to demonstrate that attorney fernandez performance fell measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.it concluded that castillo failed to meet this burden.
castillo does not contest the trial court use of the performance standard articulated by the massachusetts supreme court in saferian,which we have described as the functional equivalent of strickland.ouber guarino,cir.rather,castillo argues that the trial court applied to counsel tactical judgments a standard that was contrary to strickland for the reasons set forth below,we are not persuaded.
in its use of the phrase manifestly unreasonable,the trial court cited commonwealth white,which in turn cited commonwealth adams,although most cases involving a claim of ineffective counsel concern counsel lack of preparation,there may be instances where the judgment of fully informed counsel may be so manifestly unreasonable as to be unprotected by the labels of trial strategy or trial tactics.in white,the massachusetts supreme judicial court quoted saferian standard for evaluating a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,and then added 
in cases where tactical or strategic decisions of defendant counsel are at issue,we conduct our review with some deference to avoid characterizing as unreasonable a defense that was merely unsuccessful.see commonwealth rondeau.see also strickland washington,d.rather than merely unreasonable,we require that challenged tactical judgments must be manifestly unreasonable.commonwealth adams.
white,at.thus,in support of the manifestly unreasonable language,the trial court cited to white,which relied heavily on both saferian and strickland.this manifestly unreasonable standard is not contrary to the standard set forth in strickland.
in strickland,the supreme court held that the proper standard for attorney performance is that of reasonably effective assistance,and that w hen a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel assistance,the defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.strickland,at.more specific guidelines are not appropriate the proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.id.at.recently,in williams taylor,justice clarified what it means for a state court decision to be contrary to clearly established federal law 
the word contrary is commonly understood to mean diametrically different,opposite in character or nature,or mutually opposed.the text of d therefore suggests that the state court decision must be substantially different from the relevant precedent of this court take,for example,our decision in strickland washington,d.if a state court were to reject a prisoner claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the grounds that the prisoner had not established by a preponderance of the evidence that the result of his criminal proceeding would have been different,that decision would be diametrically different,opposite in character or nature,and mutually opposed to our clearly established precedent because we held in strickland that the prisoner need only demonstrate a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.
williams taylor,d.by this example,a state court decision imposing a heavier burden on a defendant endeavoring to make an ineffective assistance claim than that set forth in strickland is contrary to strickland.
however,strickland also counsels that in evaluating the reasonableness of counsel tactical or strategic choices,courts must apply a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgments.in this context,the supreme court in strickland cited with approval the approach to strategic of the fifth circuit court of appeals,which allowed challenges when the choice was so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have made it.phoenix matesanz,cir quoting washington strickland,cir.in addition to the first and fifth circuits,other circuits have applied this patently unreasonable formulation to tactical judgments.see,bullock carver,cir dorsey chapman,cir,cert.denied,d the minor variation in phraseology between patently and manifestly does not render the massachusetts standard contrary to federal law.see ouber,at.as the supreme court in strickland implicitly affirmed the lower court patently unreasonable formulation in the context of tactical,the standard employed by the trial court in evaluating castillo ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not diametrically different,opposite in character or nature,or mutually opposed to strickland.
unreasonable application of strickland 
in his habeas petition to the district court,and now on appeal,castillo argues that the trial court resolution of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.castillo complaints fall into two broad categories.under the first,castillo alleges that fernandez failure to know the law resulted in the following errors stipulating that the substance found in the apartment was cocaine and that the total amount of cocaine exceeded grams rejecting jury instructions on the lesser included offenses of simple possession and possession with intent to distribute and requesting a harmful joint venture jury instruction.under the second,castillo alleges that fernandez failure to know the facts caused her to call castillo to the stand after inadequate preparation and fail to call two witnesses mercado and dominguez.
the trial court viewed castillo allegations that counsel was and unqualified as mere quarterbacking.commonwealth castillo,cr,slip op.at.the trial court found that fernandez performance was not measurably below that of an ordinarily fallible lawyer.id.at.the court cited as evidence of the adequacy of her performance fernandez appropriate presentation of a number of pretrial motions,her effective of the prosecution witnesses,and a motion for a finding of not guilty at the close of the commonwealth case as well as at the end of trial.the court evaluation of counsel performance from its contemporaneous perspective during trial
