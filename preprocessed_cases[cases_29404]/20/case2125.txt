patricia ouska was charged with the armed robbery and murder of beeland te on may,and was tried before an illinois jury.ouska was found guilty of those charges and was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole by the trial court.the appellate court of illinois affirmed ouska conviction,and the illinois supreme court denied her leave to appeal.ouska then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court she asserted that,during her trial,the prosecution used her silence as substantive evidence of her guilt in violation of the fifth amendment and used her silence against her in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.she also claimed that her trial counsel failure to object to these violations deprived her of the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment.the district court denied ouska petition in its entirety.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
on may,between and,beeland rosa te was stabbed to death in the convenience store that she ran on west street in chicago.te sold a number of different items in the store,including toys,candy and lottery tickets.in order to help her customers more easily fill out their lottery slips,te kept a number of small pencils available in the store for that purpose.she also kept a medal of saint benedict in her cash register,a gift from her sister that had been purchased in the philippines.te had experienced health problems in the past,and,due to a double mastectomy,she wore silicone gel implants in her prosthesis.
ouska and her child lived with ouska former foster mother,ruby fontenot,only a two or three minute walk from te store.fontenot,who knew te and often stopped in her store,testified that she discovered that ouska had borrowed money from te and had not yet repaid that loan.fontenot prodded ouska to find the money to repay this debt,and on the morning of the murder ouska left fontenot home between and with her daughter in order to obtain those funds.
at some point before that morning,ouska rang the doorbell of erma gonzalez,who lives approximately two blocks away from the fontenot home.ouska was bleeding from her leg and told gonzalez that a mexican man had tried to rob her on the street and had stabbed her with a screwdriver.gonzalez refused ouska request to allow her to clean her wound in gonzalez apartment,and so ouska returned to the fontenot home.when she arrived there,she encountered patricia rutledge,a babysitter working for fontenot that morning.rutledge noticed that ouska kept her right hand in her pocket and that her leg was cut.while ouska went to her room,rutledge dialed,and paramedics soon arrived to take ouska to the hospital.
at about the same time that morning,te body was discovered at her store she had been stabbed times and had eight superficial cutting wounds.the cash register was open and contained no money.additionally,there were no signs of forced entry to the door separating the customer area of the store from the store rear portion,where te body was found te normally kept that door closed and locked.in that rear portion of the store was a bathroom,where investigators found a bloody rag in the sink.
later that afternoon,fontenot and her daughter vickie found two bills on ouska dresser,along with a printout of winning lottery numbers from a previous date.the next morning,on may,while ouska was still at illinois masonic medical center recovering from her stab wound,rutledge was again babysitting fontenot grandchildren and ouska daughter at the fontenot home.suspicious about the events of the previous day,rutledge entered ouska room and looked under her mattress,where she found a bloody knife.fontenot later testified that she recognized that knife as one that ouska had shown her while the two were in ouska room only a few weeks before.
during that same morning,ouska made repeated phone calls from the hospital to a neighbor,lenoir sanchez.ouska ultimately asked sanchez to get something for her from under ouska mattress in the fontenot home,which was located next door to sanchez apartment.sanchez testified that ouska was not specific as to the nature of the item that sanchez was supposed to retrieve from under the mattress.both sanchez and tommy gonzalez,sanchez boyfriend and the brother of ouska boyfriend,each made separate attempts to retrieve this unknown item from the fontenot home that morning.each time,rutledge,who had already found the knife under ouska mattress,would not allow them entry into the fontenot home.soon after,the knife was placed in a plastic bag,and the police were called to the scene.
when the police arrived and learned that the knife had been found in ouska room,detective michael shields was dispatched to speak with her regarding the te murder detective shields and a partner had spoken with ouska at the hospital on the previous morning about the details of ouska stabbing.when detective shields arrived at the illinois masonic medical center,ouska was about to be released,and she agreed to accompany the detective to the police station.ouska was told that she was to look at possible mug shots of her assailant instead,once at the station,detective shields began asking questions relating to te murder.at this point,ouska immediately stated that she did not wish to speak to the detective any further,indicated that she wished to speak with her attorney and later left the police station.at no time during this questioning was ouska placed under arrest,nor was she given miranda warnings.additionally,ouska had a bag of clothing with her as she left the hospital that she brought with her to the police station.upon leaving the station,she did not take this bag with her.detective shields,who had noticed blood on some of the clothing in the bag,inventoried the bag and its contents and sent it to a crime laboratory inside that bag,the police later found a jacket and in its pockets found in bills,a benedict medal and a small green pencil.
analysis later revealed that the blood on the knife was consistent with te blood and that the knife contained silicon and fibers matching that of te prosthesis and clothing,respectively.testing of the blood found on the two bills that fontenot and her daughter discovered on ouska dresser showed that it was consistent with the protein and enzyme classifications of te blood.additionally,tests on the blood from ouska jacket and from the money located in the jacket were consistent with the protein and enzyme classifications of te blood.blood that had been found in the front room of te store was determined to be consistent with ouska blood type,and blood consistent with ouska blood enzyme and protein type was found on the rag recovered from the bathroom sink in the rear of the store.a warrant was then issued for ouska arrest.six days later,on may,she appeared at a police station and was arrested.
b.earlier proceedings 
during her jury trial,ouska testified that she had entered te store on the morning of the murder and saw fontenot,salvador martinez,repeatedly stabbing the victim.ouska had,to this point,never told this story to the police or any judicial officer.she maintained that when she told martinez to stop,he knocked her to the ground,stabbed her in the leg with the knife and threatened that if she told anyone about his crime,he would hurt ouska and her child.ouska also testified that the knife belonged to martinez and not to her.after martinez ran from the store,ouska claimed that she quickly pulled the knife out of her leg and put it in the pocket of a sweatshirt that she was wearing.she also maintained that she never entered the rear portion of the store,the area where te was killed.
ouska also provided her version of a number of key points in the sequence of events after the murder.she testified that when she had arrived at erma gonzalez house just after the stabbing,she told gonzalez that she had been stabbed with a screwdriver because,until she returned to her home,she was unsure of the nature of the object that she had been stabbed with and believed that it could have been a screwdriver.she also explained that she had stated falsely that a hispanic man had stabbed her on the street because she was afraid that,if she told the truth,martinez would endanger her and her child.lastly,ouska maintained that when she called lenoir sanchez apartment on the morning after the murder,she asked sanchez to retrieve health insurance information from under her mattress,not the knife involved in the murder.
prior to ouska testimony,the prosecution called detective shields to the stand in its.it elicited from him the fact that ouska had remained silent when the detective had asked her questions regarding the murder at the police station.he characterized ouska behavior at that time as uncooperative.at.
later,on of ouska,the prosecution again engaged in the following line of questioning regarding ouska,silence 
state and you did tell shields on the at illinois masonic medical center that salvador martinez committed the crime 
a ouska no.
q you did ask for witness protection because you had just seen this woman brutally murdered 
q when you went to the police station at area violent crimes y ou did tell shields or pavon at that time that salvador martinez had committed the crime 
at d.additionally,the prosecution also referenced ouska actions after her arrest 
q state you went to bond court right 
a ouska correct.
q and you appeared before a judge 
q did you tell the judge at that time that you were innocent and salvador martinez had committed the murder 
a no,i did not.
q did you tell the assistant state attorney who was there that you were innocent and salvador martinez committed murder 
a no,i did not.
q so then you come into judge reyna courtroom right 
q and the case has been pending within this courtroom for approximately years 
q as a matter of fact you decided you would wait until your day of trial 
a no.i did tell a couple of people.
q well i am just telling you you decided you would wait until your day of trial and reveal in a public courtroom where salvador martinez could walk right in here,you decide you would wait until then and tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury that you were innocent and salvador martinez committed murder 
id.at.later,in closing argument,the prosecution again made reference to ouska silence regarding her claim that it was martinez who had murdered te ouska trial counsel did not object to any of this questioning by the prosecution,with the exception of the remarks in closing argument even there,counsel only objected on the ground that the assertion was not supported by the evidence.that objection was overruled by the trial court.ultimately,ouska was found guilty of murder and armed robbery and sentenced to life imprisonment.
in its review of ouska conviction,the appellate court of illinois first determined that the prosecution comments during regarding ouska silence did not run afoul of the constitution.it explained only that it found no error because those comments addressed events occurring before ouska was in custody and during a time when she understood that her participation was voluntary,at.the court did not mention the prosecution reference to ouska silence during its as part of its questioning of detective shields.
the court next addressed the prosecution references to ouska silence during and in closing argument.the court noted that ouska did not object to these comments during trial and that this generally constitutes a waiver of any improprieties.id.at.the court then examined the issue for plain error and ruled that the use of the silence did not adversely affect ouska right to a fair trial because a substantial amount of evidence existed to connect her to the commission of the crime.
the court also ruled that ouska could not make out a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the ground that her trial counsel failed to object to the improper use of her silence.it held that ouska could not show that,under the second part of the test articulated in strickland washington,d,but for her counsel failure there was a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different.
after finding no other defects with ouska trial,the appellate court affirmed her convictions and her sentence.the illinois supreme court later denied leave to appeal that decision.
ouska then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court under.the district court first addressed the use of ouska silence.it noted that a defendant fifth amendment rights are not violated by the use of silence to impeach a defendant credibility,and that,because ouska ultimately took the stand and testified in her own behalf,the prosecution had used her silence to impeach her credibility and not to establish her guilt 
the district court,however,also found that the prosecution had made reference to ouska silence in violation of her due process rights.see doyle ohio,d.nevertheless,it noted that,even if that issue had been preserved for appeal,any error was harmless under the standard of review applicable to habeas corpus petitions set forth in brecht abrahamson,d.in light of the large amount of evidence suggesting that ouska had committed the crimes in question,and her shifting stories regarding her version of events,the use of her silence did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury verdict.
lastly,the district court found meritless ouska claim that her trial counsel failure to object to the use of her silence constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under the sixth amendment.like the illinois appellate court,the district court held that ouska could not meet the second prong of the strickland test she could not demonstrate that the outcome of her trial would have been different if trial counsel had objected to the references to her silence.
as a result,the district court denied ouska petition for a writ of habeas corpus.ouska then applied to the district court for a certificate of appealability,but the court declined to grant one.subsequently,a judge of this court granted a certificate limited to two issues whether the prosecution use of ouska silence violated her due process rights and whether her trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to the prosecution use of her silence.
discussion 
ouska now seeks review of the three claimed errors that she presented to the district court.first,she asks that we amend her certificate of appealability and review the district court holding that the prosecution did not infringe on her fifth amendment privilege against by commenting on her,silence.ouska claims that the reference to her silence in the prosecution,during the testimony of detective shields in advance of her own testimony,was an unconstitutional attempt to draw an inference of guilt.next,she maintains that the use of her silence was not only constitutional error,but that the error significantly prejudiced her case and therefore can not be considered harmless.lastly,ouska contends that her trial attorney failure to object to these prosecutorial references constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and excuses any procedural default that may have occurred.
applicable standards of review 
in an appeal from a ruling on a petition for habeas relief,we review a district court findings of fact for clear error and its rulings on issues of law de novo.see foster schomig,cir,cert.denied,foster neal,d gardner barnett,cir en banc,cert.denied,gardner neal,d.additionally,because the habeas petition in this case was filed after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,the standard of review contained in that act governs ouska claims.see lindh murphy,d braun powell,cir,cert.denied,d.after aedpa,the federal habeas statute allows us to grant habeas relief only if the state court denial of relief was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.d see also braun,at.this standard only applies,however,to a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.braun,at quoting d.we have noted that the supreme court has explained that a state court decision is contrary to supreme court precedent if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or if the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at a result opposite to ours.anderson cowan,cir quoting williams taylor,d.additionally,an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent occurs if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from this court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case or if the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from our precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.id.at quoting williams,at.we review whether a state ruling was contrary to clearly established law de novo however,in determining whether a state court decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established law,we defer to any reasonable state court decision.see id.at schaff snyder,cir.with that standard of review in mind,we now address ouska claims.
enlargement of the certificate of appealability 
before proceeding further,we shall determine whether,as ouska requests,we ought to enlarge the certificate of appealability to include her contention that the prosecution use of her silence violated her rights under the due process clause.
in issuing a certificate of appealability certificate,the circuit judge limited the issues on appeal to w hether the prosecution use of ouska silence violated her due process rights and whether ouska trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the prosecution use of ouska silence.order of,in her appellate briefs,ouska asks us to amend that certificate to include her claim that the prosecution infringed her privilege against by introducing testimony of her,silence in its.
pursuant to c,a petitioner in habeas corpus may only appeal those issues for which a certificate of appealability has been granted.see porter gramley,cir.a certificate may issue only as to those claims for which the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.see c.we have noted that,if a certificate is granted as to certain issues,but the petitioner is later able to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right as to a different issue,we shall amend the certificate to include such a claim.see rodriguez scillia,cir williams parke,cir.
the state asks us to refuse to consider ouska request to amend the certificate.it submits that,because ouska waited until the filing of her appellate briefs to request that we do so,and because this court has already issued a certificate as to specific issues,we should refuse to amend it now.consideration of such a request,argues the state,wastes time and resources and distracts the parties and the court.appellee br.at.however,we have often considered requests to amend a certificate to include additional issues,not only when a party specifically asks that we do so in its briefs,see,schaff,at hugi united states,cir,but also when a party implicitly makes such a request by simply including issues in its briefs that were not specified in the certificate,see,rodriguez,at sylvester hanks,cir williams,at.of course,when we have determined that the expansion of a certificate was not warranted,we have noted that we are not required to and will not address arguments outside of those issues certified for appeal.fountain united states,cir.
in porter gramley,cir,we addressed a similar request by a state.in that case,a district court granted a certificate with respect to only one claim on appeal the petitioner asked that we expand the certificate to include a separate claim.see porter,at.the state of illinois objected,arguing that the petitioner should first have to make an explicit request for an expansion of the certificate before raising the issue on appeal.see id.we noted that federal rule of appellate procedure b,which states that when a petitioner makes no express request for a certificate the notice of appeal constitutes a request for a certificate,indicates that,when a district court granted a certificate only as to certain issues,this court should consider a notice of appeal addressing other issues as an implicit request to expand that certificate.see id.as a result,we declined to implement a requirement similar to that which the state asks for here.moreover,after porter,we have considered implicit requests to amend a certificate made in a petitioner briefs,not only when the certificate was issued by the district court,but also when it was issued by our own court.see rodriguez,at noting that this court may add issues to a certificate that it issued,if it is deemed necessary sylvester,at same 
therefore,as our past precedent dictates,we shall continue to consider requests to amend a certificate of appealability even when they are presented in a petitioner briefs to this court.we are mindful that the certificate does play an important role as a screening device,helping to conserve judicial and prosecutorial resources.young united states,cir.however,in those rare instances where the importance of an issue does not become clear until later in an appellate proceeding,this court has the authority to consider that issue,even though it is not included in the initial certificate 
to amend her certificate of appealability,ouska must make a substantial showing that the state use of her silence at trial violated her constitutional rights.to do so,she must demonstrate that reasonable jurists could debate whether this challenge in her habeas petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issue presented was adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.see slack mcdaniel,d rutledge united states,cir,cert.denied,d.
the illinois appellate court limited its review of the prosecution use of ouska silence to instances of impeachment and did not address the use of that silence in the prosecutor.we therefore review this issue under standards.
in jenkins anderson,d,the supreme court ruled that the fifth amendment privilege against is not violated when the prosecution uses a defendant silence to impeach that defendant credibility.the court reasoned that,although it can be argued that a person facing arrest will not remain silent if his failure to speak later can be used to impeach him,once a defendant voluntarily decides to take the stand,that individual has an obligation to testify truthfully.id.at.at that point,the interests of the other party and regard for the function of courts of justice to ascertain the truth become relevant,and prevail in the balance of considerations determining the scope and limits of the privilege against.id.quoting brown united states,d.
jenkins,however,left open the question of whether silence could be used against a defendant,not for impeachment purposes,but as substantive evidence of guilt.see id.at.we addressed that issue in united states ex rel.savory lane.savory involved a defendant who,in a setting and without being provided with miranda warnings,refused to answer any questions from police officers regarding a murder investigation.see id.at.in that case,we concluded that the supreme court opinion in griffin california,d,which had forbidden the prosecution from using a defendant silence at trial as an inference of his guilt,applies equally to a defendant silence before trial,and indeed,even before arrest.savory,at.we reasoned that the right to remain silent attached before the institution of adversarial proceedings,and although the presence of miranda warnings might provide an additional reason for disallowing use of the defendant silence as evidence of guilt,they are not a necessary condition to such a prohibition.id.at lastly,we noted that,because the defendant in savory did not take the stand,the prosecution motive in referring to his,silence was to suggest that he was guilty,not to impeach his testimony,as was the case in jenkins.see id.at.
in this case,the prosecution made reference to ouska,silence regarding te murder,not only during its of ouska,but also during its.this reference occurred when the state questioned detective shields regarding his discussion with ouska about te death on the day after the murder.in response to the prosecution questions,detective shields noted that ouska repeatedly declined to discuss the murder,and he referred to her attitude as uncooperative.at.the district court ruled that,because ouska later testified in the case and provided her own explanation for her silence,the prosecution was free to comment on her silence as a method of impeaching her testimony.see at distinguishing savory as a case where the defendant did not take the stand,such that any reference to his silence must have been to suggest his guilt.
ouska argues that the prosecution reference to her silence in its,before she had ever taken the stand,shows that its purpose in using that silence was to demonstrate substantive evidence of her guilt,not to impeach her credibility.our opinion in united states hernandez,cir,supports this claim.in hernandez,we held that,when the prosecution makes reference to a defendant silence in its that reference demonstrates that those comments were intended as an inference of the defendant guilt,even when that defendant later takes the stand.see at.moreover,we also noted that there was no evidence that the improper references in the prosecution were made inadvertently.see id.the prosecutor in hernandez had returned to questions regarding the silence after an objection by the fact that we found to demonstrate a deliberate attempt to imply guilt and to show that the prosecutor here asked his question expecting the answer he got.id.in ouska case,as in hernandez,the state made reference to her,silence in its,before ouska ever took the stand.moreover,there was no indication that the state questioning of detective shields regarding ouska silence was inadvertent or was otherwise not meant to suggest guilt.the state not only asked detective shields a number of questions regarding ouska silence at the hospital,but also continued to refer to the exchange between the two during its of ouska.
the state,relying on united states davenport,cir,argues that savory rule against the use of silence does not apply when a defendant agrees to speak with authorities,but then later chooses to stop doing so.davenport involved two defendants who,aware that they were under investigation by the regarding unusually large deposits they had made,decided to answer an agent questions regarding the transaction in an attempt to ward off future prosecution see at.after start ing down this path of,the defendants refused to answer other,related questions of the agents at trial,they invoked their right against compulsory to prevent the admission of any of the comments they made to the investigators.id.at.we explained that 
the privilege against is not a privilege to attempt to gain an advantage in the criminal process,whether in its investigatory or its trial stage,by selective disclosure followed by a clamming up.having voluntarily given the agent their version of the events,the defendants forfeited their privilege not to answer questions concerning that version.
id.at see also williams chrans,cir.however,ouska actions are different than those of the defendants in davenport in some important respects.ouska did not consent to accompany detective shields to the police station knowing that she would be questioned regarding te,she was told that she would be looking at mug shots of her assailant.moreover,the record demonstrates that once at the station,as soon as the police began to inquire about te death,ouska immediately ceased the interview,requested her lawyer and later left the station these facts do not suggest a suspect who,as was the case in davenport,aware that she was being questioned regarding an investigation,attempted to exculpate herself with some answers and then later refused to answer additional questions related to those comments.it is true that at the time of her conversation at the station with detective shields,ouska previously had told police a story that attempted to shield herself from inquiry regarding te murder she falsely claimed that she had been stabbed on the street by a mexican man.however,in light of the fact that,when aware that she was under investigation for te murder,ouska immediately declined to answer any and all questions,we are doubtful that her previous comments regarding her initial explanation of the stabbing would be sufficient to start her down the path of under the meaning of davenport,at.
as a result,we believe that ouska has made a substantial showing,adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further,that the state used her,silence as an improper inference of her guilt,in violation of her constitutional rights.the state,as it had the right to do regarding issues not included in a certificate of appealability,declined to address ouska argument fully in its brief regarding the silence claim.see schaff,at sylvester,at.typically at this stage,we would amend the certificate to add this issue and extend the appellee an opportunity to file a supplemental brief.sylvester,at.however,for the reasons set forth in section of this opinion,this step will not be necessary,as any constitutional error in the use of ouska,silence was harmless.see brecht,at.accordingly,we shall not enlarge the certificate of appealability.
c.the prosecutor use of silence 
in addition to its references to ouska silence,the state also made reference to ouska,silence by noting her failure to claim that it was martinez,and not her,who had murdered te.in its consideration of this issue,the illinois appellate court relied upon the doctrine of waiver because there had been no objection to these prosecutorial statements at trial.ouska must therefore show cause and prejudice before we can consider the merits of this contention.see jenkins nelson,cir if a state court does not reach a federal issue because of a state procedural bar,that issue can not be raised in a writ of habeas corpus to a federal court without a showing of cause and prejudice.citing wainwright sykes,d.ouska maintains that the ineffective assistance of her trial counsel in failing to object to the use of the silence satisfies the standard for cause and prejudice.see murray carrier,d.
the supreme court has explained that to demonstrate prejudice under the cause and prejudice standard,a defendant must shoulder the burden of showing,not merely that the errors at his trial created a possibility of prejudice,but that they worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage,infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.united states frady,d emphasis in original 
we believe that ouska has not demonstrated prejudice from any improper use of her silence in light of the very substantial other evidence of her guilt.as an initial matter,the evidence demonstrated that ouska had the opportunity to commit the murder on the morning of may,and that she was at the murder scene at the time of te death.fontenot,ouska former foster mother,testified that,on the night before and the morning of the murder,she had been arguing with ouska about money that ouska had borrowed from te.fontenot maintained that,on the morning of the murder,ouska left home in order to obtain money so that this debt could be repaid.ouska left that morning at approximately and returned,bloodied from a wound to her leg,at testimony established that te was killed between and.ouska herself also admits that she was at te store,located only two or three minutes from the fontenot home where ouska lived,at the time of the murder.she contends,however,that,when she arrived at the scene,she saw martinez repeatedly stabbing the victim.
additionally,significant physical evidence linked ouska to the crime scene and the murder.a knife was found under ouska mattress on the day after the murder the knife contained blood later found to be consistent with te blood type and silicon later determined to be consistent with the silicon gel implants that te wore in her prosthesis.fontenot testified that only three weeks before,she had seen the same knife in ouska room and that ouska explained to fontenot at that time that she had found the knife in the basement of the house.fontenot also said that,on the afternoon of the murder,she and her daughter found money and a printout of winning lottery numbers from a previous date on ouska dresser the blood on those two bills was later found to be consistent with te blood enzyme and protein type.additionally,blood consistent with ouska blood type was found in the front room of te store,and blood consistent with ouska blood enzyme and protein type was found on a rag recovered from the bathroom sink in the rear of the store.
other evidence found in ouska possession casts doubt on the credibility of her version of events.when the police arrived at the store after te murder,the store cash register was found open and emptied of money.among ouska personal items,which the police had inventoried after she accompanied detective shields to the station on the day after the murder,the police found a jacket.the blood on the jacket was later found to be consistent with te blood.in the pocket of that jacket was a medal depicting saint benedict teodora kwong,te sister,testified that the medal was the same one that she had purchased in the philippines and given as a gift to te and that te kept the medal in her cash register at the store.the police also found a small green pencil in the jacket,later identified by arthur kwong,te,as one similar to the pencils that te kept in her store for customers to use in filling out lottery slips lastly,the police discovered in one and bills in the jacket,despite the fact that fontenot had testified that ouska left the house on the morning of the murder to look for money.
additional evidence also provided reason for the jury to doubt the credibility of ouska testimony.on the morning of the murder,ouska was ultimately taken to illinois masonic medical center to receive treatment for her wounds,and she stayed there until the next day,may.while there,she made repeated phone calls to the apartment of a friend,lenoir sanchez,who lived in the building next to the fontenot home.sanchez testified that ouska asked her to go next door and to obtain something from under ouska mattress,but when sanchez asked what the item was,ouska would not tell her.at.both sanchez and her boyfriend tommy gonzalez each made separate attempts to get this unknown item from the fontenot home.however,earlier that morning,under the same mattress,rutledge had found the knife used in the murder.as a result,rutledge would not let sanchez or gonzalez in,and the police were called soon thereafter.ouska subsequently testified that she kept her hmo card and paperwork under the mattress,materials that she needed due to her hospital stay,and that she asked sanchez to retrieve that information.ouska also claimed that she did not place the knife under the mattress she explained that she had left the knife on top of the bed,in the pocket of the sweatshirt she had been wearing that morning,before she left for the hospital.despite this alternate explanation,ouska phone calls to sanchez and her request that sanchez retrieve something from under ouska mattress,the same mattress under which the knife had been found earlier that morning,could have given the jury additional license to question ouska credibility.
moreover,ouska testified that at no point did she enter the rear portion of the convenience store,where te was stabbed and where te body was found.blood consistent with te blood,however,was later found on ouska jacket.additionally,blood consistent with ouska blood enzyme and protein type was found on a rag recovered from the store bathroom.the bathroom is located in the rear portion of the store.
lastly,a number of other aspects of ouska testimony were inconsistent with her previous rendition of events.between and on the morning of the murder,ouska went to the home of her neighbor,erma gonzalez,and told gonzalez that a mexican man had tried to rob her and had stabbed her with a screwdriver,causing the wound in her leg.yet,ouska later told fontenot,rutledge and the police officers who first spoke with her about her injuries that she had been stabbed with a knife,not a screwdriver.then,at trial,ouska claimed that it was martinez who had stabbed her,not the mexican man that she had earlier described.additionally,when ouska related her story of the stabbing by the mexican man to fontenot and rutledge,she claimed that,at one point,she had possession of the knife used in the stabbing but had dropped it on the street ouska later testified that she was concealing the knife at that time in her jacket,and that same knife was later found under her mattress.
ultimately,the evidence supporting ouska guilt in this case was substantial and multifaceted.that evidence demonstrated that she had the opportunity to kill te on the morning of may,and that she was at the crime scene when the murder occurred.a number of items that appear to have come from the store,and more particularly its cash register,were found later in ouska clothing,and ouska can not explain how they came to be there.blood consistent with te blood was found on ouska jacket,on money found in ouska room and,most importantly,on the knife found under ouska mattress.testimony linked ouska to the murder weapon and suggested that she attempted to hide that weapon before others could discover it.moreover,ouska explanation of the events surrounding te death were inconsistent,casting further doubt on her credibility.lastly,as the district court noted,there is no evidence that corroborates ouska story about martinez being the one who attacked the victim.at.
given this evidence,we do not believe that ouska can establish that she suffered prejudice by the prosecutor remarks about her silence.
ineffective assistance of counsel
