juan raul garza is scheduled to be executed by the federal government on june.garza was convicted in the district court for the southern district of texas for five violations of federal drug trafficking laws,operating a continuing criminal enterprise,money laundering,pertinent counts of killing in furtherance of a continuing criminal enterprise,in violation of e.a jury recommended that he be sentenced to death on each of the three e violations,and the district court accepted that recommendation.garza conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal to the fifth circuit,united states flores and garza,cir,and his petition for writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court was denied,garza united states,d.garza then filed a motion to vacate his sentence under,the federal prisoner substitute for a petition for habeas corpus,arguing,among other things,that the introduction at the sentencing phase of his trial of evidence of five uncharged murders he allegedly committed in mexico violated his constitutional rights.the trial court denied the motion,the fifth circuit denied his request for a certificate of appealability,united states garza,cir,and the supreme court again denied certiorari,garza united states,d.
his avenues for domestic relief thus exhausted,garza filed a petition with the commission on human rights the commission,an organization formed under the auspices of the organization of american states.he could not have done so at any earlier time,as the commission requires exhaustion of national remedies before a party may resort to it.before the commission,garza again argued among other things that the introduction of the evidence of the mexican murders violated his rights as set out in the american declaration of the rights and duties of man.on april,the commission issued a report stating its position that the introduction of the mexican murders at the sentencing phase of the trial in effect allowed the government to sentence garza to death as punishment both for the murders for which he was convicted and for the mexican murders,crimes with which he was never charged.on this basis,the commission concluded that garza death sentence was a violation of international human rights norms to which the united states had committed itself.
shortly after the commission issued its report,garza,who is currently incarcerated at the federal penitentiary in terre haute,indiana,filed this habeas corpus petition under in the southern district of indiana,arguing that the united states was bound by treaty to abide by the commission decision.accordingly,garza asked the court to invalidate his death sentence and to order his release from custody unless the government agreed to provide him with a new sentencing hearing.garza also petitioned the court to stay his execution pending resolution of his habeas corpus petition.the district court,however,determined that garza petition,although styled a petition for habeas corpus under,was in fact a successive petition under.because garza had not obtained the permission of the court of appeals to file a successive petition,and in any event,petitions can be filed only in the district in which the petitioner conviction and sentence were entered,not in the district in which the petitioner is incarcerated,the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition and dismissed the action.garza,whose execution date is now less than a week away,has filed a petition with this court seeking a stay of his execution pending his appeal of the district court decision.
a stay of execution pending the resolution of a second or successive petition for habeas corpus should be granted only when there are substantial grounds upon which relief might be granted.delo stokes,d.whether or not garza current petition is technically successive for purposes of statutes like,it is a later petition in the broader sense of the term we therefore believe that the stokes standard is the proper one to apply to the current request for a stay.before this court could grant a stay,garza must convince us first that,contrary to the district court decision,both the district court and we have jurisdiction to hear his petition,and second,that the merits of his petition present a substantial ground on which relief could be granted.the question of the district court jurisdiction and the availability of is a very close one,but in the end we conclude that on these very unusual facts garza petition is properly cognizable under.this procedural victory is of no avail to garza,however,because an examination of the merits of his petition reveals that it does not present any substantial ground for relief.for that reason,we deny his petition for a stay of execution.
determining whether the district court had jurisdiction to consider garza petition requires us to examine the interaction between and.in general,federal prisoners who wish to attack the validity of their convictions or sentences are required to proceed under.furthermore,in the overwhelming majority of cases specifically prohibits prisoners from circumventing and challenging their convictions or sentences through a habeas petition under.there is,however,a recognition in the statute that it will not apply in a narrow class of cases.this is the savings clause of,which allows prisoners to bring petitions if they can show that the remedy is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of the prisoner detention.see,last clause.if garza can show that his petition fits under this narrow exception,then two consequences follow first,the district court had jurisdiction to consider his habeas petition under,and second,the proper court in which to file the case was the one encompassing the district of confinement southern indiana,not the district where the case was tried.
since,has contained a provision which bars prisoners from filing second or successive petitions except in two narrow circumstances when newly discovered evidence would establish by clear and convincing evidence that the prisoner is not guilty of the offense for which he was convicted,or when the petition presents a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive by the supreme court to cases on collateral review,that was unavailable to the petitioner at the time of his first petition.see.garza concedes that he has already exhausted his right to one petition,and that his arguments based on the commission recent decision do not fall under either of the clauses permitting successive motions,and so he apparently can not proceed under.indeed,the fifth circuit,which is the proper court in which to file a petition for permission to file a successive motion,has so concluded twice.see in re garza,cir in re garza,decided june.the mere fact that garza petition would be barred as a successive petition under,however,is not enough to bring the petition under savings clause otherwise,the careful structure congress has created to avoid repetitive filings would mean little or nothing.
the problem before us is what more is necessary to satisfy the savings clause.in in re davenport,cir,this court considered the interaction between savings clause and the limitations on successive petitions,and we concluded that in most cases,petitions that were barred under the successive petition rules could not be brought under either.to hold otherwise,we noted,would be to nullify the limitations on successive petitions.id.at.nevertheless,in davenport we recognized that there might be rare circumstances in which the operation of the successive petition rules absolutely prevented the petitioner from ever having an opportunity to raise a challenge to the legality of his sentence.in such a case,would be genuinely inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.id.at.we believe that this is one of those exceptional cases.
the davenport decision resolved two consolidated appeals,both from district court decisions holding that the appellants habeas corpus petitions were barred because they were in effect successive petitions.the first appellant,davenport,argued that his sentence was improperly enhanced on the grounds that he was an armed career crimi
