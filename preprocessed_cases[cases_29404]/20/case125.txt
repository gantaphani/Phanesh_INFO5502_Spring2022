following a jury trial in new hampshire superior court,scott abram was convicted of counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault against his two stepchildren,four counts of endangering the welfare of a child and one count of indecent exposure and lewdness.
after exhausting his direct appeals,abram petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of new hampshire pursuant to.abram argued that the state trial court violated his rights under the sixth amendment confrontation clause by prohibiting him from his stepchildren regarding their accusations that he had also abused their younger siblings.the district court denied the petition.we affirm.
when a federal court reviews a state court conviction on habeas review,any state court factual findings are presumed to be correct.clements clarke,cir.accordingly,we briefly sketch the relevant facts underlying abram conviction and the accusations abram sought to introduce at trial,drawing liberally from the district court decision in abram warden,cv jl,dist.lexis may,which in turn draws from the new hampshire supreme court decision in state abram.
in,abram married evelyn towne,who had three children a daughter,and two sons,and abram and towne then had two children together,and on november,and told their mother that abram had been sexually abusing them for a long time the children reported that abram sexually assaulted them and forced them to engage in sexual conduct with each other.both claimed that abram had anally penetrated them,and they also accused him of anally penetrating their younger brothers,and when questioned by investigators,however,the two younger brothers denied that the alleged abuse occurred 
prior to trial,the government filed a motion in limine to preclude the defendant from eliciting any testimony regarding the older siblings accusations that abram abused and.the state anticipated that abram would raise these accusations and and denials on in order to impeach and credibility.the government argued that the court should not permit any questioning about the accusations because abram could not establish that the allegations were demonstrably false.it relied on state gordon,and state white,for the proposition that under new hampshire law,the defendant could introduce a victim prior allegation of sexual assault for impeachment purposes by showing that such allegations were demonstrably false,which means clearly and convincingly untrue.in his written objection to the state motion,abram offered evidence that,he contended,proved the falsity of and allegations regarding their younger siblings.he emphasized that physical examinations of and in revealed no evidence of physical abuse,and that both and had repeatedly denied the sexual abuse in interviews with investigators.abram also pointed out that,in her statement to police,mentioned that she had observed abram abusing three years ago,and yet,in,she had denied ever seeing abram abuse 
the trial court found that abram failed to prove that the accusations were demonstrably false and granted the state motion.the court noted that and physical examinations did not prove or disprove whether the abuse had occurred it also observed that although and initially denied the allegations of the assault,there was evidence that undermined the defendant claim that these allegations were false.the court cited medical records from,in which the children mother reported that,and frequently complained of anal pain.after and were removed from the family home in,a family member discovered masturbating,and both boys told family members that abram had shown them the activity.told police that abram had frequently touched his penis and bum.the trial court further found that minor temporal inconsistency in reporting the time line of sexual abuse did not clearly indicate that the allegations were false,particularly given her young age at the time she was interviewed.
the jury convicted abram,and the trial court sentenced him to a term of to years imprisonment.
on direct appeal,the new hampshire supreme court considered and rejected abram claim that the trial court exclusion of the allegations regarding and violated abram sixth amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.the court acknowledged that under our holding in white coplan,cir,new hampshire application of the demonstrably false standard could violate the confrontation clause in certain extreme cases when its application was patently unreasonable.abram,at.abram was not an extreme case meriting reversal under white,the state court held,because abram could not present similarly compelling evidence that the allegations at issue were false.it also concluded that there was a particularly high likelihood in abram case that the excluded evidence would result in a trial within a trial,because the allegations involved children who were not victims in the case.id 
abram renewed his sixth amendment claim in his federal habeas corpus petition.the district court denied abram petition on summary judgment,on the grounds that the new hampshire supreme court decision was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of federal law under supreme court precedent,as interpreted by white.this appeal followed.
we review de novo the district court denial of habeas relief.clements,at.the anti terrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,dictates our standard of review of the new hampshire supreme court disposition of abram direct appeal.where,as here,the state court considered and rejected the petitioner claim on the merits,we may grant habeas relief only if its adjudication 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.abram claim invokes the first prong of this statute.he contends that he is entitled to habeas relief because his inability to and about their allegations regarding and violated the confrontation clause.the state supreme court determination that it did not,he avers,constituted an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
under section d,an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law occurs when the court either identifies the correct governing legal rule from the supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case or unreasonably extends a legal principle from the supreme court precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.john russo,cir.
we begin with the question of what constitutes clearly established federal law on the issue presented.the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to be confronted with the witnesses against him.delaware van arsdall.the supreme court has recognized the ability to adverse witnesses as essential to that right.id.at.the right is not absolute,however.trial courts may place reasonable limits on based on concerns about,among other things,harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues,the witness safety,or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.id.at.
abram relies primarily on our decision in white to argue that the exclusion of the allegations pertaining to and was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law although we agree that white articulates the relevant legal principles under which we evaluate abram claim,we conclude that the state supreme court application of those principles was not unreasonable.
in white,the defendant was charged with assaulting the two young daughters of a friend while visiting their home.at.the girls were the only witnesses who testified about the alleged assaults,and the government case hinged on their credibility.id.at.at trial,white sought to both girls about prior accusations of sexual assault that the girls had made against three other men.a jury had acquitted one of the men of the charges no formal charges were brought against the second and the police never identified the third.id.white argued that the girls prior accusations were similar to their accusations against him,and that evidence demonstrating the falsity of these prior accusations thus bore upon the girls credibility and showed prior sexual knowledge.id.at.
the trial court prohibited all inquiry into the prior allegations,and the new hampshire supreme court affirmed white conviction.id.the state supreme court found that white had proven the falsity of the prior accusations to a reasonable probability,but concluded that new hampshire law required that the defendant prove the prior accusations were demonstrably false for them to be admitted,which the court equated with clear and convincing evidence.id.the district court denied white habeas petition.
on habeas review,we interpreted supreme court decisions to require a balancing of interests depending on the circumstances of the case in determining whether a defendant sixth amendment confrontation clause rights had been violated.these interests included the importance of the evidence to an effective defense,the scope of the ban involved,and the strength vel non of state interests weighing against admission of the evidence.id.at.applying this test,we determined that although new hampshire demonstrable falsity standard was generally defensible,white represented an extreme case in which application of this standard violated the confrontation clause.the facts that made the case extreme,we observed,were the state supreme court finding that the prior accusations were false to a reasonable probability the fact that the defendant had virtually no other way to defend himself and the similarity between the prior accusations and those made against white.id.at.
we thus held in white that a defendant may have a sixth amendment right to a witness regarding prior allegations of sexual assault on a lesser showing than demonstrable falsity,but only where multiple factors in combination weigh heavily in favor of allowing such questioning.it is significant that the accusations in white,while falling short of the new hampshire standard,nonetheless were false to a high degree of likelihood,to a reasonable probability.such prior accusations will only be relevant to the victim credibility if the jury concludes they are false.given the potential harms from pursuing such an inquiry,including the emotional toll on the victim and confusion over what conduct is actually before the jury,it is appropriate to require the defendant to satisfy a high threshold regarding the likelihood of falsity.we nevertheless recognized in white that,in some circumstances,new hampshire particularly demanding requirement mayhave to give way to a defendant confrontation clause rights.
none of the factors that prompted us to label white an extreme case is present here.first,unlike the defendant in white,abram could not prove that the accusations concerning and were false to a reasonable probability.on careful review,the new hampshire supreme court found the evidence of falsity to be inconclusive at best,abram,at,and abram has not challenged that finding under d 
second,the exclusion of the evidence in this case did not deprive abram of a defense as it did white.abram sought to introduce the allegations in part to argue that the children were so desperate to escape his discipline that they sought to scorch the earth with incendiary allegations.even without this testimony,however,he was able to introduce other evidence supporting his theory as to why the children had invented their allegations of abuse against him.
third,whereas in white the prior allegations involved the same victims as those in the defendant case,in abram case,the excluded evidence involved different victims who were not otherwise part of abram trial.the new hampshire supreme court concluded that allowing abram to raise the excluded evidence would be more likely to produce confusion of the issues,likely resulting in a trial within a trial,and potentially causing substantial delay.abram,at.we think this conclusion was reasonable.
abram acknowledges these distinctions but nevertheless contends that the state court misapplied white balancing test.he argues that the importance of the testimony to the defense and the scope of the prohibition outweighed the strength of the state interests against admission.the testimony was particularly important to the defense,he claims,because the prosecutor case hinged almost entirely on the credibility of and and he argues that the scope of the ban was absolute,in that the defense was not allowed to ask any questions about the allegations pertaining to and 
although the new hampshire supreme court did not explicitly apply this balancing test to the facts in abram case,we may consider abram argument on habeas review in determining whether the state court has unreasonably refuse d to extend a legal principle to a new context where it should apply.fratta quarterman,cir see also hurtado tucker,cir observing that while the reasoning used by the state court is pertinent,t he ultimate question on habeas is not how well reasoned the state court decision is,but whether the outcome is reasonable.
that said,under aedpa,we may only consider whether,in applying these factors,the state court determination that abram confrontation clause rights were not violated was unreasonable.we may not consider whether we would have reached the same conclusion.where,as here,the federal law in question sets forth general principles,state courts have considerable flexibility to exercise their judgment in reaching outcomes.see yarborough alvarado,the more general the rule,the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in determinations.
with this in mind,we do not conclude that the state supreme court conclusion was unreasonable.and allegations regarding the abuse of their younger siblings would have only undermined their credibility if those allegations were indeed false.see white,at many jurors would regard a set of similar past charges if shown to be false,as very potent proof in the petitioner favor.emphasis added quinn haynes,cir a true allegation of another sexual assault is completely irrelevant to credibility.as we observed above,the state supreme court found that the evidence neither proved nor disproved the falsity of the accusations regarding and given that finding,the state court did not unreasonably apply federal law by excluding this evidence.we note that other circuits have failed to find sixth amendment violations on similar facts.see cookson schwartz,cir rejecting habeas claim and distinguishing white,where the petitioner could not establish that the excluded sexual assault allegation was false to a reasonable probability quinn,at,rejecting habeas claim where the denials of the alleged perpetrators constituted the only evidence that the prior allegations were false boggs collins,cir rejecting habeas claim where the state trial court had found that the victim had never made the alleged prior accusations 
it would also have been reasonable for the state court to find that the scope of the exclusion was not absolute,in that abram was not prevented from pursuing his theory of the children motive to fabricate.we so conclude based on our reading of van arsdall,the supreme court case from which white draws this factor of its test,and the case on which abram relies in asserting that the ban in his case was absolute.
in van arsdall,the defendant claimed that the state trial court had violated the confrontation clause by not allowing him to a government witness in his murder trial about the undisputed fact that the witness had agreed to speak with the government about the murder in exchange for the dismissal of a charge against him.at.after acknowledging that trial courts generally retain wide latitude insofar as the confrontation clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such,the supreme court held that the trial court exclusion of this evidence constituted a constitutional violation because the trial court prohibited all inquiry into the possibility that the government witness would be biased id.at.
it was reasonable for the new hampshire supreme court to conclude that the supreme court concern in van arsdall was that the defendant,if not permitted to the witness about his agreement with the government,would be completely unable to explore the question of bias.here,on the contrary,abram retained the ability to the witnesses about their possible incentives to fabricate the accusations of abuse.as the supreme court has often repeated,the confrontation clause guarantees an opportunity for effective,not that is effective in whatever way,and to whatever extent,the defense might wish.see,delaware fensterer,per curiam.
finally,abram argues that white left open the possibility that courts might find other cases extreme such that application of new hampshire demonstrably false standard would be patently unreasonable,even if the facts were distinguishable from those of white itself.he urges us to find that the application of the demonstrably false standard would be unreasonable here,both because the prior accusations in question were unusual in that they involved the defendant alleged abuse of other children,rather than the child victims allegations against other potential defendants and because both the lack of physical evidence of the abuse and and denials suggested the falsity of the claims.
in contending that his case is extreme,however,abram ignores the important ways in which,as we have explained,this case differs from white.the mere possibility of falsity that he raises is significantly different from the finding in white of a reasonable probability that the earlier allegations were false.unlike white,abram was not entirely deprived of his opportunity to defend.moreover,the state court in this case supportably saw an added risk of jury confusion where the excluded evidence concerned different victims.in sum,the circumstances here,taken together,fall short of establishing an extreme case meriting the grant of a writ of habeas corpus.
having considered all of abram arguments,we conclude that the state supreme court decision was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
for the reasons set forth above,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
dissenting opinion follows 
torruella,circuit judge dissenting.the specter of an adult,particularly one in a position of trust such as a stepfather,sexually abusing his minor stepchildren is enough to incense even the most equanimous person and to wish upon such a miscreant the full retributive weight of the law.but there lies the catch the law.we live in an ordered society,and to keep it ordered for the benefit of the whole of society,we are bound to apply the law,not just to do what we believe the abominable person charged may justly deserve 
our constitution,as our supreme law,establishes the minimum rights to which a person accused of a crime is entitled in defense of his life and liberty.there are virtually no exceptions to the attachment of these rights by reason of the nature of the crime charged,even for the most heinous of accusations.such is the situation with which we must wrestle in this appeal.succinctly put,we are required to determine whether the new hampshire courts unreasonably applied clearly established federal law designed to protect abram right to his accusers.
the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to be confronted with the witnesses against him.delaware van arsdall.an essential element of this right,as recognized by the supreme court,is the right to adverse witnesses.id.at.however,as the court has stated,this is not an absolute right trial courts may place reasonable limits on based on concerns about,among others things,harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues,the witness es safety,or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.id.at.our inquiry should therefore be directed at determining whether the new hampshire trial court restrictions on the petitioner right to confront the witnesses against him are properly within these constitutional parameters.
because i can not in good conscience find that the trial court ruling in this case reasonably applied established federal law when considering the petitioner sixth amendment rights and because the court engaged in no perceptible balancing of the considerations required under white,i am forced to conclude that the petitioner in this case is entitled to the habeas relief he seeks.see white coplan,cir finding that prohibiting defendant from accusers regarding prior accusations of sexual assault was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law and noting that supreme court precedent requires a balancing of interests.
the facts are straightforward and are not in dispute.petitioner scott abram married evelyn towne in and settled in manchester,new hampshire.towne brought three children from a prior marriage to this union,and thereafter,abram and towne procreated two children of their own,and 
sometime in,while the family still resided in manchester,and made allegations to their mother that abram was sexually abusing them.within two weeks of their giving formal statements to the manchester police describing the alleged abuse,however,the mother called the police to say that the children first and then had recanted.the authorities proceeded no further with these matters.
in statement to the manchester police,she claimed that she had heard and molested in the bathroom,and that she had seen the defendant do it one time to in.notwithstanding these allegations,both and consistently denied that abram penetrated their anuses.furthermore,a physical examination of these children by physicians acting at the request of the authorities failed to reveal any evidence of sexual abuse,although the doctor opined that a negative result of this examination did not necessarily rule out the possibility of sexual abuse having taken place.the record shows that and were three and four years of age,respectively,when the incident allegedly took place.
in,the family moved to concord,new hampshire.in november,when was thirteen and was eleven,they renewed their accusations against abram,claiming sexual abuse.they alleged that abram had sexually assaulted them by anally penetrating them.also accused abram of engaging in vaginal intercourse with her and of forcing her to engage in sexual conduct with.during the investigation that ensued,in a written statement to investigator paula fanjoy,renewed her accusations against abram,including the related claims that she saw her brothers and in the bathroom with abram and saw him place his penis in their butts.then stated that she saw blood on diapers three years ago,in.medical records from showed that the children mother reported that,and frequently complained of anal pain.
and allegations resulted in abram arrest and indictment on charges of aggravated sexual assault and related offenses covering the time period between november and november.the government again did not pursue any charges based on the renewed allegations.
before trial,the government filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude abram from eliciting any testimony from and regarding their claims that abram had abused and in.in doing so,the government anticipated that,for the purpose of impeaching and credibility before the jury during his,abram would raise the fact that and had made these accusations,notwithstanding that and had denied that abram sodomized them.it was the government position at this hearing that the court should not permit any questions on this subject because abram could not establish the falsity of and allegations to the requisite level under new hampshire law.
new hampshire law requires a showing that prior false allegations of sexual abuse are demonstrably false before an alleged victim of sexual assault can be about prior allegedly false sexual abuse.see state gordon,overruled on other grounds by state miller,overruling gordon to the extent it require d a defendant to demonstrate clearly and convincingly that the prior allegations were false before being permitted to the victim about them under rule b,but affirming that there is no constitutional requirement to permit this unless the prior allegations were proved to be demonstrably false.the new hampshire supreme court has interpreted demonstrably false to require the defendant to prove that the allegations were clearly and convincingly untrue.state white.
the trial court granted the government motion and enjoined abram from asking any questions on about the allegations and withdrawals concerning and.the trial court in essence found that abram allegations did not meet the new hampshire demonstrably false test because the medical examinations of and neither proved nor negated sexual abuse,later recanted his initial denial of sexual abuse,and the temporal inconsistencies in expected testimony did not clearly indicate that the allegations were false.the case proceeded to trial before a jury,which found abram guilty of counts of felonious sexual assault,four counts of endangering the welfare of a child,and one count of indecent exposure and lewdness.the trial court sentenced abram to to years of imprisonment.for reasons not relevant to this appeal,the new hampshire supreme court reduced this sentence to thirty to sixty years of imprisonment when it vacated nine of the total counts for which abram was convicted.the new hampshire supreme court affirmed the trial court ruling prohibiting any on the issue of and allegations regarding and see state abram.a petition for habeas corpus in the district court for the district of new hampshire alleging violation of abram sixth amendment rights fared no better,and this appeal ensued thereafter.
this case presents a quintessential credibility case.there was a dearth of physical evidence to prove the government case against abram.the majority of the evidence against abram consisted of the testimony of the obviously compelling witnesses he allegedly abused,in which they related evidence which,if true,would incense even the most detached and juror.the accusers testimony was pitted against abram denial that those incidents took place.the case,and abram freedom,turned entirely on the word of the alleged victims against abram.it was thus imperative that the defendant be allowed to test the reliability of the government witnesses in any reasonable manner.the importance of the right of is heightened when the testimony of the witness in question is the only evidence directly linking the defendant to the crime.searcy jaimet,cir cudahy,dissenting citing olden kentucky,davis alaska.
abram sought to introduce evidence to show motive or bias which included the fact that and made prior allegations that abram had abused their younger siblings,and the uncharged allegations,that both and denied that abram abused them,and that abram was never charged for this alleged abuse.federal case law distinguishes between general attacks on a witness credibility evidence offered to support the inference that the witness has a tendency to lie and attacks on credibility aimed at showing possible biases,prejudices,or ulterior motives of the witness.davis,at.w hile generally applicable evidentiary rules limit inquiry into specific instances of conduct through the use of extrinsic evidence and through with respect to general credibility attacks,no such limit applies to credibility attacks based upon motive or bias redmond kingston,cir quoting quinn haynes,cir white,at evidence suggesting a motive to lie has long been regarded as powerful evidence undermining credibility,and its importance has been stressed in supreme court confrontation cases.this case law does not imply that any time a defendant seeks to introduce evidence of prior false allegations to show the accuser bias or motive,the allegations are entitled to unconditional constitutional protection,regardless of the allegations veracity.the veracity of the allegations is relevant.in my opinion,in this case,abram provided evidence of falsity to a reasonable probability.
the evidence regarding and accusations regarding their younger brothers would support the defense that the children were motivated to make false allegations about abram in order to get him out of the house and to get away from his discipline,and were in fact so motivated that they were willing to scorch the earth to get him out.the uncharged allegations from,if false,potentially show a pattern of false accusations against the same defendant.as we stated in white 
many jurors would regard a set of similar past charges by complainants,if shown to be false,as very potent proof in the defendant favor.this if,of course,is the heart of the matter t he risk is presented of a substantial excursion by both sides into proof that the witness is or is not telling the truth as to a prior episode yet and extrinsic proof are two different issues.the ability to ask a witness about discrediting prior events always assuming a good faith basis for the question is worth a great deal.imagine if the defendant had been allowed to question the victims about their prior accusations,establish their similarity,and inquire into supposed recantations.the jury,hearing the questions and listening to the replies,might have gained a great deal even if neither side sought or was permitted to go further.
at.here,a pattern is not only suggestive of an underlying motive,it is even more so than what we,in white,considered suggestive because it shows the accusers potential animus against the defendant.see at if the prior accusations regarding other men were false,it suggests a pattern and a pattern suggests an underlying motive although without pinpointing its precise character.
further,the evidence of the uncharged allegations regarding the younger brothers is not cumulative of other evidence relevant to the accusers credibility.although the evidence that and recanted their allegations regarding the alleged abuse they themselves endured supports the inference that the children have a propensity to lie,it does not show the extent to which they were willing to go in their attempt to get abram out of the house or escape his presence.the children extraneous efforts in making false allegations regarding their younger brothers are relevant to show their animus toward the defendant.abram was entitled to a higher level of constitutional protection because the evidence of the uncharged allegations was essential to show and potential motive and animus toward the defendant.see redmond,at noting that credibility attacks based upon motive or bias are not subject to the limitations of generally applicable evidentiary rules.given that the trial court failed to consider the argument that the evidence was relevant to the children bias or motive,i find that it unreasonably applied federal law.
and uncharged allegations regarding their younger brothers are especially relevant and should have been allowed as a subject of controlled.but the trial court went even further,and barred any on this crucial subject.the facts here,like the facts in white,present an extreme case where the trial court should have extended the protections of the sixth amendment regardless of the petitioner ability to meet new hampshire demonstrably false standard 
first,the circumstances surrounding the uncharged allegations are similar in nature to and allegations against abram in.see white,at concluding that the evidence was considerably more powerful than general credibility evidence where the past accusations bore a marked resemblance to the accusers allegations against the defendant.both the and allegations were made on the heels of an argument between and abram,who was a strict disciplinarian,and during periods of time coextensive with the periods during which and claimed that abrams engaged in their long term sexual abuse.further,they involved minor children of the same household,all of whom were under abram custody and control.
second,there is a temporal proximity between the accusations and the accusations,during the latter of which renewed the previously recanted accusations she and made in.if the children lied about the accusations,then it makes it more likel
