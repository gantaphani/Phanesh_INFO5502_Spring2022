this is an appeal from a september,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york scheindlin,denying william henry richardson petition for a writ of habeas corpus.see richardson greene,wl,unpublished.although she denied the petition,judge scheindlin granted richardson a certificate of appealability on the question whether the state trial court should have foreclosed inquiry into the second step of the batson challenge after reconsidering its initial decision that the state juror challenges amounted to a pattern of discrimination.id.at.
we affirm the judgment of the district court,and hold that petitioner failed to preserve in his state criminal proceedings the arguments made in his federal collateral proceedings.his cause,therefore,can not be heard in this court.
background 
state proceedingsa.the criminal conviction 
in,richardson killed an individual over money,for which he was sentenced to years to life imprisonment by the new york criminal justice system.in,he was released on parole,and immediately began dealing illegal drugs.on the morning of january,richardson killed arundel snoop williams,his drug supplier,and charmaine kennedy,williams girlfriend,by shooting them in their heads.
richardson remained at liberty until february,when he was apprehended on a parole violation and charged by the new york district attorney with the murders of williams and kennedy.at his first trial,the jury failed to reach a verdict.at his second trial,which is the subject of this habeas appeal,richardson was convicted of the murders,and on january,he was sentenced to two consecutive terms of years to life imprisonment.
b.the voir dire 
as is well known,under the rule announced in batson kentucky,d,every person has a right to a trial before a jury impaneled without discrimination by race.id.at.a batson objection may be lodged when a party perceives a pattern of discrimination in the use of peremptory strikes during the voir dire,step one or the prima facie case of a batson challenge.step two requires that,upon a showing of a pattern of discrimination,the opposing party provide race neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes.finally,step three returns the ball to the challenger,who must then show that the professed race neutral reasons were pretextual and prove racial discrimination was the real motive.id.at.see mckinney artuz,cir.
the basis of richardson batson claim originated as follows.sixteen prospective jurors were initially seated for the voir dire at richardson second trial.two were subsequently excused,leaving fourteen prospective jurors subject to peremptory strikes.of the fourteen,five were african american women.
the prosecution initially struck four of the prospective jurors,two of whom were african american women,renee hall and darbi hegnew.defense counsel struck another four prospective jurors.four of the remaining prospective jurors then were sworn in as part of the jury two of that four were african american women.this left two prospective jurors of the original fourteen,one of whom was tanisha redmond,the final african american woman.when the prosecution struck redmond defense counsel raised an objection pursuant to step one of the batson framework,observing that the defendant was african american and that the people have used five challenges,three for african american females.
the prosecution protested that there was no pattern of racial discrimination in its peremptory strikes.however,without expressly ruling that there was such a pattern,the trial judge demanded that the prosecution provide race neutral reasons for its strikes.the prosecution then stated for the record,per batson step two,its reasons for peremptorily striking each of the african americans.with respect to hall,the prosecution stated 
i would say probably mostly a subjective view of her.i ca give a good reason.honestly,it had nothing to do with her race.my views are often very subjective.
id.at.this reason,which petitioner deems inadequate to survive a batson challenge,is central,it is the sole basis habeas petition now before this court.
thereupon the trial judge,without further comment,directed the prosecution to p ick one of the african american jurors.the prosecution then explained to the judge that it had already accepted two african americans as part of the jury.among the first twelve jurors subject to peremptory strikes,four were african american and the prosecution had accepted two of them i accepted,i believe,a fairly equal number.id.
at this point the trial judge realized that he had believed,mistakenly,that the prosecution had accepted only one african american juror among the five available in the entire jury pool of fourteen,when in fact the prosecution had accepted two.the trial judge then immediately reversed his initial determination pursuant to batson step one that there was a pattern of discrimination 
i apologize.i thought there was one.but you accepted two african americans 
that is my mistake.i thought you accepted only one.i may have picked up on something that defense counsel said which i misunderstood.i had the impression that out of four you had challenged three.that is in fact not correct.out of five you challenged three and kept well two.
i apologize to you both.if there had been three out of four i might have agreed with you.i would have been very suspicious.it is out of five african american s,three challenged,two accepted.where is the pattern 
the defense protested that there was,in fact,a pattern,noting that t hree of the prosecution five challenges have been african american females.id.at.but the trial judge was not persuaded.the prosecution reasons for striking each juror were irrelevant to the judge,for he misunderstood the count when he turned to the district attorney for the explanation,and this mistake caused him to demand an explanation which the district attorney was not required to give.id.at.the judge reversed his initial determination and ruled that there wa s no pattern of discrimination at batson step one.id.at.thus,in making this ruling,the judge did not consider whether the prosecution reasons were race neutral,per batson step two.
defense counsel took exception to the judge ruling that there was no pattern of discrimination,which the court noted.however,defense counsel did not take exception to the court authority to reconsider or revisit its initial step one determination nor did he contend that the prosecution arguably inadequate reasons at batson step two mooted any issue concerning batson step one.
the voir dire continued through several more rounds and several additional pools of prospective jurors.respondent represents that by the time the final jury was selected,five of the twelve jurors were african american.
c.the direct appeals 
richardson appealed his sentence and conviction on several grounds in the new york courts,including the batson issue.the appellate division rejected richardson batson claim because the defense did not establish a prima facie case of discrimination.people richardson,dep t.the appellate division also rejected richardson argument that the requirement of a prima facie case became moot 
b ased on a fair reading of the record of the voir dire,we find that although the prosecutor offered explanations for the challenges at issue,the court never ruled on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination.almost immediately after finding that a prima facie case had been established,the court retracted that determination upon its realization that it had been premised on a factual mistake as to the prosecutor exercise of challenges.
id.quotation marks and citation omitted.
richardson was granted leave to appeal to the court of appeals of new york.that court also rejected richardson batson claim,but on a ground different from the appellate division 
w e reject defendant contention that the trial court erroneously denied his batson claim.defendant asserts that the trial court could not revisit its finding of prima facie discrimination.defendant failure to raise this argument before the trial judge renders this issue unpreserved and beyond our review.
