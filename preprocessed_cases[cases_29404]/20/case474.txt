robert brennan appeals from judge owen decision sentencing him to months imprisonment for criminal contempt,to be served consecutively to appellant undischarged month sentence for bankruptcy fraud.appellant argues that the district court erred by i imposing a consecutive rather than a concurrent sentence ii wrongly calculating appellant criminal history category chc iii departing upwardly from the chc iv sentencing appellant under the larceny guideline rather than the obstruction of justice guideline v including certain funds in the loss amount calculation and vi denying appellant credit for acceptance of responsibility appellant also argues that his sentence should be vacated and remanded for resentencing by a different judge.
we agree only with appellant argument that his original chc was wrongly calculated and remand for resentencing on that issue we do not direct the remand to a different district judge.
background 
the facts relevant to appellant sentencing claim arise principally from an sec enforcement action against him,his bankruptcy,and his conviction for bankruptcy fraud.
a the sec action 
appellant was the chairman,founder,and sole owner of first jersey securities,fjs,a trading in penny stocks.in,the sec sued appellant and fjs for committing securities fraud involving about customers.sec first jersey secs,the sec action.on june,judge owen found appellant and fjs guilty of fraud,granted a permanent injunction against violations of the securities laws,and ordered appellant and fjs jointly and severally to disgorge approximately million million in principal and million in prejudgment interest.sec first jersey,cir 
b the bankruptcy and fraud 
on august,a few weeks after judge owen entered the million judgment against appellant,appellant filed for bankruptcy under chapter in the district of new jersey and became a debtor in possession.the bankruptcy court held that the million judgment in favor of the sec was nondischargeable.see sec brennan,cir.
prior to trial in the sec action,appellant had created two offshore asset protection trusts.he consented to an order by the bankruptcy judge freezing those assets.id.at.near the end of his trial in the sec action,appellant created a third offshore trust,the cardinal trust.united states brennan,cir.this trust was funded by approximately million in bearer bonds that appellant delivered to its trustee just before filing for bankruptcy.id.appellant did not disclose the existence of the cardinal trust in his original bankruptcy petition,id.at,and,when its existence was discovered,appellant valued his interest in it at,sec brennan,at.he also did not disclose his ownership of the million in bearer bonds or of about in casino chips,which he cashed after filing for bankruptcy.united states brennan,at.
the assets in the cardinal trust grew to approximately million by.id.at.in,appellant used million in assets from all three of the offshore trusts to purchase and refurbish a gambling boat,the palm beach princess the three trusts held a million mortgage on the boat that appellant did not disclose in his bankruptcy filings.appellant also continued to list his interest in the cardinal trust as,and the trust situs was moved twice to evade detection.id.at sec brennan,at.
appellant was indicted and convicted in new jersey of bankruptcy fraud for concealing the bearer bonds and casino chips and for money laundering of the bonds and their proceeds.on july,judge garrett brown sentenced appellant to months imprisonment.id.in calculating the loss amount under,the court included not only the value of the bearer bonds and casino chips but also the million in proceeds from investing these assets,giving a total loss amount of million.id.at.the court ordered restitution of,the value of the bearer bonds concealed by appellant.the third circuit affirmed appellant conviction and sentence in all respects.united states brennan,at.
c the april,freeze order 
in april,just prior to appellant indictment for bankruptcy fraud in new jersey,the sec moved before judge owen in the southern district for an order to show cause why appellant should not be held in civil contempt of the million disgorgement order entered in.sec brennan,at.judge owen granted the motion in an order issued on april.the order included the freeze order,which enjoined appellant and anyone working with or for him to 
hold and retain within their control,and otherwise prevent any disposition,transfer,pledge,encumbrance,assignment,dissipation,concealment or other disposal whatsoever of any funds or other assets of brennan that are not assets of his bankruptcy estate presently held by them,under their control or over which they exercise actual or apparent investment or other authority,in whatever form such assets may presently exist and wherever located.
on april,the district court modified the freeze order to allow appellant to compensate legal counsel,specifying that he could seek loans from third parties for that purpose.the loans were to be subordinated to his million debt to the sec the third parties were to provide certifications of the source and terms of the loans and appellant was to provide these certifications to the sec.the sec reserved the right to deem the order violated if the funds were advanced directly or indirectly by brennan,his family or any other person related to the bankruptcy estate or against whom the bankruptcy estate is pursuing a claim.
d offense of freeze order 
on may,two months before appellant was sentenced in the new jersey bankruptcy fraud case,judge owen issued a notice of a charge of criminal contempt notice to appellant under for violations of the freeze order.it was alleged that appellant failed to declare the palm beach princess as one of his assets and made a circuitous and covert transfer in june and july of out of the vessel to appellant criminal counsel in the bankruptcy fraud case.
as noted,the palm beach princess was purchased at least in part with million in funds from appellant three offshore trusts.the ship was nominally owned by mjq.on june,mjq transferred million to mjq development llc.francis murray,a friend of appellant,was the director of both mjq entities at the time.on july,mjq development transferred million to gs strategies,llc,which is wholly owned by murray.finally,on july,gs strategies paid murray by check.murray then transferred to michael critchley,appellant criminal defense counsel in new jersey,later that day.the location of the remaining million is unknown.
e appellant plea agreement and guilty plea 
on august,appellant entered into a written plea agreement regarding the criminal contempt charge.appellant pled guilty to the may contempt notice,which the plea agreement characterized as charging him with concealing and transferring between june and july,approximately to his bankruptcy fraud attorney.the agreement stipulated that the obstruction of justice guideline,was the most analogous offense guideline and thus applied to appellant contempt offense under and.assuming credit for acceptance of responsibility,this resulted in an offense level of with a stipulated chc of ii,appellant would face an to month sentence.appellant reserved the right to request that his sentence be imposed to run partially or wholly concurrently with his new jersey month bankruptcy fraud sentence.the agreement noted,however,that the length and other aspects of the sentence would be determined solely by the court.appellant thereafter entered a plea of guilty.
f appellant november letter to court 
on november,prior to his sentencing,appellant wrote a letter to judge owen.in the letter,appellant expressed his categorical and unqualified remorse for violating the freeze order.in an attempt to explain the circumstances of the offense,appellant claimed that,consistent with the freeze order,he gave the sec copies of all the promissory notes used to secure funds for the payment of attorneys in the case before judge owen.however,he admitted that he did not provide the sec with copies of the promissory notes underlying or otherwise disclose the loans to pay his criminal attorney in the new jersey bankruptcy case because he consciously did not want the sec informed about anything to do with that matter.appellant claimed that the payment from murray to appellant lawyer was,like the loans for which appellant provided documentation to the sec,bona fide,secured by a promissory note,and subordinated to the sec claim.appellant said that he did not disclose that loan to the sec because it related to his bankruptcy fraud proceeding.appellant admitted that he violated the freeze order by engaging in this transaction and not notifying the sec.
appellant attached what he claimed was a copy of the promissory note given to murray in exchange for the murray loaned to appellant.although the loan occurred,if at all,in july,the promissory note was dated july.moreover,the note was signed only by appellant.the district court found at sentencing that appellant fabricated the note.
g sentencing 
the sentencing proceedings consumed three days of hearings between december and june.appellant ultimate sentence differed from the plea agreement and psr recommendations in four ways first,the district court applied the larceny guideline,rather than the obstruction of justice guideline,id,and found a loss amount of million.the court reasoned that the larceny guideline was the most analogous to appellant contempt offense because appellant actions amounted,in essence,to stealing from assets that were set aside for his victims and creditors and giving them to his lawyer.a loss amount of million was deemed appropriate because that amount was transferred out of the palm beach princess,although appellant lawyer ultimately received only.
second,the court granted an upward departure under c on the grounds that appellant chc of ii substantially understated the seriousness of his prior similar misconduct established by civil adjudication third,the court denied appellant acceptance of responsibility points,noting appellant delay before pleading guilty,his fabrication of the promissory note and his lack of honesty in his admissions.fourth,the court made the sentence wholly consecutive,rather than concurrent,to appellant new jersey bankruptcy fraud sentence.based on these changes,appellant was sentenced to months imprisonment in addition to the months imposed by the new jersey court for bankruptcy fraud,rather than the to months suggested in the plea agreement.
discussion 
on appeal,appellant challenges his sentence,making the arguments listed in the opening paragraph of this opinion.
a consecutive versus concurrent sentencing 
contains three provisions regarding the imposition of a sentence consecutively or concurrently to a prior undischarged sentence.if the conduct underlying an instant offense occurred after sentencing in a prior proceeding,the later sentence must run consecutive to the earlier sentence.a where subsection a does not apply,and where the undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense s that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,the sentences must run concurrently.id.b.finally,in cases not governed by subsections a or b,the sentence for the instant offense may be imposed to run concurrently,partially concurrently,or consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.id.c policy statement.
we review the district court legal determination of whether to apply a,b,or c,de novo.united states rivers,cir.however,a district court sentencing decisions under c will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.united states livorsi,cir.
the meaning of fully taken into account 
appellant argues that his contempt sentence should run concurrently to his bankruptcy fraud sentence under section b or c because both sentences punished the same underlying conduct or course of conduct involving his concealment of the same assets,over the same period of time,from courts,regulators,and creditors.appellant relies on the fact that the funds transferred to his lawyer in the new jersey case were drawn from the concealed assets underlying his bankruptcy fraud conviction.
the goal of section is to ensure 
some coordination of sentences imposed with an eye toward having such punishments approximate the total penalty that would have been imposed had the sentences for the different offenses been imposed at the same time,had all of the offenses been prosecuted in a single proceeding.
witte united states,d.nevertheless,section b reference to offense s that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense is hardly unambiguous.we reduced some of the doubt by stating that the provision means actually accounted for.united states williams,cir.see also id.the guideline language is not hypothetical or abstract it does not refer to offenses that,in theory,could be fully taken into account.it suggests that the other offense must have been considered in fact in the defendant sentencing.we have also noted that the prior offense need not have been a cause of an increase in the defendant offense level to be deemed to have been fully taken into account.id.at.
the commission,in apparent recognition of its ambiguities,has amended section b to state that it applies in cases in which all of the prior offense i is relevant conduct to the instant offense and ii has resulted in an increase in the offense level for the instant offense,appl.the sentencing commission has styled this provision as a clarifying amendment.id.app c,amend.if so,we could consider it in interpreting previous versions of the section.see united states hendrickson,cir court can consider amendment subsequent to offense conduct that clarifies and simplifies guideline provisions.however,at least one court has held that the amendment is substantive rather than clarifying,united states rouse,cir,and we note that the amendment is somewhat at odds with williams statement that a prior offense may have been taken into account under section b even though it was not a cause of an increase in the defendant offense level.if the amendment is at odds with williams,it might arguably be deemed substantive,and its application in the present matter might violate the ex post facto clause.united states brennan,at ex post facto clause violated when court applies change in the law which is adverse to interests of a defendant where change occurred after commission of the crime,art.i,cl.we need not resolve this issue,however,because application of the amendment would not alter the result.
application of section b 
it can not be fairly said that judge owen considered all of the conduct underlying appellant bankruptcy fraud grounds for the earlier sentencing for the criminal contempt offense.
to be sure,the money at issue in the bankruptcy million originally concealed by appellant plus the million in the source of the heart of the criminal contempt by appellant out of the palm beach princess in violation of the freeze order.however,while the freeze order requirements surely overlapped in part with appellant obligations of full disclosure in the bankruptcy proceeding,they went beyond the original concealment of assets by appellant.they sought to preserve assets for the benefit of the sec they controlled the transfer or encumbrance by appellant and others of both known and concealed assets and,most importantly,they set out a procedure by which appellant might raise and spend funds for legal counsel.appellant was allowed to raise such funds by subordinated loans documented in certifications to the sec.appellant clearly violated these provisions by the transfer in question,by causing at least of the of fresh cash raised by subordinated be diverted to counsel,and by failing to inform the sec even though he was to his november letter to the court that the money was a loan.while the money diverted to the mjq entities,and in part to murray and then counsel,was drawn from the various sums concealed from the bankruptcy court,the conduct violating the freeze order involved prohibited transfers after the original concealment and violations of specific provisions designed to allow appellant to retain and pay counsel.the sentence imposed on appellant was therefore based on the specific conduct violating the freeze order,not the original concealment of assets that underlay the new jersey sentence.
this conclusion is fully supported by the fact that the particular conduct violating the freeze order was not considered by the new jersey district court when it sentenced appellant for fraud.appellant was sentenced by the court under section of the sentencing guidelines,although he argued that the guidelines applied.under the guidelines,appellant sentence could not have been enhanced on the ground that bankruptcy fraud was involved,although it could have been enhanced on the ground that it violated the freeze order under the guidelines,an enhancement was authorized for either a misrepresentation or other fraudulent action during the course of a bankruptcy proceeding or a violation of any prior,specific judicial or administrative order,injunction,decree,or process not addressed elsewhere in the guidelines.b b,c deleted and consolidated with by amendment,effective.the district court applied the enhancement under the guidelines only for committing fraud during a bankruptcy proceeding.see united states brennan,at 
appellant nevertheless argues that his bankruptcy fraud and contempt sentences must run concurrently because,at sentencing,the new jersey court expressly noted appellant failure to disclose the million investment in the gambling ship and his payment of from the ship to his attorney.in doing so,the court was reading or paraphrasing letters from the sec director of enforcement and from the bankruptcy trustee into the record.however,the court did not adopt the statements in the letters as findings of fact or suggest that the diversion of the million had any effect on appellant offense level or sentence.moreover,while the new jersey court mentioned these various violations of the freeze order,it never mentioned the freeze order itself rather,the court treated the violations as more instances of bankruptcy fraud.the new jersey court therefore indicated no appreciation of the additional,distinctive lawlessness of appellant conduct as violating a court order designed specifically to protect the sec and to allow appellant to retain private counsel indeed,the court may well have been unaware of the freeze order existence.
to be sure,the new jersey presentence report psr noted that brennan had been charged with criminal contempt in the southern district of new york however,the basis for that,the existence,substance,and violation of the freeze not mentioned in the psr.so far as the psr informed the new jersey court,the criminal contempt charge could have involved a wide variety of acts that had nothing to do with appellant disposition of his various assets.for example,appellant might have misbehaved in court or violated an order of some other kind.on this record,we must conclude that appellant would have received the same sentence in the new jersey court for the bankruptcy fraud had the million transfer not occurred and that,had he been sentenced by that court simultaneously for violation of the freeze order,a higher sentence would have been imposed.neither the language nor purpose of section b was therefore violated by the failure to impose a concurrent sentence.
propriety of a fully consecutive sentence under section c 
as noted,we review a district court sentencing decisions under section c for abuse of discretion.livorsi,at.application note of the commentary to section states that t o achieve a reasonable punishment and avoid unwarranted disparity,the court should consider the factors set forth in referencing a.these factors include 
the need for the sentence imposed 
a to reflect the seriousness of the offense,to promote respect for the law,and to provide just punishment for the offense 
b to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct 
c to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant and 
d to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training,medical care,or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.
appellant argues that the district court failed to give an adequate explanation for imposing a consecutive sentence.but n othing in the language of the guideline or its commentary requires district courts to make specific findings with respect to any or all of the factors listed in the commentary or a.united states velasquez,cir.moreover,the court here did make findings relevant to a section c decision.after determining appellant offense level and chc,the court discussed his long criminal history and the purposes of sentencing.the court first remarked that appellant criminal history was extensive and ongoing,even within the last year or so,and that i really do see any remorse in all this.the court also noted that deterrence of others is a purpose of sentencing,and it was reluctant to send a message that this kind of conduct,continuing long after the bankruptcy case and long after the million judgment does not deserve punishment.
given the district court explicit consideration of several of the section a factors,as well as the fact that neither of appellant sentencing proceedings accounted for the offense conduct at issue in the other,the imposition of a consecutive sentence under section c was in no way an abuse of discretion.see livorsi,at subsection c accords broad discretion to district courts in fashioning sentences,and we can discern no reason to upset the district court decision,based as it was on a review of all relevant factors.
b original chc and upward departure 
appellant claims that his original chc should have been i rather than ii,and that the court upward departure from a chc of ii to iii was erroneous.we agree with his first argument but reject his second.
appellant original chc 
assigning appellant a chc of ii based on his prior sentence for bankruptcy fraud in new jersey was error.section of the guidelines prescribes the allocation of criminal history points for each prior sentence,defined as any sentence previously imposed for conduct not part of the instant offense.a.conduct that is part of the instant offense is defined as conduct that is relevant conduct to the instant offense under section.id.appl.note.finally,section defines relevant conduct as all acts and omissions committed,aided,abetted,counseled,commanded,induced,procured,or willfully caused by the defendant that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.id.a a,a.see united states thomas,cir.thus,a sentence imposed for conduct that was part of the same course of conduct as the offense of conviction is not a prior sentence within the meaning of section.
acts may be found to be part of the same course of conduct if the defendant engaged in a repeated pattern of similar criminal acts,even if they were not performed pursuant to a single scheme or plan.thomas,at internal citation omitted.see also united states perdomo,cir the same course of conduct concept looks to whether the defendant repeats the same type of criminal activity over time.it does not require that acts be connected together by common participants or by an overall scheme.united states butler,cir acts of arson and assault in aid of a scheme of extortion against a given victim,though different in kind,could support a finding of common scheme or plan.
appellant bankruptcy fraud and criminal contempt were part of the same course of conduct,in that they constituted a repeated pattern of similar criminal acts.thomas,at.all involved concealing,laundering,investing,and using of appellant assets for appellant own purposes without the knowledge or consent of the bankruptcy estate or appellant judgment creditors.the court therefore erred in imposing criminal history points on appellant based on the new jersey bankruptcy fraud sentence,and his original chc should have been 
we note in this regard that the government only response on the merits to appellant argument is a footnote stating that the argument fails for the same reasons that section b does not mandate a concurrent sentence.however,the standard of whether conduct is part of a course of conduct or a repeated pattern is not the same as the standard of whether conduct was fully accounted for by a sentencing court.indeed,the recent amendment to section b discussed above recognizes that very distinction by stating that concurrent sentences are mandatory when the prior offense is relevant conduct to the instant offense and actually resulted in an increased offense level for the instant offense.
there is a procedural problem with appellant argument,however.appellant failed to object to the chc of ii at sentencing,and we may overturn the determination only if it constitutes plain error.see.b united states whab,cir.to establish plain error,appellant must show not only that the error occurred and was that he has also that it affected substantial rights.united states olano,d.finally,even if appellant satisfies these three requirements,correcting the error is within our discretion,which we should not exercise unless the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.internal quotation marks omitted,alteration in original.however,we have previously remanded an incorrect chc determination as plain error where that determination might have affected a defendant sentence.united states walker,cir.
in this case,it is possible that appellant incorrect chc calculation affected his substantial rights by subjecting him to a longer sentence than he would otherwise have received.in light of walker,we exercise our discretion to redress a plain error and find that appellant original chc was i.a remand for resentencing is therefore necessary.
upward departure based on administrative adjudications 
whether the alteration in appellant chc will affect his sentence depends upon the availability and extent of an upward departure.having upwardly departed from a chc of ii,the district court can be expected to depart again based on a chc of i,and,in the interests of judicial economy,we address appellant arguments that any departure is error as a matter of law.
we review a court decision to depart de novo.united states butler,cir.the district court decision to depart upwardly from appellant chc of ii,based on prior civil adjudications,was not error.
section a includes a policy statement that i f reliable information indicates that the chc does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes,the court may consider imposing a sentence departing from the otherwise applicable guideline range.the guideline lists five types of reliable information that a district court may consider in reaching its conclusion,including prior similar misconduct established by a civil adjudication or by a failure to comply with an administrative order.id.c.the guideline example of such misconduct is a similar instance of large scale fraudulent misconduct established by an adjudication in a securities and exchange commission enforcement proceeding.id.the guideline does not define similar,but we have held that prior conduct need not have been of an identical type.united states mayo,cir fraudulently obtaining loans and arson similar where purpose of arson was,like purpose of obtaining loans,to disadvantage financial institutions in their loan dealings with defendant.
in determining that appellant chc underrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history,the district court relied on i its own finding in the sec action that appellant defrauded his hundreds of thousands of customers and ii five prior instances in which appellant agreed to civil sanctions including suspensions,censures,fines,and injunctions.sec first jersey securities.at.appellant argues that he never admitted wrongdoing in those five instances and that as a matter of law they can not be deemed reliable information under section.this argument is entirely meritless and is irrelevant in any case,because the massive fraud underlying the sec action itself certainly constitutes a similar instance of large scale fraudulent misconduct established by an adjudication in a securities and exchange commission enforcement proceeding sufficient to merit an upward departure.
because we do not have before us the issue of the reasonableness of the extent of any upward be determined on need not address it,other than to say that nothing in this opinion necessarily precludes a reimposition of the original sentence.this issue can be reviewed if and when it arises.see united states cox,cir reviewing extent of departure for reasonableness.
c application of the larceny guideline and calculation of loss amount 
the sentencing guidelines direct that courts apply the most analogous guideline to criminal contempt offenses.we affirm the district court determination that the larceny guideline was the most analogous,as well as the court loss amount finding.
use of larceny guideline 
we generally review a district court selection of an applicable guideline de novo.united states cefalu,cir.however,the determination under ussg as to whether there is a single most analogous offense guideline,and,if not,how to proceed under b,involves the application of a guideline to the facts of a case,and e mandates that we give due deference to such applications by the district court,rather than review them de novo.id see also united states versaglio,cir determination of most analogous offense guideline is predominantly an application of a guideline to the facts,a decision to which we should give due deference.
the court applied the larceny guideline because it found that appellant contumacious conduct amounted to stealing money from the palm beach princess that should have gone to his victims or creditors.we agree an application note to the contempt guideline specifies that f or offenses involving the willful failure to pay child support violations of,the most analogous guideline is larceny,embezzlement,and other forms of theft.the amount of the loss is the amount of child support that the defendant willfully failed to pay,appl.appellant principal argument against application of the larceny guideline is that it does not apply to misappropriation of one own property.however,application note specifically contemplates using the guideline for such misappropriation.furthermore,the larceny guideline has been used to sentence those convicted of theft of property held in trust for another.united states nolan,cir embezzlement of pension funds by pension fund manager united states arjoon,cir embezzlement by bank employee of stock held by bank as collateral for loan.but see united states tankersley,cir applying obstruction of justice guideline to a criminal contempt offense where the defendant sold his own yacht,which was subject to freeze order in underlying civil case,and hid proceeds of sale.
although the obstruction of justice guideline is frequently used as the guideline most analogous to a contempt offense,the application note to section states only that i n certain cases,the contemptuous offense conduct will be sufficiently analogous to obstruction of justice for that guideline to apply,appl.c ourts can not be bound to sentence under the obstruction of justice guideline any time they find an intent to obstruct justice.cefalu,at.rather,a court may consider,inter alia,i whether the contumacious conduct resembles the offenses listed in the obstruction guideline and ii whether the lack of flexibility of the obstruction guideline is suited to adequately punishing the contempt offense.see id.at.
the background section of the obstruction of justice guideline describes the n umerous offenses of varying seriousness that may constitute obstruction of justice as follows 
using threats or force to intimidate or influence a juror or federal officer obstructing a civil or administrative proceeding stealing or altering court records unlawfully intercepting grand jury deliberations obstructing a criminal investigation obstructing a state or local investigation of illegal gambling using intimidation or force to influence testimony,alter evidence,evade legal process,or obstruct the communication of a judge or law enforcement officer or causing a witness bodily injury or property damage in retaliation for providing testimony,information or evidence in a federal proceeding.the conduct that gives rise to the violation may,therefore,range from a mere threat to an act of extreme violence.
background.appellant money frozen by a court order for the benefit of a party to resembles none of these examples,all of which describe conduct that actually and directly seeks to hinder or corrupt a judicial proceeding.appellant conduct sought to deprive a party of the benefit of such a proceeding and,as the district court pointed out,was more akin to stealing from creditors than hindering or corrupting the proceeding.
also,the obstruction guideline is insufficiently flexible to deal with a contempt offense such as appellant,which may be of widely varying degrees of seriousness depending on the amount of money transferred.if the obstruction guideline were applied to his contempt offense,appellant offense level would be the same whether he removed or million from the palm beach princess.appellant punishment thus fits his crime more closely when a guideline is used that relates offense level to the amount of money taken.
we therefore affirm the district court reliance on the larceny guideline as the guideline most analogous to appellant contemptuous conduct 
loss amount determination 
the district court loss amount determination not clearly erroneous.a district court factual findings relating to loss must be established by a preponderance of the evidence,united states sasso,cir,and we review them for clear error.united states abbey,cir per curiam.the commentary to defines loss under the larceny guideline as the value of the property taken,damaged,or destroyed.appl.note.
the issue here is not whether million was transferred from the palm beach princess but whether brennan was responsible for more than of that transfer.although it is true that only of the million could be traced to appellant attorney,brennan had share of the boat the diversion of to his attorney was more than sufficient to show that he played at the least a substantial role in the transfer.it was not clear error,therefore,for the court to conclude that the entire amount was a loss attributable to brennan violation of the freeze order.the million was transferred out of the boat as a unit it followed a circuitous and covert path as a unit it was divided only at the last step,after it reached murray,appellant close friend and the only traceable funds from that division were used for brennan benefit.no more is needed to support the court finding.
d acceptance of responsibility 
appellant also he was entitled as a matter of law to credit for acceptance of responsibility.a district court determination of whether a defendant has accepted responsibility is a factual finding that will not be disturbed unless it is without foundation.united states reyes,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the district court conclusion that appellant did not accept responsibility for his conduct was well founded,and we affirm it.
one consideration in favor of determining that a defendant has accepted responsibility is his truthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense s of conviction,appl.a.however,appellant repeatedly sought to minimize or conceal the extent of his guilt by grossly misstating the facts.in his november letter and in his statements and submissions to the court during sentencing,appellant argued that the loan from murray was bona fide,did not result from a transfer of appellant assets out of the boat,and was only in violation of the freeze order because appellant failed to send a copy of his promissory note to murray to the sec.appellant submitted a document to the court that purported to be the note at issue but that the court determined was fabricated.this determination was not error in fact,the note was not fully executed and bore a date that was a year after the transaction.to this date,brennan refuses to accept responsibility for the full million transferred out of the palm beach princess.accordingly,there is more than sufficient foundation to deny appellant credit for acceptance of responsibility 
e remand to a different judge 
we can direct that a case be assigned to a different judge for resentencing in unusual circumstances,united states robin,cir per curiam in banc describing the grounds on which reassignment would be appropriate.where personal bias of the judge is not alleged,robin directs us to consider the following factors 
whether the original judge would reasonably be expected upon remand to have substantial difficulty in putting out of his or her mind views or findings determined to be erroneous or based on evidence that must be rejected,whether reassignment is advisable to preserve the appearance of justice,and whether reassignment would entail waste and duplication out of proportion to any gain in preserving the appearance of fairness.
id.at.reassignment will not usually be warranted merely because a sentencing judge has been shown to have held erroneous views,united states bradley,cir.moreover,a misapprehension of the law is not the sort of view that one would have difficulty putting out of one mind,once it was corrected.united states gonzalez,cir per curiam internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
remand to a different judge is not warranted here.appellant has not alleged or shown that judge owen was biased against him but,rather,argues that the robin factors militate in favor of reassignment.they do not.the only error made by the district court was a legal one in determining appellant original chc,which after all was suggested in the plea agreement this type of previously expressed view is not difficult to put out of one mind.
appellant argues that the appearance of fairness requires reassignment because judge owen committed errors in the case and because some of judge owen orders in the sec action were reversed,thus making him appear partial.appellant also claims that since judge owen filed the criminal contempt charge and presided over it,his impartiality is in question.both arguments are entirely meritless.given the twenty year length of this proceeding,our occasional disagreement with some of judge owens rulings is absolutely no basis for remand to a different judge.moreover,the united states code itself contemplates that a judge will preside over a criminal contempt case in which he filed the charge.see a court shall have power to punish contempt of its authority.finally,reassigning the case to a different judge would certainly entail waste and duplication out of proportion to any gain in preserving the appearance of fairness,robin,at,because judge owen has held three sentencing hearings already and is fully versed in the complicated facts of this case.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we remand for resentencing in light of the fact that appellant original chc was i rather than ii.otherwise we affirm.
after argument,the supreme court decided blakely washington,d,which cast some doubt on the constitutionality of the federal sentencing guidelines.we nevertheless apply the guidelines under united states mincey,cir,which held that u nless and until the supreme court rules otherwise,the law in this circuit remains that the federal sentencing guidelines are constitutional.
the mandate in this case will be held pending the supreme court decision in united states booker,wl,argued october.should any party believe there is a need for the district court to exercise jurisdiction prior to the supreme court decision,it may file a motion seeking issuance of the mandate in whole or in part.although any petition for rehearing should be filed in the normal course pursuant to rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure,the court will not reconsider those portions of its opinion that address the defendant sentence until after the supreme court decision in booker.in that regard,the parties will have until fourteen days following the supreme court decision to file supplemental petitions for rehearing in light of booker.
the court also appointed a special agent to examine whether appellant and fjs had com
