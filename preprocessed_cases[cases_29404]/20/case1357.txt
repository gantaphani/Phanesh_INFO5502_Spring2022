ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court decision to grant or deny a habeas petition de novo.murphy ohio,cir.because treesh filed his habeas petition after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,we may grant the writ with respect to a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.murphy,at quoting d.a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases or if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from that precedent.id.at quoting williams taylor.a decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case,or if it either unreasonably extends or unreasonably refuses to extend a legal principle from supreme court precedent to a new context.id.at quotation marks and citations omitted.
c learly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.williams,at.moreover,t he state court decision need not cite supreme court cases,or even evince an awareness of supreme court cases,so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the decision contradicts them.williams bagley,cir quoting early packer,per curiam.
miranda violation 
treesh argues that the trial court admitted statements obtained from him in violation of miranda.specifically,he contends that he was never fully apprised of his miranda rights,he did not knowingly and intelligently waive those rights,his request for counsel was ignored,his statements were not voluntary,and the state court conclusions to the contrary were contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
sufficiency of warnings 
in miranda,the supreme court established certain procedural safeguards that require police to advise criminal suspects of their rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments before commencing custodial interrogation.ducksworth eagan.in particular,miranda prescribed the following four warnings 
a suspect must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent,that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law,that he has the right to the presence of an attorney,and that if he can not afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.
miranda,at.although these precise words do not have to be used,the warnings must reasonably convey to a suspect his rights as required by miranda.florida powell,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
when officer janusczak arrested treesh around on august,he recited a full set of miranda warnings.he then asked treesh if he understood his rights.after treesh failed to respond,janusczak began to repeat the warnings,but treesh interrupted him and said yeah,yeah,i know.the cleveland police department held treesh in a cruiser at the scene of his arrest until the euclid police department took over custody.treesh was then transported to the euclid city jail,where he showered before being transported to the eastlake police station around to.when treesh arrived at the station,he was immediately taken into a booking room where lieutenant doyle gave treesh the following version of the miranda warnings 
you understand you under arrest you been arrested before.
do you understand your miranda rights i going to ask you some questions over the next hour or so,two hours or three hours.you have a right to answer the questions that i ask,or you can stop me at any time.if you ca afford an attorney,one will be appointed.
do you understand me okay.
according to doyle,treesh twice indicated during this interview that he understood his rights.he did not affirmatively request an attorney or invoke his right to remain silent.instead,treesh agreed to talk to doyle and was then interrogated for approximately one hour and minutes.sometime during the interview,doyle asked treesh if he remembered his rights 
q do you understand your miranda rights okay,i told them to you before,right why do you tell me.
a i have the right to remain silent.anything i say can and will be used against me in a court of law,blase,blase,blase.
q you have a right to an attorney.okay.
after this interview,treesh was placed in a jail cell,but was awakened shortly before and returned to the booking room.doyle read the miranda warnings to treesh before beginning this interview 
doyle before we start talking again,just as i told you before,you know your miranda rights.you know i a police officer.you know you under arrest,you at the police station.i going to ask you some questions 
treesh rights before.
doyle pardon 
treesh you gave me the rights before.
doyle okay,and i plan on continuing doing that.what i have to tell you,though,again,i going to ask you questions and you do have to answer the questions.
doyle if you decide to answer the questions,you can stop me at any time.you have a right to an attorney.
treesh i already know all my rights.
doyle okay,but i going to tell you them.
treesh okay.
doyle if you ca afford one,one will be appointed for you.then i got to say,will you talk to me anyway 
treesh yeah.
doyle do you understand your rights 
treesh yeah.
around,fbi special agent alford advised treesh,both orally and in writing,of his miranda rights.the form alford gave treesh included all four required miranda warnings.treesh signed the form indicating that he waived those rights.alford interviewed treesh for about an hour to an hour and a half.at,doyle interviewed treesh again.during that interview,he again advised treesh of his miranda rights,both orally and in writing,and obtained a written waiver from treesh.around,doyle interviewed treesh and brooks together.when doyle told them that the store clerk was alive and had made a statement to police,they requested an attorney.this was treesh first request for an attorney since being arrested treesh indicated that he would give a statement,but only if they assured him they would not seek the death penalty.when doyle told him they would not make any deals,treesh refused to give any statements regarding their involvement in the vine street news robbery and murder.however,treesh and brooks spoke about the involvement of others during the eastlake murder and of crimes committed in other states.
the ohio supreme court concluded that the warnings that treesh received from doyle before and during his first interrogation were incomplete.treesh,at.although treesh testified that janusczak did not read the miranda warnings upon his arrest,the ohio supreme court affirmed the trial court implicit conclusion that the arresting officer did recite all four miranda warnings.id.at though the testimony at the suppression hearing conflicted as to whether the arresting officer actually recited the miranda warnings,the trial court implicitly found the arresting officer testimony about the arrest to be more credible than treesh we will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court on this issue.internal citation omitted.treesh has not presented clear and convicting evidence to indicate that this factual conclusion was erroneous.see james,at.
the ohio supreme court went on to conclude that janusczak full arrest warning,viewed in conjunction with the partial rewarnings at the interrogations,indicates that treesh was sufficiently apprised of his miranda rights.treesh,at.the question before us,then,is whether the ohio supreme court conclusion that doyle incomplete warnings were sufficient to remind treesh of the previously recited miranda rights was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.we hold that it was not.
in reaching its conclusion,the ohio supreme court relied on wyrick fields.treesh,at.the supreme court in fields concluded that a suspect did not need to be readvised of his miranda rights,which he had waived in writing before the initiation of a polygraph examination,because the circumstances had not changed so seriously that his answers no longer were voluntary and his waiver was still knowing and intelligent.at.since fields,t he courts have generally rejected a per se rule as to when a suspect must be readvised of his rights after the passage of time or a change in questioners.united states weekley,cir concluding that officers did not need to readvise suspect of his miranda rights where he was read his rights upon his arrest,reminded of his rights during transport and again in the elevator before he was questioned internal quotation marks omitted.instead,we apply a test when considering whether a delay between reading the miranda warnings and custodial interrogation requires the interrogating officers to readvise the suspect of his miranda rights.id.at.
under fields,additional warnings are only required if the circumstances seriously changed between the initial warnings and the interrogation.fields,at.between janusczak warnings and doyle questioning of treesh,he was taken first to the euclid city jail then to the eastlake police department.however,only approximately two hours had passed between his arrest and his interrogation.additionally,doyle partially readvised treesh of his miranda rights,which alerted treesh to the fact that he could still invoke those rights.treesh recitation of at least three of those rights during his interview also demonstrates that he was aware of his rights.accordingly,the ohio supreme court conclusion that doyle was not required to fully readvise treesh of his miranda rights was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of fields,particularly in light of the application of fields by our sister circuits.see,united states clay,cir no need for rewarning where there was no evidence that suspect no longer understood the warnings or did not understand their applicability to interrogation that occurred two days after initial warning united states ex rel.patton thieret,cir miranda rights did not need to be reread after forty minute lapse evans mccotter,cir rights voluntarily waived where suspect was twice advised of rights over a period notwithstanding change of interview locations stumes solem,cir interval between first and second interviews did not invalidate suspect waiver given before the first interview jarrell balkcom,cir change in interrogators and lapse did not render confession inadmissible united states ex rel.henne fike,cir nine hours between warnings and waiver not too long.
treesh contends that the ohio supreme court conclusion that treesh heard and understood the miranda warnings recited by janusczak and that he waived those rights involved unreasonable applications of clearly established federal law.he also argues that the state courts failed to make a determination as to whether treesh waiver was knowing and intelligent.instead,treesh contends that the ohio supreme court wrongly consolidated its analysis of the voluntariness of the waiver with its analysis of whether treesh waiver was made knowingly and intelligently.we consider that argument first.
knowing and intelligent waiver 
we begin by noting that to the extent treesh raised this issue before the ohio supreme court,he failed to articulate clearly that he was challenging whether his waiver was knowing and intelligent.given treesh failure to clearly raise the issue before the ohio supreme court,it is not surprising that the court treatment of the issue was not entirely cogent.nonetheless,the ohio supreme court implicitly concluded that treesh waiver was knowing and intelligent.although the ohio supreme court never explicitly stated that treesh made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights,it acknowledged that waivers must be knowing and intelligent.treesh,at it is well established that a defendant who is subjected to custodial interrogation must be advised of his or her miranda rights and make a knowing and intelligent waiver of those rights before statements obtained during interrogation will be admissible.it also considered factors relevant to that analysis.for example,in examining the facts underlying his claim,the court noted that doyle testified that treesh did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol,and that treesh acknowledged awareness of his rights several times throughout the interviews and eventually signed two written waivers of his rights.id.at.the court held that treesh was sufficiently apprised of his miranda rights,id.at,and went on to conclude that appellant waiver was not improperly obtained,id.at.
a suspect may waive his miranda rights provided the waiver is made voluntarily,knowingly,and intelligently.miranda,at.the waiver inquiry has two distinct dimensions.berghuis thompkins,quoting moran burbine.
first,the relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,coercion,or deception.second,the waiver must have been made with a full awareness both of the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.only if the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the miranda rights have been waived.
moran,at.an express written or oral statement of waiver is not required.north carolina butler.moreover,although mere silence is not enough to establish a waiver,silence,coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver,may support a conclusion that a defendant has waived his rights.id.thus,w here the prosecution shows that a miranda warning was given and that it was understood by the accused,an accused uncoerced statement establishes an implied waiver of the right to remain silent.thompkins.at.
the ohio supreme court conclusion that treesh waived his rights was not an unreasonable application of federal law.when treesh failed to respond after janusczak asked treesh if he understood the rights just read to him,janusczak began to recite the miranda warnings again.treesh interrupted him,however,and said yeah,yeah,i know.he later indicated to doyle that he understood his rights admittedly after an incorrect recitation of those rights,and agreed to talk.additionally,treesh was able to at least partially recite his miranda rights.although he never specifically stated that he waived his rights,such a showing is not required to prove waiver.see id.at.treesh actions indicated that he was aware of his rights and that he waived them.he never invoked his right to counsel or his right to silence.considering the circumstances,the ohio supreme court conclusion that treesh waived those rights was not an unreasonable application of federal law.
additionally,the record indicates that the ohio supreme court did not unreasonably apply federal law in concluding that treesh waiver was knowing and intelligent.to be deemed knowing and intelligent,t he constitution does not require that a criminal suspect know and understand every possible consequence of a waiver of the fifth amendment privilege.spring,at.instead,we examine the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the case,including the background,experience,and conduct of the accused,garner mitchell,cir alterations in original quoting johnson zerbst,to determine whether the suspect knew that he could choose not to talk to law enforcement officers,to talk only with counsel present,or to discontinue talking at any time,id.alterations in original quoting spring,at.t he supreme court has never said that impairments from drugs,alcohol,or other similar substances can negatively impact a suspect waiver of his miranda rights.matylinsky budge,cir.
the evidence supports the ohio supreme court implicit conclusion that treesh knowingly and intelligently waived his rights.he appears to have understood the rights janusczak read to him,evidenced by his interrupting janusczak second recitation of those rights and saying yeah,yeah,i know.additionally,he continuously told officers who interrogated him that his rights had been read to him and was even able to partially recite those rights.moreover,every officer who interrogated treesh testified that he appeared to be coherent,was not confused or disoriented by the questions they asked,and did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.in further support of the conclusion that treesh made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights,treesh ultimately signed a written waiver.treesh later testified that he was familiar with the criminal justice system,that he knew his rights,and that he knew where he was when he arrived at the eastlake police station.given the officer testimony regarding treesh mental state,as well as treesh statements to police and other indications that he understood his rights,it was not unreasonable for the ohio supreme court to conclude that treesh knowingly and intelligently waived his miranda rights.
voluntariness of the waiver 
in his brief,treesh contends that even if he had been properly warned of and had knowingly waived his miranda rights,his statements were not voluntary,because he was coerced into confessing when officer doyle lied to him by falsely claiming that a video tape of the crime existed,and by exploiting treesh desire to exonerate his girl friend.treesh also argues that the officers were overreaching by exploiting treesh exhaustion and high.nonetheless,he cites no case law in support of his argument.
i t is a settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.united states elder,cir quoting united states zannino,cir see also united states layne,cir deeming issue waived where defendant did not make a legal argument regarding the issue.because treesh has not developed a legal argument regarding the voluntariness of his statement,he has forfeited this issue on appeal.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
treesh asserts that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel when trial counsel failed to challenge jurors cynthia barth and barbara modica for cause.cynthia barth took paralegal classes taught by the prosecutor in this case,charles coulson.the trial judge asked barth whether t he fact that coulson was her instructor would put her in a position that she could not listen to the case and render a fair and impartial verdict barth responded that it would not.coulson followed up on the issue with the following exchange 
coulson barth,i see you are a paralegal.did i help you get there 
coulson do you think your experience as a paralegal would in any way interfere with your ability to listen to the law as the judge gives it to you and apply it in this case 
barth no,i think it would help actually.
coulson you think you might be able to understand these instructions even better 
barth hopefully.
coulson well if i did any good,i hope so.i had you for research and writing 
coulson i think you mentioned that.
barth actually i think that your paralegal was there more than you were.i did mean to embarrass you.
treesh trial counsel did not ask barth any questions about her relationship with coulson.counsel passed for cause and barth was seated as a juror.
during voir dire,modica admitted that she had seen media reports about the case and made statements suggesting that she was predisposed in favor of the death penalty.modica stated that she had read three to four articles about the case in the cleveland plain dealer,that she followed the case,found it interesting,had discussed the case with friends but not at great length,and that she would presume the articles were pretty much accurate.however,she noted that she did not believe everything she read in the newspaper.modica also stated that she would be able to ignore what she read and decide the case based on the evidence presented in the courtroom.treesh counsel did not regarding modica exposure to the case.in response to her statement that she believed in the death penalty,however,treesh counsel had the following exchange with modica 
hawkins you indicated to both the judge and the prosecutor that you favor the death penalty,that correct 
modica when it warranted it seems to me that if someone is judged guilty of a crime that heinous enough to even bring that charge against him,if he guilty i do see even why he should be up and walking around.
hawkins now,you said heinous crime,what crimes did you have in mind when you said that 
modica well,murder is what i am thinking.
hawkins do you think anybody that purposely kills another,purposely murders another themselves should be put to death 
modica no if it was something happens that was planned ahead of time,do know exactly i am thinking maybe if you did it out of a moment of instant passion,or something like that.
nonetheless,modica also mentioned several factors that would impact her decision regarding the death penalty,including a person reasons for committing murder,whether he was mentally retarded or had developmental difficulties,and whether he was under the influence of drugs.she also stated that she would be able to make a decision based on the ev
