sandra griffin filed a petition for habeas relief in april of.in september of,the district court dismissed her petition without prejudice as she had not exhausted her state remedies.when she returned to federal court in october of,her petition was dismissed as untimely pursuant to the limitations period under d.in,this court vacated the district court dismissal of griffin petition and remanded for further proceedings in order to determine whether the petitioner was entitled to equitable tolling.griffin rogers.in january of,the district court,adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge,ruled that griffin was not entitled to equitable tolling and dismissed the case for failure to file within the limitations period.griffin timely appealed the district court dismissal.
in palmer carlton,cir,this court adopted a stay and abeyance procedure for habeas petitions that raise both exhausted and unexhausted claims.the exhausted portions of these petitions were to be stayed while the petitioner returned to state court.these stays were to be conditioned upon the petitioner pursuing state court remedies within a brief interval,normally days,after the stay is entered and returning to federal court within a similarly brief interval,normally days after state court exhaustion is completed.also,in palmer,this court determined that it would be appropriate to apply these stays retroactively to petitioners like griffin,whose claims were dismissed rather than stayed.
when this case was last before this court,it was unclear whether griffin had complied with the window that palmer prescribes for pursuing state remedies after a federal dismissal.the record simply did not include that information.on remand,it was conceded that griffin did not proceed to state court for over six months,well beyond the window suggested by palmer.the district court refused to equitably toll the limitations period as griffin had not filed within the time frame.the only issue on appeal is whether the district court was correct in rejecting griffin request for equitable tolling.
while griffin is not entitled to the mandatory equitable tolling prescribed in palmer,the district court was incorrect to treat the window as a hard,retroactive deadline that precludes the court consideration of her claims on the merits.even if griffin is not entitled to the automatic equitable tolling under palmer,she is entitled to relief under this court traditional equitable tolling analysis.the dismissal of the district court is therefore reversed and the petition is remanded for consideration on the merits.
this court thoroughly summarized the factual and procedural history essential to griffin current appeal in its opinion 
in,a trial judge in ohio state court found sandra maxwell griffin guilty of complicity to aggravated murder with specifications,complicity to unlawful possession of a dangerous ordnance,complicity to grand theft,and complicity to aggravated robbery with a firearm specification.griffin then obtained new counsel and unsuccessfully appealed her case to the ohio supreme court,arguing that the trial court had violated her fifth,eighth,and fourteenth amendment rights by not following certain state laws regarding her waiver of trial by jury or by panel and regarding the length of her sentence.she lost her appeals,and her conviction became final in.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa became effective on april,and prisoners whose state convictions already had become final were required to file any petitions for habeas corpus relief within one year of that date.see isham randle,cir,cert.denied,d.represented by the ohio public defender office,griffin filed for habeas corpus relief on april.the petition was assigned to judge holschuh.although in her initial petition griffin raised just one ground for relief,namely the trial court failure to follow mandatory statutory requirements of a proceeding in violation of her due process and equal protection rights,at,in her reply to the warden return of writ she expanded her claims.griffin argued that her waiver of trial by jury or by a panel,as provided under ohio law,was neither knowing nor intelligent and that her sentence exceeded that permitted under law.the district court determined that these were clearly distinct from the argument that she presented to the state courts,noted that the new arguments appear to have been procedurally defaulted,and offered griffin the opportunity to demonstrate cause and prejudice before the court would dismiss the claims as procedurally defaulted.at dist.order.griffin argued that the cause of her failure to present the arguments in state court was her counsel ineffective assistance.
judge holschuh ruled that,although ineffective assistance of appellate counsel can constitute cause for procedural default,the petitioner must present the ineffective assistance claim itself to the state courts before using it to excuse the default.because griffin had not brought that claim to the state courts,she could not yet present it to the federal court in a habeas petition.judge holschuh concluded,if she wishes,at some point,to make such an ineffective assistance argument here,petitioner must present her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel to the state courts.at dist.order.on september,the court denied her petition and dismissed the case without prejudice for her failure to establish cause for her procedural default.at.
at.after her habeas petition was dismissed,griffin filed an application to reopen in state court pursuant to ohio rule of appellate procedure b in order to pursue her unexhausted ineffective assistance claim.
when this case was last before this court,the record did not indicate when griffin filed this application to reopen.the current record reflects that griffin,represented by the ohio public defender office,filed her application to reopen on april,approximately six and one half months after the district court dismissal on september.at application for reopening.this application was dismissed as untimely by the ohio court of appeals on may.ohio court of appeals judgment.the ohio supreme court dismissed her appeal without opinion on september.
after the dismissal of her application to reopen,griffin attempted to return to federal court to pursue her habeas petition 
griffin then returned to judge holschuh,filing on october,a habeas petition under her previous case number.in her,she alerted the court to the fact that she was filing it under the original case number,because it merely continued her previous attack.she also noted that,because her previous filing had been dismissed without prejudice to permit exhaustion,this subsequent filing was not a second or successive petition prohibited under b.at.in this petition,griffin also included notice of the claims that she had brought in her state application to reopen.however,on friday,october,judge holschuh ordered the clerk to strike griffin new filing under the previous case number and directed the clerk to file it with a new case number and assign it to a judge using the ordinary selection process.at dist.order.judge holschuh noted that because the previous case had closed and the petitioner had offered no grounds to reopen the previous case,the petition should be filed under a different case number,and the district judge to which it would then be assigned should consider independently whether to entertain the petition or reject it as a second or successive petition.judge holschuh stated that t he assignment or of a new civil number to a case is obviously not conclusive on the issue of whether the petitioner is entitled to file a second habeas corpus petition,and n othing in this order is intended to convey any opinion as to whether the new petition is or is not a successive petition or has otherwise been properly filed.at.
griffin her second petition on monday,october,and it was given a new case number and assigned to judge smith.after briefing,judge smith dismissed the action for failure to file within the limitation period for actions.the district court noted that when griffin filed her first habeas petition on april,two days before the deadline was to have run,days of her statute of limitations had lapsed.that petition had been dismissed on september.without knowing the actual date of her state court filing,the district court assumed that griffin immediately filed her state court application and that this filing tolled the running of her federal statute of limitations.the district court ruled that when the state court application was resolved on september,griffin had two days in which to return to federal court.she did not submit her second petition until october,after the statute of limitations had run.therefore,the district court dismissed griffin petition.
at.griffin then timely appealed,and this court vacated the dismissal.griffin,at.this court determined that the district court had not applied the correct standard regarding griffin.when the district court dismissed her petition,griffin did not have two days remaining under the statutory limitations period.instead,her statutory window of opportunity had already expired.see duncan walker,d.but,this court found that the district court should have determined whether or not griffin was entitled to equitable tolling under palmer carlton,cir.we found that griffin limitation period should be tolled during the pendency of her original habeas action,at,and for the period between her september state court dismissal and her return to federal court in october,id.at.but,we were unaware of when griffin actually filed her application to reopen in the ohio courts.concluding that griffin would certainly be entitled to equitable tolling if she could show filing in accordance with palmer,we vacated and remanded for further consideration.id.
on remand,griffin conceded that she had taken over six months to bring her application to reopen,and the district court determined that she was not entitled to equitable tolling under palmer.the district court,adopting the recommendation of the magistrate,found that palmer created a retroactive deadline for habeas petitioners.report and recommendation petitioner has clearly not met the time limits established by palmer.strict application of that case and of the sixth circuit mandate in this case militate against equitable tolling.
because aedpa statute of limitations is not jurisdictional,a petitioner who misses the deadline may still maintain a viable habeas action if the court decides that equitable tolling is appropriate.allen yukins,cir citing dunlap united states,cir,cert.denied,d see also young united states,d it is hornbook law that limitations periods are customarily subject to equitable tolling.citations omitted id.at.congress must be presumed to draft limitations periods in light of this background principle.in the present case,there are two ways that equitable tolling could apply.first,in palmer carlton,this court adopted a procedure,which effects a mandatory form of equitable tolling for the narrow group of cases in which a mixed petition is dismissed near or after the expiration of the aedpa limitations period.our court has determined that if such a petitioner files any unexhausted claims in state court within days of dismissal and in federal court within days of exhaustion,the petition will automatically be considered timely.if this mandatory equitable tolling does not apply,this court may still equitably toll the limitations period based on the traditional equitable factors as outlined by this court in andrews orr,cir.
in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,congress added a statute of limitations for habeas corpus petitions providing in relevant part 
d a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.the limitation period shall run from the latest of 
a the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review 
the time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.
d.aedpa provided no grace period for habeas corpus claims arising from convictions such as griffin that became final prior to the statute enactment.as the failure to provide such a grace period would have rendered aedpa unconstitutional,this circuit provided a grace period for convictions that became final prior to april,the effective date of aedpa.see isham randle,cir,cert.denied,d citing texaco,short,d.in the present case,griffin filed her habeas petition on april,just two days shy of the grace period expiration.
since aedpa passage,courts have also struggled to determine how to address the limitations questions of habeas petitions raising unexhausted claims.in a decision,rose lundy,d,the supreme court had directed federal courts that it was proper to dismiss petitions that contained both exhausted and unexhausted claims mixed petitions.before aedpa,such a dismissal permitted plaintiffs to exhaust their remaining state claims and return to federal court without a time limitation.in duncan walker,d,however,the supreme court determined that the aedpa limitations period does not toll during the pendency of the habeas petition itself.while in federal court,tolling is allowed only during the time the petition is pending in state court.thus,when a case is dismissed pursuant to rose,the limitations period generally will have expired,foreclosing the possibility of a timely in accordance with d.see see also id.at.breyer,dissenting pointing out that district courts take on average days to dismiss petitions on procedural grounds.in cases like griffin,where the initial petition is filed at the end or near the end of the limitations period,a rose dismissal will effectively preclude the possibility of a consistent with the aedpa limitations period 
in duncan,justice stevens wrote a concurring opinion joined by justice souter to address the complications arising from rose and the new aedpa limitations period.at.stevens,concurring.justice stevens,recognizing the possibility that congress had overlooked this potential problem,urged the circuit courts to consider two uses of the equitable powers of the federal courts to ensure that petitioners who invoke the court jurisdiction within the interval prescribed by aedpa are not barred from having their federal claims heard.id.at.first,justice stevens suggested that courts confronted with a mixed petition could stay the proceedings rather than dismiss them completely.id.at.under this stay and abeyance procedure,courts retain jurisdiction over the exhausted claims,dismiss the unexhausted claims,and stay the habeas proceedings pending the complete exhaustion of state remedies.second,justice stevens urged the federal courts to equitably toll the limitations period for petitioners who initially invoked the court jurisdiction during the statutory period.id.at.n either the court narrow holding,nor anything in the text or legislative history of aedpa,precludes a federal court from deeming the limitations period tolled for such a petition as a matter of equity.
shortly thereafter,the second circuit addressed the issue raised by justice stevens.zarvela artuz,cir.the petitioner in zarvela filed his habeas petition with only two days remaining in the limitations period.id.at.subsequently,he sought permission to withdraw the petition without prejudice so that he could exhaust a new claim in the state courts.id.the district court granted his motion.id.nine days later,he filed his new claim in state court fourteen days after the state appellate decision was rendered,he his federal habeas petition.id.the district court dismissed his petition as untimely.id.the second circuit held that the district court confronted with zarvela mixed petition should have issued a stay rather than grant the petitioner motion to withdraw.id.at,noting that a stay will be the only appropriate course in cases like zarvela where an outright dismissal could jeopardize the timeliness of a collateral attack.citing freeman page,cir emphasis added.such a stay,the court ruled,should have been conditioned upon the petitioner prompt initiation of state court exhaustion and his prompt return to federal court after completion of exhaustion.at.thus,the appellate court directed district courts prospectively to explicitly condition the stay on the prisoner pursuing state court remedies within a brief interval,normally days,after the stay is entered and returning to federal curt within a similarly brief interval,normally days after state court exhaustion is completed.without using the language of equitable tolling the circuit court found that the petitioner was entitled to have his petition treated as if it had been stayed,provided his entry to the state courts and his return occurred promptly.finding that the petitioner would have complied with the timeliness conditions of the stay that should have been granted,the appellate court reversed and remanded for further proceedings.
in palmer carlton,cir,this court endorsed the stay and abeyance procedure adopted by the second circuit in zarvela.the court wrote 
the second circuit stay and abeyance approach is eminently reasonable.it addresses the equitable concerns raised by justice stevens in duncan,preserves the interests in comity embraced by lundy,and prevents the potential abuse of the writ perpetrated by some petitioners.
id.they also embraced this procedure retroactive application to petitions that had been dismissed rather than stayed.id.the petitioner in palmer had filed his original habeas petition on the last day of the limitations period.id.at.his motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice was granted by the district court on march.id.a state proceeding was dismissed on march.id.the petitioner his habeas action on may,and the district court determined that this filing was untimely.id.on appeal,this court determined that the dismissal should be affirmed 
nevertheless,adoption of the second circuit approach in this case would not afford palmer the relief he seeks.although his remedies were exhausted on march,he waited until may,before he returned to federal court and filed a second habeas petition.this wait amounted to more than the normal period suggested by the second circuit as a reasonable period for a petitioner to return to federal jurisdiction,and the record offers no reason for the delay.
id.at.as the petitioner waited sixty days after his state court dismissal to his habeas petition,he would not have complied with the retroactive stay contemplated by the zarvela court.
like the zarvela court,the palmer court did not conduct a traditional equitable tolling analysis.instead,it simply determined that had the petitioner case been stayed conditionally upon the two filing windows,the petitioner would not have complied.at.notably,the court did not indicate that the failure to comply with this normal time period was dispositive.indeed,the court suggested that an adequate explanation might have excused the delay.id.t he record offers no reason for the delay.
but,palmer offered no reason for his delay that would have permitted the court to consider whether equitable tolling was appropriate.nor could he have.between the march habeas dismissal and the may habeas,the petitioner does not appear to have filed any additional proceedings in the state court.instead,the petitioner was relying on a state action that sought declaratory relief on purely state grounds.id.at t his pleading did not present a federal question for review.palmer tennessee dep t of correction,wl,appeal denied,raising tennessee statutory and tennessee constitutional claims but no federal constitutional claims.palmer was a poor candidate for equitable tolling not simply because he waited sixty days after his state proceedings were completely concluded to his federal habeas action,but because he did not bring any federal challenges whatsoever during this time period.
in hargrove brigano,cir,this court more fully endorsed the procedure in the context of aedpa statute of limitations.in hargrove,the petitioner sought habeas relief on the grounds of constitutionally insufficient evidence.id.at.since the pro se petitioner had never filed an appeal,the district court dismissed the petition without prejudice in order for the petitioner to exhaust his state remedies.id.yet,rather than staying the petition,the district court,acting prospectively,ordered the tolling of the aedpa limitations period conditioned on the petitioner pursuing his state remedies within days of the dismissal and returning to federal court within days after exhaustion.id.the warden challenged this prospective order of equitable tolling,arguing that the issue was not within the jurisdiction of the dismissing court.id.at.instead,the warden argued that equitable tolling should be decided by the court receiving the subsequent,untimely petition after exhaustion.id.this court found that the district court prospective equitable tolling was reasonable.id.at,although the district court did not issue a stay in this case,it achieved the same result reached in zarvela and approved in palmer.
again,in hargrove,our court did not actually conduct an equitable tolling analysis it merely recognized that under the retroactive rule of palmer equitable tolling was proper as a matter of law for those petitioners whose petitions are dismissed without prejudice for the purpose of exhausting state claims.as this court held previously,palmer introduces a new period of mandatory equitable tolling for petitioners who filed their federal habeas petitions within the statute of limitations but were forced to return to state court to exhaust certain claims.griffin,at emphasis added.the line of cases dictates that regardless of the equities of the situation,the courts will mechanically permit a that would have been available had the case been conditionally stayed rather than dismissed.
in the present case,griffin is not entitled to the automatic equitable tolling mandated by palmer.as her case was dismissed without prejudice on september,prior to both duncan and palmer,the district court did not use the procedure.thus,when the case was dismissed,her aedpa limitations period had already expired.had a stay been issued rather than a dismissal,the stay would normally be conditioned upon her filing of unexhausted claims in state court within days and returning to federal court within days of exhaustion.but griffin did not file her application for delayed appeal with the ohio courts until april,nearly six and one half months after her district court dismissal.as she did not comply with the guideline,she is not entitled to mandatory equitable tolling.
as the mandatory equitable tolling rule of palmer is not applicable in the present case,we turn to the traditional equitable tolling analysis.this court reviews de novo the district court decision not to apply equitable tolling.king bell,cir.federal courts have typically extended equitable relief only sparingly.irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d.in deciding whether equitable tolling should apply,courts in this circuit consider the following factors 
the petitioner lack of notice of the filing requirement the petitioner lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirement diligence in pursuing one rights absence of prejudice to the respondent and the petitioner reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the legal requirement for filing his claim.
dunlap united states,cir citing andrews orr,cir.these five factors are not comprehensive,nor is each of the five factors relevant in all cases.cook stegall,cir.instead,courts must consider equitable tolling on a basis.king,at.
in applying the andrews factors to the present case,the only filing at issue is griffin application to reopen her direct appeal in the ohio courts when her petition was dismissed on september,her statutory limitations period under aedpa had already expired.see duncan,at.but,under the operation of palmer,if griffin had returned to state court within days,her petition would proceed to the merits.thus,in applying the test,this court must consider only griffin failure to file her application for delayed appeal by october,and whether her untimely fili
