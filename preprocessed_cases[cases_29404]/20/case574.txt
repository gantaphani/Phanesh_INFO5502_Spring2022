petitioner appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york marrero,entered august,denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.this appeal requires us to decide the following questions whether the supreme court has clearly established that jeopardy attaches upon a trial court unconditional acceptance of a guilty plea to the lesser included offense in a indictment,and therefore that the double jeopardy clause bars subsequent prosecution or reinstatement of the indictment on a greater felony offense whether the new york court of appeals applied a rule that is contrary to this clearly established federal law in denying petitioner article petition and the subsidiary factual question of whether the greater possession of a in fact pending when the defendant pled guilty to the lesser included misdemeanor offense of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree.
petitioner is currently serving an indeterminate term of imprisonment of from two and to five years for criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree pursuant to new york penal law nypl,a class d felony.see nypl c.petitioner was charged in new york state court in a indictment with third degree felony possession of a weapon not in a person home or place of business and a lesser included count of fourth degree misdemeanor weapon possession,pursuant to new york penal law and,respectively.on june,morris pleaded guilty to the felony charge.the trial court had initially accepted,with no objection from the prosecution,petitioner guilty plea to the misdemeanor offense.however,under somewhat complicated factual circumstances detailed more fully below,the trial court,over defense objection,reinstated the felony count and declined to impose the bargained for sentence on the misdemeanor.petitioner now contends that the new york trial court violated his rights under the double jeopardy clause when it improperly reinstated the felony weapon possession count after accepting his guilty plea to the lesser included offense of misdemeanor weapon possession,when the misdemeanor was the only charge then pending against him.see const.amend.v,cl.the double jeopardy clause.
edward reynolds,superintendent of the mohawk correctional facility respondent,counters that the united states supreme court has yet to decide whether the double jeopardy clause is violated when a court,sua sponte,vacates a guilty plea to a lesser charge to correct its own error prior to sentencing respondent also contends the court has not decided when jeopardy attaches to a guilty plea.therefore,according to respondent,petitioner fails to establish that the new york court of appeals decision is contrary to or involves an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent as required for habeas relief under the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d.
the new york court of appeals denied petitioner double jeopardy claim,though it did not discuss the claim or cite appropriate federal law.the court of appeals grounded its decision on its own prior precedent which holds that a trial court has the inherent power to vacate a plea,to correct its own errors,and conduct a subsequent prosecution on the original charges,and that as long as sentence has not been imposed and judgment entered,defendant constitutional right not to be twice put in jeopardy does not bar the second prosecution.
we disagree with respondent for the reasons set forth below and therefore reverse the judgment of the district court,and grant the petition.since the time petitioner has spent incarcerated already has exceeded the maximum penalty for the misdemeanor fourth degree weapons charge,see nypl,we order the petitioner immediately released from state confinement.
background 
facts and state court proceedings 
petitioner was indicted in december on a class d felony count of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and a class a misdemeanor count of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree.see morris reynolds,d.he moved to dismiss the indictment for legal insufficiency of the grand jury evidence.see id.the state opposed in a written response dated march.see id.on may,the trial justice ruled from the bench that the felony charge was dismissed.the government made no objection.the case was continued to june.
morris contends that we should grant habeas relief because the supreme court has clearly established that when a defendant pleads guilty to a lesser included offense,and no other charge remains pending against him,once the court accepts his guilty plea and the prosecution does not object,to reinstate the greater count violates the double jeopardy clause.the crucial factual issue on this theory therefore is whether the felony count remained pending when the court accepted morris plea to the misdemeanor.if it was pending at that time,then morris only resolved a portion of the charges against him,and the court was within its power to reinstate the felony without violating the double jeopardy clause under ohio johnson,d.if,however,the court actually dismissed the felony charge,then the court was without power to reinstate that charge after having accepted morris plea to a lesser included offense.we address the factual issue first,because if the greater offense remained pending,then under ohio johnson,the petitioner claim necessarily fails.a careful analysis of the record demonstrates,however,that this felony charge had been dismissed,on the record,at the time the court accepted the petitioner guilty plea.
on june,the trial court,reading from an index card,said that the people had not established sufficiently the home and business exception,and that the felony count was therefore dismissed the government made no objection.additionally,the government informed the court that it was ready to proceed on the basis of the misdemeanor count and would need approximately three days to get its witnesses in.the case was continued to august.
on august,the court reiterated that the only count pending was criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree.the court indicated its willingness,based on the paucity of petitioner record,to accept a plea to that charge and give petitioner a misdemeanor probationary sentence.the government did not object.
the court asked the petitioner if he wish ed to change his plea from not guilty of the remaining count,criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree,to guilty of that crime app.at emphasis added.petitioner responded yes.defense counsel stated that petitioner was pleading guilty to the misdemeanor,in full satisfaction of the indictment.the government did not object.
the court carefully allocuted the petitioner.the government articulated the facts that it would have proven had the case gone to trial.the prosecution acknowledged that it understood that petitioner was to receive a probationary sentence of three years,and reserved its right to make a sentencing recommendation.the court accepted petitioner plea and the prosecutor made no objection.
there is some dispute over the,whether the trial justice reinstated the felony count before the defendant pled guilty to the misdemeanor.according to the district court,immediately after the august,plea allocution the prosecutor asked the trial justice law secretary for a copy of the trial justice decision regarding the felony count and was informed that it was not yet completed but that it would find the grand jury proceedings sufficient to reinstate the felony indictment.morris,d at quoting gianfrancesco,ex.emphasis added.according to the prosecutor,several days later she received a written decision,dated july,that found that the evidence was legally sufficient to sustain the felony count.according to the court of appeals,sometime after august,the trial justice filed a written decision dated july.see van ex rel.morris massaro.because the court of appeals did not expressly focus on the importance of the date on which the felony charge was dismissed,its decision leaves ambiguous whether it believed that order was.
several months after the court accepted morris plea,on october,when preparing to sentence him,the trial justice stated that after review,criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree is reinstated.app.at emphasis added.the trial court offered petitioner the opportunity to withdraw the misdemeanor plea,which offer was declined.petitioner brought an article proceeding seeking to prohibit the trial judge from setting aside the misdemeanor plea and seeking to require the court to impose the promised probationary sentence and to set aside the reinstatement of the felony.the appellate division granted his petition with two judges dissenting.see van ex rel morris massaro,dep t.the state appealed to the court of appeals which reversed and dismissed petitioner article proceeding.see van,at,at,at.on june,petitioner pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and was sentenced to two and a half to five years imprisonment.he is currently incarcerated.
federal court proceedings 
petitioner filed an amended habeas petition,dated may,claiming that the trial court lacked the authority to set aside sua sponte the guilty plea and reinstate the felony count without petitioner consent,and that this vacatur offended the double jeopardy clause of the united states constitution.
in a report and recommendation dated december,united states magistrate judge peck recommended that the petition be granted.morris reynolds,civ.nrb ajp,wl,at.although he found that petitioner claim regarding the trial court lack of inherent authority to reinstate the indictment raised a question of state law that could not be addressed on federal habeas review,he concluded that petitioner double jeopardy rights had been violated.see id.at.after finding that the state courts had not adjudicated the merits of the federal constitutional issue,magistrate judge peck determined that the aedpa standard of review did not apply to this case and conducted a de novo review of the double jeopardy claim.see id.at.
after concluding that the supreme court had never directly addressed the issue of whether jeopardy attaches upon a court unconditional acceptance of a guilty plea,the magistrate judge determined that in ohio johnson,d,the supreme court required lower courts to assess both the defendant interest in finality and the state interest in having one full and fair opportunity to convict.see wl,at.based on this analysis,magistrate judge peck concluded that reinstatement of the felony charge was barred by principles of double jeopardy and recommended granting the petition.see id.at.
in an order dated august,united states district judge victor marrero declined to adopt the magistrate judge report and denied the petition.see morris,d at.the district court found that the state courts did not examine the issues of the trial court power to vacate a guilty plea and double jeopardy separately,reasoning that the two inquiries were inextricably intertwined and concluding that once the premise is accepted that the trial court inherent authority under state law to correct its error was properly exercised,the double jeopardy issue was necessarily resolved.see id.at.otherwise,reasoned the district court,the two legal conclusions would clash irreconcilably.see id.at.consequently,the district court concluded that the merits of the constitutional claim were adjudicated,and therefore the deferential aedpa standard of review applied.see id.at.
with respect to the facts,the district court disagreed with the magistrate judge conclusion that the trial justice had produced a written order,which despite its date clearly was not prepared until after the guilty plea was accepted.id.at quoting wl,at.according to the district court,the magistrate judge finding that the order was did not give proper deference to the factual findings of the state courts under e id.at.
the district court found that the inference drawn by the magistrate judge was not based on a factual basis sufficient to support a convincing conclusion.id.at.therefore,the district court held,it was constrained not to disturb the state court factual findings because petitioner failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that those findings were erroneous.id.
regarding the law,the district court agreed with the magistrate judge conclusion that the supreme court has not specifically addressed the issue related to double jeopardy in this jeopardy attaches at the time of the acceptance of a guilty plea.id.the district court did,however,note that the decision of the court of appeals implicitly rested on the premise,discussed in the appellate division dissent,that no double jeopardy issue arose when the felony count was reinstated because the proceeding did not terminate in a judgment,conviction and sentence,but rather,merely a conviction pursuant to a guilty plea.see id.at citations omitted.the district court concluded that though there was no explicit mention of the federal double jeopardy claim,the new york court of appeals was following johnson.see id.at.
finally,the district court found that even under de novo review,using the rule that the magistrate judge derived from johnson,whether the state had the opportunity to marshal its evidence and resources and chose not to exercise it,the writ should not issue.see id.at.the district court found that the magistrate judge findings that the state never objected to the dismissal of the felony charges or morris guilty plea were not sufficiently supported by the record.see id.at.the district court issued a certificate of appealability on august.see id.at.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo the district court decision to grant or deny a petition for writ of habeas corpus.see clark stinson,cir.we review a district court factual findings for clear error.see amadeo zant,d.this court review is,however,constrained by,which provides that a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct however,the petitioner may rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.e.
additionally,as acknowledged earlier a writ of habeas corpus may not issue with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceeding unless the adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
notwithstanding the absence of discussion of morris federal double jeopardy claim,the court of appeals decision constituted an adjudicat ion on the merits to which we owe aedpa deference.see d sellan kuhlman,cir.we determine 
whether a state court disposition of a petitioner claim is on the merits by considering what the state courts have done in similar cases whether the history of the case suggests that the state court was aware of any ground for not adjudicating the case on the merits and whether the state courts opinions suggest reliance upon procedural grounds rather than a determination on the merits.
sellan,at quoting mercadel cain,cir.
pursuant to that test the new york court of appeals adjudicated morris on the merits.first,new york courts have held in other cases that in similar circumstances,the double jeopardy clause is not offended by a proceeding that does not terminate in judgment.see van,at,at,at collecting cases.second,the history of morris does not suggest that the court of appeals was aware of any ground by which it could have decided the case without adjudicating it on the merits.see id.indeed,the two justices of the appellate division that dissented did so on the ground that the double jeopardy clause was not offended.see van,at,at.third,the court of appeals opinion does not rely upon procedural grounds for a determination.see at,at,at.because morris double jeopardy claim was therefore adjudicated on the merits,the district court correctly found that d deference is due the state court decision.
therefore,this court is constrained to apply clearly established federal law,as determined by the holdings,not dicta,of the united states supreme court.williams taylor,d.w hatever would qualify as an old rule under the supreme court jurisprudence constitute s clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states under d.id.citation omitted.this court must,however,be mindful that even on habeas,it has an independent obligation to say what the law is.id.at.quoting wright west,d emphasis added.
the question for this court then is whether under the circumstances of this case,the state court decision to permit prosecution of petitioner on the reinstated felony charge was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
if we determine that petitioner is relying upon double jeopardy law which was clearly established federal law at the time of his prosecution,within the meaning of d,this court must examine the state court decision and,guided by williams,determine whether it is contrary to or an unreasonable application of that law.
b.the facts on review 
as noted earlier,in a habeas proceeding,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.e.p etitioner,however,may rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.morris,d at citing pons artuz,civ,wl,at cir.june.thus,this court must presume that the factual findings of the new york courts are correct and may not set aside those findings unless the material facts were not adequately developed at the state court hearing or the court factual determinations are not fairly supported by the record.id.at citation omitted.
the record in this case establishes that although the trial court order reinstating the felony was dated july,the felony charge was not pending at the time petitioner plea was accepted on august,and the government did not object to entry or acceptance of the misdemeanor plea in this case.to the extent the district court concluded otherwise,its findings were clearly erroneous.additionally,we think that the district court observation that on the day petitioner plea was accepted the trial court contemplated a reversal of its earlier oral ruling,id.at,is of no import.rather,the relevant inquiry is whether the felony count was pending at the time the court accepted the petitioner plea.
the state conducted no formal hearing.however,the trial court said,on october,that o n july,it issued its written decision.app.at.the record belies this finding.clear and convincing evidence rebuts the trial court statement.first,it is very clear that no one in court,including the justice,had any idea that the court did not dismiss the felony count and that the felony charge was pending at the time of the plea.twice previously,the court had said it was dismissing the felony.on may,the trial justice ruled from the bench that he was dismissing the felony count of the indictment.see app.at.on june,he reiterated that ruling,see app.at,and on at least one of those dates he stated that the indictment was being dismissed because the people failed to establish sufficiently the home and business exception.app.at.directly before accepting petitioner plea,the trial justice said,the only count here is criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree.app.at.defense counsel stated that her client wished to plead guilty to the misdemeanor,in full satisfaction of the indictment.app.at.the trial justice then asked petitioner if he wished to plead guilty to the remaining count,criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree,id.emphasis added,to which petitioner responded yes.id.in addition,on august,the trial justice asked the prosecutor whether it was the people understanding that the court intended to do away with the felony charge.see app.at.she responded yes and reserved only a right to make a sentencing recommendation for the date of sentence.id.further,immediately following the plea,when the prosecutor asked the trial justice law secretary for a copy of the decision it was not available because it was incomplete.morris,d at citation omitted.finally,it was not until october,that the trial justice announced that criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree is reinstated.app.at emphasis added.the record establishes beyond doubt that the felony charge was not pending on august,when the trial justice accepted petitioner guilty plea to the misdemeanor,despite the fact that the decision reinstating the charge was dated july.
because it was not material to the court of appeals analysis,that court left ambiguous whether the felony count remained pending at the time of the plea,and whether it believed the written decision dated july,was.to the extent that the court of appeals left its findings on this fact,which we find determinative,ambiguous,our review of the record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the felony count had been dismissed,and was therefore not pending,when the trial court accepted morris plea.
further,the transcript is quite clear at no time during the plea allocution did the prosecutor object to the plea.see app.at.the prosecutor claims to have protested the fact that no written decision presumably of the felony dismissal was available off the record.app.at.we have no way of assessing the claim.nothing in the record suggests any disagreement with entry of the plea.see app.at.the record reflects only what we set forth earlier,viz.the prosecutor understood that the court intended to do away with the felony count and reserved her right to make a sentencing recommendation.see app.at.thus,the record supports a finding that the trial justice accepted morris guilty plea to the misdemeanor with the prosecutor approval or at least without objection by the prosecution 
the supreme court has clearly established,for the purpose of d,that when no greater offense remains pending at the time a court accepts a defendant guilty plea to a lesser included offense,and the prosecution has not objected to the defendant plea,the double jeopardy clause bars reinstatement of the greater offense 
the double jeopardy clause provides that no person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.const.amend.v,cl.it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction.and it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.ohio johnson,d citing brown ohio,d quoting north carolina pearce,d emphasis added.the provision serves principally as a restraint on courts and prosecutors.brown,at.where successive prosecutions are at stake,the guarantee serves a constitutional policy of finality for the defendant benefit.id.quoting united states jorn,d plurality opinion.
the supreme court has long held that a guilty plea constitutes a conviction.see kercheval united states.in kercheval,the government charged defendant with using the mails to defraud.see id.at.defendant pleaded guilty and the court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of three years.see id.upon defendant motion the court allowed the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea.see id.at.at the trial the court permitted the prosecution,over defendant objection,to put in evidence a certified copy of the guilty plea.see id.at.on appeal the government argued that a guilty plea is similar to a confession,and therefore should be likewise admitted.see id.at.the supreme court held that a guilty plea differs in purpose and effect from a confession it is itself a conviction.like a verdict of a jury it is conclusive.more is not required the court has nothing to do but give judgment and sentence.id.at.given that a guilty plea is a conviction,see,and that the double jeopardy clause protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction,johnson,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted,the clause prohibits a second prosecution for the same offense following a guilty plea.
it has also long been clearly established by the supreme court that it is a violation of double jeopardy to prosecute a defendant for a greater offense after convicting and punishing the defendant for a lesser included offense.see brown,at.in brown,the defendant pleaded guilty to joyriding,the crime of operating a vehicle without t
