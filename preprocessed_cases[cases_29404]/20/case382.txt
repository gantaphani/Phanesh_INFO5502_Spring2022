on march,a grand jury charged petitioner victor perkins perkins with one count of first degree robbery penal law,two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree penal law,two counts of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree penal law,and one count of unlawful imprisonment in the first degree penal law.all counts stemmed from the robbery and detention of a grocery clerk named claudia cruz cruz.
perkins was tried and convicted of first degree robbery and two counts of weapons possession in the third degree.however,the jury acquitted perkins of the unlawful imprisonment charge,as well as the two counts of weapons possession in the second degree.the trial court sentenced perkins as a second violent felony offender to concurrent prison terms,the longest of which was a term of twenty years.
perkins appealed his conviction to the new york state supreme court,appellate division appellate division,claiming that the trial court had violated his rights under the confrontation clause by admitting the grand jury testimony and supporting depositions of cruz without affording him the ability to her at a hearing or at trial.perkins further argued that his fifth amendment rights had been violated by the introduction of a written confession that had been obtained after he invoked his right to silence.the appellate division accepted perkins argument that his constitutional rights had been violated in both instances,but nonetheless upheld his conviction on the ground that the constitutional errors had been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the other evidence presented at trial.people perkins,dep t perkins ii,lv.denied.
perkins subsequently filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus,seeking to have the district court set aside his conviction.respondent victor herbert herbert,superintendent of the attica correctional facility,opposed perkins petition.the united states district court for the western district of new york victor bianchini,however,conditionally granted the writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,setting aside perkins conviction for robbery and weapons possession.perkins herbert,d,perkins iii.according to the magistrate judge,the constitutional errors had not been harmless under the substantial and injurious effect standard set forth in brecht abrahamson,d.perkins iii,d at citing fry pliler,d.we disagree with this last ruling and reverse the grant of the writ.
background 
factual background 
on february,at approximately,perkins and another man named ernesto shannon,lucky lucky,entered willie grocery store in the city of rochester.according to an oral statement by perkins,a third man,named ted francis ted,stood outside the grocery store acting as a lookout.after demanding cruz jewelry and the money from the register,the two men forced cruz to help them contact a man named luis rijo,hector hector,a local drug dealer with whom cruz was acquainted.perkins then paged hector from a nearby telephone booth with the number,knowing that cruz would sometimes use this number to summon hector to the grocery store.
once hector arrived at the front door,perkins and lucky forced cruz to participate in his capture.according to testimony from cruz,as well as a written confession from perkins,the two men forced cruz to meet hector at the front door and persuade him to use the rear entrance instead.after hector had approached the rear entrance,cruz coaxed hector into the store.however,soon after hector entered,he was ambushed by lucky and taken into the basement,where he was blindfolded,to a chair and beaten.lucky then threatened hector with a semiautomatic pistol and demanded to know where hector kept his drugs and money 
under duress,hector relented.he spoke to the two men in spanish,which cruz translated,revealing that his drugs and money were located in the attic of a nearby house at avenue c.at this point,one of the two men left the grocery store in search of hector drugs and money however,that person soon returned to the grocery store,where the two men questioned hector once more.hector once again reassured the two men that he had told them the truth regarding the location of his drugs and money,and lucky subsequently exited willie grocery store.perkins,however,remained behind with cruz and hector.
while the men were struggling to locate hector drugs and money,the police had received reports of suspicious activity and shouting coming from willie grocery store.in response to these reports,the police contacted the owner,who unlocked the store.upon entering the basement,the officers encountered cruz,who appeared distraught,and hector,who was duct taped to a chair and bleeding from the head.although she was crying,and her hands were trembling,cruz pointed in perkins direction and said h e over there.when the officers looked in this direction,they saw perkins fleeing through the rear entrance.officer mark barna officer barna,who had been waiting outside the rear entrance,observed perkins fleeing the grocery store and called out a radio broadcast with perkins description.
shortly after receiving officer barna broadcast,officer richard gerbino officer gerbino apprehended perkins.officer gerbino search revealed that perkins was carrying a gun holster,in cash,and numerous pieces of jewelry that would later be identified as belonging to cruz.officer gerbino then brought perkins back to the grocery store for a identification by cruz,who hesitated at first,but ultimately recognized perkins as the man who had robbed her.perkins then asked the officers if they caught the other guy and offered to cooperate,stating his desire not to go to prison.
at the police station,investigators thomas baccanti and michael mcauliffe inv.baccanti and inv.mcauliffe read perkins his miranda warnings,which perkins agreed to waive.perkins initially denied that he had participated in the robbery or possessed a gun.inv.baccanti,however,told perkins that he did not believe this to be true,and that cruz had already implicated perkins in the robbery.after making this comment,inv.baccanti stated what really happened was you pointed a gun at her,at claudia cruz,and you took her money and jewelry that the way it happened,is it perkins responded,y es,that the way it happened.perkins also admitted to possessing a gun,and to accidentally discharging it while he was fleeing from the police.however,when inv.baccanti requested that perkins reduce his statement to writing,perkins refused.perkins also indicated that he did not wish to discuss the matter any further,thus ending the interrogation.perkins again refused to discuss the matter two and a half hours later,at,when the investigators attempted to the conversation.
after waiting in the interview room by himself until,perkins met with investigators thomas janus and glenn weather inv.janus and inv.weather.inv.janus and inv.weather had been investigating a homicide that had occurred earlier that day at avenue c,the same site that lucky had visited in search of hector drugs and money.unaware that perkins had earlier invoked his right to remain silent,inv.weather said to perkins victor,i realize that you have have been read your rights and you agreed to waive them.they still stand here during the conversation we having now and that we going to be having over the next few minutes.perkins replied,y eah,no problem.
the two investigators informed perkins that they wished to discuss what had happened earlier that day,as well as a homicide that had occurred at avenue under questioning about the robbery at willie grocery store,and its potential connection to the homicide at avenue c,perkins produced a written statement detailing his involvement in the robbery of cruz and the plot to steal hector drugs and money according to perkins written statement,he had personally taken cruz chains,ring,and gold watch at gunpoint.however,perkins also claimed that he had not visited avenue c on the date of the robbery.instead,perkins claimed in his written statement that lucky was the only one to visit avenue c in search of hector drugs and money.
approximately one month after the robbery,on march,the police discovered that perkins accomplice lucky had been the victim of a homicide as well.the police suspected that ted,whom perkins had identified as the lookout in the initial robbery,had either participated in,or had knowledge of,lucky death.furthermore,the police learned that ted had personally approached cruz on one occasion,reminding her of lucky homicide and warning her not to testify.ted had also contacted her and boyfriend on separate occasions,conveying the same message.as a result,cruz refused to testify against perkins at trial.
the sirois hearing 
under new york law,when a defendant is accused of causing the unavailability of a witness,the court will hold a sirois hearing to determine whether the defendant actually did procure the absence of the witness,in which case the admission of examined testimony of the absent witness will be permitted.see people cotto,a t a sirois hearing,the people must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant,by violence,threats or chicanery,caused a witness unavailability.although the supreme court has taken no position on the standards necessary to demonstrate such forfeiture,davis washington,d,new york courts have required the prosecution to show that the defendant procured the absence of the witness by clear and convincing evidence,people geraci,internal quotation marks omitted,whereas the second circuit has adopted a preponderance of the evidence standard,united states mastrangelo,cir.
on february,the trial court held a sirois hearing to determine whether the prosecution could introduce the grand jury testimony and supporting depositions of cruz into evidence in lieu of her live testimony.according to the prosecution,perkins had enlisted the aid of ted to warn cruz not to testify,and thereby waived his right to cruz.this sirois hearing was intended to determine whether or not perkins had,in fact,caused cruz unavailability.see cotto,at,at,at.
the prosecution first called inv.janus,who testified as to the contents of several conversations he had had with cruz regarding her testimony against perkins.according to inv.janus,cruz was initially reluctant to mention ted by name.however,cruz soon indicated that she was seeing ted on a regular basis driving by looking at her and that she had been approached by ted on one occasion.ted reminded cruz of the murder of lucky,a in cruz robbery,saying that lucky was one of their own people and look what happened to him.ted further explained,in the words of inv.janus,that it would not be a good idea for cruz to testify.cruz told inv.janus that ted had also contacted her and boyfriend,on separate occasions,suggesting to both men that cruz should not testify.
as a result,cruz refused to testify against perkins,and expressed anger at inv.janus for continuing to request her testimony.when inv.janus ultimately served cruz with a subpoena for the sirois hearing,cruz began to cry and said that inv.janus might as well have issued her a death warrant.cruz also remarked that lucky had been killed because he had been talking.
throughout these conversations,cruz never mentioned to inv.janus whether she had ever been contacted by perkins himself,and never alleged that ted had conveyed these warnings on perkins behalf.indeed,perkins had been imprisoned continuously since his arrest on february,and the prison record logs reveal no contact with ted.
inv.janus further testified that ted himself was suspected of acting as the lookout in the robbery of cruz and of possibly being involved in the homicide at avenue c that occurred the same day.additionally,perkins himself had identified ted as an accomplice in the robbery,even though he feared for his safety by identifying him.furthermore,cruz had confirmed that there was a third robber just outside the grocery store,although she told inv.janus that she did not see this person face.
next,inv.weather testified that perkins had identified ted as an accomplice.according to inv.weather,perkins had revealed that ted had acted as a lookout during the robbery.accordingly,ted remained a suspect in the robbery.additionally,inv.weather noted that ted was a suspect in a homicide that occurred on the same day at avenue c,which the police believed may have been linked to the robbery.
the prosecution next called investigator james rossiter inv.rossiter,who testified that he had served cruz with a material witness order,compelling her presence at the sirois hearing.upon receiving the order,cruz began to cry,stating that she did want to be the next homicide victim and that she was fearful of coming to court due to the threats she had received.nonetheless,inv.rossiter escorted cruz to the district attorney office.inside the district attorney office,inv.rossiter overheard part of a conversation that cruz was having with her boyfriend.according to inv.rossiter,cruz said that they do care about the robbery,it the homicide they concerned with.inv.rossiter,however,did not know to whom cruz was referring when she used the word they.
finally,the prosecution called pedro oliver oliver,cruz.oliver testified that a black male had approached him in his driveway,saying make sure you tell your daughter not to go to court.the man said nothing more before walking away.
after hearing testimony from these witnesses,cruz attorney addressed the court.according to cruz attorney,cruz has explained to me that as a result of threats that have been made to her,she is fearful that if she testifies,even as to the threats themselves,and implicates anyone in relation to those threats,that her life will be in danger.therefore,the attorney then represented to the court that cruz is not willing to testify and would not answer questions if called.
after hearing that cruz refused to testify in open court,and that perkins refused to waive his presence during her testimony,the trial court conducted an in camera proceeding,over defendant objection,in which the court questioned cruz outside the presence of both the defendant and the defendant counsel,as well as the prosecution.the trial court permitted the defendant to submit written questions,which the court would ask of cruz,but did not allow any direct questioning.additionally,the court did not allow the defendant to see an actual transcript of the in camera proceeding.instead,the court provided the defendant with a written summary.the court explained that it believed such a procedure could safeguard the rights of the defendant by posing relevant questions to the victim and listening to her answers,while protecting the rights of the obviously distraught witness by excluding the defendant and his counsel.people perkins,misc d,perkins i.
during her in camera testimony,which largely overlapped with the testimony of the investigators,cruz noted that she had a feeling that ted was involved in the robbery because he used to hang around with perkins and lucky.therefore,she was fearful of ted,and reluctant to speak with ted when he approached her after the robbery.cruz told the judge that ted had personally warned her on one occasion not to testify,reminding her of lucky murder.ted had also approached her boyfriend,while cruz waited inside her car,conveying a similar message.ted had even approached her with the same message.
in response to written questions from perkins attorney,cruz confirmed that she had not had any contact with perkins since the date of the robbery.furthermore,cruz did not at any point testify that she believed that perkins had orchestrated the threats.nonetheless,the trial court ruled that perkins had waived his sixth amendment right of confrontation,and that cruz grand jury testimony and supporting depositions could be admitted at trial.perkins i,misc d at,at.although the court acknowledged that there was no direct evidence to demonstrate that the defendant orchestrated the intimidation of the victim,it nonetheless held that the prosecutor proved the same by presenting sufficient circumstantial evidence.id.particularly,the court emphasized that there was no suggestion that anyone else stood to gain from the witness silence.id.at,at quoting cotto,at,at,at.in a footnote,the court explained that ted did have anything to gain because he was never identified by cruz as a participant in the robbery and had not been charged.perkins i,misc d at,at.
at trial,the prosecution introduced the testimony of various officers who had responded to the robbery that took place at willie grocery store.according to the testimony of these officers,perkins had been seen fleeing from the basement of willie grocery store on february,leaving behind cruz and hector.the responding officers testified that when they arrived at the scene,cruz appeared to be hysterical,and hector was duct taped to a chair and bleeding from the head.cruz pants were unbuttoned and unzipped,and she was trembling and crying however,she pointed in perkins direction,saying h e over there,before perkins could flee from the basement.once the officers apprehended perkins,they discovered him to be carrying numerous items of jewelry,in cash,and a gun holster.along perkins flight path,the officers also found a roll of duct tape,a caliber semiautomatic pistol,a caliber semiautomatic pistol,and a spent casing that matched the caliber pistol.perkins asked the officers if they caught the other guy and offered to cooperate,stating that he did not wish to go to prison.
additionally,the prosecution introduced testimony from inv.baccanti and inv.mcauliffe,both stating that perkins had orally admitted to the robbery of cruz.according to both investigators,inv.baccanti had accused perkins of pointing a gun at cruz and taking her jewelry,and perkins had responded by saying,y es,that the way it happened.
furthermore,pursuant to the trial court ruling at the sirois hearing,the prosecution introduced the grand jury testimony of cruz,as well as two of cruz depositions.according to cruz statements,perkins had pointed a gun at cruz and had stolen her jewelry under threat of force.
finally,again,pursuant to the trial court ruling at the suppression hearing,the prosecution introduced perkins written confession.according to this written statement,perkins confessed that he had taken cruz jewelry.perkins also confessed to conspiring with lucky to go to the store and make cruz page hector so that the two men could rob hector as well.the prosecution would ultimately stress the importance of this written statement in closing arguments,encouraging the jurors to read that statement aloud and keep in mind that the testimony of the different police officers supports,corroborates,and confirms what is within that statement.
in his closing arguments,perkins attorney suggested that cruz may have been an accomplice in the robbery of hector,rather than a victim herself.to support this theory,perkins introduced evidence that cruz had been previously convicted of welfare fraud,and that,as a condition of her probation,cruz was required to make restitution in excess of.in his closing statement,perkins attorney argued that this provided a financial motive for cruz to conspire with perkins and lucky to rob hector.with respect to the jewelry that perkins had been carrying when he was apprehended,perkins attorney suggested that cruz may have actually handed this to perkins voluntarily.according to perkins attorney,cruz may have given perkins her jewelry in order to convince hector that she was a victim,rather than a participant,in the robbery at willie grocery store.
prior to deliberations,the parties agreed to present all of the exhibits to the jury,which then commenced deliberations and found perkins guilty of first degree robbery and two counts of third degree criminal possession of a weapon.however,the jury acquitted perkins on the unlawful imprisonment count and the two counts of second degree criminal possession of a weapon

discussion 
constitutional violations 
on appeal,appellant herbert argues that the magistrate judge erred in finding that perkins fifth and sixth amendment rights had been violated by the admission of cruz testimony and perkins written confession.even though the appellate division and magistrate judge below both agreed that the trial court violated perkins constitutional rights by admitting this evidence,herbert urges this court to find otherwise,and to hold that the state trial court acted reasonably in making its determination.perkins iii,d at perkins ii,at,at.for the reasons below,we decline to do so.
with respect to the confrontation clause error in admitting cruz testimony,herbert argues that the state trial court acted reasonably in determining that perkins procured the absence of cruz,notwithstanding the appellate division rebuke of that very same position.perkins ii,at,at a ll of the threats warning cruz not to testify were made by a suspected accomplice ted,not defendant perkins.emphasis added.in support of this contention,herbert reiterates the trial court argument that perkins had a motive to procure the absence of cruz,and that perkins was the only person who stood to gain from cruz silence.however,the appellate division and magistrate judge both correctly observed that this argument misstates the facts presented below 
in this case,the prosecution merely demonstrated that perkins had a motive to procure cruz silence.it did not demonstrate,however,that perkins took any steps to orchestrate the intimidation of cruz.it did not even demonstrate that perkins had the opportunity to do so,which is particularly significant due to the fact that perkins was incarcerated continuously since the date of the robbery,and the prison record logs reveal no contact with either cruz or ted.cotto herbert,cir finding that defendant procured the absence of a witness in part because the defendant had the opportunity to arrange for the witness intimidation because he was out on bail both prior to and during the trial internal quotation marks omitted.
furthermore,even perkins motive to silence cruz the only real evidence linking perkins to the threats was shared by ted,the man who personally conveyed the threats to cruz.perkins iii,d at.ted had already been identified by perkins as an accomplice in the robbery of cruz,and the sirois hearing demonstrated that the police suspected ted of being involved in two related homicides,as well as in the robbery itself.according to inv.janus,even cruz had acknowledged that there was a third robber just outside willie grocery store,although she claimed that she did not see this person face although cruz may not have explicitly identified ted as a participant in the robbery,there has been no showing that ted was aware of this fact.furthermore,even if he were aware that cruz had failed to explicitly identify him,ted would still have a motive to prevent cruz from testifying under oath about the facts of the robbery and potentially revealing his involvement.given these circumstances,ted had a strong,independent incentive to prevent cruz from testifying in court and potentially implicating him.when we further consider that cruz herself never indicated that perkins had orchestrated the threats,we must conclude that the prosecution failed to meet its burden in showing that perkins procured the absence of the witness,and that the appellate division and magistrate judge,therefore,both correctly concluded that perkins did not waive his right of confrontation 
with respect to the miranda violation in admitting the written confession of perkins,herbert argues that the state trial court was correct in finding that perkins written confession was not obtained in violation of his right to remain silent,due to the fact that the police waited several hours after perkins invoked his right before resuming questioning,and advised perkins that the rights and warnings he was previously given still applied.however,again,this statement does not accurately reflect the facts of the case,and we therefore agree with the appellate division and magistrate judge,which both found that perkins right to remain silent was not scrupulously honored by the interrogating officers.see mosley,at.explaining that,after one invokes his right to remain silent,the admissibility of any further statements depends upon whether that right to remain silent has been scrupulously honored.internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,the interrogating officers failed to perkins his miranda rights before resuming questioning,even though perkins had previously invoked his right to remain silent.see campaneria reid,cir questioning can be resumed after fresh miranda warnings are given and the right to remain silent is otherwise scrupulously honored.emphasis added wilson henderson,cir where a person has invoked his right to remain silent,q uestioning can resume after new warnings have been given.emphasis added see also brown,at,at interrogation can resume only where a significant period of time has passed since the invocation of the right to remain silent and where the police have reiterated the requisite warnings.emphasis added.additionally,even though herbert suggests that the officers reminded or advised perkins that he had previously been read his rights,the record reveals that the officers positively stated that perkins had waived these rights.perkins iii,d at before resuming questioning,the investigator stated victor,i realize that you have have been read your rights and you agreed to waive them.emphasis added.therefore,under these facts,we adhere to the determinations of both the appellate division and magistrate judge,finding that the interrogating officers did not honor perkins right to remain silent,and that the subsequently obtained written confession was erroneously admitted.
nonetheless,confrontation clause errors and miranda violations are both subject to harmless error review.delaware van arsdall,d confrontation clause errors are subject to harmless error review.zappulla new york,cir miranda violations are subject to harmless error review.for the reasons discussed below,we find both of these errors to be harmless.
harmless errora.standard of review 
where a state appellate court has found that a state trial court committed a constitutional violation but has held that the violation was harmless,the standard of review for a federal court conducting habeas corpus review has not yet been clearly established.compare johnson acevedo,cir,with ruelas wolfenbarger,cir.instead,federal courts have developed two different approaches to the standard of review to apply on habeas review.
under one approach,first outlined in brecht abrahamson,a federal habeas court must assess,in its own judgment,whether the constitutional error resulted in actual prejudice to the defendant,d internal quotation marks omitted see also id.at.holding that the state unconstitutional references to the habeas petitioner silence amounted to harmless error where the references were infrequent,the state properly admitted references to the petitioner silence were more frequent,and the state evidence of guilt was,if not overwhelming,certainly weighty ruelas,at.rather than requiring the prosecution to demonstrate that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,as has traditionally been required on direct review,brecht held that habeas relief is not warranted unless,in light of the record as a whole,the constitutional violation had substantial and injurious effect or influence in securing the defendant conviction.at.emphasis added.due to its concerns with finality,comity and federalism,the brecht court intentionally designed this standard to be less onerous to the state than the harmlessness test generally used on direct review of a constitutional error.id.at.
under the other approach,first outlined in mitchell esparza,a federal habeas court must assess whether the state appellate court acted reasonably in determining that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,d per curiam internal quotation marks omitted gutierrez mcginnis,cir.the mitchell court derived this approach from the chapman test,traditionally used on direct review,which requires the prosecution to demonstrate that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.mitchell,at.see also chapman california,d.subsequent to chapman,congress tightened the statutory requirements for a writ of habeas corpus by passing the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.see fry pliler,d.under aedpa,an application for a writ of habeas corpus may not be granted with respect to a claim that has been adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state court adjudication 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.in applying the unreasonable application clause of aedpa to a state appellate court chapman analysis,mitchell held that w e may not grant respondent habeas petition if the state court simply erred in concluding that the state errors were harmless under chapman harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard rather,habeas relief is appropriate only if the state court of appeals applied review in an objectively unreasonable manner.mitchell,at.see also id.at.omitting any mention of the brecht test,and holding that a state court harmlessness finding regarding improper jury instructions was not objectively unreasonable see also gutierrez,at mitchell signals,and we therefore hold,that when a state court explicitly conducts harmless error review of a constitutional error,a habeas court must evaluate whether the state unreasonably applied chapman.but see fry,at.holding that brecht applies on habeas corpus review whether or not the state court conducted its own review under chapman harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard.this aedpa chapman test imposes a high burden on a reviewing court,and requires a federal court on habeas review to ask whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.williams taylor,d emphasis added see also id.at.t he most important point is that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.therefore,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.see also sorto herbert,cir under the unreasonable application clause of aedpa,petitioner must identify some increment of incorrectness beyond error in order to obtain habeas relief.
recently,the seventh circuit held that a habeas court must explicitly find both a lack of reasonableness under and harm under brecht before issuing the writ of habeas corpus.johnson,at.the sixth circuit,by contrast,found that the brecht test subsumes the aedpa chapman test,and that,therefore,only the brecht test should be applied on habeas review of a state appellate court determination of harmlessness.ruelas,at i t certainly makes no sense to require formal application of both tests and brecht when the latter obviously subsumes the former.quoting fry.at.both circuits agree,however,that a finding of harmlessness under brecht,by itself,is sufficient to deny the writ of habeas corpus.
we need not decide whether both tests apply in such a scenario,or whether brecht applies by itself.for present purposes and in keeping with second circuit precedent,we now decline to decide the question because we conclude that the result is the same under either test.brown keane,cir see also howard walker,cir where the question has arisen regarding the chapman and brecht standards of review,this court has declined to resolve it,finding instead that the harmlessness determination would be identical under either analysis benn greiner,cir referring to the open question of whether or brecht applies,and declining to resolve that issue because the standards both produce the same result in this case gutierrez,at noting the persistent similarity in outcomes of the and brecht tests,and stating that it is unlikely for a constitutional harm under brecht to be harmless under.for the reasons that follow,we hold that the errors were harmless under both tests.
b.the constitutional errors were harmless
