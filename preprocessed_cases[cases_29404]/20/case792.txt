on july,the district court granted olabode motion and stated that it would resentence him to allow the filing of a notice of appeal.it appointed the defender association of philadelphia,federal court division to represent olabode.defense counsel subsequently informed the district court by letter that he had reviewed the record,that he found no additional grounds for habeas relief and that he was ready to proceed with the resentencing.at.on january,the district court reimposed the original sentence.olabode filed a notice of appeal on january.
on direct appeal,olabode claimed that the district court had improperly delegated the setting of the restitution schedule to the probation office.the government agreed that a remand was warranted.this court remanded the case to the district court to impose a restitution schedule.on february,the district court ordered a schedule of payments fixed at per year while olabode was confined at the ins detention center.
on march,olabode filed another pro se motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to,alleging that trial counsel misrepresented the terms of the plea agreement and that the evidence was insufficient to support his guilty plea.the district court transferred the motion to this court as an application for authorization to file a second or successive motion to the extent olabode claimed counsel was ineffective during the guilty plea colloquy and sentencing,and denied the motion on the merits to the extent olabode claimed counsel rendered ineffective assistance on appeal.olabode has not appealed the latter ruling.this court appointed counsel to represent olabode and directed the parties to address whether a subsequent motion is second or successive when a prior motion was limited to an effort to reinstate the right to file a direct appeal.an amicus brief was filed on behalf of the community defender organization for the eastern district of pennsylvania,the federal court division of the defender association of philadelphia,the federal defender office for the middle district of pennsylvania,the federal defender office for the western district of pennsylvania,the federal defender office of new jersey,the federal defender office of delaware,the federal defender office for the virgin islands,and the national association of federal defenders.amici argue that olabode motion is not second or successive.

discussion 
the passage of aedpa effected many changes in the law regarding applications for collateral relief in the federal courts.significant among those changes was the new limitation of a prisoner ability to file more than one collateral challenge.previously,the courts could dismiss a second or subsequent collateral attack on a conviction if the court believed it constituted an abuse of the writ.mccleskey zant,d.aedpa,however,has imposed a much more stringent rule.once the defendant has completed a direct appeal,the prisoner may file one collateral challenge as a matter of course provided it is timely.see.
thereafter,a prisoner ability to file a second or successive application for collateral relief is limited.before a second or successive motion may be filed in the district court,the applicant must move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the motion.b a.authorization may be granted only if the motion contains newly discovered evidence that,if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense or a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable.id.notwithstanding the specificity of many of the provisions of aedpa,it does not define what constitutes a second or successive motion,the necessary predicate for application of these provisions.
olabode argues that the motion that he filed after his resentencing is not second or successive because he filed his first motion to reinstate his right to a direct appeal after his counsel failed to file a notice of appeal.he notes that a defendant whose counsel filed a timely direct appeal would be able to file a motion thereafter.he maintains that it would be unjust to require him to use his one motion to reinstate a right that he would have had if counsel filed an appeal as he requested.
olabode argument is supported by the amici curiae who contend that,as a matter of statutory construction,because a motion seeks to vacate,set aside or correct the sentence,emphasis added,a second or successive motion would have to be second or successive to another motion challenging the same order imposing sentence.olabode motion at issue challenges a different order than did the first motion correspondingly,the notice of appeal was taken from the latter sentencing order dated january,and not the first sentencing order dated june.
the amici curiae also argue that as a matter of policy the direct appeal should occur before a collateral attack is made because only issues not raised or raisable on direct appeal can be addressed in a motion.they state that a direct appeal gives the defendant an opportunity to evaluate with counsel the claims that may be raised in a motion.like olabode,amici curiae argue that this approach places the defendant in the position he would have been in had the notice of appeal been timely filed.
the government argues that the better view is that such a motion is second or successive except with respect to claims which relate to the direct appeal.it contends t
