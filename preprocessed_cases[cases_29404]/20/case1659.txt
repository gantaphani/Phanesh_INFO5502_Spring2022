factual and procedural history 
on october,robert lee caver was convicted in the detroit recorder court of assault with intent to commit armed robbery and two counts of attempted assault with intent to commit armed robbery.caver was prosecuted for entering and looting a local drug house with two other men while impersonating federal law enforcement agents.caver is currently imprisoned only for assault with intent to commit armed robbery,as he has completed his sentences on the remaining convictions.
caver directly appealed his convictions,asserting that the trial court erred in instructing the jury and that there was insufficient evidence regarding assault to support the verdict.the michigan court of appeals affirmed caver convictions.caver then filed a delayed,pro se application for leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court.caver application reasserted the errors plus two new issues.one claim asserted that caver appellate counsel,neil leithauser,had failed to investigate certain allegedly meritorious issues.while he did generally state that he had wished to pursue an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim,caver did not allege that leithauser failed to investigate or pursue the absence of caver trial counsel,samuel simon,during the court response to the jury note or during the subsequent jury.the michigan supreme court denied caver delayed application for leave to appeal.
next,caver filed a motion for relief from judgment in the trial court,alleging,inter alia,the ineffectiveness of his trial and appellate counsel.the motion referred to two instances of trial counsel ineffectiveness relevant to this appeal 
defendant caver trial counsel 
failed to be present during open court proceeding sic during jury instructions,counsel was present and defendant was placed back in sic bullpen,and defendant nor counsel sic present during open court proceedings of his trial 
failed to remain with defendant immediately after jury retired to deliberate,where within minutes the jury sent a note requesting to see evidence.sic and counsel was not present 
caver based his claim of ineffective appellate counsel on his appellate attorney failure to raise these issues of ineffective trial counsel.the trial court denied caver motion,finding that caver had not demonstrated the good cause or prejudice required under d to excuse his failure to present the issues on his direct appeal.the court also concluded that caver ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim was without merit and could not satisfy the good cause requirement of d because appellate counsel is not required to raise every issue on appeal.jones barnes,d.the michigan court of appeal denied caver delayed appeal and his motion for rehearing,which was,in substance,identical to his brief before the district court.the appellate court concluded that caver had failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under d.
caver then filed an application for leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court.this application was notably different from caver earlier briefs in that caver separated the presentation of his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims and his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims.in treating his trial counsel claims,caver again presented paragraphs nine and eleven,which alleged the absence of trial counsel when the court received a note back from the jury and again when the court went on to the jury.caver treatment of his appellate counsel claims,however differed from his earlier applications.in caver application to the michigan supreme court,unlike his earlier claims,he failed to argue that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to present the ineffectiveness of caver trial counsel for being absent during critical stages of the trial.instead,caver asserted that appellate counsel was ineffective in not alleging trial counsel ineffectiveness in failing to object to certain testimony,failing to witnesses,and failing to investigate the illegality of caver arrest and his alibi.caver also asserted appellate counsel ineffectiveness in failing to assert error respecting the trial court refusal to allow the testimony of res gestae witnesses.caver application did also provide general statements of his appellate counsel ineffectiveness but these general statements appear to be in connection with his instances of appellate counsel ineffectiveness.the michigan supreme court denied caver application for leave to appeal,concluding that caver had failed to meet his burden under d.
on february,caver filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,alleging ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel,among other constitutional errors.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court granted caver petition.the district court found that caver appellate counsel had been ineffective in failing to raise the ineffectiveness of caver trial counsel on direct appeal,thus establishing both a separate constitutional defect and cause and prejudice sufficient to excuse the procedural default of caver claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.the attorney general now appeals the decision of the district court.
ii.standard of review 
appellate courts,in reviewing federal habeas corpus proceedings,examine the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings under a clearly erroneous standard.lucas,cir.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa was enacted on april.antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.relevant portions codified as amended at.caver filed his petition for relief on february.caver petition,therefore,is governed by d,as amended by aedpa.see williams taylor,d.under the amended statute,a writ of habeas corpus 
may issue only if the adjudication resulted in a decision that either was contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.

iii.discussion 
a.the court need not reach whether or not caver procedurally defaulted his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims because the state failed to raise the issue in proceedings before the district court 
the attorney general asserts that caver did not fairly present,in the state court collateral proceeding,the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim upon which the district court relied in granting caver petition and that the claim was,thus,procedurally defaulted.it is true that before seeking federal habeas corpus relief,a state prisoner must exhaust his available state remedies by fairly presenting all claims to the state courts.b see hannah conley,cir.the exhaustion requirement is satisfied after the petitioner fairly presents all claims to the highest court in the state in which the petitioner was convicted,thus giving it a fair and full opportunity to rule on his claims.see rust zent,cir.the petitioner bears the burden of proving that he has exhausted these remedies.see id.
caver,however,counters the attorney general procedural default argument by noting that issues raised for the first time on appeal are not properly before the court.wyckoff,standard fire ins,cir.a review of the record shows that respondent did not raise the issue of default before the district court,instead attempting to meet the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel arguments on the merits of the issue.accordingly,the court need not address caver alleged procedural default because respondent did not,in fact,raise the issue in the proceedings before the district court.
caver did not procedurally default his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim 
the attorney general also argues that caver procedurally defaulted his trial counsel claim.as described above,exhaustion occurs where a petitioner gives the state courts a fair and full opportunity to rule on his claims by fairly presenting all claims to the highest court in the state in which the petitioner was convicted.see rust zent,cir.the exhaustion requirement is also satisfied if it is clear that a claim is procedurally barred under state law.gray netherland,d.in such a case,however,the habeas petitioner must overcome the procedural default,an independent and adequate ground for the conviction and sentence that prevents federal habeas corpus review,by demonstrating cause and prejudice for the default.id.at.this court has previously announced a four part test to determine whether a claim has been procedurally defaulted 
first,the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner claim and that the petitioner failed to comply with the rule second,the court must decide whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction third,the court must decide whether the state procedural forfeiture is an adequate and independent state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim fourth,the petitioner must demonstrate under wainwright sykes,d that there was cause for him not to follow the procedural rule and that he was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.
maupin smith,cir.
d governs the procedures for collateral appeals and denies relief if the defendant alleges claims that could have been raised in the direct appeal from the conviction.see people jackson.specifically,the attorney general asserts that the issue of denial of counsel during a critical stage of the trial was not presented to the state courts.
ultimately,then,the issue is whether caver fairly presented the claim to the michigan courts in his one and only motion for relief from judgment.fair presentation of an issue requires that a petitioner give state courts a full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the state appellate review system.boerckel,d finding that one complete round includes discretionary appeal to state supreme court.fair presentation also requires that the same claim under the same theory be presented for the state court consideration.pillette foltz,cir.thus,to the extent that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is based upon a different allegedly ineffective action than the claim presented to the state courts,the claim has not been fairly presented to the state courts.id.
certainly,the issue was not raised in his direct appeal to the michigan court of appeals.he did,however,raise the issue in his pro se appeal to the michigan supreme court,asserting that he had wanted to present an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim in his intermediate appeal,but that appellate counsel had denied him that opportunity thus,the attorney general argument in this regard must fail.given the less stringent standards and active interpretation that are afforded to the filings of pro se litigants,urbina thoms,cir,these aspects of caver application support a finding that caver fairly presented the trial counsel ineffectiveness claim.
c.the district court did not err in concluding that the state court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law 
the attorney general makes two arguments in support of the contention that the district court erred by finding that the state court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.first,the attorney general maintains that the state court reasonably applied clearly established federal law in determining that caver appellate counsel did not fall below the required standard of professional competence.next,the attorney general asserts that the district court erroneously presumed prejudice under united states cronic,d,instead of conducting an individualized inquiry 
as noted above,a habeas petition may issue only if the state court decision is contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.the phrase clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta of the supreme court.williams taylor,d.as the supreme court has noted,i t is past question that the rule set forth in strickland qualifies as clearly established federal law for ineffective assistance of counsel claims.id.at.under the strickland washington test,to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland washington,d.for caver to succeed,however 
h e must do more than show that he would have satisfied strickland test,because under d,it is not enough to convince a federal habeas court that,in its independent judgment,the decision applied strickland incorrectly.rather,he must show that the state court applied strickland to the facts of his case in an objectively unreasonable manner.
bell cone,d citations omitted.
strickland performance component 
the supreme court has made clear that in reviewing a lawyer performance,a court scrutiny must be highly deferential.strickland,at.a fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.id.in relation to appellate counsel,the strickland performance standard does not require an attorney to raise every issue on appeal.see jones barnes,d.indeed,the process of winnowing out weaker arguments on appeal and focusing on those more likely to prevail is the hallmark of effective appellate advocacy.smith murray,d quoting barnes,at.as the supreme court has recently observed,it is difficult to demonstrate that an appellate attorney has violated the performance prong where the attorney presents one argument on appeal rather than another.smith robbins,d.in such cases,the petitioner must demonstrate that the issue not presented was clearly stronger than issues that counsel did present.id.at.
in the instant case,there can be little doubt but that the omitted counsel alleged absence during jury much stronger than the issues caver appellate counsel presented as caver notes,the first issue presented to the michigan courts on appeal whether the court erred in its aiding and abetting instruction was subject to plain error highly deferential standard,to put it mildly.moreover,the second argument presented on direct appeal,the sufficiency of the evidence,was dependent upon the success of the first issue.absent liability as an,there could be no evidence to support a finding of the requisite intent.
in contrast,because of the jury is a critical stage of a proceeding,see discussion infra part,caver would have had a far better chance of succeeding on his ineffective assistance claim.indeed,the largest obstacle to such a claim would have been the vagueness of the trial record with regard to trial counsel presence or absence during the actual of the jury.see discussion infra part.while such of appellate counsel evaluation of the facts may seem like the forbidden product of the distorting effect of hindsight,even assuming that counsel was absent only for the receipt of the jury note the resulting argument would still appear much stronger than a sufficiency of the evidence claim 
strickland prejudice component 
having determined that the representation of caver appellate counsel fell below an objectively reasonable standard,we must assess whether this performance prejudiced caver.the question presented here is whether an appellate counsel prejudices a client where the attorney fails to raise on appeal a claim that the trial counsel representation was per se prejudicial because the trial counsel was absent during a critical stage of the proceedings,namely jury.we answer in the affirmative,because but for the appellate counsel ineffectiveness,there is a reasonable probability that the result of the state appeal may have been different.
on the same day that the supreme court in strickland outlined the requirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,it also determined that where counsel is absent at a critical stage of a criminal proceeding the trial will be deemed unfair and prejudice under strickland presumed.united states cronic,d.the attorney general challenges the district court conclusion that jury is a critical stage such that prejudice is presumed and no individual analysis is required.
a critical stage of a criminal proceeding is a step of a criminal proceeding,such as arraignment,that h olds significant consequences for the accused.bell cone,d.where counsel is absent or denied in such instances,the likelihood that the verdict is unreliable is so high that a inquiry of prejudice to the defendant is unnecessary.mickens taylor,d citing cronic,at.the individual inquiry into whether counsel inadequate performance undermined the reliability of the verdict is forgone only in such cases.id.
is jury a critical stage under cronic while the supreme court has not expressly considered whether jury reinstruction,as it is understood in this matter,is a critical stage,this court recently a decision squarely and founded on the supreme court decision in it is french jones,cir.on remand from the supreme court,which had vacated the original appellate opinion in french and remanded for reconsideration in light of the supreme court decision in bell cone,d,this court reiterated its previous decision holding that jury was indeed a critical stage as described in cronic and that prejudice could be presumed.french,at.again,we note that the supreme court has uniformly found constitutional error without any showing of prejudice when counsel was either totally absent,or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding.french,at quoting united states cronic,d.this is to say,under cronic,that if petitioner trial counsel was,indeed,absent during the,a structural error occurred in the trial court proceeding,and either relief from judgment or a writ of habeas corpus could be properly granted on this ground any conclusion otherwise would be an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as stated in cronic.
because prejudice is presumed and because,as outlined above,appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the absence of trial counsel issue,the district court was correct in finding that the state court application of strickland that is,the state court conclusion that appellate counsel was not ineffective was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
d.the district court factual finding that caver trial attorney was absent during jury was not clearly erroneous 
the attorney general challenges not only the district court legal which we validate also the district court central factual determination standing as the linchpin of caver habeas petition.that determination is the district court finding that caver trial counsel was absent during jury.the record,the attorney general argues,is devoid of support for such a finding.
our review of the district court factual findings is highly deferential.we start from the premise that a district court factual findings in a habeas proceeding are reviewed for clear error.lucas,cir.clear error occurs only when the panel is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.if there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.united states kellams,cir.we are also mindful that in a habeas proceeding the petitioner has the burden of establishing his right to federal habeas relief and of proving all facts necessary to show a constitutional violation.romine head,cir.thus,the panel must determine whether or not the district court erred in determining that petitioner met the burden of establishing his right to federal habeas relief and of proving all facts necessary to show a constitutional violation on the record presented.
the collateral trial court opinion was the last reasoned opinion before the district court,and the opinion did not contain any findings of fact the district court held an evidentiary hearing,in which the petitioner and both trial and appellate counsel were questioned.the petitioner was not asked by his counsel about his claim that his trial attorney was not present when the jury was.for reasons that are unclear,trial counsel was not questioned respecting his alleged absence during jury.without any testimony on the matter,the district court was left with the following excerpt of the trial record 
back on the record at about 
the court i not really certain about this.
i not quite certain about what this note from the jury means.it says definitions of assault,and false pretenses.and i not quite certain,so i going to ask them if they would be kind enough to write down exactly what is on the verdict form.
brief pause.
the court gentlemen,i have written a note.
where is simon 
attorney for caver i just asked the same question.
the court nevertheless,i am writing this note 
dear jurors,i do quite understand your question.would you please mark on the verdict form the exact charge or charges that you want.
and i going to send them a form in there so they can write on here exactly what they want to hear.
after this exchange,the attorney for caver stated that he believed that the court should define assault and false pretenses,rather than making an inquiry.a note was then sent to the jury at.the court reconvened from to to clarify that the juror requests were required to be in writing.from to the trial court responded to the jury request and the requested instruction.after the jury was excused to deliberate,ernst,counsel for one of caver,objected to the court aiding and abetting,and the court overruled the objection.the trial transcript does not reflect simon presence in the courtroom from the time of the court initial question where is simon to the conclusion of the proceeding that day at 
the attorney general argues that the judge question,where is simon does not demonstrate that trial counsel was not present at the subsequent,but merely reflects his absence at the time of the judge statement in response to the jury question.the attorney general also cites the fact that the court went on and off the record twice after the judge question,arguing that it must be presumed that the judge would have pursued counsel absence if counsel had remained absent.therefore,the attorney general maintains,caver has not met his burden of proof on this point.
we disagree.while we must find clear error where the record is thoroughly devoid of evidence to support a district court finding,a district court factual finding may survive appellate scrutiny where there is some supporting evidence.naturally,the trial court judge inquiry,where is simon,raises the question of the trial attorney whereabouts,particularly when coupled with the subsequent concern expressed by caver trial counsel.thus,it can be understood to confirm simon absence from the courtroom at the time of the statement.there is no indication that simon returned to the courtroom in the period of time after the
