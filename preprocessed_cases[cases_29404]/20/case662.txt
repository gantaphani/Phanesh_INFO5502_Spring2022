opinion of the court 
introduction 
we have approached this case with the utmost seriousness.we are humbled by the fact that over a period of time,the case has progressed through courts of the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the district court without james lambert having been granted relief.we,nonetheless,must decide this case consistent with what we believe our obligation to be,while according the utmost respect to the standard of review that we are required to apply.having done so,we now vacate the judgment of the district court dated july,and remand this matter to the district court,which is directed to conditionally grant the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.if,within days of the date of this opinion and order,the commonwealth fails to retry lambert,he shall be released 
ii.procedural history 
it is not an overstatement to say that the procedural history of this case is extensive in the extreme,as would be expected in a case that has spanned more than years.we have carefully examined the numerous issues lambert has raised over these many years and how the various courts have resolved those issues.we,however,decide this case on one issue,an issue under brady maryland,and find it unnecessary to address the other issues raised to us or the issues raised to the courts that preceded us.so,too,only a summary of the procedural history that does not pertain to the brady issue will suffice.
james lambert and bruce reese were arrested and charged with murder,robbery,criminal conspiracy,and possession of an instrument of crime based on what the commonwealth had been told by one bernard jackson,who subsequently testified for the commonwealth in exchange for an open guilty plea to murder,robbery,conspiracy,and several unrelated crimes.on april,lambert was convicted by a jury of two counts of murder as well as the other crimes with which he was charged,and was sentenced to death.reese was convicted of murder,and was sentenced to life imprisonment.
lambert moved for a new trial and to vacate the judgment,motions which were denied.he appealed,and in a decision with two justices not participating,the pennsylvania supreme court upheld his conviction and affirmed the sentence of death.see commonwealth lambert,lambert i.lambert next filed a pro se pennsylvania relief act pcra petition,which was amended by counsel on january,and twice supplemented thereafter.on january,the pcra court denied the petition without a hearing.the pennsylvania supreme court remanded for the pcra court to write an opinion,which it did on march.lambert again appealed,and the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed in an opinion signed by two justices,with two justices concurring in the opinion,one concurring in the result,and two dissenting.see commonwealth lambert,lambert ii.lambert then filed a second pcra petition raising,for the first time,a claim under brady,based on recently discovered exculpatory evidence.that petition was denied as well,and the pennsylvania supreme court again affirmed.see commonwealth lambert,lambert iii.
in,lambert filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania raising claims of constitutional error,most of which were accompanied by related allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel the district court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing and denied relief on all claims,but granted a certificate of appealability coa on one claim relating to the commonwealth alleged discriminatory use of peremptory challenges at jury selection in violation of batson kentucky,and one claim relating to whether there had been a violation of mills maryland.see lambert beard,wl.july.
we then expanded the coa to include the following issues whether the commonwealth failure to disclose exculpatory evidence and misrepresentation of the bargain given to its key witness in exchange for his testimony violated brady whether lambert was denied his right to present a defense,call witnesses on his behalf,and confront the evidence against him when he was barred from introducing evidence that jackson and reese had a history of committing robberies together and without him whether lambert was denied his right to due process and a fair trial when the trial court allowed a witness called by reese to identify lambert for the first time in court whether lambert was denied his right to due process when the trial court refused to sever his trial from reese trial whether the trial court misled the jury about the role of appellate review in violation of caldwell mississippi,and whether lambert waiver of his right to present mitigating evidence was not knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under,and.we have appellate jurisdiction under and.we exercise plenary review over the decision of the district court,as the court did not hold an evidentiary hearing.see simmons beard,cir.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,where,as here,a habeas petitioner claims were adjudicated on the merits in state court,our review is limited to determining whether the state court decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent or an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court.see d.
iv.factual background 
at approximately on the evening of september,the robbery of prince lounge went bad,and two patrons were shot to death.the philadelphia police department commenced an investigation,but the perpetrators could not be identified,although two of the three barmaids working that night gave general descriptions of each of the two perpetrators.not long after the murders,however,an anonymous tip was received by the department identifying bernard jackson and touche later identified as reese,jackson as the men in the bar that night.each barmaid was subsequently presented,for the first time,with a photo array that included jackson photo.sarah clark identified jackson as the man who was standing at the top of the stairs in the bar and ordered her to place the money in a bag just before she heard two gunshots from the rear of the bar,the shots that killed the two patrons.marie green was to percent sure that the man at the top of the stairs was jackson.janet ryan,the third barmaid,was working at the rear of the bar and dropped down and ran to the ladies room when the shooter pointed a gun in her face.
jackson,who by then was in custody on another charge,learned that he had been identified by at least one of the barmaids and told the police about the prince lounge robbery and that reese and another dude,whose name he could not recall,had done it.his story,at least initially,went as follows.he and reese met the other dude whom he much later identified as lambert for the first time less than an hour before the three of them decided to rob a bar.after casing,and rejecting,one bar,jackson,who admitted to having previously committed at least thirteen armed robberies of bars,made the decision to rob the prince lounge after ascertaining that a female friend of his was not working that night.jackson claimed to have waited in the getaway car while lambert and reese entered the bar and went upstairs,each armed with a handgun provided by was carrying the and reese the,which,as it turned out,was the murder weapon.jackson claimed not to have known what happened in the bar aside from what he was told by reese and lambert when they returned to the car and fled the scene with jackson at the wheel.
discussion 
it is undisputed that without jackson statements to the police,the commonwealth could not have indicted lambert on these charges.see giglio united states,finding evidence impeaching witness credibility material,in part,because without the witness testimony,there could have been no indictment.jackson,however,came burdened with a wealth of impeachment material,not the least of which were four prior inconsistent statements to the police about who did what and who said what on the night in question,and his admitted goal of testifying to save himself from a death sentence no
