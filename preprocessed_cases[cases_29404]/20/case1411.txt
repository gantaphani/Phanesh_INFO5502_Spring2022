merita muka,her husband,ilirian muka,and their children,lionela and brajen muka collectively referred to as the mukas,appeal the district court dismissal of their habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction.specifically,the mukas argue that in the instant case,application of the provisions of the real id act of,divesting the district court of jurisdiction over writs of habeas corpus in immigration cases would violate the suspension clause of the constitution and the mukas are entitled to protection from removal under i.
for the reasons discussed below,we disagree with the mukas first argument,which is dispositive in this case,and affirm the district court.
facts and procedure 
the underlying facts of this case were accurately recited in a prior opinion and are mostly unnecessary in disposing of the instant appeal therefore,we will only briefly summarize the facts.the mukas,citizens of albania,illegally entered the united states in.muka gonzales,cir unpublished opinion muka i.the mukas filed applications for asylum and withholding of removal and,after a hearing,the immigration judge ij denied their applications on may.the ij ordered the mukas removed.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed that decision on november.the mukas then petitioned this court for review of the bia decision,which a panel of this court denied on may.
subsequently,on december,the mukas filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court,claiming that the district court had jurisdiction to review the case under,and asking the district court to review the lawfulness of the order of removal entered against the mukas and to issue an immediate stay of removal pending the outcome of these proceedings.record at pet.for writ.the mukas asserted that they were the beneficiaries of an approved visa petition filed by merita muka united states citizen brother,and that b y virtue of this petition,the family will be eligible for adjustment of status under i when an immigrant visa becomes available.at pet.for writ.according to the mukas,merita brother filed a petition for alien relative form on merita behalf on april,which was approved on july.at pet.for writ.the petition has a priority date of april,however,immigrant visas are not yet available for individuals with such a late priority date.mukas br.at.the mukas do not explain,either in their habeas petition or in their brief before this court,why they did not raise this argument during their initial removal proceedings or in their petition for review.
the government responded to the mukas habeas petition by requesting that the district court dismiss the petition.specifically,the government asserted that provisions of the real id act of,codified at,clearly deprived the district court of jurisdiction to consider the mukas claim for habeas relief.at resp.to pet.at.on october,the district court issued an order agreeing with the government.after analyzing three separate provisions of the real id act,the district court found that the clear and unambiguous language of the statute deprives this court of jurisdiction to grant the relief that petitioners request.muka baker,wl,muka ii.furthermore,the district court noted that the mukas ha d already sought a review of the bia decision by the sixth circuit,at which time t he court of appeals conducted the review,agreed with the bia,and denied the petition for review.id.at.the district court concluded that petitioners argument that the denial of their petition for a writ of habeas corpus would be in violation of the suspension clause is without merit petitioners have been afforded an adequate avenue for review of their challenge to the order of removal.id.the mukas timely appealed this order.
while this appeal was pending,the mukas filed a motion to stay removal proceedings,which a panel of this court denied on january.after this denial,the mukas left the united states and are currently seeking asylum in canada.mukas br.at.the government then filed a motion to dismiss based on two grounds the case is moot because the mukas left the united states,and this court lacks jurisdiction.we denied the motion,stating that we can not conclude that the matter is moot.muka baker,cir.june.we also denied the government motion for reconsideration on the ground that dismissal of this appeal at this time based on lack of jurisdiction would be premature given that the question of the district court jurisdiction in habeas is the issue presented on the merits of this appeal.muka baker,cir.june.
ii.analysis 
as a threshold matter,the mukas contend that the district court interpretation of the real id act as stripping the district court of jurisdiction over the mukas habeas petition violates the suspension clause of the constitution,article,clause.this is a question of law that we review de novo.mukasey,cir.applying de novo review,we conclude that the mukas argument is meritless 
the suspension clause of the constitution states that t he privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.const.art.i,cl.furthermore,the supreme court has noted that this clause requires some judicial intervention in deportation cases.cyr,d internal quotation marks omitted.however,the writ of habeas corpus is not suspended in violation of this clause if,when the right to habeas is eliminated,there is the substitution of a new collateral remedy which is both adequate and effective in allowing an individual to challenge the legality of his or her detention.swain pressley,d.
as we have previously held,with one limited exception not applicable in the instant case t he real id act of clearly eliminated a habeas petition as a means for judicial review of a removal order.jaber gonzales,cir see also elia gonzales,cir noting that the real id act amendments limit habeas relief in immigration cases almuhtaseb gonzales,cir stating that t he real id act renders petitions for review the exclusive means for judicial review for all orders of removal,except for limited habeas review of expedited removal orders.this is true because the real id act explicitly states that 
b consolidation of questions for judicial review 
j udicial review of all questions of law and fact,including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions,arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the united states under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section.except as otherwise provided in this section,no court shall have jurisdiction,by habeas corpus under section of title,or any other habeas corpus provision,by section or of such title,or by any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,to review such an order or such questions of law or fact.
b emphases added.moreover,another subsection of the real id act provides 
g exclusive jurisdiction 
except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,including section of title,united states code,or any other habeas corpus provision,and sections and of such title,no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the attorney general to commence proceedings,adjudicate cases,or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.
g emphases added.thus,as the district court noted,it is abundantly clear that absent a grant of authority elsewhere in the section,a district court is expressly excluded from considering a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.muka ii,wl,at see also xiu yan chen gonzales,cir concluding that a petition under filed in a district court after may,must be dismissed because it can not be entertained by a district court de ping wang dep t of homeland,cir t he real id act eliminated the availability of habeas corpus as a separate means of obtaining judicial review of a final order of removal.
however,the real id act did not simply remove the availability of habeas relief and leave aliens without any avenue to challenge the legality of removal orders.instead,t
