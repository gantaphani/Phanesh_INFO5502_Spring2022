detlef hartmann is an inmate at the delaware correctional center in smyrna,delaware.he has filed an application for federal habeas relief under.the united states district court for the district of delaware dismissed the application as under the limitations period set forth in d.hartmann appeals,arguing that his application was timely because his filing of various motions in delaware state court tolled the limitations period in accordance with d.because we conclude that hartmann motion under delaware superior court criminal rule b did not meet the tolling requirements of d,we will affirm the judgment of the district court,dismissing hartmann petition as untimely.
background 
on march,hartmann pled guilty in delaware superior court to one count of second degree unlawful sexual intercourse and two counts of unlawful sexual contact.the victim of each count was a minor child.hartmann was immediately sentenced,consistent with the plea agreement,to an aggregate of nineteen years of incarceration,suspended with decreasing levels of supervision after the mandatory minimum term of ten years.hartmann did not appeal either his conviction or his sentence.
on june,pursuant to delaware superior court criminal rule b,hartmann filed a pro se motion in the superior court for sentence reconsideration,reduction,or modification in this motion,he sought a reduction in his sentence on the basis of thirteen mitigating circumstances.the superior court denied the motion on june,noting that it had no discretion to reduce a mandatory minimum sentence.
on november,hartmann filed another motion,entitled motion to dismiss.in this motion,hartmann challenged the jurisdiction of the superior court over the charges in his indictment and alleged that his counsel had been ineffective.on november,the superior court struck the motion,noting that a motion to dismiss was improper because hartmann convictions were final.on march,the delaware supreme court affirmed this order,explaining that the superior court did not abuse its discretion in striking the motion as a nonconforming document to the extent that the motion did not comply with rule.the supreme court also determined that hartmann substantive argument was meritless.
on august,hartmann filed a habeas petition for federal collateral relief under.the district court dismissed the petition as under the limitations period set forth in d.the district court found that hartmann conviction had become final on april,and that he did not file his petition until august,over two years later.although the application would have been timely had the limitations period been tolled both by the rule b motion and by the motion to dismiss,the district court determined that hartmann motion to dismiss could not toll the limitations period because it was not a properly filed application for state relief under d.thus,the district court found that the period from november,through march,should be counted as part of hartmann allowance and that,as a result,hartmann petition was untimely regardless of whether his rule b motion tolled the limitations period.the district court therefore declined to rule on the tolling effect of hartmann rule b motion.
on november,a panel of our court issued a certificate of appealability under c with regard to the district court ruling that hartmann petition was.we requested briefing with respect to the applicability of statutory tolling on the rule b motion and the motion to dismiss.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court exercised jurisdiction over hartmann petition pursuant to a.we have jurisdiction of this appeal pursuant to and.our review of the timeliness of a federal habeas application is plenary.see nara frank,cir.
iii.discussion 
with the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,congress established a limitations period within which a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court may file an application in federal court for a writ of habeas corpus.d absent a impediment to filing or the development of new constitutional rights or discoverable facts,none of which is present in this case,the limitations period runs from the date on which the state conviction became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.d a.because hartmann did not seek direct review of his sentence or his conviction,his conviction became final on the date on which his time for seeking direct review expired.in delaware,a direct appeal of a criminal conviction must be filed within thirty days after the date of conviction.supr.a iii.hartmann was convicted on march,and his conviction became final on april,therefore,absent any tolling,hartmann had until april,to file a federal habeas application that was timely under d.hartmann did not file his petition until august.
in aedpa,congress also provided a statutory mechanism by which petitioners may toll the limitations period prescribed in d.under d,t he time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.hartmann claims that his limitations period was tolled under d during two periods of time first,during the pendency of his rule b motion,from june,through june,and second,during the pendency of his motion to dismiss,from november,through march.for hartmann petition to be timely under d,both motions must have had the effect of tolling the limitations period the time gained from either one,without the other,is insufficient 
we look first to the rule b motion.the question we address is whether hartmann,by filing a motion under delaware superior court criminal rule b,filed an application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim capable of tolling the limitations period for filing a federal habeas application.to answer this question,we first must understand what hartmann was requesting when he filed for relief under rule b.unlike delaware superior court criminal rule a,which allows a court to correct an illegal sentence,and rule,which governs the procedures by which a person can challenge a judgment on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction or on any other ground that is a sufficient factual and legal basis for a collateral attack,rule b allows for a reduction of sentence without regard to the existence of a legal defect.state lewis,emphasis added.a rule b motion is a plea for leniency,directed toward the sentencing court,which seeks discretionary relief based on mercy and grace,rather than on the law.a prisoner may make such a motion only once and,except in extraordinary circumstances,must file the motion within days of the date on which the sentence was imposed or forfeit the right to do so.if the deadline is read together with the deadline for filing a direct appeal,most prisoners who file a rule b motion will do so during the pendency of the direct appeal importantly,a prisoner is not obligated to seek relief under rule b delaware direct and collateral appellate review mechanisms operate independently of the rule b procedures by which a prisoner may seek discretionary leniency 
thus,we are presented with the question does a properly filed plea for leniency,by which the prisoner seeks discretionary mercy and does not challenge the lawfulness of the sentence,toll the limitations period for filing federal habeas application in approaching this question,we are reminded that our court has taken a flexible approach toward interpreting d.see nara,at.flexibility,however,is not without limits the application of a flexible approach requires recognition of the limits past which the rule in question will not bend.
nara involved a state court prisoner who had collaterally challenged his mental competence to enter a guilty plea but who had withdrawn his challenge after being informed that he had already litigated the issue in an earlier collateral proceeding.he then filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea nunc pro tunc.id.at.in a habeas proceeding before us,we held that,under our flexible approach,nara
