opinion of the court 
james shedrick appeals from the district court denial of his petition for habeas corpus alleging ineffective assistance of counsel on two grounds.the government first contests our jurisdiction,however,because of an appellate and waiver contained in shedrick signed plea agreement.we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this appeal relating to claims to hold otherwise could work a miscarriage of justice.we next affirm the district court denial of shedrick claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him about sentencing matters,but conclude,contrary to the district court,that ineffectiveness of counsel prevented shedrick from timely appealing.therefore,we vacate his sentence and remand this case with directions for the district court to it.shedrick will then be able to file a timely direct appeal,which we will consider in the normal course.
factual and procedural background 
in the early morning of july,philadelphia police officers keya mason,raymond rutter,and joy,along with sergeant beverly pembrook,were on patrol in philadelphia district.officer mason responded to a emergency call reporting a man with a gun located at street and greenway avenue.upon arriving at that address,officer mason heard gun shots but did not see anyone in the area.
sergeant pembrook also responded immediately to the call and,like officer mason,did not find anyone at the scene.after a short time,however,pembrook observed a identified as in the middle of the intersection holding a large silver revolver in his right hand.pembrook made a priority radio call for,stating that the suspect was armed and not in custody.
by that time,mason had joined pembrook.officers rutter and,who were riding together,also arrived at the scene.pembrook and mason stood in front of a police car and attempted to engage shedrick while rutter and began to approach him from covered positions behind parked cars.the officers repeatedly instructed shedrick to drop the gun,but he refused.he pointed the gun at the sky and attempted to fire three shots.the gun failed to discharge.
the officers repeated their order for shedrick to drop his gun.he again aimed the gun upward and pulled the trigger three more times.yet again the gun failed to fire.shedrick then opened up the cylinder of the revolver,and empty shell casings fell out of the weapon.when this occurred,the police and disarmed him.officer rutter called in a report indicating that shedrick was in custody.
immediately after shedrick was detained,the officers were approached by li nguyen and patricia edwards.nguyen and edwards stated that they had been in a van on their way to work when shedrick had appeared on the street and started firing shots at their vehicle.one of the bullets struck the front hood of the van.a second bullet penetrated the windshield and traveled directly between nguyen,who was driving,and edwards,who was in the front passenger seat.nguyen and edwards reported that they went to a police station one block away to report the shooting.when they returned to the spot where the shooting had occurred,they witnessed the police tackling shedrick.
the police traced the gun in shedrick possession,a smith wesson caliber revolver,to an individual named aki brickhouse.brickhouse was charged with,and pled guilty to,transferring the weapon to a convicted felon shedrick.he also asserted that shedrick had been selling crack cocaine on a regular basis from a location in west philadelphia and had carried the smith wesson while dealing drugs.
shedrick was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.he signed a written agreement with the government,pleading guilty to that charge and specifically admitting that he possessed the revolver,he had a prior felony record and the revolver had traveled in interstate commerce.however,shedrick vigorously contested any involvement in the van shooting as described by nguyen and edwards and any drug dealing while armed with the revolver as described by brickhouse.
the plea agreement expressly stated that shedrick maximum potential sentence was ten years imprisonment.it went on to note that the government was permitted to make whatever sentencing recommendation as to imprisonment it deems appropriate.indeed,both parties were free to argue the applicability of any other provision of the sentencing guidelines,including offense conduct,offense characteristics,criminal history,adjustments and departures.
the agreement also included a provision waiving not only most appeals but also collateral attacks.it stated 
in exchange for the undertakings made by the government in entering this plea agreement,the defendant voluntarily and expressly waives all rights to appeal or collaterally attack the defendant conviction,sentence,or any other matter relating to this prosecution,whether such a right to appeal or collateral attack arises under,or any other provision of law.
notwithstanding the waiver provision above,if the government appeals from the sentence,then the defendant may file a direct appeal of his sentence.
b.if the government does not appeal,then notwithstanding the waiver provision set forth in paragraph above,the defendant may file a direct appeal but may raise only claims that 
the defendant sentence exceeds the statutory maximum or 
ii.the sentencing judge erroneously departed upward from the otherwise applicable sentencing guideline range.
the district court conducted a plea hearing in november.during shedrick guilty plea colloquy,the court confirmed and reinforced the terms of the written plea agreement.at the outset of the hearing,the court stated 
and a plea agreement has been reached and it is recorded in writing and will be filed certainly at the end of this proceeding.but,most importantly,although the plea agreement states all of the agreements and understandings that exist between the defendant,defense counsel,and the government,it does not recommend a set term of incarceration as binding upon this court.ultimately,the appropriate sentence would be left to the exercise of the court discretion based upon information presented by both sides and based upon a review of the sentencing guidelines.
later,the court reiterated that the sentence would be left to its discretion and that there were no agreements with anyone about what the right sentence should be.shedrick confirmed this understanding.he also acknowledged that no other agreements existed between himself and the government except those contained in the written plea agreement.the court then made clear to shedrick that the maximum sentence in his case was ten years incarceration.shedrick did express some confusion whether the facts alleged in the plea agreement included an admission that he aimed or shot at police officers,prompting the court to clarify that he had only agreed to plead to the basic facts of possessing the gun as a convicted felon and that any other issues were left to the parties to argue at sentencing.
after shedrick entered his plea,the probation office prepared a presentence report psr.it calculated shedrick base offense level at.it then recommended a enhancement under sentencing guidelines manual b due to shedrick prior felony conviction for a controlled substance offense and a deduction under for acceptance of responsibility.those adjustments resulted in an offense level of that,combined with a criminal history category of iii,yielded a sentencing guidelines range of to months.
two weeks prior to sentencing,the government filed a memorandum with the district court arguing that shedrick was subject to a enhancement for possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense specifically,drug dealing,and the court should depart upward eight levels from the established guidelines range because shedrick had discharged the weapon during the commission of his offense by shooting at a van occupied by two people.shedrick objected.
the district court held a sentencing hearing during which the potential enhancement for possession in connection with another felony offense,as well as the upward departure for shooting at the van,were contested.the government called two witnesses to provide a factual basis to support the enhancement and departure brickhouse and nguyen.
brickhouse testified that shedrick had been selling cocaine on a regular basis and that both shedrick and his,tarik robinson,had carried the smith wesson revolver while dealing drugs.
nguyen testified that he and patricia edwards were driving to work in a red van at approximately on the date of shedrick arrest,when a black man holding a silver revolver started shooting at them.the government provided photographs to the district court showing that bullets struck the left front hood of the van and the,passing between the two passengers.nguyen recounted going to a police station to report the shooting,returning to where it had occurred,and witnessing the police tackling the man who had shot at the van 
after brickhouse and nguyen testimony,shedrick testified to his version of events.he admitted that he had the gun in his possession,but denied ever firing it.he also stated that he did not know brickhouse and had never seen nguyen prior to the sentencing hearing.
the government and defense counsel then engaged in extended arguments about the enhancement and departure.the defense contended that there was insufficient evidence to show that shedrick either had been dealing drugs or had fired the shots that struck nguyen van.thus,it was the defense position that shedrick should receive a sentence within the standard guidelines to months.
the government,on the other hand,maintained that because the evidence demonstrated that shedrick had carried the gun while dealing drugs as testified to by brickhouse and that shedrick shot at the van as testified to by nguyen,both the enhancement and upward departure should apply.it recommended to the court a sentence of months incarceration 
at the close of the hearing,the district court found that brickhouse and nguyen were credible witnesses and thus applied the enhancement and upward departure.accordingly,the court sentenced shedrick to months incarceration to be followed by three years of supervised release.
the district court appointed shedrick new counsel for purposes of appeal on july,over five months after sentencing,as shedrick trial counsel had not filed an appeal.on august,approximately six months after sentencing,his new counsel filed a motion for enlargement of time to submit a notice of appeal nunc pro tunc.the district court denied the motion on august,and our court dismissed the appeal as untimely on november.shedrick through counsel proceeded to file a habeas corpus petition in the district court,which was denied.he petitioned pro se our court for a certificate of appealability,which was granted for two issues whether counsel was ineffective for failing to advise shedrick of a possible upward departure at sentencing and whether counsel was ineffective for filing an untimely appeal.before we reach these issues,however,we address the government jurisdictional contention.
ii.jurisdiction 
according to the government,the appeal and collateral attack waiver contained in shedrick written plea agreement strips our jurisdiction.not so.in united states khattak,we joined the courts of appeals for ten other circuits and held that w aivers of appeal,if entered into knowingly and voluntarily,are valid,unless they work a miscarriage of justice,cir.though khattak went on to say that,if a waiver is valid,we have no jurisdiction to consider the merits of an appeal,we recently clarified that statement,see united states gwinnett,cir.n otwithstanding the statement in khattak,this c ourt retains jurisdiction over the appeal by a defendant who ha s signed an appellate waiver.id.at.this does not undermine the practical bite of such waivers,however.for as stated in both khattak and gwinnett,we will not exercise our jurisdiction to review the merits of a defendant appeal if we conclude that she knowingly and voluntarily waived her right to appeal unless the result would work a miscarriage of justice.id.at khattak,at.in short,we have jurisdiction over this case,but will generally not exercise it absent compelling reasons.
at first glance,it does appear that shedrick waived his right to appeal and collaterally attack his sentence in paragraph of the plea agreement.however,the agreement goes on to state that an appeal is preserved if any of three conditions occurs.they are,to repeat,a government appeal,a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum,or an erroneous upward departure from the otherwise applicable sentencing guidelines range.
it is undisputed that the first two predicates do not apply here the government did not appeal,and shedrick sentence of months imprisonment does not exceed the statutory maximum of ten years.shedrick maintains,however,that the third condition applies.specifically,he argues that the evidence was not sufficient to support the district court conclusion that he discharged his gun,which was the basis of the court upward departure he further argues that ineffective assistance of counsel prevented him from timely appealing this allegedly erroneous departure.
the government,on the other hand,claims that shedrick is not arguing that the court erroneously granted an upward departure,but merely is arguing that counsel was ineffective for allegedly not informing him that the potential for an upward departure existed.gov t br.at.we disagree.at its essence,shedrick argument is that,as a result of counsel deficient performance,he failed to understand the full effect of his guilty plea as it related to upward departures,and failed timely to appeal the district court upward departure,which he was entitled to appeal under the express terms of the plea agreement waiver.enforcing a waiver where constitutionally deficient lawyering prevented shedrick from understanding his plea or from filing a direct appeal as permitted by his plea agreement would result in a miscarriage of justice in this context,we will exercise our jurisdiction to consider shedrick claims.
iii.merits 
ineffectiveness of counsel for failure to advise 
shedrick first argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his plea process as a result of counsel failure to advise him about a potential enhancement or upward departure at sentencing.according to shedrick,a fundamental consideration for him in determining whether to accept the guilty plea was the length of sentence he could expect to receive.
under the test of strickland washington,d,shedrick must demonstrate that his attorney performance was deficient and that he was prejudiced by the deficiency.that is,he must prove that counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,id.at,and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.
shedrick can not satisfy these requirements.indeed,we have long held that an erroneous sentencing prediction by counsel is not ineffective assistance of counsel where,as here,an adequate plea hearing was conducted.see,united states jones,cir counsel not ineffective for allegedly promising defendant a sentence of no more than months where defendant was advised in colloquy of potential maximum sentence and there were no other promises regarding sentence united states mustafa,cir a ny alleged misrepresentations that defendant former counsel may have made regarding sentencing calculations were dispelled when defendant was informed in open court that there was no guarantee as to sentence,and that the court could sentence him to the maximum.masciola united states,cir per curiam holding that a n erroneous prediction of a sentence by defendant counsel does not render a guilty plea involuntary where record demonstrates that a proper plea colloquy took place during which defendant acknowledged that he was aware of his maximum potential sentence.as stated in mustafa,
w e recognize that the maximum sentence authorized by law is often so extraordinarily long that few defendants other than career criminals plead guilty with the expectation that the maximum sentence applies to them.however,all that the law requires is that the defendant be info
