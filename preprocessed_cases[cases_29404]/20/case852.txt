the district court granted steven watkins petition for a writ of habeas corpus under,finding that the west virginia prosecuting attorney had,after trial,admitted to watkins defense counsel that the victim of watkins attempted robbery crime told the prosecuting attorney before trial that he,the victim,had not been put in fear by watkins on the date of the crime,an element essential to conviction under west virginia law,and that the prosecuting attorney had failed to so inform watkins.based on this finding,the district court concluded that the state habeas court had unreasonably applied the principles of brady maryland.
on appeal,the west virginia officials named in watkins habeas petition the state claim that the district court impermissibly found new facts and erred in failing to give the appropriate deference to the state habeas court factual findings and conclusions of law made with respect to its adjudication of watkins brady claim.we agree and accordingly reverse.
underlying criminal proceeding 
on june,steven watkins entered zimm pharmacy in fayetteville,west virginia,wearing a hard hat,sunglasses,and a red bandana that masked his face.when watkins entered the store,only the owner,mike zimm,and two female employees were inside.watkins began to ask zimm a question,but zimm could not understand it and asked watkins to repeat the question.watkins then tried to move his mask,or his disguise so that his speech would be muffled as much and repeated his question,asking zimm whether he had pushed the button to activate the store security system.even though he had not done so,zimm told watkins that he had in fact activated the system,which prompted watkins to flee the store and to enter a nearby apartment building.
watkins was eventually arrested and charged with attempted robbery in the second degree,in violation of b,which punishes a ny person who attempts to commit robbery by placing the victim in fear of bodily injury.
at watkins trial,zimm testified on behalf of the state and explained how watkins had placed him in fear of bodily injury 
q you indicated that you were fearful of watkins is that correct 
a yes,i was fearful.i did know what to expect for me or my employees.
q w as there anything going on in your business community at this time that triggered that fear 
a yes,sir.there had been numerous robberies and,just recently before that,there had been a couple robberies in the beckley area,raleigh county pharmacies,pharmacists.
q and what thought went through your head when you saw this man approaching you dressed in the manner that you saw that day 
a i thought,it my turn.they come to fayette county.that what i thought.
zimm testimony at trial was consistent with a statement he gave to police officers on the day of the incident.it was also corroborated by the trial testimony of one of the employees in the store who observed zimm 
q c an you tell me what came into your mind as to what was going on at the time watkins entered the store 
a well,at first when he came in and he approached the counter,i at first thought it was a joke,because we have several customers that would do that.and then i realized after he had asked zimm about the alarm,zimm had the look of,you know,something bad,something going on,and i knew it was a joke anymore 
at the conclusion of the state case,watkins filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that zimm had been placed in reasonable fear of bodily injury,but the trial court denied the motion.and during closing argument,both prosecuting attorney brian parsons and defense counsel james adkins presented argument with respect to the fear element.
the jury found watkins guilty of the offense as charged,and the court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of between and years.the supreme court of appeals of west virginia summarily denied watkins appeal,and watkins did not seek review by the supreme court of the united states.
state habeas proceeding 
watkins filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in west virginia state court,claiming,among other things,that he had been denied a fair trial because prosecuting attorney parsons had failed to inform defense counsel adkins that zimm had told parsons that he,zimm,might not have been afraid of watkins on the day of the attempted robbery.watkins claimed that this nondisclosure was a violation of brady maryland,which requires the prosecution,upon request,to provide the accused with evidence favorable to the accused.specifically,watkins petition stated 
defense counsel adkins has provided a memorandum to habeas counsel indicating that he was present during a conversation with prosecuting attorney parsons who allegedly uttered that the victim,mike zimm,told him that he was never afraid and parsons responded that if that was the case then they should stop prosecuting at that time.if that is true,then the state of west virginia failed to provide that exculpatory evidence to the defendant herein,in violation of brady.
in the state written response to watkins petition,prosecuting attorney parsons admitted that he had had at least two discussions with zimm before trial about the definition of the fear element and exactly what had to be proved at trial.but,as parsons explained unequivocally 
zimm did not state that he was never afraid,but rather he sought a better understanding of what fear meant in the context of this case.
parsons attributed zimm questioning to a certain amount of bravado that existed in his relationship with zimm and to the hesitation of one man to acknowledge fear to another.
the state court conducted an evidentiary hearing on watkins petition,and defense counsel adkins testified at the hearing that,at an unrelated court proceeding after watkins had been convicted,prosecuting attorney parsons stated that zimm might not have been scared of watkins at the time of the incident.specifically,adkins said 
q do you recall what was said at that time 
my contemporaneous note would probably be more accurate than my memory w e were at another hearing,and parsons had stated something to the effect that zimm might not have been scared of watkins on the day of the alleged robbery.
emphasis added.prosecuting attorney parsons did not dispute adkins testimony.rather,in adkins,he obtained adkins agreement that parsons pretrial discussions with zimm,during which they discussed the fear element,were appropriate 
q y ou would agree with me that,although the term fear or being afraid,has some sort of common sense application or meaning,the term fear as it relates to a legal standard of being afraid is something that a person with an education such as zimm might have a question about is that fair to say 
q i s it also a fair statement that,if zimm was not afraid of watkins,there really no sense in the case being prosecuted is that a fair way to look at it from the state perspective 
q do you have any problem with an attorney for the state saying to a victim that,if you not afraid or you do feel that you were afraid,you need to tell me and we not going to take this case forward.do you have a problem with that question do you feel in your professional opinion that that is coaching a witness 
after receiving the evidence,the state habeas court denied watkins petition,issuing a written opinion that made findings of fact and conclusions of law.the court relevant findings and conclusions were as follows 
the court finds that,during trial,state mike zimm testified that he was afraid of watkins based upon what watkins said in zimm store and upon watkins appearance.zimm trial testimony was consistent with the statement he gave to police at the time of the incident.
the court finds that,at some time after the trial of this matter,adkins was told that zimm said he was not afraid at the time of the incident at issue.parsons discussed with zimm the definition of the word fear as it applied to the elements of the crime at issue,and that parsons informed zimm that if the element of fear did not exist,then the case could not be proven at trial.the discovery provided to the defense did not contain any reference to zimm alleged statement that he was not afraid or to the above described conversation between parsons and zimm.
the court concludes that the state alleged failure to inform defense counsel of the conversation between parsons and zimm regarding the requirement of fear did not violate brady maryland.
additionally,the court concludes that parsons statements to zimm with regard to the element of fear were an accurate way to describe elemental requirements to a lay and that there is no evidence that parsons suggested or improperly influenced zimm testimony.
watkins appealed the court ruling to the supreme court of appeals of west virginia,and that court affirmed,adopting and incorporating the state habeas court order as its own.
federal habeas proceeding 
finally,watkins filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court,pursuant to.he again asserted,among other things,that he was denied his right to due process under the united states constitution when the prosecution knowingly withheld from him impeachment evidence that was exculpatory,in violation of brady.
by order dated march,the district court stated that it could not determine whether the state court improperly found that no brady violation occurred because the state court never made a finding concerning whether or not zimm stated that he was not in fear on the day of the subject incident.the court accordingly ordered a plenary evidentiary hearing to make an independent factual determination regarding whether zimm had made the statement in question to prosecuting attorney parsons before trial.later,however,the court realized that such an evidentiary hearing would not be consistent with the supreme court holding in cullen pinholster.holding that federal court review under d is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits,and instead,it simply issued a final order dated march,granting watkins petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
in granting watkins petition,the court stated 
i found in a prior order that the state habeas court did not find whether zimm had stated he was never afraid.however,there is an important distinction between proof of the substance of zimm statement and proof that the state admitted that the statement was made.i now find that the state court found the state had admitted that zimm made this statement.put differently,the state court did not find that zimm said he was not afraid the state court found that the prosecutor admitted that zimm said he was not afraid.in light of the clear admission that the state was in possession of brady material,i also find the state court unreasonably applied clearly established supreme court precedent to the facts.
to support its conclusion,the district court relied on the key factual finding made by the state habeas court.but in doing so,the court assumed facts that supported a brady violation,whereas the state habeas court had not assumed those facts and found no such violation 
i now conclude that the state habeas court found that parsons admitted to adkins that he,the prosecutor,was in possession of brady material.i quote from the state court findings 
the court finds that,at some time after trial of this matter,trial counsel was told by the prosecutor that zimm said he was not afraid at the time of the incident at issue.
to justify its contrary conclusion,the district court had to assume,making an implied factual finding,that zimm statement that he was not afraid was imputable to prosecuting attorney parsons before trial.but the state habeas court had found only that the pretrial conversation between zimm and prosecuting attorney parsons related to a discussion of the fear element,and it did not ascribe any particular importance to the conversation between prosecuting attorney parsons and defense counsel adkins,where parsons observed that zimm might not have been afraid of watkins.with this additional implied finding,the district court concluded,based on the state court factual finding and the evidence in the record,it would be objectively unreasonable to conclude that no brady violation occurred.
the state filed this appeal,contending that the district court failed to give the necessary deference to the factual findings and legal conclusions of the state habeas court,as required by d and e.
in brady maryland,the supreme court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.to prove a brady violation,a habeas petitioner must show that the evidence was favorable to him material in the possession of the prosecution before trial and not disclosed to him upon request.see united states stokes,cir.stated otherwise,brady mandates the disclosure of favorable evidence when it could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.kyles whitley.and,of course,the supreme court has made clear that brady only protects a defendant before trial and that nothing in its precedents suggest s that brady disclosure obligation continue s after the defendant is convicted and the case is closed.district att y office for the third judicial dist.osborne,emphasis added.
in this case,watkins contends that prosecuting attorney parsons violated brady in failing to produce before trial the fact that zimm had admitted before trial that he was not afraid at the time of the attempted robbery.of course,if that fact were true,then the information would be favorable to watkins,and its nondisclosure would support his claim that a brady violation occurred.but watkins claim is not supported by the state habeas record or the state habeas court findings and conclusions.
watkins relies entirely on an amorphous statement made by prosecuting attorney parsons to watkins defense counsel adkins after the trial had been completed.the record shows that prosecuting attorney parsons made a observation to defense counsel adkins to the effect that zimm might not have been scared of watkins on the day of the attempted robbery.that evidence,however,does not mean that that information or belief was something known to prosecuting attorney parsons before trial.to the contrary,the observation could have been based on something that some other unidentified person had said to parsons,or that zimm himself might have said to parsons,or that amounted to mere retrospective speculation.in any of those circumstances,as well as others,it could not be said that parsons possessed brady material.
the only evidence of a pretrial conversation between zimm and prosecuting attorney parsons related to parsons explanation to zimm of what constitutes fear and the necessity of proving fear as an element of attempted robbery.
the state habeas court found on this record two distinct facts.first,at some time after the trial of this matter,defense counsel adkins was told that zimm said he was not afraid at the time of the incident at issue.and second,that prosecuting attorney parsons had a pretrial conversation with zimm during which parsons discussed with zimm the definition of the word fear as it applied to the elements of the crime at issue,and that parsons informed zimm that if the element of fear did not exist,then the case could not be proven at trial.
the district court,however,failed to accord the appropriate deference to the state habeas court findings.the district court,which was initially inclined to conduct a plenary evidentiary hearing but ultimately did not do so,nonetheless restated the state habeas court findings to conclude that parsons had admitted that zimm made the statement that he was not afraid,thereby imputing knowledge of zimm lack of fear to parsons before the trial began.the record simply does not support such a leap.section requires a federal court conducting collateral review of a state court adjudication to do so through a highly deferential lens.decastro branker,cir see also d.to that end,e instructs the district court to defer to a state court factual findings 
in a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.the applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.
e emphasis added see also conaway polk,cir.
in the present case,the district court did not find the state habeas court factual findings unreasonable in light of the evidence presented.d.nor did the court find that watkins had rebutted the state habeas court factual findings with clear and convincing evidence.e.on the contrary,the district court purported to accept the state court factual findings.see based on the state court factual finding,it would be objectively unreasonable to conclude.yet it nonetheless placed its own gloss upon the state court factual findings,impermissibly altering them to conclude that prosecuting attorney parsons admitted to having been told by zimm before trial that he was not afraid of watkins.the facts in the state court record are to the contrary,and no state habeas court finding can be read to support the district court conclusion.
we conclude that the state habeas court did not base its decision on an unreasonable determination of the facts,see d,and we note that watkins did not attempt to rebut the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence,see e.similarly,we conclude that based on its entirely reasonable factual findings,the state habeas court did not apply the brady rule in an objectively unreasonable manner.see barnes joyner,cir holding that the federal court must defer to the state habeas court legal conclusion,so long as it is not objectively unreasonable d.the facts found by the state habeas court do not impute information to prosecuting attorney parsons before trial that zimm had said he was not afraid.without such a fact in the record and such a factual finding by the court,there could be no brady violation.
to be sure,the state habeas court did find that prosecuting attorney parsons and zimm had had a pretrial discussion about the definition of fear and the necessity of proving fear at trial.but that conversation was no more than routine trial preparation.as the state habeas court concluded,parsons statements to zimm with regard to the element of fear were an accurate way to describe elemental requirements to a lay and that there was no evidence that parsons suggested or improperly influenced zimm testimony.
the district court order granting watkins petition for a writ of habeas corpus is accordingly 
i concur in the majority opinion.the west virginia state court rejection of watkins the state prosecutor,brian parsons,failed to disclose an alleged,exculpatory statement made by the victim,mike zimm,in violation of brady maryland,was not an unreasonable one in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings.
watkins alleged in his state habeas petition that parsons told his trial counsel,james adkins,that zimm had told parsons prior to trial that he was not afraid of watkins during the attempted robbery.in other words,watkins alleged that parsons admitted to adkins after the trial that an exculpatory statement was made by zimm prior to the trial.in the written response to the petition,parsons denied watkins allegation.watkins did not call either zimm or parsons as a witness at the evidentiary hearing in state court.watkins called adkins as his sole witness,but adkins did not testify that parsons admitted to him that zimm made the alleged brady statement prior to trial or,for that matter,after trial.in sum,watkins failed to elicit testimony or present other evidence that supported his brady allegation.
after the hearing,the state court issued a page written opinion addressing watkins habeas claims,including his brady claim.the opinion contains explicit factual findings and conclusions.but not surprisingly,the state court did not find that zimm made the alleged brady statement to parsons.the state court did not find that parsons admitted to adkins that zimm made the alleged brady statement to him.and the state court did not find that parsons had knowledge of any such brady statement prior to watkins trial.consequently,the state court did not address the question of whether the alleged but unproven statement would have been material for brady purposes if zimm had made it prior to trial.
on federal habeas review,we are not at liberty to rewrite state court findings of fact,or imply additional ones,in a manner that is unsupported by the evidence in the state court record and inconsistent with the state court reasonable rejection of a constitutional claim.we must give deference to the state court ultimate and reasonable adjudication of the claim,and we must give the state court the benefit of the doubt when doing so.in this case,that deference is easily given.the state court did not find the existence of a brady statement and the record does not compel that we do so.
i.the state habeas proceedings 
a.the state habeas allegations 
in his state habeas petition,watkins alleged the following claim as his eleventh ground for relief 
t he state of west virginia failed to inform the defendant that the prosecuting victim zimm had told them that he was not afraid of the defendant.
elaborating upon the basis for this allegation,watkins represented that his trial counsel,james adkins,had 
provided a memorandum to state habeas counsel indicating that he was present during a conversation with the assistant prosecuting attorney who tried th e case who allegedly uttered that the victim,mike zimm told him that he was never afraid and the apa responded if that was the case then they should stop prosecuting at that time.
id.emphasis added.if that is true and the case,watkins asserted,then the state of west virginia failed to provide that exculpatory evidence to him.id.
in its written response to watkins habeas petition,the state agreed that apa parsons had discussed with zimm prior to trial the element of fear necessary to obtain a conviction for attempted robbery under state law,but denied that zimm made the alleged exculpatory statement to parsons during that pretrial discussion.according to parsons response 
i spoke with zimm on at least two occasions prior to the trial of the matter as a part of the trial preparation process.i recall having a conversation with zimm about the definition of the word fear as it applied to the legal elements requiring proof in the trial of the respondent.zimm did not state that he was never afraid,but rather he sought a better understanding of what fear meant in the context of this case.the court should understand that a certain amount of bravado existed as to the relationship between counsel and zimm and a reluctance to express fear months after an incident is natural between two men.i did,however,inform zimm that if the element of fear did not exist the case could not be proven at trial.i believe this to be an accurate statement of the law and at no time did counsel pressure,suggest or influence zimm to testify one way or the other.zimm trial testimony was consistent with his statement given the day of the crime and in no way exculpatory.
emphasis added.parsons written account of this pretrial conversation,including his explicit denial that zimm told him during that conversation that he was not afraid at the time of the attempted robbery,is uncontroverted.
b.the omnibus evidentiary hearing 
the state habeas court held an omnibus evidentiary hearing,providing watkins the opportunity to prove his allegation.watkins did not do so.
watkins did not call zimm or parsons as a witness to substantiate his allegation that zimm made the statement to parsons prior to trial.as a result,the state court did not hear from the only two witnesses who had knowledge of the pretrial conversation that had taken place between them.
watkins did call his trial counsel adkins as a witness,presumably to substantiate his allegation that adkins had provided a memorandum to state habeas counsel indicating that he was present during a conversation with parsons who allegedly uttered that zimm told him never afraid.but adkins did not do so.adkins that he was testimony regarding the issue was as follows 
q by state habeas counsel.w e have a contention in this habeas proceeding,whereby it alleged that parsons made some comments to the effect that zimm had told him that he was afraid during this whole incident.were you ever present when parsons spoke about that 
a i do recall that.
q were you ever present in judge hatcher courtroom at a time when it was perhaps yourself,parsons,mallory i think her name was farris the court reporter,and a client of yours named grasty when parsons suggested that zimm had told him he was afraid of watkins 
a i believe so,and i believe i may have made a contemporaneous note and either placed it in the file or i think i might have given it to you.
q yes,sir.do you recall what that what was said at that time 
a my contemporaneous note would probably be more accurate than my memory.
q okay.do you have any independent recollection of that conversation 
a something to the effect that something to the effect that yes,we were at another hearing,and parsons had stated something to the effect that zimm might not have been scared of watkins on that on the date of the alleged robbery.
q is that what parsons as far as you recall,you said your recollection was fuzzy on some of this,but as far as you recall,is that what was said 
a like i said,i believe i made a contemporaneous note and retained a copy in my file.and i think when i was aware that you were handling this on a habeas,i think i might have provided you with a copy of it.
q do you recall who was present at the time that it was stated 
a other than me and parsons,no.
q did you do you recall responding at that time did you say anything 
a no.i was out of the case at that point in time.
emphasis added.watkins did not call any of the other persons who were present during this conversation,and he did not introduce into evidence the contemporaneous note that adkins repeatedly referenced during his testimony 
accordingly,the evidence presented in the state court proceeding in support of watkins claim consisted of parsons agreement in the written response that he had a pretrial conversation with zimm about the element of fear that did not include the alleged statement by zimm adkins testimony that he did not recall parsons making comments to the effect that zimm had told him that he was afraid during th e incident,and adkins sole independent recollection of that conversation,which was that parsons had stated something to the effect that zimm might not have been scared of watkins on the date of the alleged robbery,which is more opinion than fact and says nothing about when parsons developed this belief 
c.the state habeas decision 
in its decision denying habeas relief,the state court made the following findings of fact 
d uring trial,zimm testified that he was afraid of the petitioner based upon what the petitioner said in zimm store and upon the petitioner appearance.
zimm trial testimony was consistent with the statement he gave to police at the time of the incident.
a t some time after the trial of this matter,trial counsel was told that zimm said he was not afraid at the time of the incident at issue.
assistant prosecuting attorney brian parsons,discussed with zimm the definition of the word fear as it applied to the elements of the crime at issue,and that parsons informed zimm that if the element of fear did not exist,then the case could not be proven at trial.
the discovery provided to the defense did not contain any reference to zimm alleged statement that he was not afraid or to the above described conversation between parsons and zimm.
emphasis added.
with regard to zimm alleged statement,therefore,the state court did not find that zimm had told parsons that he was not afraid of the defendant,as watkins had alleged.nor did it find that adkins overheard parsons utter that zimm told him that he was never afraid,as watkins had also alleged.the evidence presented at the hearing did not warrant either finding.
with regard to the conversation that parsons agreed had taken place between him and zimm,the state court description of that conversation likewise did not include a finding that zimm alleged statement was a part of it.moreover,the state court continued to draw quite an important distinction between the two things.although the court referred to the conversation as the conversation that it had just described,the court continued to refer to the alleged,statement as just that an allegation.
the state court conclusions of law also do not indicate that the state court implicitly found that the pretrial conversation included the alleged statement.
the court concludes that the state has an obligation to disclose to the defendant favorable impeachment or exculpatory evidence that is within its knowledge.
the court concludes that the state alleged failure to inform defense counsel of the conversation between parsons and zimm regarding the requirement of fear did not violate the dictates of brady maryland.
additionally,the court concludes that parson statements to zimm with regard to the element of fear were an accurate way to describe elemental requirements to a lay and that there is no evidence that parsons suggested or improperly influenced zimm testimony.
emphasis added.thus,the state court having not found that zimm made the alleged,exculpatory statement to parsons prior to trial,or that the alleged statement was within parsons knowledge prior to trial only addressed watkins raised claim that brady required parsons to disclose the pretrial conversation that parsons had described in the state response.the state court closely reiterated parsons uncontroverted account of that conversation and reasonably concluded that there was no evidence that parsons suggested or improperly influenced zimm testimony during it.
under the familiar principles of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,we may not grant federal habeas relief from a state court conviction unless the state court adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,or a decision that was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.d.moreover,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct,and t he applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e.
here,watkins has not rebutted the state court factual findings,as written,by clear and convincing evidence.nor does he assert that the state court denial of his brady claim was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.instead,he contends that we should imply a critical finding of fact based upon evidence that he failed to present in the state court proceeding a finding that the state court clearly declined to make and that would be inconsistent with the state court reasonable adjudication of his brady claim.aedpa deference does not allow us to do so.
by its plain terms,d limits our review to the evidence placed before the state pcr court.elmore ozmint,cir emphasis added see also cullen pinholster.accordingly,w e consider whether the state pcr court based its decisions on an objectively unreasonable factual determination in view of the evidence before it,bearing in mind that factual determinations by state courts are presumed correct absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.elmore,at quoting baum rushton,cir.under these highly deferential standards,we must also give the state court decision the benefit of the doubt.burt titlow,elmore,at.
in some situations,aedpa deference allows federal courts to infer from the state court explicit factual findings and conclusion s implied factual findings that are consistent with its judgment although unstated.hightower terry,cir emphasis added see marshall lonberger,applying presumption of correctness to implicit finding against the defendant credibility,where that finding was necessarily part of the court rejection of the applicant claim lavallee delle rose,per curiam same lee comm r.dep t of,cir w e afford aedpa deference even where the state court decision is a summary adjudication or engages in only some evaluation because implicit findings may be inferred from dispositive rulings.emphasis added blankenship hall,cir we have previously recognized a state court dispositive ruling may contain implicit findings,which,though unstated,are necessary to that ruling.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added valdez cockrell,cir the presumption of correctness not only applies to explicit findings of fact,but it also applies to those unarticulated findings which are necessary to the state court conclusions of mixed law and fact.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,ed.in some cases if the court fails to make a finding on a particular fact it has been assumed that it found against the party carrying the burden of persuasion on that fact or that it impliedly made a finding consistent with its general disposition of the case.footnotes omitted.
in such cases,we make the common sense judgment that material factual issues were resolved by the state court in favor of the judgment when it was reasonable for that court to have done so in light of the evidence.hightower,at original alterations and internal quotation marks omitted see also marshall,at where it was clear under the applicable federal law that the state court would have granted the relief sought by the defendant had it believed the defendant testimony,its failure to grant relief was tantamount to an express finding against the defendant.lavallee,at same 
here,however,watkins urges us to do the opposite.watkins contends that he is entitled to federal habeas relief from his state court conviction because the state habeas court,in the course of denying his brady claim,found that at some time after the trial of this matter,trial counsel was told that zimm said he was not afraid at the time of the incident at issue.emphasis added.but instead of having us interpret that single finding of fact in a manner consistent with the state court other findings and conclusions,as well as its reasonable disposition of the claim in light of the evidence presented,watkins urges us to rewrite and add to the finding in a manner that is inconsistent with them.
specifically,watkins contends that the state court meant to find,or impliedly found,instead,that at some time after the trial of this matter,trial counsel was told by parsons that zimm said to parsons that he was not afraid at the time of the incident,and that zimm said this to parsons prior to watkins trial.to be sure,these additions to the state court actual finding of fact are critical to any plausible claim on watkins part that a brady violation occurred.but we can not simply ignore the fact that the state court did not make them or that,based upon the evidence presented,the state court reasonably denied the brady claim instead.indeed,i do not see how it had any other choice.
the state court did not find that zimm made an exculpatory statement to parsons prior to trial.the state court did not find that parsons admitted to adkins that zimm made an exculpatory statement to him prior to trial.and,of course,the state court did not find that parsons or the state had knowledge of any exculpatory statement by zimm prior to trial.watkins does not point to any evidence that would directly support,much less compel,these modifications to the state court findings of fact.instead,he contends that we should include them because the state did not produce evidence that someone other than parsons told adkins that zimm made the alleged,exculpatory statement,and because the state did not produce evidence that zimm made the alleged,exculpatory statement after the trial.this reasoning not only impermissibly reverses the burden of proof from watkins to the state to disprove his allegation,it turns aedpa deference on its head.
although i can not know precisely why the state habeas court phrased this single factual finding in the manner that it did,it is still entitled to a presumption of correctness,and the state court decision on the merits of the brady claim may not be set aside unless it is an unreasonable one in light of the evidence that was presented to the state court.one need only read adkins brief testimony about the whole matter to conclude that it is not.
frankly,if i had been the state court judge,i would not have found that anyone told adkins that zimm said to anyone at any time that he was not afraid during the attempted robbery.but i am not the finder of fact.my obligation is to give deference to the state court reasonable adjudication of the constitutional claim in light of the evidence presented to it,and to give the state court the benefit of the doubt when doing so.
that said,there could be any number of reasonable explanations for why the state court penned this single finding as it did.maybe the state court simply made a mistake.or maybe the state court meant to say exactly what it did and nothing more.the state court record suggests that there were other persons present during the conversation,adkins memory of the conversation was admittedly fuzzy,and adkins was not allowed to refresh his memory with the contemporaneous note to which he persistently referred.as the finding is written,therefore,the state court might well have decided to give state habeas counsel the benefit of the doubt as to whether the brady allegation had been made in good faith,deserving of the evidentiary hearing that was provided to watkins to prove the claim.but it would not have made a finding that was inconsistent with the balance of its other findings and conclusions,unsupported by the evidence that watkins brought forth to support the allegation,or inconsistent with its eminently reasonable decision to deny watkins brady claim based upon that evidence.
the line of cases relied upon by the dissent also would not allow us to translate a single,ambiguous finding of fact,or even a mistaken one,into an inconsistent one that is not supported by the evidence,in order to upset the state court reasonable rejection of the constitutional claim.see,garcia quarterman,cir noting that t he statute compels federal courts to review for reasonableness the state court ultimate decision,not every jot of its reasoning quoting santellan cockrell,cir emphasis added see also santellan,at e ven where a state court has made a mistake,we are determining the reasonableness of the state court decision,not grading their papers.quoting cruz miller,cir second alteration in original cruz,at although sound reasoning will enhance the likelihood that a state court ruling will be determined to be a reasonable application of supreme court law,deficient reasoning will not preclude aedpa deference,at least in the absence of an analysis so flawed as to undermine confidence that the constitutional claim has been fairly adjudicated.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in the end,however,my interpretation of the state court explicit finding of fact is irrelevant,for i am not at liberty to pick it apart or rewrite it in the light most favorable to watkins.see,wainwright goode,per curiam holding that where the state court record wa s ambiguous,the court of appeals erred in substituting its view of the facts for that of the state court palmer estelle,cir where the record is ambiguous,the state court factual findings are deemed to be fairly supported by the record.quoting wainwright,at.watkins bore the burden of presenting clear and convincing evidence that the state habeas court factual finding,as written,was not entitled to the presumption of correctness that aedpa grants it.he has not done so.even if he had,he would only have shown that this single factual finding was either incorrect or incomplete,neither of which would compel us to replace it with a factual finding that is unsupported by the evidence and inconsistent with the state court decision.watkins was required to show that the state court ultimate rejection of his brady claim was an unreasonable one in light of the evidence presented to the state court,see winston kelly,cir,and this he can not do.
iii.the federal habeas proceedings 
i turn now to the district court decision,and the troubling factual misrepresentations that watkins made to it about the evidence of record.
from the outset,watkins represented to the district court in his petition that adkins testified that he heard prosecutor parsons say at an unrelated hearing that at some point before trial the alleged victim,mike zimm,told him that he was not afraid on the day in question.that is untrue.
watkins then proceeded to further supplement adkins actual testimony with testimony that he wishes adkins had given.according to watkins 
at some point after the trial,adkins was present at an unrelated hearing where parsons was also present.at the unrelated hearing,adkins heard brian parsons say that at some point before watkins trial he met with the alleged victim,mike zimm,and during that meeting zimm told parsons that he was not in fear the day watkins came to his store.parsons,in the presence of jim adkins,then admitted that he then told zimm that if he was in fear that day,then it was pointless to pursue the case as a robbery.zimm statement at that meeting with p arsons was the opposite of what he testified to at watkins trial.
at watkins omnibus habeas corpus hearing,adkins did testify to all of this,and then gave his professional assessment that if he had known about zimm contradictory statements before trial,it would have potentially affected the outcome 
parsons does not deny that such a conversation between he and zimm took place.in fact,he admits to it in the state response to watkins petition.
again,this is untrue.if adkins had actually testif ied to all of this,id.at,watkins might well have had a plausible brady argument.but adkins did not.
watkins summary is no mere overstate ment of the strength of adkins testimony.dissent at.it is created out of whole cloth.adkins did not testify that parsons told him anything about his pretrial conversation with zimm,much less that parsons admitted to him that zimm made an exculpatory statement.instead,watkins took selected portions of parsons response to the state habeas petition,and put them into the mouth of adkins except,of course,that most important portion where parsons denied that zimm made the alleged,exculpatory statement to him.parsons did not deny having a pretrial conversation with zimm about the element of fear,but he most certainly did deny that such conversation included a contradictory statement by zimm that he was not in fear the day watkins came to his store.
unfortunately,the district court appears to have accepted watkins unsubstantiated factual narrative.it likewise erroneously recounted adkins testimony as follows 
during the omnibus evidentiary hearing,james adkins,the petitioner trial lawyer,testified that,at an unrelated hearing after the petitioner trial,he overheard brian parsons,the prosecutor at the petitioner trial,describe a conversation he had with zimm before the petitioner trial.in adkins presence,prosecutor parsons stated that zimm told him during this pretrial conversation that he had not been in fear on the day the petitioner entered his store.according to adkins,the prosecutor said that his response to zimm was that if he was not in fear,the case for attempted robbery could not proceed.adkins made a contemporaneous note of the conversation.although the note was not admitted into evidence,its substance was discussed during the hearing and in the parties briefing.
emphasis added.again,no such testimony by adkins exists,and neither the contemporaneous note nor anyone summary of it was introduced into evidence before the state court.
proceeding from this incorrect evidentiary premise from the outset,the district court found that t here was no evidence to controvert adkins nonexistent testimony,and it rewrote the state court factual finding into the one that watkins wanted 
a t some time after the trial of this matter,trial counsel was told by the prosecutor that zimm said he was not afraid at the time of the incident at issue.
alteration of state court finding in original emphasis added.having made this unsubstantiated factual finding that parsons admitted to adkins that he had knowledge of the alleged brady statement,and operating under the additional,assumption that parsons had knowledge of it prior to trial,the district court was then in a position to conclude that the state court denial of relief in light of these implied findings was unreasonable under d.this was error.
the district court extraordinary steps to its grant of federal habeas relief have gone far afield from the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,d,and give inadequate deference to the state court reasonable adjudication of watkins brady claim in light of that evidence.
on appeal,the dissent has similarly stretched adkins testimony into a version that does not exist.according to the dissent,adkins identified parsons,and only parsons,as the person who told him about zimm alleged statement.dissent at.but in actuality adkins did not identify parsons even once as a person who told him after trial that zimm had said he was not afraid during the crime.
simply put,adkins was the only witness that watkins called to substantiate his allegation,and adkins did not do so.there is no need for us to interpret or add to adkins testimony.nor is it within our province to do so.adkins testimony speaks for itself.
when adkins was explicitly questioned about watkins brady allegation,he testified that he did not recall parsons ma king comments to the effect that zimm told him that he was afraid during this whole incident.when pressed by state habeas counsel,adkins testified that he believe d he recalled a conversation that took place after watkins trial and that he may have made a contemporaneous note of the substance of that conversation.id.but adkins never agreed with state habeas counsel leading statement that during this conversation parsons suggested that zimm had told him that he was afraid of watkins.dissent at.rather,adkins immediately and repeatedly referred to the contemporaneous note that he believed he had given to state habeas counsel and he all but asked counsel to produce it to him.
when watkins counsel instead asked adkins to put in his own words his independent recollection of that conversation,adkins did not testify that parsons suggested that zimm had told him he was afraid of watkins.and he did not identify parsons even once as a person who told him that zimm had said that he was not afraid during the attempted robbery.on the contrary,adkins testified,and only testified,to his independent recollection and in his own words,that parsons had stated something to the effect that zimm might not have been scared of watkins on the date of the alleged robbery,emphasis added,which is more opinion than fact and offers nothing in the way of when or why parsons developed this belief about zimm.
interestingly,the dissent seemingly acknowledges watkins failure of proof,as it too points to no testimony that would support the district court implied factual finding that parsons admitted to adkins that zimm told parsons that he was not afraid of watkins at the time of the robbery instead,the dissent focuses upon the state case,faulting parsons for not denying watkins allegations in the way it believes he should have and criticizing the state for putting up what it deems to have been a lackluster showing at the state evidentiary hearing.dissent at.
for example,the dissent criticizes parsons for not challeng ing adkins recollection of his conversation with parsons and for not suggest ing that zimm could have made the alleged statement after trial.dissent at.but,of course,this was not the state burden to bear and the state had no obligation to make any showing at the state evidentiary hearing.it was watkins burden to prove that zimm made the alleged,exculpatory statement,that he made it to parsons,and that he made it prior to trial.he did not.watkins chose not to call zimm or parsons as a witness to explore their pretrial conversations.watkins chose to call adkins to prove his claim,but adkins memory did not allow him to serve that role and watkins did not produce adkins contemporaneous note to refresh his memory.
indeed,why would parsons have felt the need to challenge adkins recollection of the conversation and why would he have endeavored to find and present evidence that zimm made the alleged statement after trial or to someone else parsons had already denied that zimm made the alleged brady statement to him and adkins had not contradicted this denial with testimony that parsons had admitted to him that the exculpatory statement was made.little wonder,therefore,that the state court did not find that zimm made the alleged statement to parsons,did not find that zimm made the alleged statement to anyone else,and did not find that parsons told adkins about the alleged statement.
the dissent likewise criticizes the manner in which parsons denied watkins allegation in the state response to watkins state habeas petition.although the dissent admits that parsons denied watkins allegation,it urges us to brush this inconvenient fact aside as well because,in its opinion,parsons had every reason to minimize zimm during the robbery.dissent at.but the dissent points to nothing in the record that supports this assumption about parsons motives,much less its implied finding that the state court was of this unspoken view as well.
the dissent also creates a host of additional implied findings pertaining to parsons denial.the dissent has decided that parsons attempted to finesse exactly what witness zimm said at their meetings,that he parsed and qualified their exchanges during these meetings,and that he intentionally le ft open the possibility that zimm did say something short of never being afraid but still not amounting to the required not in fear of bodily injury.dissent at.again,there is nothing in the record to support these accusations against parsons,and the state court certainly did not make any such adverse credibility findings against him.
in effect,the dissent faults parsons for not explicitly denying an endless variety of unspoken but theoretically possible variations of the allegation that watkins made and that parsons denied,all the while ignoring the fact that watkins could have explored any such suspicions about parsons response at the evidentiary hearing.parsons did not choose the words that comprised the allegation against him.watkins did.and i certainly can not fault parsons for phrasing his denial of watkins accusation by using the same accusatory words that were used against him 
in any event,such speculation about prosecutorial motives during the pleading stage is misplaced given our deferential standard of review and watkins clear failure to prove his allegation.the question is whether the state court decision to reject watkins brady claim was an unreasonable one in light of the evidence that watkins presented in support of it.watkins can not excuse his failure of proof by relying upon an alleged lackluster showing by the state,nor can we.dissent at.all agree that watkins sole allegation in his petition was that zimm told parsons prior to trial that he was never afraid,and all agree that parsons denied watkins allegation.as the dissent also acknowledges,parsons was in the courtroom.watkins could have called parsons as a witness to ask him,for example,whether zimm sa id something short of never being afraid.dissent at.more simply,watkins could have just asked parsons what zimm said to him.watkins also could have called zimm as a witness and asked zimm what he said to parsons.in short,watkins was provided a full opportunity to explore any and all conversations between zimm and parsons.instead,watkins did nothing,and now wags his finger at the state for not disproving his unproven allegation 
to conclude,watkins arguments are plentiful,but they are based upon summaries of evidence that does not exist.the district court implied finding that parsons admitted the brady violation to adkins is likewise built upon nonexistent evidence and supposition.parsons did not agree in the state response to watkins state habeas petition that zimm made the alleged exculpatory statement during their pretrial conversation.watkins points to no testimony by adkins that parsons admitted that zimm made the alleged exculpatory statement to him prior to trial.the state court did not find that parsons admitted to adkins that zimm made the exculpatory statement,and the evidence presented in the state court proceeding does not require us to imply a finding that would be contrary to the state court reasonable adjudication of this claim.even if i were at liberty to review watkins state habeas petition de novo,i could find no basis upon which to grant relief on this record.i certainly can not say that the state court decision to deny relief was an unreasonable one 
with respect,i dissent.the district court understood and deferred to the facts found by the state habeas court,and then correctly concluded that the state court unreasonably applied brady maryland,to those facts.accordingly,we should affirm its grant of the writ of habeas corpus to steven watkins.
i agree with the majority that the state court did not base its denial of habeas relief on an unreasonable finding of the facts and that a federal court reviewing a state habeas ruling must defer to the state court factual findings.but for these very reasons,i can not agree that the district court erred in granting habeas relief.for in holding that the district court impermissibly placed its own gloss upon the state court factual findings,the majority itself does precisely that.this move enables the majority to reconstruct the narrative of this case to one more to its liking,but one that the state court never found,the state never espoused,and the record simply does not support.
a jury found watkins guilty of the west virginia crime of attempted robbery in the second degree,which requires proof that the robber placed the victim in fear of bodily injury.b.at the core of the majority opinion is the erroneous conclusion that the state habeas court did not find that before trial the prosecution possessed evidence that the victim of the attempted robbery had made an inconsistent statement about an element of the charged offense,that he had not been in fear of bodily injury during the attempted robbery,as was required for conviction.the concurrence then adds some equally flawed arguments in an attempt to bolster this conclusion.
on the basis of these mistaken theories,the majority holds that the prosecutor failure to inform the defense about this impeachment evidence did not violate brady.but careful review of the record requires the contrary conclusion.the state habeas court did indeed find that before trial the prosecutor had evidence of the critical witness statement.and the prosecutor failure to inform the defense of this evidence clearly violated brady.
the factual finding of the state court at issue here reads in its entirety as follows 
the court finds that,at some time after the trial of this matter,trial counsel adkins was told that zimm the witness said he was not afraid at the time of the incident at issue.assistant prosecuting attorney brian parsons,e discussed with zimm the definition of the word fear as it applied to the elements of the crime at issue,and that parsons informed zimm that if the element of fear did not exist,then the case could not be proven at trial.the discovery provided to the defense did not contain any reference to zimm alleged statement that he was not afraid or to the above described conversation between parsons and zimm.
the state court found that after trial,defense counsel adkins was told that the,mike zimm,stated that he had not been afraid during the charged attempted robbery.the first sentence of the above paragraph makes that clear.equally clear is that in the second sentence,the state court found that before trial,prosecutor parsons and witness zimm had a conversation in which parsons told zimm that without evidence of his fear during the alleged attempted robbery,the case could not be proven at trial.and in the third sentence,the state court indisputably found that the prosecution did not turn over to the defense,prior to trial,any evidence about this conversation or about any statement the witness,zimm,made during the conversation.
the majority opinion focuses on the timing of zimm alleged statement,holding that the district court erred in concluding the state court found zimm alleged lack of fear statement to have occurred before trial.but it is the majority that errs here.the timing of zimm alleged statement has never been in dispute.the state has never contended that zimm made the alleged statement to the prosecutor after trial,and does not do so on appeal before us.
to the contrary,prosecutor parsons himself,in responding to the habeas petition in state court,recounted that the conversation about the fear element took place prior to trial in the course of a discussion about the necessity of proof of this element at trial.thus,in the state written response to the habeas petition,parsons explained 
i spoke with the sic zimm on at least two occasions prior to the trial of the matter to sic as a part of the trial preparation process.i recall having a conversation with zimm about the definition of the word fear as it applied to the legal elements requiring proof in the trial of the respondent.zimm did not state that he was never afraid,but rather he sought a better understanding of what fear meant in the context of this case.the court should understand that a certain amount of bravado existed as to the relationship between me and zimm and a reluctance to express fear months after an incident is natural between two men.i did,however,inform zimm that if the element of fear did not exist the case could not be proven at trial.
emphasis added.absent from parsons explanation to the state habeas court is any suggestion that the contention in the habeas petition as to the timing of zimm alleged lack of fear statement was wrong,that the statement did not take place before trial.to the contrary,parsons defended his nondisclosure of evidence of zimm statement by placing it in the context of witness preparation regarding proof of the fear element at trial.
moreover,prosecutor parsons took exactly the same approach at the evidentiary hearing before the state habeas court.when he cross examined defense counsel adkins,parsons neither challenged adkins recollection of his conversation with parsons nor suggested that zimm could have made the alleged statement after trial.see.rather,parsons again sought to place zimm alleged statement within their conversation about the fear element.in sum,the state prosecutor consistent account in his written response to the state habeas petition and at the evidentiary hearing before the state court was that zimm alleged fear statement occurred before trial.
it is clear from the state habeas court factual findings that the court accepted and adopted prosecutor parsons uncontroverted account as to the timing of the alleged fear statement.indeed,the state court very wording closely mirrors that of the prosecutor response to the habeas petition.compare,with.thus,in context,there is only one way to read the first two sentences of the state court factual findings the initial sentence describes how,after trial,prosecutor parsons told defense counsel adkins that the witness,zimm,stated he had not been afraid and the second sentence places this statement in the context of a conversation between prosecutor and witness about the necessity of proof of the element of fear at trial.this conclusion,contrary to the majority suggestion,does not conflate the conversation between parsons and zimm before trial with the conversation between parsons and adkins after trial.rather,it recognizes that in his conversation with defense counsel adkins,prosecutor parsons relayed the substance of his conversation with zimm.
on appeal before us,the state repeats this very same version of the critical events for a third time.its brief to this court is utterly bereft of any suggestion that the district court conclusion about the timing of zimm alleged statement is incorrect.to the contrary,the district court view that the state court found that the alleged statement occurred before trial is one in which the state explicitly concurs.thus,in its appellate brief,the state recounts after finding that mike zimm the witness made a statement to the prosecutor that he was not afraid during the attempted robbery,the state habeas court concluded that no brady violation had occurred.appellant br.emphasis added see also id.at.
in sum,the record offers no support for the majority conclusion that the district court impermissibly alter ed the state habeas court factual findings to conclude that zimm alleged statement to the prosecutor occurred before trial.that the state court found that zimm alleged statement occurred before trial a view espoused by the state itself is the only reading that finds support in the record 
the concurrence offers some additional arguments in an attempt to bolster the decision to deny habeas relief to watkins.none is convincing.
first,the concurrence adopts the sole argument offered by the state itself as to why the district court assertedly erred in concluding that the state court had found that prosecutor parsons told adkins about zimm alleged statement.although the state court expressly found that at some time after the trial of this matter,adkins was told that zimm said he was not afraid at the time of the incident,the concurrence contends that,in doing so,the state court clearly declined to find that it was prosecutor parsons who told adkins this.the state similarly asserts that an unidentified individual told adkins about an alleged statement by zimm.appellant br.
by using the passive voice,the state habeas court did not identify by name the individual who,after trial,told defense counsel adkins that zimm had said,prior to trial,that he was not afraid.and it may well be that in his federal habeas petition,watkins overstated the strength of adkins testimony describing the conversation in which prosecutor parsons told him about witness zimm statement.but we must defer to the state court finding that adkins was told that zimm stated he was not afraid at the time of the robbery,in light of the evidence that was before the state court.as the district court concluded,that evidence offers not even a suggestion that anyone other than prosecutor parsons told adkins about zimm alleged statement.rather,the only possible conclusion to draw from the record is that parsons is the person who relayed this information to adkins.
to be sure,adkins initially indicated that he did not recall a conversation in which parsons told him that zimm had made the statement.immediately thereafter,however,adkins corrected himself and testified that he did recall this conversation with parsons.adkins used qualifying words and equivocal phrases about what,precisely,he heard,and suggested that his contemporaneous note would probably be more accurate than his memory.but despite his qualifications about what was said during this conversation,adkins was not at all equivocal about who said it.it was the prosecutor parsons.id.when asked whether parsons suggested that zimm had told him he was afraid of watkins,adkins responded in the affirmative.id.at.moreover,throughout the rest of his testimony,adkins identified parsons,and only parsons,as the person who told him about zimm alleged statement.id.at when asked about his independent recollection of that conversation,responding yes parsons had stated something to the effect that zimm might not have been scared of watkins and when asked if he recalled who was present at the time that it was stated,responding other than me and parsons,no.
no evidence was presented at the habeas hearing that anyone else relayed this information to adkins.no evidence was presented to suggest that it was not parsons who made the statement to adkins.and prosecutor parsons himself,appearing as the state counsel at the habeas hearing,did not dispute that it was he.thus,in finding that after trial,adkins was told that zimm said he was not afraid during the attempted robbery,the state habeas court necessarily found that prosecutor parsons told adkins this 
second,the concurrence maintains that in his written statement,prosecutor parsons asserted that he had a pretrial conversation with zimm about the element of fear that did not include the alleged statement,and explicit ly deni ed that zimm made the alleged statement.emphasis in concurrence.but in fact parsons,who the state habeas court undoubtedly recognized had every reason to minimize zimm during the robbery,nowhere asserted in his written statement or orally that their conversation did not include zimm alleged statement.nor did parsons explicit ly den y that zimm made the alleged statement.and parsons never disputed that he told adkins,after trial,about zimm alleged statement.in other words,prosecutor parsons,although in the courtroom when accused of a brady violation,never denied that he possessed during trial helpful impeachment evidence that he failed to turn over to the defense.
rather,parsons attempted to finesse exactly what witness zimm said at their meetings.thus,in his written statement to the state habeas court,parsons parsed and qualified their exchanges.he did not explicitly deny that he acquired exculpatory information at that time,nor did he deny that zimm had told him he might not have been afraid at the time of the attempted robbery.instead,parsons simply stated that zimm did not state that he was never afraid.these words,of course,leave open the possibility that zimm did say something short of never being afraid but still not amounting to the required not in fear of bodily injury.prosecutor parson statement is certainly not the categorical denial one would expect from a prosecutor accused of a brady violation.
moreover,parsons acknowledged in the same written statement that a certain amount of bravado existed as to the relationship between himself and zimm,and thus zimm had a reluctance to express fear months after the attempted robbery.id.and parsons conceded in his statement that he had informed zimm that if the element of fear did not exist,the case could not be proven at trial.id.thus,upon consideration of the entire record before it,the state habeas court was certainly justified in making the factual finding that it did,that at some time after the trial of this matter,watkins trial counsel was told that zimm said he was not afraid at the time of the incident at issue.the concurrence apparently disagrees with the finding,but we must defer to a state habeas court factual findings unless unreasonable.d.nothing is unreasonable about this finding.
in sum,the record is devoid of support for the concurrence suggestion that the experienced district court judge rewrote the state court factual finding in order to conclude that it was parsons who told adkins that zimm made the alleged statement.based on the record before the state court,the only possible source of this information regarding zimm alleged statement was prosecutor parsons,who never denied that he had possessed exculpatory evidence prior to watkins trial.there was,and is,no basis for the state court to have found that adkins was told about zimm alleged statement without also finding that parsons is the person who told him about it.
my colleagues seek to exploit the state habeas court failure to more explicitly articulate factual findings that were defer,as we must,to those implicit factual findings of a state habeas court,which are compelled by its explicit findings,it was prosecutor parsons who told adkins,after trial,that zimm had stated,before trial,that he was not afraid during the attempted robbery.
the concurrence refuses to afford deference to these implicit factual findings because it maintains that they are inconsistent with the state court decision to deny watkins brady claim.not so.the finding that a prosecutor possessed and failed to disclose to the defense favorable impeachment evidence is not inconsistent with a denial of habeas relief.a prosecutor withholding of such evidence does not automatically trigger a brady violation.rather,the evidence withheld must also be material.brady,at.thus,in a given case,a state habeas court could certainly find that a prosecutor had withheld exculpatory evidence,but conclude that the evidence was not material,and so deny brady relief.that apparently is precisely what the state court did here.for after making its findings,it summarily concluded that the state actions did not violate the dictates of brady maryland,without specifying why this was so.this conclusion that the prosecution withheld evidence without violating brady is not logically inconsistent with the denial of watkins brady claim 
moreover,even were the state court factual findings somehow inconsistent with its judgment,we could not withhold deference on that ground.the concurrence errs in suggesting that we owe deference to implicit findings only when they are consistent with or necessary to the state court judgment.that is simply not the law.rather,the presumption of correctness afforded to a state habeas court factual findings broadly extends not only to express findings of fact,but to the implicit findings of the state court.garcia quarterman,cir see also taylorx horn,cir same lujan tansy,cir same.were the rule otherwise,federal courts could read ambiguities into state habeas findings and then invent scenarios to resolve them that justify denying habeas relief.aedpa deference does not permit this 
to be sure,as the concurrence notes,when appropriate,on aedpa review federal courts do imply factual findings that align with the state court ultimate judgment.that is undoubtedly the correct course in a case where it can scarcely be doubted from the state court written opinion that the petitioner factual contentions were resolved against him.lavallee delle rose,see also marshall lonberger,implying factual finding from the judgment where state court failure to grant relief was tantamount to an express finding against the defendant.but this is not such a case.here,it can scarcely be doubted from the state court written opinion,lavallee,at including its express findings of fact and the inferences fairly deducible from these facts,marshall,at that watkins factual contentions were resolved in his favor,notwithstanding the court ultimate judgment against him.
in sum,when viewed in light of the evidence before it,the state court factual findings compel only one version of events that parsons told adkins,after trial,that zimm stated,before trial,that he was not afraid during the attempted robbery.we can not eschew a straightforward reading of the state court factual findings simply because it renders that court ultimate judgment unreasonable.rather,aedpa expressly instructs that we grant habeas relief in such circumstances.see d 
of course,watkins can not prevail on his brady claim simply by proving that,prior to trial,the prosecution possessed favorable impeachment evidence which it did not disclose watkins must also show that such evidence was material,strickler greene,and that the state court unreasonably determined that the prosecution failure to disclose such evidence did not violate brady.harrington richter,see also d.
the test for materiality in this context is.undisclosed evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.smith cain,quotation marks and citation omitted.a court considering the materiality of undisclosed evidence need not be convinced to an absolute certainty that proper disclosure would have resulted in a different verdict.monroe angelone,cir.for a reasonable probability does not mean that the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,but rather that the likelihood of a different result is great enough to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.smith.at citing kyles whitley,quotation marks and alterations omitted.
in this case,the record makes clear that zimm trial testimony that he had feared the defendant during the alleged attempted robbery was fundamental to a successful prosecution.the record is also clear that the element of fear was fiercely contested throughout trial.thus,the likelihood of a different result had the prosecution disclosed evidence that zimm stated before trial that he had not been afraid during the alleged attempted robbery is great enough to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.
critically,at trial,zimm was the state primary witness,and the state only witness who testified to being in fear of bodily injury from defendant watkins.the jury was properly instructed that,to prove attempted robbery in the second degree,the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that watkins committed an assault that placed mike zimm in fear of bodily harm.prosecutor parsons himself confirmed zimm role as the key witness on the fear element in his memorandum to the state habeas court,recounting that he had inform ed zimm that if the element of fear did not exist the case could not be proven at trial.
the state nevertheless contends that evidence that zimm stated before trial that he had not been afraid was not material because other evidence at trial suggested that zimm had in fact been fearful.to this end,the state cites evidence that the other pharmacy employees knew of a rash of recent pharmacy robberies in the area that watkins clothing made clear that he intended to rob the pharmacy that watkins had his hands at his waistband,where he could have had a weapon and that another pharmacy employee described how zimm facial expression changed when watkins entered the store,thereby corroborat ing zimm description of his fear.appellant br.at emphasis in original.
as the district court noted,however,all of this evidence was relevant only to show that zimm was credible and to corroborate his trial testimony about being afraid.of course,as the state suggests,the jury could have discounted evidence of zimm lack of fear statement,even if the state had disclosed it.but this argument merely leaves us to speculate about which of zimm contradictory declarations the jury would have believed.smith.at.such speculation does not render evidence immaterial.for,although the state argument offers a reason that the jury could have disbelieved zimm alleged lack of fear statement,it gives us no confidence that it would have done so.id.emphases in original.
not only was zimm trial testimony that he was in fear of the defendant literally elemental to the prosecution case,attacking the fear element was the sine qua non of the defense trial strategy.from opening statement to closing argument,the defense repeatedly and vigorously contended that the evidence did not demonstrate that an assault requiring fear of bodily harm had taken place.see.at the close of the state case,the defense moved for a directed verdict,relying in large part on the state failure to prove fear.defense counsel adkins argued that because his client did not swing at zimm,did not brandish a weapon,and did not verbally threaten him,zimm could not have been in fear of bodily harm.the state responded that during trial zimm said that he was fearful,that zimm had also testified that he was aware of several recent pharmacy robberies,and that the defendant had been dressed and behaved in a way that caused zimm to have apprehension.in denying the motion for directed verdict,the state trial court twice remarked that it a close call,but ultimately determined that the jury may well find that zimm was,in fact,under assault and feared for himself.
plainly then,evidence that zimm had stated,before trial,that watkins had not caused him to be afraid would have been crucial to the defense.the defense could have used that evidence to argue reasonable doubt,to reinforce other evidence suggesting that zimm was not afraid,or perhaps most critically,to undermine zimm credibility on the central issue of fear.w hen the witness in question supplied the only evidence of an essential element of the offense,impeachment evidence is frequently material,especially if the undisclosed evidence was the only significant impeachment material.see united states parker,slip op.at cir quotation marks and citation omitted.indeed,we have noted that when,as here,the jury had to believe that the witness was credible and that his version of events was in fact truthful and accurate in order to support the defendant conviction,the materiality of evidence impeaching that witness is manifest.see wolfe clarke,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.
watkins established before the state habeas court a clear brady violation the prosecutor possessed and did not disclose evidence that a witness said that he was not afraid during the alleged attempted robbery fear was an essential element of the crime that witness was the state key witness on the fear element and the fear element was hotly contested throughout the trial.given the critical nature of the impeachment evidence here,it was unreasonable for the state habeas court not to conclude that the state had violated its brady obligations.
the district court properly granted habeas relief.the majority contrary holding piles a further injustice on a man already victimized by improper governmental action.
footnote.the dissenting opinion also fails to recognize that the state habeas court found two distinct conversations.the first conversation that it found consisted of a statement made after trial that zimm said he was not afraid at the time of the incident at issue.the second conversation that it found was one between zimm and prosecuting attorney parsons before trial that explored the definition of the fear element.there is no evidence to support a conclusion that the pretrial conversation included a statement by zimm that he was not afraid,and the state habeas court did not find that the pretrial conversation included such a statement.indeed,the prosecutor testified affirmatively that zimm did not make such a statement in that pretrial conversation zimm did not state that he was never afraid,but rather he sought a better understanding of what fear meant in the context of this case.the dissent simply conflates the two conversations,as did the district court,concluding without record support,that the conversation referred to the pretrial conversation and not some other conversation.the state habeas court found the conversations to be historically and substantively distinct.
as discussed in more detail below,watkins plainly misrepresented the substance of adkins state court testimony during the federal habeas proceedings.in addition,watkins attached to his pro se federal habeas petition a typewritten note that he now represents to be the contemporaneous note mentioned by adkins.this note references chatter amongst the various persons during a sentencing hearing for an unrelated defendant that occurred on april.we can not know whether the contemporaneous note that surfaced during these federal habeas proceedings is the contemporaneous note that adkins referenced in his testimony.the place and time to determine that was during the state court proceedings.but even if we were to consider the note,it would create more problems for watkins.the note that watkins chose not to show to the state habeas court,but now urges us to see,dates the conversation as having occurred on april,after watkins trial but prior to his sentencing.adkins was not out of the case at that time,and he would have necessarily been aware of any alleged,exculpatory statement prior to the conclusion of the state trial proceedings.in other words,watkins brady claim would most likely be procedurally barred,see c,which may well explain why state habeas counsel did not produce the note during the state habeas proceedings despite adkins repeated references to it.
watkins state habeas counsel might well have been concerned about his ability to prove the existence of the alleged statement from the inception of the evidentiary hearing.prior to presenting adkins testimony,watkins counsel had instead described the eleventh claim as one involving alleged improper coaching of the witness.see advising the state habeas court that the eleventh contention i
