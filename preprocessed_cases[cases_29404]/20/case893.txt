having been released on parole after serving years of a life sentence of imprisonment for a federal conviction for rape and murder,michael kennedy was directed by his probation officer,as a condition of parole,to report to the wicomico county,maryland,sheriff office and to register as a sex offender,in accordance with the sex offender registration and notification act sorna,title i of the adam walsh child protection and safety act of,stat,codified primarily at and.see a imposing a duty on sex offenders to register in the states in which they reside,work,and study making sorna applicable to those convicted of a sex offense prior to sorna enactment.acknowledging the broad scope of his probation officer authority,kennedy nonetheless argues that the order to register was unreasonable because it was premised on an incorrect reading of sorna he was unable lawfully to register in maryland under the terms of maryland state registry and the order violated the tenth amendment by commandeering maryland officials to register him in violation of maryland law.
we conclude that because sorna lawfully imposes,as a matter of federal law,registration obligations directly on sex offenders,such as kennedy,the probation officer acted within his discretion in imposing the registration requirement and that kennedy is not relieved of that duty by any restriction in maryland law or by maryland failure to implement sorna.we also reject kennedy tenth amendment challenge.accordingly,we vacate our earlier opinion,kennedy allera,app x cir,affirming on the ground that kennedy was required to register under maryland law independent of his duty under sorna,and affirm the judgment of the district court for the reasons given herein.
in december,a federal jury in california convicted michael kennedy of raping and murdering maria lopez de felix.at the time of the crime,kennedy was employed as an immigration and naturalization officer,and the victim was a mexican national who had attempted to enter the united states illegally.according to the facts presented at trial,kennedy was escorting lopez de felix to the mexican border when he led her to an unoccupied building,raped and strangled her,and left her body on an adjacent walkway.following his conviction,kennedy was sentenced to life imprisonment.
after serving years in federal prison,kennedy was released on parole in january to the supervision of the parole commission in the district of maryland.included in the standard conditions of his release was the requirement that kennedy register as a sex offender in accordance with the laws of any state with which he had contact,as directed by his probation officer.the condition provided specifically 
if you have been convicted of any sexual offense under district of columbia or federal law including uniform code of military justice offenses,you must report for registration with your state sex offender registration agency as directed by your probation officer.you are required to report for registration in any state in which you live,work,attend school,or pursue any vocation.you must be registered in compliance with applicable state law that applies to current or prior federal,state,or local convictions for sexual offenses,and in compliance with i which makes it a federal crime for any offender covered by not to register in accordance with state law.if there is any question as to whether or where you are required to register,you must seek and follow the guidance of your probation officer.
when kennedy probation officer,michael allera,instructed kennedy to register as a sex offender in maryland in accordance with maryland law,kennedy objected,arguing that maryland law did not require him to register.nonetheless,kennedy reported to the wicomico county sheriff office to register,as allera had directed.the sheriff office,however,refused to accept kennedy registration,concluding that kennedy was not required to register under maryland law.consequently,officer allera withdrew his instruction to kennedy to register in maryland as a sex offender.
in,officer allera learned of several troubling incidents in which kennedy had acted inappropriately toward women.in addition,allera received a report from kennedy therapist indicating that recent evaluations suggested that kennedy posed a moderate risk of committing another sex offense.officer allera submitted those facts to the parole commission,and the commission modified kennedy parole conditions to require him to submit to a polygraph examination and to continue participating in a treatment program.after kennedy objected to these conditions,the commission national appeals board affirmed them on january.in response,kennedy filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus under in the district court,challenging his new parole conditions on constitutional and statutory grounds.
on july,while kennedy habeas petition was pending,congress enacted sorna,which provides that a sex offender shall register,and keep the registration current,in each jurisdiction where the offender resides,where the offender is an employee,and where the offender is a student.a.in addition,sorna gave the attorney general of the united states the authority to specify its applicability to sex offenders convicted before its enactment or its implementation in a particular jurisdiction.id.d.pursuant to this authority,the attorney general issued a regulation on february,making sorna registration requirements applicable to all sex offenders,including sex offenders convicted of the offense prior to the enactment of sorna.
in response to sorna enactment and the attorney general regulation,officer allera officially instructed kennedy,by letter dated march,to register as a sex offender under sorna.in response to this letter,kennedy supplemented his habeas petition to include a challenge to the legality of this condition and any obligation to register under sorna.at the same time,kennedy also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction,requesting that the district court enjoin officer allera from requiring him to register.this motion was later withdrawn,however,when the parole commission agreed to refrain from ordering kennedy to register as a sex offender while the merits of his habeas petition were pending and while the parole commission was considering him for early termination of parole.
on november,the parole commission denied kennedy early termination of parole,and the national appeals board thereafter affirmed the ruling.the board stated further 
t he commission has not specifically required you to register as a sex offender under maryland law because it had been advised that there was a question of the applicability of the law to you.in good faith,the commission has awaited a ruling on the issue.however,the national appeals board has determined that,under the sex offender registration and notification act sorna,you are required to register as a sex offender.see gould,d.the board affirms the condition of parole that requires you to register as a sex offender.
to implement the ruling,officer allera sent kennedy a letter dated april,which stated 
dear kennedy,
this is a to my phone message on.as you are aware,a condition of your parole states if you have been convicted of any sexual offense under district of columbia or federal law you must report for registration with your state sex offender registration agency as directed by your probation officer.you are required to report for registration in any state in which you live,work,attend school,or pursue any vocation.this condition was held in abeyance pending further research of the matter.
as indicated in the notice of action on appeal dated march,the parole board affirmed the condition of your parole that requires you to register as a sex offender.as noted in the document,this was based on a decision by the national appeals board.
you are hereby instructed to report to lieutenant roberts at the wicomico sheriff office and register as a sex ofender on april,at am.
emphasis added.
after receiving this letter,kennedy renewed his motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prohibit the parole commission from requiring him to register as a sex offender,challenging the constitutionality of sorna in various respects and arguing that sorna did not apply to him because maryland law did not require him to register.in response,the parole commission agreed to delay enforcing its requirement that kennedy register as a sex offender until after the district court ruled on kennedy habeas petition and motion for an injunction.
thereafter,the district court denied both kennedy habeas petition and his motion for an injunction,explaining that sorna clear and unequivocal requirement that individuals convicted of sex offenses must register as sex offenders under federal law applied to him even though maryland had not yet fully implemented sorna,noting that maryland has a registry in which kennedy could register.kennedy allera,slip op.at.june.the court also summarily rejected kennedy constitutional and statutory challenges to sorna,explaining that t hese arguments have been considered and consistently rejected by courts across the country,all of which have confirmed the constitutionality of sorna and the regulations associated with it.the court concurs in these analyses and will not belabor these points here.id.at citations omitted.finally,the court found significant the fact that a s kennedy acknowledges,the commission has broad authority to impose conditions on his parole that are reasonably related to his offense and personal characteristics.id.at.it concluded that kennedy thus can not avoid the condition that he report for registration with his state sex offender registration agency as directed by his probation officer.id.quoting kennedy parole conditions.
from the entry of the district court order,dated june,kennedy appealed to this court.he also reported to the wicomico county sheriff office to be registered as a sex offender,and the sheriff office accepted his registration.kennedy is now registered in the maryland sex offender registry.
by an earlier unpublished opinion,we affirmed the district court order,concluding that kennedy challenges to sorna made no difference because he was independently required by maryland law to register as a sex offender.see kennedy allera,app x,cir.
on november,kennedy filed a petition for rehearing,arguing that we had misinterpreted maryland law in holding that maryland law required him to register as a sex offender.kennedy argued that under maryland law,sex offenders whose offenses were committed prior to july,are only required to register if they were previously subject to registration requirements in another state or were under the supervision of a supervising authority on october,and that he did not fall within the terms of these provisions because he had never been required to register in another state and because the parole commission was not included in the statutory definition of supervising authority.by an order dated march,we granted kennedy petition for rehearing.
the parole commission has broad authority to impose reasonable conditions on an order granting parole,b,and because actions of the parole commission taken pursuant to this authorization are committed to agency discretion for purposes of a,d,they are insulated from judicial review see garcia neagle,cir hackett parole comm n,cir the federal court scope of review over a decision by the parole commission is extremely limited.in general,however,even where action is committed to absolute agency discretion by law,courts have assumed the power to review allegations that an agency exceeded its legal authority,acted unconstitutionally,or failed to follow its own regulations.garcia,at.thus,our review of actions of the parole commission is limited to claims that it has violated constitutional,statutory,regulatory,or other restrictions,and we may not review commission action where the challenge is only to the decision itself.id.
recognizing that the parole commission has broad authority to impose reasonable conditions on his parole,kennedy argues nevertheless that the parole commission order for him to register as a sex offender was unreasonable because the order was premised on an incorrect interpretation of sorna kennedy was unable to lawfully register under the terms of the maryland state registry,and in turn,unable to lawfully comply with the parole commission order and the order violated the tenth amendment by commandeering the state of maryland to register kennedy in violation of its own state law.we address these arguments in order.
to begin,although kennedy contends that the special parole condition requiring him to register in maryland was based on an incorrect interpretation of sorna,it is unclear whether this claim even falls within the scope of review permitted by a.see garcia,at.moreover,even if this claim were reviewable,it would fail on the merits,as it remains clear that sorna imposes a federal duty on sex offenders to register in each jurisdiction where the offender resides,where the offender is an employee,and where the offender is a student.a see also applicability of the sex offender registration and notification act,sorna directly imposes registration obligations on sex offenders as a matter of federal law.sorna further vests the attorney general with the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders convicted before july,or its implementation in a particular jurisdiction,d,and the attorney general has done so,specifying that sorna applies to all sex offenders,including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required prior to the enactment of that act.as kennedy was convicted of rape and murder in,he qualifies as a sex offender under,and thus he was required by sorna to register in maryland,his state of residence.
notwithstanding this unambiguous directive of federal law,kennedy contends that because he was unable to initially register,consistent with b,a provision that requires sex offenders to initially register before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement,he is relieved of any duty to comply with sorna until the act is implemented in maryland.as support for this proposition,he relies on guidelines published by the department of justice,see the national guidelines for sex offender registration and notification national guidelines,july,which,he claims,make clear that because of his inability to register initially under b,he has no duty to register under sorna until maryland implements sorna he is fully instructed about sorna requirements and he receives a signed acknowledgment of such instructions.
in making this argument,however,kennedy overlooks the fact that the section of the national guidelines on which he relies addresses the duty of jurisdictions to identify and register sex offenders who can not be registered under the ordinary initial registration procedure.that section does nothing to negate kennedy independent duty as a sex offender to register under sorna.the national guidelines,which were issued to provide guidance and assistance to covered jurisdictions in implementing the sorna standards in their registration and notification programs.at,repeat that sorna applies to all sex offenders,including those convicted of their registration offenses prior to the enactment of sorna or prior to particular jurisdictions incorporation of the sorna requirements into their programs,id.at.in addition,the national guidelines instruct jurisdictions that they 
should endeavor to register sex offenders with presorna or convictions who remain in the prisoner,supervision,or registered sex offender populations at the time of implementation in conformity with sorna as quickly as possible,including fully instructing them about the sorna requirements,obtaining signed acknowledgments of such instructions,and obtaining and entering into the registry all information about them required under sorna.
id.recognizing,however,that it may not be feasible for a jurisdiction to fulfill these duties immediately,the national guidelines authorize jurisdictions to phase in sorna registration for such
