this case arises out of an armed robbery gone awry.in his appeal,sean janosky,a state prisoner,challenges the dismissal of his federal habeas petition,which asserted violations of his constitutional rights under the sixth and fourteenth amendments.after careful consideration,we affirm the denial of habeas relief.
background 
on december,two men robbed a diamond merchant at his place of business in peabody,massachusetts.the police investigation led to john pedoto,whom the police suspected might have driven the getaway car.during questioning,pedoto named the petitioner as the lead man who had posed as a prospective customer and then robbed the merchant at gunpoint.
the police found a piece of scrap paper in a search of pedoto car.the paper bore the name shawn and a telephone number.within the boston area code,that number was listed to one ann janosky,at the petitioner residence.
the police presented a photo array to the diamond merchant and his wife the merchant had seen the thief both during the robbery and while browsing in the store five days earlier his wife had seen the thief on the prior occasion.the merchant identified the petitioner as the armed robber.his wife could not identify anyone from this first array but identified the petitioner when shown an photo array one month later.the police obtained a search warrant for the petitioner residence and seized a brown ribbed turtleneck sweater,similar to one described by the merchant as having been worn by the armed robber.
a state grand jury returned an indictment against the petitioner and a codefendant,mark bova,whom the authorities had come to believe was the second man involved in the heist.in advance of trial,the petitioner counsel moved to allow questioning of police witnesses concerning the statements made by pedoto who had since died.counsel explained that the purpose of this testimony was to show that once pedoto falsely implicated the petitioner in the robbery in order to shift the spotlight,the police made a prescindent rush to judgment and failed to conduct a full investigation into other potential suspects.relatedly,counsel asked for a limiting instruction to the effect that pedoto statements should not be considered for the truth of the matters asserted.the trial justice deemed these requests premature,although he indicated that,if the evidence came in,he would be inclined to give such an instruction.
the two defendants were tried together.at trial,the prosecution entered into evidence a copy of the scrap of paper seized from pedoto car.the petitioner counsel objected to the introduction of that evidence on hearsay and best evidence grounds,but to no avail.
also during the trial,the petitioner counsel elicited testimony from the investigating officers that pedoto was the one who first linked the petitioner with the robbery.despite the trial justice earlier intimation,the petitioner lawyer did not request an instruction forbidding the use of this testimony as proof of the matters asserted.no such instruction was given but,at the codefendant request,the trial justice instructed that pedoto statements were offered solely against the petitioner and could not be used against bova.
on march,the jury convicted the petitioner of armed robbery and carrying a firearm without a license.see.laws ch,id.ch,a.at the same time,it acquitted him of a charge of armed assault with intent to murder.the jury acquitted bova on the solitary charge against him armed robbery.
the petitioner appealed and,while his appeal was pending,filed a motion for a new trial the trial justice denied this motion,and the petitioner appealed from that order.the massachusetts appeals court mac consolidated the two direct appeals and rejected both of them.commonwealth janofsky sic,table.
the petitioner then filed an application for leave to obtain further appellate review alofar.the supreme judicial court sjc summarily denied the alofar.commonwealth janosky,table.
the petitioner repaired to the federal district court and timely sought habeas relief.pertinently,he claimed that i the trial justice failure to give a suitable limiting instruction violated his constitutional rights to confrontation and due process ii his trial counsel shoddy performance violated his constitutional right to receive effective assistance of counsel and iii the trial justice admission of a copy of the scrap of paper seized from pedoto car violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation.the district court dismissed the petition.janosky amand,unpublished order.the court held that the petitioner first claim was procedurally barred that the state courts rejection of the second claim did not represent an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law and that the third claim had not been fully exhausted and,thus,was not cognizable on federal habeas review.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
we divide our analysis into three segments,each corresponding to a discrete claim of error.although the three claims implicate distinct bodies of federal habeas law,all of the district court disputed legal determinations engender de novo review.prou united states,cir.
jury instructions.
we begin with the petitioner claim that the trial justice abridged his rights by failing to give a sua sponte limiting instruction concerning pedoto hearsay statements,and made a bad situation worse by advising the jury at the codefendant timely request that those statements were admitted only against the petitioner.the mac did not deal with the merits of this claim because the petitioner had not seasonably objected at trial,rendering his claim procedurally barred.that a procedural default took place can not be gainsaid,and the district court discerned no basis for excusing this procedural default.accordingly,it ruled that this claim was not subject to federal habeas review.we examine that ruling.
federal habeas review of a particular claim is precluded in circumstances in which a state prisoner has defaulted on that claim in state court by virtue of an independent and adequate state procedural rule.coleman thompson,d.setting to one side cases of actual innocence,this general prohibition applies unless the habeas petitioner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice.id.
we have held,with a regularity bordering on the monotonous,that the massachusetts requirement for contemporaneous objections is an independent and adequate state procedural ground,firmly established in the state jurisprudence and regularly followed in its courts.see gunter maloney,cir brewer marshall,cir burks dubois,cir johnson mississippi,d requiring that a state procedural rule be consistently applied in order to constitute an independent and adequate state ground.here,the mac applied the state contemporaneous objection rule to bar review of this claim after engaging in a brief miscarriage of justice assessment to determine whether it should look past the procedural default.
this discretionary review does not amount to a waiver of the state contemporaneous objection rule.see gunter,at burks,at tart massachusetts,cir beard kindler,d holding that a discretionary state procedural rule can serve as an adequate ground to bar federal habeas review.consequently,federal habeas review of the petitioner jury instruction claim is foreclosed one exception noted can demonstrate cause and prejudice.see burks,at.
the petitioner contends that there is cause for his procedural default because his trial counsel performed ineffectively by failing to request a limiting instruction and not objecting to the instruction actually given.the premise on which this contention rests is sound ineffective assistance of counsel,so severe that it violates the sixth amendment,may constitute sufficient cause to excuse a procedural default as long as the petitioner exhausted his ineffective assistance claim in state court.murray carrier,d.on this point,exhaustion is not a problem the petitioner assiduously pursued a constitutionally focused ineffective assistance claim before all the affected state courts,thus satisfying the exhaustion requirement,and the state courts rejected the claim on the merits.consequently,the question reduces to whether trial counsel performance was constitutionally infirm.
that question calls into play the familiar test elucidated in strickland washington,d.this circuit has not yet ruled on whether the strickland inquiry,when nested within the analysis,is limited by the deferential standard of review set forth in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d.there is disagreement among courts about whether,when the state court has decided a direct ineffective assistance claim,that decision is entitled to aedpa deference in the context or whether the ineffective assistance claim is reviewed de novo as to cause and prejudice.compare,wrinkles buss,cir applying the aedpa standard when analyzing an ineffective assistance claim to establish cause,and winston kelly,d,noting split of authority and concluding the aedpa standard applies,with hall vasbinder,cir holding that even though a habeas petitioner normally must satisfy the heightened aedpa standard with respect to an ineffective assistance claim,he need not do so when arguing ineffective assistance in order to establish cause,and fischetti johnson,cir similar.here,however,the petitioner has not asked us to apply de novo review for purposes of the cause analysis.
we are reluctant to address an important issue without adversarial briefing and,in any event,there is no need to decide the issue here.de novo review is obviously more favorable from the petitioner standpoint,and we will assume without deciding that de novo review applies.we indulge this assumption because,even under that more favorable standard,the petitioner fails to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel as cause for his procedural default.
strickland constructs a algorithm for assessing claims of ineffectiveness.under this algorithm,a defendant must show both that counsel performance was deficient and that it prejudiced his defense.at.an inquiring court need not necessarily address both parts of this algorithm if the court determines that the defendant does not satisfy either part,it may stop there.id.at.
to establish deficient performance,a defendant must show that,considering all the circumstances,counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.to establish prejudice,a defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.this prejudice analysis is the same as the prejudice analysis more generally used in connection with procedural defaults.see prou,at.
in this instance,we need not decide whether trial counsel handling of the jury instructions descended to the level of ineptitude necessary to constitute deficient performance.given the substantial evidence of the petitioner guilt,there is no reasonable probability that,had the matter been handled as the petitioner now suggests,the outcome of his trial would have changed.we explain briefly.
it is,of course,settled law that a court must weigh the strength of the evidence in determining whether a sufficient showing of prejudice has been made under strickland.see united states de la cruz,cir buehl vaughn,cir.when the evidence of guilt is substantial,courts routinely have found no prejudice resulting from counsel failure to request a limiting instruction.see,musladin lamarque,cir albrecht horn,cir anderson sternes,cir garrett united states,cir scarpa dubois,cir.
here,the evidence of the petitioner guilt was substantial indeed,overwhelming.the victim and his wife both identified the petitioner.the victim eyewitness testimony was especially powerful he testified that he had engaged in a,conversation with the petitioner immediately prior to the robbery.he also had seen him on another occasion,five days earlier.and,finally,the victim description of the brown sweater worn by the armed robber matched apparel seized by the authorities from the petitioner home.
in comparison,the inculpatory effect of pedoto statements was quite modest moreover,even though counsel did not request a limiting instruction with respect to pedoto hearsay statements,he explained the narrow objective of this testimony in both his opening statement and his closing argument.at these times,counsel repeatedly stressed that the purpose of the evidence was to show that pedoto falsely accused the petitioner in order to avoid prosecution and that the police,content with a bird in hand,thereafter neglected to undertake an adequate investigation.
in light of the foregoing,we do not find any prejudice in trial counsel failure either to request a limiting instruction or to object to the instruction actually given.it follows that the petitioner can not show cause through a showing of trial counsel alleged ineffectiveness.
of course,even without a finding of cause and prejudice in the conventional sense,a federal habeas court may excuse a procedural default if the petitioner can demonstrate that a failure to consider his claim will work a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman,at.the exception is narrow and applies only in extraordinary in which a petitioner makes some showing of actual innocence.see carrier,at.burks,at.here,however,the petitioner has not attempted to make any such showing,and none is evident on the face of the record.
that ends this aspect of the matter.simply put,the petitioner has not mustered the required showing of cause and prejudice to excuse his procedural default.see carrier,at.so long as a defendant is represented by counsel whose performance is not constitutionally ineffective under the standard established in strickland we discern no inequity in requiring him to bear the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural default.the petitioner is thus barred from litigating his procedurally defaulted jury instruction claim.
ineffective assistance.
we next address the petitioner independent claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.the petitioner asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective in the ways previously mentioned failing to request a limiting instruction at the appropriate time and not objecting to the instruction actually given and in two additional ways eliciting damaging hearsay testimony from the investigating officers and neglecting to investigate other potential culprits.because the state courts reached the merits of the petitioner independent ineffective assistance claim,we apply the aedpa deferential standard of review.see d see also williams taylor,d.under this standard,we restrict our inquiry to whether the relevant decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.d.because the sjc summarily denied further appellate review,we look to the last reasoned this case,the mac rescript.see foxworth amand,cir gunter,at.
for habeas purposes,a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court employs a rule that contradicts an existing supreme court precedent or if it reaches a different result on facts materially indistinguishable from those of the controlling supreme court precedent.williams,at.a decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it identifies the correct rule,but applies that rule unreasonably to the facts of the case sub judice.id.at.to justify federal intervention,the state court application must be both incorrect and unreasonable.see leftwich maloney,cir explaining that the state court decision is not vulnerable unless it evinces some increment of incorrectness beyond mere error mccambridge hall,cir en banc same.
the strickland standard qualifies as clearly established federal law for purposes of habeas review.see,ouber guarino,cir see also williams,at.although the mac did not cite to strickland in resolving the petitioner claim,it used a analogue that we have deemed a satisfactory surrogate for the strickland standard.see ouber,at explaining that the massachusetts ineffective assistance standard is at least as favorable to defendants as the strickland standard accord gomes bra
