in this appeal of the denial of a habeas corpus petition,david julian asks this court to consider whether the state court properly determined that his counsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations when that counsel misinterpreted the supreme court decision in apprendi new jersey,d and informed julian that the maximum sentence he could receive would be thirty,rather than sixty years in prison.
on august,julian and his state court trial counsel,dennis sheehan,met with illinois state attorneys and the court to discuss a negotiated plea agreement.he was looking down both barrels of a gun,having been indicted on may,for a robbery committed that same day,and indicted on may,for a robbery committed on april.at the hearing,the state summarized the plea disposition under which julian would be sentenced to year concurrent terms for the two armed robberies.just before julian started to enter his plea,the state mentioned that julian was on supervised release for a previous armed robbery conviction.in response,the trial judge informed julian that state law required that he serve his sentence for the armed robbery consecutively with any separate sentence imposed for a parole violation.at that point,julian conferred with his attorney and then rejected the plea.according to julian,his lawyer informed him that the supreme court had just recently issued a new opinion in apprendi new jersey,d,which required any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum to be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.julian testified that sheehan informed him that because the indictments on the two charges of armed robbery did not mention the prior conviction,the longest sentence he could receive would be thirty years.according to julian testimony,sheehan presented the information to him as a guarantee.according to sheehan testimony,sheehan never guaranteed julian a maximum sentence of thirty years.sheehan did testify,however,that he recalled telling julian that since there was an additional clause in the bill of indictment that made comment about his first conviction for armed robbery,that under those circumstances,it would seem to me that based upon a reading of apprendi,he could get anything more than.tr.at in any event,julian rejected the plea and proceeded to trial on each of the two a jury trial followed later by a stipulated bench trial.unfortunately for julian,sheehan was only half right about the holding of apprendi.it did indeed hold that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt,but it specifically exempted from this holding the fact of a prior conviction.apprendi new jersey,d.julian proceeded to trial and was sentenced to concurrent terms.
after julian was sentenced in the first trial,sheehan filed an unsuccessful motion to reconsider the sentence,arguing that based on apprendi,julian should have received thirty years,at most.several days later,at a sentencing hearing for the second conviction,julian submitted a letter to the court that stated,in part 
i want you to now bring up the apprendi sic jersey as a factor in my sentencing as well as the fact that you stated to me that due to the states sic mishandling of the indictment in these cases that i guaranteed myself a maximum of years,per charge.
at,ex.d,ex.a.the court did not review the letter,but it was entered into the record under seal,over the state objection.
julian filed timely direct appeals and motions for relief that raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel.in those appeals,julian argued that his attorney was ineffective when he advised julian that he could not receive more than a sentence because of limitations set forth in apprendi.he also contended that he would have accepted the plea offer of years had he known that his potential sentence could have exceeded thirty years.
during the evidentiary hearing held during the proceedings,both julian and sheehan testified about the apprendi issue.sheehan version of the facts differs from julian only in the level of certainty sheehan provided regarding the sentence.julian described sheehan advice as a guarantee as shown in the following exchange 
q and did sheehan advise you what the absolute maximum sentence would be that you could receive 
q and what did he tell you the absolute maximum sentence you could receive would be on these cases 
q did he cite any particular case that you remember in support of his statements to you 
q what was that 
a the apprendi new jersey.
q and what was what he told you during these meetings on this issue,what was your understanding of that 
a my understanding was that due to the way i was improperly 
q i sorry,let me cut you off.what did sheehan tell you regarding that,to the best of your recollection,apprendi 
a.he told me,due to the apprendi,that i have guaranteed myself no more than years.
tr.at.sheehan testified about the apprendi advice as follows 
first,on direct examination the following exchange occurred 
q and did you ever advise or make a statement to julian to the effect that because of this apprendi case,that he was guaranteed or that the most he could get was years in the department of corrections 
tr.at.on,he elaborated further 
here is what i remember telling him about it.i remember saying to him that my reading of the apprendi case indicated to me that since there was an additional clause in the bill of indictment that made comment about his first conviction for armed robbery,that under those circumstances it would seem to me that based upon a reading of apprendi,he could get anything more than.that basically what i told him.
tr.at.on examination,sheehan testified as follows 
q d id you ever tell julian then that based on that case and based on your interpretation of that case apprendi,would be held here in the state of illinois,that he was guaranteed to only get sic years 
a t he answer to that question is no.i indicated to him that it was for the court to make a determination as to his penalty and certainly not myself.
julian friend,richye herlihy,testified that sheehan told her that julian could get up to thirty years in prison,but no more.tr.at.
julian and sheehan agree that,prior to the decision in apprendi,at his first court appearance on may,both sheehan and the trial judge informed julian that he was eligible for a term of up to sixty years.julian testified,however,that sheehan later informed him that apprendi had altered the landscape and changed the maximum he could receive.tr.at.
the state court denied julian request for relief,finding clear evidence that both the court and julian counsel advised julian that he was eligible for an extended term of up to sixty years.at,ex.h.julian appeal to the state appellate court resulted in a similar conclusion at,ex.l,and the illinois supreme court denied his petition to appeal at,ex.n.
on petition for a writ of habeas corpus,the district court below concluded that there was no clear and convincing evidence that the state court factual julian counsel did not erroneously inform him that he could not receive a sentence greater than unreasonable based on the record.our review of the district court decision to deny the petition for writ of habeas corpus is de novo.barrow uchtman,cir,cert.denied,d.
our review of this habeas petition,like all habeas petitions,is limited by the terms of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.habeas relief must not be granted unless the state court adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.in assessing the reasonableness of the state court decision,the federal court assumes that the state courts factual determinations are correct unless the defendant rebuts them with clear and convincing evidence.e.
our review of this case utilizes both prongs of the d.we begin with a discussion of the state court.the state court complete discussion of the evidence on this matter consisted of the following four sentences 
evidence was clear that julian was advised by his attorney and by the court that he was eligible for an extended term of up to years in the illinois department of corrections.sheehan did state that when discussing a plea negotiation offer by the state he sheehan opined that the sentence might be years.he never stated that that was the maximum sentence or that a sentence could not be longer.julian knew,because both the court and his attorney told him,that he was eligible for an extended term.
at,ex.h,at.the appellate court came to two conclusions based on the trial court scant discussion.first,the appellate court concluded that the postconviction court found that the defendant was advised both by his attorney and the trial court that he faced a maximum penalty of years imprisonment.second,it concluded that t he postconviction court found that sheehan merely expressed his opinion concerning the effect of apprendi,and did not guarantee that the defendant sentence would not exceed years.at,ex.l.in sum,the appellate court conclusion that sheehan counsel was not ineffective appears to be based on two distinct theories.the first is that sheehan did not err.he correctly informed julian that he could receive up to a sixty year sentence.the second is that because sheehan merely expressed an opinion about the effect of apprendi,and did not guarantee julian thirty years,his misinformation about apprendi did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.
the conclusion that the defendant was advised effectively both by his attorney and the trial court that he faced a maximum penalty of years imprisonment constitutes an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.see d.it is true that,at one time,both sheehan and the court advised julian that the maximum sentence he could receive would be sixty years.both of these admonishments,however,came before the apprendi decision was released.there is no dispute that after the apprendi decision sheehan discussed the case with julian and told him that the law had changed.julian and sheehan testimony aligned on this point.see tr.at tr.at julian testified that his lawyer information changed after the apprendi case was decided 
q b efore you received the first sentence,at any point did he tell you you could get over years 
q a long time before that,before he ever told me about the apprendi.
q so sometime between your first appearance and when he told you about apprendi 
a yes.after that,it was never an issue.he told me i could get more than thirty years.
tr.at.on,julian elaborated 
q i just want to make sure i heard this correctly.did i understand you to say,julian,that at some point sheehan did tell you that you could get years and then afterwards he said you could only get years based on apprendi 
q and that is 
a after he told me about the apprendi and that i could get no more than years,he never discussed an extended term again.
q okay,so it did come up it did come up,then,prior to your first trial with sheehan that you could get years you are just saying that he then said something different after that,but again,prior to the first trial 
a he told me a long time before my first trial,yes,that i could get an extended term.then after he learned of the apprendi,he told me that due to the apprendi,a new supreme court ruling,i could get no more than years.i have guaranteed myself no more than years.
sheehan testified consistently with julian as follows 
a when we spoke about this case originally,and when i found out what his prior criminal record was,and that he was on parole for an armed robbery,i was telling him that he was eligible for the year sentence.
q okay.but you had also just answered me,that you could specifically remember saying those words,in the context of that discussion,but you could get,correct 
a that right.
q so at some point it came up,but maybe not every time you discussed the possible sentence.
a that also correct.
q did you ever mention the apprendi case to julian and what you believed it represented 
a i remember having a brief discussion with him about it.
q okay.and in that discussion,if you recall,do you recall telling him that it would preclude an extended term sentence in this case 
a here is what i remember telling him about it.i remember saying to him that my reading of the apprendi case indicated to me that since there was an additional clause in the bill of indictment that made comment about his first conviction for armed robbery,that under those circumstances it would seem to me that based upon a reading of apprendi,he could get anything more than.that basically what i told him.
this is not,as the state asserts,a swearing match between julian and sheehan.and we need not redetermine credibility.see marshall lonberger,d d gives federal habeas courts no license to redetermine credibility of witnesses whose demeanor has been observed by the state trial court,but not by them.the state court simply ignored a key piece of evidence that reconciled both julian and sheehan testimony.the government cites several pages from the transcript which indicate that sheehan informed julian that he was eligible for a sixty year sentence.brief of the appellee at,but each of these statements refers to information sheehan gave to julian before the apprendi decision was released.consequently,any admonishments that julian received prior to apprendi became moot in julian eyes after sheehan informed julian that apprendi changed the playing field.the court determination that julian knew that he was eligible for an extended term was against the clear weight of the evidence and,therefore,an objectively unreasonable determination of undisputed facts.see davis,cir.
even if it were not,in formulating its alternate theory,the appellate court unreasonably applied the united states supreme court clearly established law on ineffective assistance of counsel claims.recall that the appellate court other and perhaps primary conclusion was that sheehan merely expressed his opinion concerning the effect of apprendi,and did not guarantee that the defendant sentence would not exceed years.at,ex.l,from this,the court could conclude that sheehan did not provide the defendant with ineffective assistance at trial.id.
a state court must analyze a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to the guidelines set forth in strickland washington,d.strickland requires that a petitioner demonstrate first that counsel performance was deficient in an objectively unreasonable manner,and,second,that the deficient performance resulted in prejudice.id.at.a habeas petitioner who brings an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under the aedpa must demonstrate that the state court unreasonably applied strickland in evaluating his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.the state court application of strickland must be objectively unreasonable and not merely erroneous.yarborough gentry,d.
the strickland test applies where a defendant challenges the legal assistance received during plea negotiations.hill lockhart,d.indeed the first prong of the strickland test emanates from an earlier supreme court case in which the court held that a defendant challenging a guilty plea based on ineffective advice from his lawyer must demonstrate that the advice was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.mcmann richardson,d.
this court previously has identified some of the specific criteria that constitute objectively reasonable representation in the context of advice concerning a plea agreement.a reasonably competent attorney will attempt to learn all of the facts of the case,make an estimate of the likely sentence,and communicate the result of that analysis before allowing the client to plead guilty.bethel united states,cert.denied,d moore,at barnes,at.the attorney need not be correct in her prediction of the consequences of pleading guilty and of going to trial,as a mistake,in and of itself is not proof of deficient performance.moore,at barnes,at.the leeway given counsel stems from the general concept that a court must start with the presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.davis lambert,cir.because reasonable attorneys may have a great deal of disagreement about appropriate strategy or tactics,a defendant challenging the effectiveness of counsel must show more than that counsel made poor choices.woods mcbride,cir,cert.denied,d.consequently,although a mistaken prediction is not sufficient to show deficient performance,barnes,at,in some cases it may be such a gross mischaracterization that it provides a strong indication of constitutionally deficient performance.united states martinez,cir.a court may factor the magnitude of the error into its assessment of whether the legal advice was that of a reasonably competent attorney.see mcmann,at.
the state appellate court,therefore,was headed in the wrong direction when it determined that sheehan did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel because he merely expressed his opinion and did not guarantee that the defendant sentence would not exceed years.at,ex.l.the only query we make is whether the attorney actions in learning the facts,analyzing the law,and communicating the results of that analysis to the client,were objectively reasonable.moore,at.and so in moore,where the attorney discussed the possible ramifications of the sentence with a client but did not have the relevant statute with him and was uncertain as to its effect,this court concluded that his conduct was objectively unreasonable,notwithstanding the fact that the attorney never identified the conclusion he reached or the advice ultimately given to the client.moore,at.consequently,the appellate court conclusion that because sheehan provided an opinion rather than a guarantee,he could not have provided ineffective assistance of counsel is a.at,ex.l.what sheehan told julian about a maximum for his sentence was clearly wrong and therefore objectively unreasonable.in fact one would be hard pressed to find a lawyer who guaranteed a client anything.guarantees in the law are hard to come by,particularly in the world of sentencing.were we to constrain claims for ineffective assistance of counsel only to those who received guarantees from their lawyers,we surely would eviscerate the law regarding the right to effective counsel.
the first prong of the state court strickland analysis,therefore,should have focused not on whether sheehan offered advice or a guarantee,but rather on whether sheehan advice was that of a reasonably competent defense lawyer in this case,it will be helpful to our assessment of sheehan analysis of the facts and law,and his efforts to communicate the results of his analysis to revisit the key facts leading up to the rejection of the plea.they are as follows 
on may,julian was brought before a judge on charges that he had committed a robbery that same day.the judge advised julian that the usual sentencing range for the offense was six to thirty years imprisonment,but that if julian had been convicted of the same or greater class offense within the past years excluding any time spent in custody,that could be extended as high as years.at,ex.l.sheehan similarly advised julian that his maximum sentence could be sixty years.tr.at.days later,on june,the supreme court released its decision in apprendi new jersey,d.seven weeks after that,on august,julian and his counsel entered the plea hearing.at or before this hearing,sheehan discussed the effect of the apprendi decision on julian sentence,and,sheehan told julian that under his reading of the apprendi case since there was an additional clause in the bill of indictment that made comment about his first conviction for armed robbery,that under those circumstances it would seem to me that based upon a reading of apprendi,he could get anything more than.tr.at.
of course,this reading of the apprendi decision was wrong.apprendi clearly held that other than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.apprendi,at.emphasis supplied.consequently,there was no need for the government to include an additional clause in the indictment that referenced julian prior conviction for armed robbery.apprendi holding regarding prior convictions was not new.in jones united states,d,decided the year before apprendi,the court noted,in a case construing a federal statute,that under the due process clause of the fifth amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the sixth amendment,any fact other than prior conviction that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment,submitted to a jury,and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.id.and the year before that,in united states,d the supreme court held that congress could treat is,the fact of a prior a sentencing factor rather than an element of the crime,and therefore it need not be set forth in the indictment.id.
it is true,as the government notes,that the apprendi opinion was pages in length and contained two concurrences and two dissents.nevertheless,had sheehan read only the syllabus or even just the word holding of apprendi,demarcated in the syllabus of the opinion by an italicized held he would have known,without any doubt,that the fact of a prior conviction need not be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt the majority opinion contains a lengthy discussion regarding the exception for the fact of a prior conviction which includes a discussion of why this particular type of fact is particularly reliable and relevant and a clear announcement that the holding of,d would stand.apprendi,at.following this discussion,the court summarizes its holding,stating,o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.despite the fact that there were two concurrences and two dissents,the majority opinion drafted by justice stevens was not a fractured opinion in which only portions of the opinion held a majority vote.five members of the court agreed with the whole of the majority opinion in apprendi.in short,the holding of apprendi is clear on first,second,or third glance,that the fact of a prior conviction need not be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.to his credit,sheehan testified that he read apprendi before advising julian,and in this respect his efforts surpassed those of the attorney in moore,who confessed that he did not have the statute with him when providing the advice and acknowledged that he was uncertain as to its effect.nevertheless,given the clear exception for prior convictions announced at several points in the majority opinion of apprendi see apprendi,at,sheehan reading of apprendi in this case simply can not constitute an objectively reasonable analysis of the law and his counsel therefore was deficient in sum,by focusing on sheehan guarantee rather than the analysis required by strickland,the state court application of governing federal law was objectively unreasonable.
none of that matters,however,if julian can not show that but for his lawyer advice,he would have taken the plea offer.because the district court upheld the state court conclusion that sheehan did not provide erroneous information,it did not have the opportunity to consider whether the ill advice prejudiced julian.although we could remand the issue to the district court so that it might address this issue,the district court would merely review the same court record that we have already scoured for evidence of prejudice.because our review is de novo and the issue has been fully briefed,efficiency dictates that we resolve the question here.see,amcast indus.detrex,cir deciding an issue for the first time on appeal where the matter has been fully briefed and the appellate court review is plenary such that the district judge v
