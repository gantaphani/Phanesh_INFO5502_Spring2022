ronald burt was sentenced to death for the murders of steven roy and kevin muto.his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment when the governor of illinois granted clemency to all death row inmates.burt was tried before a jury,but near the end of the state he abruptly changed his plea to guilty without any concessions from the government and against the strenuous advice of his attorneys.during the more than months between his arrest and guilty plea,burt was taking a number of powerful psychotropic medications prescribed for him by prison doctors.burt was examined by a psychologist eight months before his trial began,and the doctor,while noting several psychological impairments,deemed him fit to stand trial.the psychologist,however,did not consult burt medication records and his report mentions only in passing that burt was even on medication.neither defense counsel nor the trial court ever requested a further evaluation to determine if burt was competent at the time he pleaded guilty.burt direct appeal,state petition,and petition for habeas corpus in the district court,were all unsuccessful.we granted burt a certificate of appealability on two issues whether he was denied due process when the trial court failed to order a hearing into his fitness to plead guilty,and whether he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorneys failed to request a renewed examination of his fitness.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the illinois supreme court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law on both issues.accordingly,we reverse the district court denial of burt petition and remand with instructions to grant the writ of habeas corpus unless illinois informs the district court within a reasonable time to be determined by the district court that it intends to retry burt.
background 
facts of the offenses 
these facts are taken from the illinois supreme court opinion resolving burt direct appeal.see people burt,burt i.on january,police in stephenson county were summoned to roy farm after a neighbor discovered that roy and a farmhand,muto,had been fatally shot.the following day officers arrested burt,dannie booth,and david craig for the murders of the two men.burt initially claimed to know nothing about the murders,but he later offered to give a statement after the detectives investigating the case told him that booth and craig had both identified him as one of the assailants.
burt eventually gave three statements to the police.in his first statement,he said that booth,who was years old at the time,had asked him and craig to help collect roy owed him.upon arriving at the farm,booth went to argue with roy while burt and craig waited in another room.while waiting,they searched the room and burt found roy rifle in a closet.he was holding the rifle when roy and booth,still arguing,entered the room.burt pointed the gun at roy,demanded his wallet,and then ordered him to walk to a back room.once in the back room,burt said that roy made a sudden movement.burt claimed this movement made him fear that roy might be trying to pull something,and he shot roy in the back of the head.booth then grabbed the rifle and shot roy several more times.
burt,craig,and booth remained in the house and took some of roy belongings,at which point muto knocked on the back door.burt answered the door and told him to leave when muto refused to leave,booth forced him at gunpoint into a different back room and,after taking his wallet,shot muto in the back of the head and in the back.burt grabbed the gun and again shot muto in the back.the three men then fled the farm with roy vcr,some meat from his refrigerator,and some of his personal checks.
the next day,burt gave a second statement to the police.his second statement was very similar to the first except he added that,after shooting roy,he and craig discussed killing booth because they feared he would report them to the police.a few days later,burt gave a third statement.in this statement he denied shooting muto and claimed that booth was wholly responsible for that murder.burt said that he had previously wanted to protect booth because booth was so young but that he changed his mind after learning that booth was blaming him for the murders.the trial court suppressed the third statement as hearsay.later,booth and craig each pleaded guilty to one count of murder and were sentenced,respectively,to years and years imprisonment.
procedural history and psychological treatment 
on january,two weeks after his admission to the stephenson county jail,burt was seen by a modir,who prescribed the antidepressant doxepin brand name sinequan.shortly thereafter burt,booth,and craig were all indicted for two counts of murder,armed robbery,home invasion,armed violence,and theft.after his indictment burt was transferred to stateville penitentiary and continued to take sinequan.in april burt had his first of many appointments with edward navakas,a psychiatrist at stateville.navakas continued burt prescription for sinequan and also added a new prescription for an medication,diazepam brand name valium.in may navakas prescribed another antidepressant,imipramine brand name tofranil,and doubled burt dosage of valium.
the circuit court for the fifteenth judicial circuit appointed two attorneys,thomas nettles and john vogt,to represent burt.neither nettles nor vogt had any experience defending a capital case and each moved to withdraw.the court denied their motions.nettles and vogt then requested an examination to determine if burt was competent to stand trial.in july,approximately eight months before trial,burt was examined by donald pearson,a psychologist.on the day of the evaluation prison officials refused to dispense his medications because,in burt words,they did not want him doped up for the examination.pearson opined that burt was competent to stand trial despite suffering from antisocial personality disorder,substance abuse disorder,attention deficit hyperactive disorder,and borderline intelligence reflecting minor mental retardation.pearson report also noted that burt was scared of imaginary snakes in his cell.pearson mentioned that burt reported taking sinequan and valium,but he made no further mention of burt medications and did not review navakas records.
approximately two weeks after burt was examined by pearson,navakas again changed burt medications when he discontinued sinequan and increased the dosage of tofranil.three weeks later on august navakas prescribed a new drug,thioridazine brand name mellaril,and maintained tofranil and valium.on august navakas increased the dosages of both mellaril and tofranil,while continuing valium at its previous level.navakas also made a notation that he was discontinuing sinequan,even though burt was not then taking that drug.from august until february burt continued to see navakas,who continued to prescribe mellaril,tofranil,and valium.navakas notes for september,show a new prescription for sinequan,but his notes for burt next appointment on december,make no mention of that drug.
in november burt was examined by another psychologist,linda wetzel,in connection with a defense motion to suppress his confessions.wetzel calculated burt iq as,placing him in the percentile for his age group,and she diagnosed him as having a brain impairment of the frontal cerebral lobe that had been exacerbated by numerous childhood head injuries.she wrote 
his memory deteriorates to a retarded level after a delay of only minutes.his mental flexibility is severely impaired and motor speed is moderately to severely impaired.language abilities are spared which allows him to appear brighter than his actual borderline intelligence level.he is further handicapped by his severe depression which interferes with his ability to concentrate.
wetzel concluded that burt condition resulted in poor impulse control,poor judgment,and inability to monitor and behavior.
six weeks before trial on february,burt told navakas about a painful growth on the left side of his chest.navakas determined that the growth was caused by the mellaril,so he cut burt dosage in half,while maintaining him on the same doses of tofranil and valium.
burt trial began in.during jury selection on march burt attorneys requested a continuance.nettles explained that burt does not feel he is able to continue to assist us in the selection of jurors today.he added that burt was having difficulty sleeping and feels that because of his inability to sleep and because of the medication that he would not be able to assist on today date in selecting these jurors.the court denied a continuance but told burt it would reconsider if i detect you having trouble staying awake.
on march,the fourth day of trial during the state,attorney vogt announced that burt wished to plead guilty.vogt added that we spoken with our client last night and i also spoke with him this morning for some time and we told him that we did think it was appropriate and would be against our advise sic to do that,but he insists on it with us and wants to do it.
the court admonished burt of the consequences of pleading guilty,including that he would be eligible for the death penalty.the court also briefly inquired about burt mental condition 
the court are you getting all the medication you prescribed at this time are you getting it over at the jail 
defendant yes,i am.
the court you feel rested this morning 
defendant i feel about the same.
the court about the same,but that was a problem the other morning,but i watched.you been alert,i think,through the trial.and you discussed this with your attorneys have you not 
defendant yes.
the court okay.are you following their advice or do they disagree with you on that 
defendant they disagree.
the court then cautioned burt to consider his attorneys advice.after burt said he still wished to plead guilty,the court finished admonishing him of the consequences of his decision and then accepted the guilty plea.at a sentencing hearing begun later that day,the parties presented evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.the jury on april sentenced burt to death.
burt filed a timely motion to withdraw his plea in which he argued,among other things,that his guilty plea was not voluntarily and intelligently made because his mental deficiencies and heavy medications rendered him incompetent at the time he changed his plea.the court denied that motion.burt continued to take a variety of psychotropic medications throughout his proceedings.the illinois supreme court affirmed burt convictions on direct appeal,burt i,and the united states supreme court denied certiorari,burt illinois,d.
burt then filed a petition for state relief,asserting in part that he was denied due process when the trial court failed to order a new competency hearing and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorneys failed to request one.burt petition was supported by,among other things,an affidavit from one of his trial attorneys and a report by lyle rossiter,a board certified forensic psychiatrist who reviewed burt medical history.attorney nettles affidavit stated he was aware that burt was taking psychotropic medication throughout burt incarceration.it also stated that burt exhibited frequent swings of mood and often demonstrated belligerent or explosive behavior in his presence.nettles further stated that burt threatened to become violent in the courtroom on multiple occasions and once threatened to attack him.nettles believed,burt did not fully comprehend legal advice and that his behavior throughout the trial,particularly his decision to change his plea to guilty,was not rational.finally,burt insisted on changing his plea to guilty largely because he was not permitted to smoke in the stephenson county jail,and was anxious to return to prison where smoking was permitted.
rossiter report stated that this defendant history of head injury with probable brain damage renders him more susceptible to the adverse effects of psychotropic medication.rossiter opined that burt should have had a fitness hearing because he was taking powerful psychotropic medications at the time of his march trial,and he had a long history of psychiatric disorders and evidence of brain damage.
the circuit court dismissed burt petition in december.the illinois supreme court,with two dissenting justices,affirmed.people burt,burt ii.as relevant here,the majority held that burt was not denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorneys failed to request a fitness hearing before the court accepted his guilty plea because he did not show a bona fide doubt as to his competency to plead guilty and thus could not establish that he was prejudiced by his attorneys failure to request a new competency hearing.id.at.the court held that burt failure to establish a bona fide doubt as to his competency was likewise fatal to his due process claim.id.at.chief justice harrison dissented,arguing that burt abrupt decision to plead guilty without seeking any concessions from the prosecution was an inherently irrational act because of his certain eligibility for the death penalty.id.at.the chief justice added that burt psychiatric history showed that t here can be no real doubt,however,that whatever decisionmaking sense burt possessed abandoned him during the trial.id.justice kilbride also dissented,noting that there is no explanation of why counsel could not or did not procure any concessions from the state in return for defendant guilty plea,such as an agreement not to seek the death penalty.id.at.the united states supreme court again denied certiorari.burt illinois,d.the governor of illinois eventually commuted burt sentence to life imprisonment as part of a blanket commutation of all illinois death sentences.
burt then petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus,again asserting that he was denied due process and effective assistance of counsel.as relevant here,the district court found that the illinois supreme court reasonably concluded that burt due process claim failed because he could not establish a bona fide doubt about his competency.the district court also found that the illinois supreme court reasonably concluded that burt could not establish that he was prejudiced by his counsel failure to request a fitness hearing because he had not established a bona fide doubt about his competency to stand trial.we granted burt a certificate of appealability on two issues whether burt was denied due process when the trial court failed to conduct a fitness hearing prior to accepting his guilty plea,and whether his attorneys rendered ineffective assistance by failing to request a competency hearing either immediately before trial or before the court accepted burt change of plea.
ii.discussion 
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa provides that a defendant can not prevail on a petition for habeas corpus unless he shows that a state court rendered a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.d see also matheney anderson,cir.burt argues that the illinois supreme court unreasonably applied the federal law relevant to each of his claims.we recognize that we may not grant relief under the unreasonable application prong unless the state court application of supreme court precedent l ies well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.hardaway young,cir.
due process claim 
burt first argues that he was denied due process when the trial court failed sua sponte to order a fitness hearing before accepting his guilty plea despite knowing about his history of psychological problems and his heavy use of psychotropic medication.a criminal defendant must be mentally competent to stand trial.drope missouri,d.the question of whether a defendant is competent focuses on whether he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.dusky united states,d.a defendant must also be competent at the time he pleads guilty,and the standard governing competency to plead guilty is the same as that used to evaluate competency to stand trial.godinez moran,d.where the evidence before a trial court raises a bona fide doubt as to the defendant competency,due process requires the court sua sponte to order a competency hearing.pate robinson,d.
the illinois supreme court found that burt failed to establish a bona fide doubt as to his competency to plead guilty for several reasons.first,burt decision to disregard his attorneys advice when pleading guilty demonstrated independent thought and shows that his will was not flattened.burt ii,at.second,navakas at one point wrote that burt seemed motivated to continue his legal defense.id.third,burt clearly understood the consequences of pleading guilty because the trial court admonished him before accepting the plea.id.at.fourth,the court noted a remark made by the trial court at sentencing that,despite one outburst and the incident when he claimed to be too tired to participate in jury selection,burt conducted himself very well and very normally throughout the proceedings.id.at.fifth,although attorney nettles affidavit showed that burt was belligerent and explosive,it did not address whether he could understand the proceedings and participate in his defense.id.at.finally,the court disregarded rossiter report,stating that i t is for this court,and not rossiter,to determine whether there existed a bona fide doubt of defendant fitness.id.at.
the illinois supreme court logic is troubling in many respects.first,it is odd to think that a defendant with severe psychological problems is showing strong independent thought when he suddenly makes a highly questionable strategic decision to plead guilty against the strenuous advice of his counsel.nothing prevents a defendant from making poor tactical choices,including abruptly pleading guilty in the midst of trial.see gosier welborn,cir.and a desire to plead guilty motivated by something like a belated sense of compassion for the victim or a religious conversion may well be fully rational.see id.but we have also recognized that a sudden guilty plea with no attempt to seek concessions from the prosecution may,when coupled with other evidence of mental problems,raise doubts as to the defendant competency.see united states johns,cir.the court conclusion that burt plea demonstrated a strong will ignores the context in which he pleaded guilty burt has significantly below average intelligence and had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactive disorder and a brain impairment that made him prone to poor impulse control.a sudden and highly questionable tactical decision seems more likely a product of his mental deficiencies than strong will and reasoned thought.
other portions of the court reasoning are also suspect.the observation that the court admonished burt of the consequences of pleading guilty is irrelevant to his claim of incompetency.if burt was in fact unable to understand the proceedings,that the court informed him of the consequences of a guilty plea would make no difference.the trial court observation that burt was in court also gives us pause because it is so at odds with nettles affidavit,which states that burt exhibited violent behavior in court and that his frequent mood swings caused several delays in the proceedings.we hasten to add,however,that burt does not attempt to rebut the presumption that this factual finding of the illinois supreme court is correct.see mahaffey schomig,cir.finally,the court decision to disregard rossiter report without explanation is troubling.rossiter reviewed burt medical history as a medical expert and,while an expert report need not be considered conclusive,the court should have at least considered rossiter findings.see matheney,at.
our disagreements with the illinois supreme court reasoning do not,by themselves,justify granting burt petition for habeas corpus because aedpa requires that we show great deference to the state court.see id.at.but no level of deference permits us to overlook the most critical shortcoming of the illinois supreme court total failure to address whether burt was entitled to a competency hearing before pleading guilty given the heavy and doses of psychotropic medication he was taking.
burt correctly observes both that no medical expert ever opined on his fitness to stand trial while he was heavily medicated and that the illinois supreme court never addressed this crucial fact or the wealth of other information that should have alerted the trial court to the need for a new competency hearing before accepting his guilty plea.burt was examined by pearson eight months before trial on a day when prison officials refused to dispense his prescribed medications.pearson made no effort to review burt psychiatric history and did not even review navakas records when finding burt fit to stand trial.see brown sternes,cir psychiatrist opinion as to defendant competency undermined by his failure to review medical history.furthermore,burt medications changed significantly between the time pearson examined him and the time he pleaded guilty.immediately before seeing pearson,burt daily medication regimen was mg of sinequan,mg of valium,and mg of tofranil.during trial,he was taking mg of mellaril down from a high dosage of mg six weeks before trial,mg of valium,and mg of tofranil.thus,burt dosage of tofranil tripled and he switched from sinequan to mellaril between his fitness examination and his trial.moreover,rossiter later opined that burt was particularly susceptible to the effects of these powerful drugs because of his brain damage.
the trial court was well aware that burt was taking an array of powerful psychotropic medications both before and during trial.see pitsonbarger gramley,cir the charge that a defendant was under the influence of psychotropic drugs at or near the time of trial is a serious one.it was also aware that burt had experienced difficulty staying awake during jury selection.yet when the court learned that burt suddenly wished to plead guilty against his attorneys advice,the court asked only two questions about his mental condition.first,the court asked if he had taken his medication,making no further inquiry into what effect the drugs were then having on him.second,the court asked how burt was feeling.but when burt replied that he felt about the same,the court responded about the same,but that was a problem the other morning,but i watched.you been alert,i think,through the trial.rather than following up with another question,the court instead concluded on its own that burt was alert and gave him no further chance to elaborate.
if ever there was a case in which a trial court should have sua sponte ordered a renewed competency hearing,this is that case.pearson report made the trial court fully aware that burt was a man of significantly below average intelligence with a history of psychological problems.the court knew that burt was taking large doses of powerful psychotropic medications and that pearson report barely mentioned those drugs.the court also knew that at one point during the trial burt was having such difficulty remaining alert that his attorneys felt compelled to request a continuance.lastly,burt sudden unexplained decision to plead guilty against the advice of counsel when he faced certain eligibility for the death penalty should have caused the court to consider whether he was competent to make that decision.the trial court never should have accepted burt guilty plea without first ordering a renewed competency hearing,and the illinois supreme court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law when it found that burt was not denied due process.see pate,at.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
although we conclude that burt must prevail on his due process claim,we will also address his second his attorneys provided ineffective assistance when they failed to request a renewed fitness examination either shortly before trial or,at a minimum,before the court accepted the guilty plea.a criminal defendant has a sixth amendment right to be represented by effective counsel.strickland washington,d.in order to establish that he was denied the
