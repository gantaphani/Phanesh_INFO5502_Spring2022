a panel of this court previously affirmed the district court denial of billy ray nelson habeas corpus petition challenging his sentence on the ground that the texas procedure failed to give constitutionally sufficient effect to his mitigating evidence,in violation of penry lynaugh penry i,d.see nelson cockrell.cir,unpublished.nelson petitioned the supreme court for writ of certiorari.the supreme court granted the petition,vacated our judgment,and remanded the case to this court for reconsideration in light of the supreme court decision in tennard dretke,d.nelson dretke,d.on remand,a panel of this court once again affirmed the district court denial of nelson habeas corpus petition.see nelson dretke,cir.having ordered rehearing en banc,nelson dretke,cir,we again reconsider the application of penry i and its progeny to nelson case.we conclude that,on the facts presented here,there is a reasonable likelihood that the texas scheme precluded the jury from giving full effect to nelson mitigating evidence as required by the supreme court accordingly,we reverse the district court denial of habeas relief and remand with instructions to grant the writ of habeas corpus.
factual and procedural background 
on december,a texas jury found nelson guilty of capital murder for the february,slaying and brutal sexual assault of his neighbor,charla wheat.evidence presented during the phase of trial revealed the following nelson gained entrance to wheat apartment by asking if he could use her phone.once inside,he cut the telephone cord to prevent her from calling for help and then proceeded to stab her.he then found wheat roommate,carol maynard,who was five months pregnant at the time,and forced her to get out of bed and enter the living room,where wheat was on her knees bleeding from her stab wounds.nelson told the women to remove their clothing and threatened to kill them if they refused.he then forced the women to perform sexual acts on him and each other.thereafter,he stabbed maynard in the neck and proceeded to strike wheat.nelson left briefly but wheat began screaming and he returned.while maynard pretended to be dead,nelson struck and stabbed wheat until she died.he then left the women apartment.
at the sentencing phase of the trial,nelson presented the following mitigating evidence,which we will discuss more fully infra he was rejected by his mother,who had completely abandoned him by age abusive childhood evidence he abused drugs and alcohol substance abuse evidence he has troubled relationships with his brother and with women he had a child out of wedlock,with whom he was not permitted to have a relationship and a psychiatrist testified he was suffering from borderline personality disorder mental disorder evidence.for a jury to impose the death penalty at the time of nelson trial,article b of the texas code of criminal procedure required the jury to answer two special issue questions concerning evidence presented in mitigation whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result the deliberateness special issue and whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society the special issue the jury answered both questions in the affirmative,sentencing nelson to death.nelson appealed his sentence and conviction to the texas court of criminal appeals that court affirmed,nelson texas,and nelson conviction became final when the supreme court denied certiorari review,nelson texas,d.
nelson filed a state petition for writ of habeas corpus in september,arguing that the texas capital sentencing scheme,the two questions,failed to ensure that the jury could give the constitutionally required consideration of and effect to his mitigating evidence of his mental disorder,abusive childhood,and substance abuse under penry i,d.he also filed a second petition in february,alleging additional claims.the texas court of criminal appeals denied the writ based on the findings and recommendations of the trial court.ex parte nelson.specifically,with regard to nelson penry claims,the texas court of criminal appeals recognized that,to be constitutional,a death penalty procedure must allow the jury to consider all relevant mitigating evidence.ex parte nelson,at judicial district howard county.july,findings of fact and conclusions of law.the court also recognized that where the defendant mitigating evidence is beyond the scope of the special issues,and the jury is unable to give effect to its reasoned moral response to the mitigating evidence,the procedure is unconstitutional as applied to the defendant.id.in applying the law to the facts of nelson case,the court noted that nelson evidence of drug and alcohol abuse had no mitigating relevance beyond the scope of the special issues.id.at.moreover,with regard to the other mitigating evidence presented,
t he court instructed the jury on the charge on punishment,you should consider and give effect in answering each issue to your evaluation of all of the evidence before you,including all aspects of the background and character of the defendant and the circumstances of the crime.the jury charges and special issues allowed the jurors to give effect to all presented mitigating evidence in their answers to the special issues including the intoxication of nelson at the time of the offense.
id.at.therefore,the court concluded that the procedure was constitutional as applied.the court dismissed nelson subsequent habeas petition as an abuse of the writ.ex parte nelson.
nelson filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court in august.the district court rejected nelson penry claim for failing to meet the requirements of our test a panel of this court granted nelson a certificate of appealability coa on this issue however,the panel ultimately affirmed the district court denial of habeas relief.nelson petitioned the supreme court for writ of certiorari,and the supreme court granted the petition,vacated the panel judgment,and remanded the case to this court for reconsideration in light of the supreme court decision in tennard,d.on remand,a panel of this court once again affirmed the district court denial of habeas relief.all three panel members concurred in the judgment however,there was no consensus on the correct methodology for analyzing nelson claim accordingly,this court ordered rehearing en banc,and we once again reconsider the application of penry in light of tennard to the facts of nelson case 
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
because nelson filed his habeas petition after april,this habeas proceeding is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.see fisher johnson,cir.we have jurisdiction to resolve the merits of nelson habeas petition because,as stated above,we granted him a coa on his penry claim.see nelson dretke,at see also c.
under aedpa,a federal court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the petitioner shows that the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or that the state court adjudication of a claim resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d williams taylor,d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law announced in supreme court cases,or the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court did on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.mitchell esparza,d internal quotation marks omitted.a state court application of clearly established federal law is unreasonable within the meaning of aedpa when the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from supreme court precedent,but applies that principle to the case in an objectively unreasonable manner.wiggins smith,d.
a writ of habeas corpus may also issue if the state court adjudication of a claim resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.under aedpa,a state court factual findings are presumed to be correct unless the habeas petitioner rebuts the presumption through clear and convincing evidence.id.e miller johnson,cir.
we review the district court conclusions of law regarding the state court application of federal law de novo,and we review the district court findings of fact,if any,for clear error.collier cockrell,cir.
clearly established federal law 
under aedpa,our duty is to determine whether the state court determination was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court at the time that nelson conviction became final in.see williams,at.in tennard and smith texas,two recent cases involving penry claims,the supreme court unequivocally stated that the relevant inquiry under its precedent was whether there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury would interpret the texas special issues in a manner that precluded it from fully considering and giving full effect to all of the defendant mitigating evidence.see tennard,at.see also smith texas,d per curiam.this standard requires that a juror be able to express his reasoned moral response to evidence that has mitigating relevance beyond the scope of the special issues,a juror can not be precluded from electing a sentence less than death if he believes that the mitigating evidence offered makes the defendant less morally culpable for the crime,even if he nonetheless feels compelled to answer the two special issues in the affirmative.see penry johnson penry ii,d penry i,at.a review of the supreme court decisions in this area demonstrates that this standard was clearly established by the time that nelson conviction became final.
jurek texas and the immediate cases 
in furman georgia,d,the supreme court held that state schemes allowing the death penalty to be wantonly and freakishly imposed by permitting unbridled discretion in sentencing violated the eighth and fourteenth amendments.id.at.stewart,concurring.after furman,states began to rewrite their death penalty statutes,restricting the classes of eligible offenders and channeling jurors discretion in sentencing in an attempt to comply with the supreme court directive.specifically,texas responded to furman with the special issues scheme at issue in this case,which was designed to guide jurors consideration of mitigating evidence offered in the sentencing phase of capital cases.
the immediate supreme court cases addressing this and other sentencing schemes attempted to strike a balance between satisfying two competing constitutional requirement of individualized sentencing that takes into account the unique facts of each case and each defendant,and the requirement of preventing the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty that can result from giving the sentencer unfettered discretion.these cases announced the principles that would underlie the supreme court later pronouncement that a capital sentencing scheme must allow the sentencer to give full effect to all of the defendant mitigating evidence.
in jurek texas,d,the supreme court upheld the facial constitutionality of the texas sentencing scheme on the same day that it ruled on the validity of the death penalty statutes of four other states.see gregg georgia,d upholding the facial constitutionality of georgia scheme,which narrowed the class of offenders and guided the sentencer consideration of mitigating and aggravating evidence proffitt florida,d upholding the facial constitutionality of florida scheme,which narrowed the class of offenders and guided the sentencer consideration of mitigating and aggravating evidence woodson north carolina,d striking down north carolina mandatory scheme because it gave sentencers no discretion to impose the death penalty for certain crimes roberts louisiana,d striking down louisiana scheme requiring the imposition of the death penalty for certain crimes.in jurek,a plurality of the court explained that,while the texas sentencing scheme was constitutional on its face,a jury must be allowed to consider on the basis of all relevant evidence not only why a death sentence should be imposed,but also why it should not be imposed.jurek,at.plurality opinion citing woodson,at.see also roberts,at.plurality opinion.therefore,the constitutionality of the texas procedures turns on whether the enumerated questions allow consideration of particularized mitigating factors.jurek,at.while observing that the special issue allowed consideration of some types of mitigating evidence,the jurek plurality also left room for challenges to the texas sentencing scheme,noting that the texas court of criminal appeals had not yet interpreted the deliberateness and provocation special issues.id.at.i t is as yet undetermined whether or not the jury consideration of those questions would properly include consideration of mitigating circumstances.
lockett ohio and eddings oklahoma 
echoing these concerns that the sentencer be able to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence in a constitutionally adequate way,the supreme court in lockett ohio,d,struck down ohio death penalty statute,which allowed the sentencer to impose a sentence less than death for certain crimes only if the mitigating evidence showed that the victim induced or facilitated the offense,the offense was a result of duress,coercion,or strong provocation,or the offense was a product of psychosis or mental retardation.a plurality of the court explained that this sentencing scheme,which allowed the sentencer to consider some aspects of the mitigating evidence presented but not others,was unconstitutional because 
the eighth and fourteenth amendments require that the sentencer,in all but the rarest kind of capital case,not be precluded from considering,as a mitigating factor,any aspect of a defendant character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.
id.at.plurality opinion see also kansas marsh,d noting that the ohio sentencing scheme in lockett was unconstitutional because,by limiting a jury consideration of mitigation to three factors specified in the statute,it prevented sentencers in capital cases from giving independent weight to mitigating evidence militating in favor of a sentence other than death emphasis added.four years later,in eddings oklahoma,d,a majority of the court adopted the lockett plurality reasoning to vacate an oklahoma death sentence where the sentencing judge refused to consider,as a matter of law,the defendant mitigating evidence of his abusive childhood and treatable emotional disturbance.the court rejected the state appellate court application of a standard to the mitigating evidence,noting that while the sentencer can determine the weight to be given relevant mitigating evidence,it may not give it no weight by excluding such evidence from its consideration.id.at.see also marsh.at observing that,in eddings,a majority of the court held that a sentencer may not categorically refuse to consider any relevant mitigating evidence.
franklin lynaugh 
the court considered an challenge to the texas scheme for the first time in franklin lynaugh,d.there,the court held that the special issues allowed the jury to give constitutionally adequate effect to the petitioner mitigating evidence of good behavior during a previous term of imprisonment.a plurality of the court stated that,because the petitioner evidence of good prison behavior did not have mitigating significance independent of its relevance to the petitioner propensity to commit future crimes,i n resolving the special issue the jury was surely free to weigh and evaluate petitioner disciplinary record as it bore on his character that is,his character as measured by his likely future behavior.id.at.justice concurred separately,emphasizing that,although jurek upheld the facial validity of the texas capital sentencing scheme,and in this case the mitigating relevance of all of the petitioner evidence was within the scope of the special issues,
i f petitioner had introduced mitigating evidence about his background or character or the circumstances of the crime that was not relevant to the special verdict questions,or that had relevance to the defendant moral culpability beyond the scope of the special verdict questions,the jury instructions would have provided the jury with no vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response to that evidence.if this were such a case,then we would have to decide whether the jury inability to give effect to that evidence amounted to an eighth amendment violation.in my view,however,this is not such a case.
id.at,concurring.
the very next term,the supreme court considered just such a case in penry i,d.the penry i court held that habeas relief was appropriate because a juror presented with the texas special issues could not have given effect to the full scope of the mitigating evidence that had been presented at the sentencing phase.penry,a habeas petitioner,had offered mitigating evidence at sentencing of a low indicating likely mental retardation an organic brain disorder that prevented him from appreciating the wrongfulness of his conduct or conforming his behavior to the law a troubled,abusive upbringing and an personality disorder.penry argued that the texas special issues,as applied in his case,were an inadequate vehicle to allow the jury to consider or give effect to this evidence,because the evidence had mitigating relevance beyond the scope of the special issues.the court,with justice writing for the majority,first held that granting penry the relief he requested would not announce a new rule on collateral review in violation of teague lane,d,because granting such relief was dictated by eddings and lockett.penry i,at.
the court then granted the habeas petition,emphasizing that it is not enough simply to allow the defendant to present mitigating evidence to the sentencer.the sentencer must also be able to consider and give effect to that evidence in imposing sentence.id.at.only then can the sentence imposed reflect a reasoned moral response to the defendant background,character,and crime.id.quoting california brown,d,concurring.indeed,as both the concurrence and dissent in franklin understood,jurek,in which the court upheld the facial validity of the texas scheme,rest ed fundamentally on the express assurance that the special issues would permit the jury to fully consider all the mitigating evidence a defendant introduced that was relevant to the defendant background and character and to the circumstances of the offense.id.at.emphasis added.
in penry case,however,the court held that the evidence of mental retardation and abusive childhood had mitigating relevance beyond the scope of the deliberateness and issues,because it also spoke to penry moral culpability therefore,the jury was unable to give effect to the mitigating evidence in a manner consistent with the eighth amendment.first,with regard to the deliberateness special issue,the court reasoned that,although a jury could give partial effect to penry mental retardation and abusive past by finding that his actions were not deliberate,a jury could also conclude that penry acted deliberately but,because of his mental retardation and abusive childhood,was less morally culpable than defendants who have no such excuse,but who acted deliberately as that term is commonly understood.id.at.quoting california brown,at,concurring.without a special instruction enabling the jury to give effect to the impact of penry mitigating evidence on his moral culpability,the jury lacked an adequate vehicle through which to express its reasoned moral response to this evidence.second,the court held that the instruction was likewise constitutionally inadequate because,in this case,penry mental retardation and history of abuse is a sword it may diminish his blameworthiness for his crime even as it indicates that there is a probability that he will be dangerous in the future.id.at.because penry mitigating evidence,viewed through the lens of future dangerousness,is relevant only as an aggravating factor,i t did not allow the jury to consider a major thrust of penry evidence as mitigating evidence.id.at.quoting penry lynaugh,cir.
although the court did not expressly use the words full effect in penry i,its reasoning makes clear that full effect is what it meant.see,penry i,at.in the absence of jury instructions defining deliberately in a way that would clearly direct the jury to consider fully penry mitigating evidence as it bears on his personal culpability,we can not be sure that the jury was able to give effect to the mitigating evidence of penry mental retardation and history of abuse in answering the first special issue.emphasis added id.at.penry argues that those assurances were not fulfilled in his particular case because,without appropriate instructions,the jury could not fully consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence of his mental retardation and abused childhood in rendering its sentencing decision.further,even the dissent in penry i recognized that the court was applying a standard 
that the constitutionality turns on whether the questions allow mitigating factors not only to be considered and,of course,given effect in answering the questions,but also to be given effect in all possible ways,including ways that the questions do not permit.what the court means by fully consider what it must mean to distinguish jurek is to consider for all purposes,including purposes not specifically permitted by the questions.
penry i,at.scalia,dissenting citation omitted.thus there can be no doubt that the penry i court applied a standard requiring the jury to be able to give full consideration and full effect to a defendant mitigating evidence.
the state contends that the full effect language in penry i and its progeny is merely dicta,because it would otherwise overrule jurek however,this argument mischaracterizes the holding in jurek,which upheld only the facial validity of the texas special issues scheme.see jurek,at.stating that the constitutionality of the texas procedures turns on whether the enumerated questions allow consideration of particularized mitigating factors,but also noting that it is as yet undetermined whether or not the jury consideration of the special issues would properly include consideration of mitigating circumstances in every situation.the penry i court holding was a application of jurek,which expressly left room for challenges.see penry i,at.b oth the concurrence and the dissent understood jurek as resting fundamentally on the express assurance that the special issues would permit the jury to fully consider all the mitigating evidence a defendant introduced that was relevant to the defendant background and character and to the circumstances of the offense.that jurek involved only a facial challenge to the texas statute is apparent not only from the court decision in penry i,holding the texas statute unconstitutional as applied,but also from the court decisions in challenges to the constitutionality of the death penalty procedures in other states.as discussed above,the supreme court upheld facial challenges to the death penalty procedures in georgia and florida at the same time that it upheld the facial challenge to the texas statute.see gregg georgia,d proffitt florida,d.nevertheless,
after gregg and proffitt and prior to franklin,the court held unconstitutional specific applications of the same georgia and florida statutes it earlier had approved.see godfrey georgia,d vague and overly broad construction of aggravating factor rendered deathsentence unconstitutional hitchcock dugger,d,holding it unconstitutional to restrict jury consideration of mitigating factors to those enumerated in the statute.
johnson texas,d,dissenting.further,applying the and standard does not require overruling jurek,because some types of mitigating evidence can be fully considered by the sentencer in the absence of special jury instructions.penry i,at.citing franklin lynaugh,at.plurality opinion franklin lynaugh,at,concurring in judgment see also graham collins,d souter,dissenting explaining that the petitioner evidence of v oluntary chores for and church attendance with a relative,and supplying some level of support for his children could be considered through the special issue.the constitution requires a court to determine whether the special issues as applied enable the sentencer to give full consideration and full effect to the capital defendant mitigating evidence the standard is has never with the holding in jurek.
graham collins and johnson texas 
after penry i,the court addressed in graham,d,and johnson,d,two more challenges to the texas special issues sentencing scheme,both of which denied relief to petitioners who claimed that the special issues failed to give effect to the mitigating evidence of their youth.in graham,the court held that teague barred it from granting relief to a habeas petitioner who lodged a penry challenge to his death sentence,which became final in.the petitioner argued that the texas special issues did not give constitutionally adequate effect to his mitigating evidence of good character and youth.because the court disposed of the case on teague grounds,it did not address the substantive merits of the petitioner penry claim instead,it considered whether granting the petitioner requested relief would have constituted a new rule at the time the petitioner sentence became final in,holding that 
even if penry reasonably could be read to suggest that graham mitigating evidence was not adequately considered under the former texas procedures,that is not the relevant inquiry under teague.rather,the determinative question is whether reasonable jurists reading the case law that existed in could have concluded that graham sentencing was not constitutionally infirm.we can not say that all reasonable jurists would have deemed themselves compelled to accept graham claim in the ruling graham seeks,therefore,would be a new rule under teague.
later that term,in johnson,d,the court considered a similar challenge on direct review.in johnson,the only mitigating evidence that the petitioner offered was that of his youth at the time he committed the crime.the court noted that,unlike other mitigating evidence that the court had considered in previous cases,t he relevance of youth as a mitigating factor derives from the fact that the signature qualities of youth are transient as individuals mature,the impetuousness and recklessness that may dominate in younger years can subside.id.at.emphasis added.given these unique characteristics of youth,the court held that this evidence did not lie beyond the reach of the sentencer applying the texas special issues because there is ample room in the assessment of future dangerousness for a juror to take account of the difficulties of youth as a mitigating force in the sentencing determination.id.the court applied the standard set forth in boyde california,d,to determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.johnson,at.quoting boyde,at.although the reasonable likelihood standard does not require that the defendant prove that it was more likely than not that the jury was prevented from giving effect to the evidence,the standard requires more than a mere possibility of such a bar.id.the court,again emphasizing the unique qualities of youth as a mitigating factor,distinguished penry i,noting that u nlike penry mental retardation,which rendered him unable to learn from his mistakes,the ill effects of youth that a defendant may experience are subject to change and,as a result,are readily comprehended as a mitigating factor in consideration of the second special issue.johnson,at.further,unlike the evidence of mental retardation at issue in penry i,a juror consideration of the impact of youth on the petitioner conduct is not independent of an assessment of personal culpability if any jurors believed that the transient qualities of petitioner youth made him less culpable for the murder,there is no reasonable likelihood that those jurors would have deemed themselves foreclosed from considering that in evaluating petitioner future dangerousness.id.at.thus graham and johnson stand for the proposition that youth,which is different in kind and in mitigating effect from penry evidence of mental retardation and abusive childhood,can be fully considered and given effect through the sentencing scheme.
in penry ii,d,justice kennedy,the author of johnson,joined the majority,and the court reaffirmed that the standard is full effect,once again invalidating the application of the texas special issues to penry mitigating evidence of mental retardation and abusive upbringing.after the court vacated penry death sentence in penry i,the state of texas retried penry,who was again found guilty of capital murder and sentenced to death.during the sentencing phase of the second trial,the court submitted the same special issues to the jury that were the focus of penry i,only this time the court also provided a supplemental nullification instruction.this instruction directed the jury to consider the effect of all of the mitigating evidence on penry personal culpability,and,
i f you determine,when giving effect to the mitigating evidence,if any,that a life sentence,as reflected by a negative finding to the issue under consideration,rather than a death sentence,is an appropriate response to penry personal culpability,a negative finding should be given to one of the special issues.
the court,fully aware of the analytical constraints imposed by the deferential aedpa standard of review,held that the texas court of criminal appeals had unreasonably applied the holding of penry i when it held that the special issues and the nullification instruction were constitutionally adequate vehicles to give effect to penry mitigating evidence.justice,writing for the court,stated 
the key under penry i is that the jury be able to consider and give effect to a defendant mitigating evidence in imposing sentence,at,d emphasis added.see also johnson texas,d,dissenting a sentencer must be allowed to give full consideration and full effect to mitigating circumstances emphasis in original.for it is only when the jury is given a vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response to that evidence in rendering its sentencing decision,penry i,at,that we can be sure that the jury has treated the defendant as a uniquely individual human being and has made a reliable determination that death is the appropriate sentence,at.quoting woodson north carolina,d.
penry ii,at.as the court held in penry i,the deliberateness and issues were not broad enough to provide a vehicle that allowed the jury to express its reasoned moral response to the full mitigating impact of all of the evidence neither was the state attempted nullification sufficient,because it made the jury charge as a whole internally contradictory and placed jurors in an impossible situation.id.at.under this scheme,there was still at the very least,a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevent ed the consideration of penry mental retardation and childhood abuse.id.quoting boyde,at.because the state failed to define either special issue in a way that would clearly direct the jury to consider fully penry mitigating evidence as it bears on his personal culpability,the texas scheme was still unconstitutional as applied to penry mitigating evidence,and the texas court of criminal appeals conclusion otherwise was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.penry ii,at.emphasis added.
tennard dretke and smith texas 
the supreme court decision in tennard,in light of which this court must assess nelson penry claim,reaffirms that a jury can not be precluded from giving full effect to a defendant mitigating evidence and leaves no doubt that this standard was in effect at the time that nelson conviction became final the supreme court handed down tennard on june,reversing a panel of this court that had applied the aforementioned test to deny a coa on a inmate petition for habeas relief on penry grounds.the court explained that the petitioner,who argued that the texas special issues sentencing scheme did not enable the sentencer to give full effect to his mitigating evidence of impaired intellectual functioning and low score,was entitled to a coa,and that the lower courts had erred by applying the fifth circuit test.
specifically,the supreme court excoriated the fifth circuit for invoking its own restrictive gloss on the court penry i decision,uniformly applying to penry claims a standard that has no foundation in the decisions of this court.tennard,at.the court then reiterated that the standard in a capital in any other a low one 
when we addressed directly the relevance standard applicable to mitigating evidence in capital cases in mckoy north carolina,d,we spoke in the most expansive terms.we established that the meaning of relevance is no different in the context of mitigating evidence introduced in a capital sentencing proceeding than in any other context,and thus the general evidentiary standard any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence applies.id.at.quoting new jersey,d thus,a state can not bar the consideration of evidence if the sentencer could reasonably find that it warrants a sentence less than death.at.
tennard,at.
then,o nce this low threshold for relevance is met,the eighth amendment requires that the jury be able to consider and give effect to a capital defendant mitigating evidence.id.at.quoting boyde california,d citing lockett ohio,d eddings oklahoma,d penry i,d see also payne tennessee,d we have held that a state can not preclude the sentencer from considering any relevant mitigating evidence that the defendant proffers in support of a sentence less than death v irtually no limits are placed on the relevant mitigating evidence a capital defendant may introduce concerning his own circumstances.quoting eddings,at.
the court emphasized that,in assessing the relevance of mitigating evidence,a reviewing court should not weigh the severity or sufficiency of the evidence,except 
insofar as evidence of a trivial feature of the defendant character or the circumstances of the crime is unlikely to have any tendency to mitigate the defendant culpability.see skipper south carolina,d we do not hold that all facets of the defendant ability to adjust to prison life must be treated as relevant and potentially mitigating.for example,we have no quarrel with the statement that how often the defendant will take a shower is irrelevant to the sentencing determination.however,to say that only those features and circumstances that a panel of federal appellate judges deems to be severe let alone uniquely severe could have such a tendency is incorrect.rather,the question is simply whether the evidence is of such a character that it might serve as a basis for a sentence less than death,skipper,at.
tennard,at.
the court concluded 
the fifth circuit screening test has no basis in our precedents and,indeed,is inconsistent with the standard we have adopted for relevance in the capital sentencing context.we therefore hold that the fifth circuit assessed tennard penry claim under an improper legal standard.cockrell,d holding,on certiorari review of the denial of a coa,that the fifth circuit had applied an incorrect standard by improperly merging the requirements of two statutory sections.
tennard,at.
although the decision in tennard principally focused on rejecting the standard,the court also indicated that tennard evidence may have had relevance beyond the scope of the special issues,and that a jury might have been precluded from giving effect to that aspect of tennard mitigating evidence.the court explained that a coa should have issued because 
t he relationship between the special issues and tennard low iq evidence has the same essential features as the relationship between the special issues and penry mental retardation evidence.impaired intellectual functioning has mitigating dimension beyond the impact it has on the individual ability to act deliberately.see penry i,at.a reasonable jurist could conclude that the jury might well have given tennard low iq evidence aggravating effect in considering his future dangerousness 
in its most recent pronouncement on the penry issue,the supreme court in smith texas,d,once again reiterated that,to comply with the eighth amendment,a capital sentencing scheme must give full effect to all of a defendant mitigating evidence.in a per curiam opinion issued shortly after tennard,the court reversed the texas court of criminal appeals denial of state habeas relief,holding that the texas special issues and a supplemental nullification instruction similar to the one at issue in penry ii did not give full effect to the petitioner mitigating evidence of the petitioner learning disabilities low scores and childhood abuse and troubled upbringing.
first,the court held that,in light of tennard,the texas court of criminal appeals erred when it relied on the fifth circuit test to dispose of the petitioner penry claim.second,the court held that,under its precedent,the texas court of criminal appeals erred when it held that the special issues and nullification instruction gave sufficient mitigating effect to the petitioner mitigating evidence.the court,reviewing its case law,stressed that i n penry johnson,d penry ii,we held a similar nullification instruction constitutionally inadequate because it did not allow the jury to give full consideration and full effect to mitigating circumstances in choosing the defendant appropriate sentence.id.at.quoting johnson texas,d,dissenting.smith,at.the smith court therefore once again reaffirmed that the standard is full consideration and full effect.
the state contention that smith and penry ii are inapposite to the instant case because they involved a nullification instruction is not well taken.as we explained above,the nullification instruction was not an adequate solution to the problem the court identified in penry,that the jurors could not give penry mitigating evidence full effect through the special issues.penry ii,at.t he key under penry i is that the jury be able to consider and give effect to a defendant mitigating evidence in imposing sentence.emphasis and alteration in original quoting penry i,at.accordingly,the focus of our inquiry is not whether there was a nullification instruction,but whether the procedure,whatever it was,allowed the jury to express its reasoned moral response to the defendant mitigating evidence.see id.and the standard for making that determination is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the procedure precluded the jury from giving full consideration and full effect to the defendant mitigating evidence.
this review of the relevant supreme court case law therefore establishes that,at the time nelson conviction became final in,the clearly established law as announced by the supreme court was a standard.the penry ii court left no doubt that full effect was the applicable standard,or that this was the standard that applied in penry i.the debate has long since been over.today,we make clear that we are following the supreme court directive and applying the standard it articulated,whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the special issues precluded the jury from giving full consideration and full effect to the defendant mitigating evidence,including evidence that has mitigating relevance outside the scope of the special issues because it speaks to a defendant moral culpability.this standard was dictated by the supreme court earlier decisions in eddings and lockett,see penry i,at,and graham and johnson are not to the contrary.moreover,the court most recent decisions in tennard and smith reaffirm that this standard was clearly established federal law at the time nelson conviction became final.accordingly,we turn to the question presented in this the state court determination that the texas scheme was constitutional as applied in nelson case was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established law as announced by the supreme court.
application of clearly established federal law to nelson case 
the texas court of criminal appeals concluded that the special issues were constitutional as applied to nelson.because there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury was precluded from giving full effect to nelson mitigating evidence,we hold that the texas court of criminal appeals determination was an unreasonable application of clearly established law as announced by the supreme court.

the parties agree that,at the punishment phase of the trial,nelson presented the following mitigating evidence of an abusive childhood substance abuse troubled relationships with his brother and with women having had a child out of wedlock with whom he was not permitted to have a relationship and a mental disorder.specifically,nelson offered the testimony of his father,who described in great detail the emotional abuse and rejection that nelson suffered at the hands of his mother while he was growing up.nelson father explained that nelson was the second of two boys,and nelson mother,who had always wanted a girl,rejected nelson from birth,refusing to care for him,change him or feed him or anything.after nelson parents separated when nelson was fourteen years old,his mother completely abandoned him,leaving and refusing to take him with her.
nelson also presented testimony from john hickman,a psychiatrist who personally interviewed and assessed nelson.hickman testified extensively about the symptoms of borderline personality disorder,which can manifest themselves in psychotic outburst s and a lack of impulse control.according to hickman,a person with borderline personality disorder has little insight into his own illness and may periodically go through an outburst of feelings which can become very violent,very destructive,even though he exhibits normal behavior to percent of the time.hickman noted that nelson in particular experiences a lot of impulse and a lot of raw energy and anger that he has no insight into whatsoever as a result of his borderline personality disorder.
he further explained that borderline personality disorder can be especially severe in cases of maternal abandonment,and,in this case,nelson abusive upbringing and rejection by his mother engendered a rage toward women that was evidenced by the nature of the crime that he committed.hickman observed that nelson borderline personality disorder was a consequence of growing up in a home where nelson did not learn to control his anger and where he was subjected to psychologically abusive treatment by his mother,who told him that he could do anything right and that she did want him.in hickman judgment,at the time he committed the crime,nelson had a psychotic outburst and was under the influence of either a mental or physical form of duress resulting from his physical and psychological makeup.hickman also stated that,in addition to being psychologically abused by his mother,nelson had some family history which indicates disregard and abuse for women and that it is almost as if he is trained to be that way.additionally,hickman noted that nelson substance abuse likely exacerbated the effects of nelson borderline personality disorder,describing eruptive episodes,generally influenced by alcohol or cocaine,where all that primitive impulse comes out,which were guaranteed to be.in sum,hickman observed that nelson has a morass of anger,hostility,given the combination of a borderline personality,given stress factors,given alcohol,given cocaine,all hell is going to break loose with him.
although hickman testified that borderline personality disorder can be treated in some cases,he indicated that borderline personality disorder is difficult to treat because persons with borderline personality disorder do not want to admit they are weak and vulnerable and often refuse to undergo therapy.hickman estimated that in nelson case,it could take at least a year just to break down nelson defenses and convince him to participate in treatment after that,nelson would require long i talking about two to five years.that is standard for borderline.and medication.hickman emphasized that this intensive psychotherapy would require two or three times a week with a therapist that can work with him in addition to the proper drug medication and a strict environment where nelson could learn internal controls.hickman noted that,even with such treatment,he could not guarantee nelson success,and if he does get treatment,i think we can predict dangerousness.
the special issues as applied to nelson mitigating evidence 
as a threshold matter,the state contends that penry and its progeny apply only to a very narrow set of cases in which the mitigating evidence is,has both aggravating and mitigating effect,and the special issue gives the evidence only aggravating effect.thus,according to the state,a penry analysis in this case is not necessary.we disagree.the supreme court has never limited the applicability of explicitly or cases involving mitigating evidence.in penry i,the court observation that penry evidence of mental illness was was just one of many reasons that the special issues were inadequate vehicles to give penry evidence full mitigating effect it was not the determining factor.see penry i,at.listing the sword nature of penry evidence as one of a number of reasons that the issue could not give penry evidence full mitigating effect.justice dissent in johnson explains that placing too much weight on the court description of penry evidence as mischaracterizes the penry i court reasoning 
the second special issue was not inadequate because evidence worked only against penry it was inadequate because it did not allow the jury to give full effect to penry mitigating evidence.penry,at.our discussion of the third special the defendant conduct was unreasonable in response to the focused on the inability of a juror to express the view that penry lacked the moral culpability to be sentenced to death in answering the question.id.at.the point of penry is clear a death sentence resulting from application of the texas special issues can not be upheld unless the jurors are able to consider fully a defendant mitigating evidence.accord,id.at.scalia,concurring in part and dissenting in part the court today holds that the constitutionality turns on whether the special questions allow mitigating factors not only to be considered,but also to be given effect in all possible ways,including ways that the questions do not permit.
see johnson,at,dissenting.indeed,chief justice rehnquist dissented from the court decision in tennard arguing that tennard evidence was not.tennard,at.in either to penry evidence could be given mitigating effect in the second special issue.in short,low intelligence is not the same as mental retardation and does not necessarily create the penry i sword.a majority of the court declined to accept that argument in tennard and,therefore,we can not accept it here.
further,the court has indicated that penry at least potentially could cases involving evidence that is not.see,smith,d reversing the state court denial of habeas relief because the special issues could not give full effect to mitigating evidence of low and troubled upbringing tennard,d holding that habeas petitioner was entitled to a coa on his penry claim based on mitigating evidence of low and impaired intellectual functioning.in short,the state urges this court to wrench one component of the court reasoning in penry i out of context and use it as a dispositive screening test in our assessment of penry claims.in effect,the state asks this court to develop another restrictive gloss on penry i,similar to the test that the court struck down in tennard.tennard,at.the court has never used the consideration of whether evidence is as a screening test as the state urges us to do and,given the court strong admonition in tennard,we decline to do so.consequently,we turn now to the state alternative argument that nelson evidence could be adequately considered through the two special issues.
deliberateness special issue 
nelson mitigating evidence of borderline personality disorder and abandonment by his mother had relevance beyond the scope of the deliberateness special issue.as the supreme court observed in penry i,a reasonable juror could have concluded that,while the murder was deliberate,nelson was less morally culpable as a result of his borderline personality disorder and abusive childhood than a murderer without such a mental illness and similar upbringing might have been.see penry i,at.see also skipper south carolina,d powell,concurring in judgment stating that evidence concerning a defendant emotional history bear s directly on the fundamental justice of imposing capital punishment.because a major mitigating thrust of evidence of a mental disorder and an abusive childhood is that such afflictions could reduce an offender moral culpability,it is reasonably likely that a juror would not have been able to give full effect to his reasoned moral judgment regarding the full mitigating impact of nelson evidence through the narrowly worded deliberateness instruction.see,penry ii,at.penry i,at.significantly,the supreme court has never held that the deliberateness issue alone is broad enough to give full effect to mitigating evidence that also bears on a defendant moral culpability indeed the court most recent opinion in smith texas suggests the contrary.there,the court characterized smith evidence as follows 
he had been diagnosed with potentially organic learning disabilities and speech handicaps at an early age he had a verbal iq score of and a full iq of and,as a result,had been in special education classes throughout most of his time in school despite his low iq and learning disabilities,his behavior at school was often exemplary his father was a drug addict who was involved with gang violence and other criminal activities,and regularly stole money from family members to support a drug addiction and he was only when he committed the crime.
smith,at.considering the nature of this evidence,the court noted that,just as in penry ii,the burden of proof on the state was tied by law to findings of deliberateness and future dangerousness that had little,if anything,to do with the mitigation evidence petitioner presented.id.at.likewise,nelson mitigating evidence had relevance beyond the deliberateness special issue insofar as it bore on his moral culpability for the crime.consequently,although the jury may have been able to give partial effect to this evidence through the deliberateness special issue,there is a reasonable likelihood that it was unable to give full effect to this evidence,because it had relevance beyond whether nelson acted deliberately.
special issue 
likewise,the special issue can not give nelson evidence full mitigating effect.the jury heard conflicting evidence about the treatability of nelson borderline personality disorder and about the efficacy of any possible treatment.according to the expert testimony,even assuming that nelson borderline personality disorder were treatable,success would depend on many factors.based on this evidence,the jury could have easily concluded that it was unlikely that nelson would successfully complete treatment.the state expert,grigson,testified that there was insufficient information to make a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder,but repeatedly emphasized that in his opinion there is no question whatsoever that nelson will commit future acts of danger.in contrast,nelson expert,hickman,diagnosed nelson with borderline personality disorder.he further testified that,with treatment consisting of incarceration,two to five years of intensive psychotherapy two to three times a week,medication,and refraining from drug and alcohol abuse,nelson may not be continuing threat.he opined that if nelson did not receive treatment,he would pose a danger to society.he also explained that the last thing a borderline wants to do is admit they are weak and vulnerable,and thus borderline patients often resist treatment.indeed,in its own closing,the state emphasized the strong possibility that nelson would not receive the treatment he needed to keep his borderline personality disorder in check,and even if he did receive such treatment,there were no guarantees that the therapy would be effective to prevent future violence 
hickman said,if,if,if,if he is imprisoned long enough,if he undergoes psychotherapy,if he chooses to take his medication,and if he leaves dope and alcohol alone,then maybe,maybe he wo be a future danger.look at special issue number two,ladies and gentlemen.there is not an asterisk next to that,there is not something referring you down here that says if,if,if,if.we look at the defendant right now,and right now even their witness said,yes,he may be a danger.
based on the expert testimony at trial,the jury might have concluded that nelson could be treated,and therefore,it could have given some effect to this mitigating evidence within the context of the special issue.but if the jury concluded that the condition was not treatable or that treatment was improbable,as the state argued,it would necessarily have to answer yes to the special issue.just as in penry i and penry ii,it is likely that a juror considering nelson evidence of borderline personality disorder would have felt that he could give the evidence only one possible effect via the issue such a juror would have seen the evidence as only aggravating,because nelson borderline personality disorder and the difficulty of treating it increase the likelihood that nelson will act out violently again.consequently,there would be no vehicle to give mitigating effect to his evidence of borderline personality disorder,no way for the jury to express its conclusion that even though he is likely to be dangerous in the future,his mental illness makes him unworthy of the death penalty.penry i,at.a reasonable juror could well have believed that there was no vehicle for expressing the view that penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death based upon his mitigating evidence.and,also similar to penry i,the jury was likely precluded from interpreting the issue in a way that gave effect to the major mitigating thrust of the evidence,that it tends to lessen nelson moral culpability for the crime.see penry i,at.
the state and the dissenting opinions of chief judge jones and judge owen argue that the evidence at issue here is more comparable to the evidence of youth at issue in johnson and graham.specifically,they contend that,because borderline personality disorder can be a transient condition like youth,a jury could believe that nelson would be less dangerous in the future,thereby giving full mitigating effect to the evidence.we disagree.this argument erroneously analogizes evidence of youth and evidence of mental illness.the supreme court in johnson held that the issue could give effect to both mitigating aspects of of future violent behavior and moral to the uniquely transient nature of youth.see johnson,at.the relevance of youth as a mitigating factor derives from the fact that the signature qualities of youth are transient as individuals mature,the impetuousness and recklessness that may dominate in younger years can subside t here is ample room in the assessment of future dangerousness for a juror to take account of the difficulties of youth as a mitigating force in the sentencing determination.see also eddings,at.y outh is more than a chronological fact.it is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage.in this sense,the supreme court,which has never endorsed the extension of johnson and graham to treatable mental illness,has treated youth as sui generis,because it is a condition that is certain to pass in contrast,as acknowledged by nelson own expert witness,there was no guarantee that nelson borderline personality disorder would diminish over time.hickman noted that,although borderline personality disorder is treatable,success is by no means certain and is expressly conditioned on intensive therapy that,a juror could conclude,the texas prison system is unlikely to provide.in fact,hickman trial testimony indicated that,because of the severity of borderline personality disorder and patients common resistance to therapy,successful treatment is often the exception rather than the rule.unlike a jury considering evidence of youth,therefore,a reasonable likelihood existed that a jury considering nelson mitigating evidence of borderline personality disorder would have felt foreclosed from giving full mitigating effect to nelson evidence of his disorder via the issue.thus,based on the principles announced in penry i and its progeny,the special issue,like the deliberateness special issue,provided a constitutionally insufficient vehicle to allow a jury to express its reasoned moral response and give full effect to nelson mitigating evidence.the texas court of criminal appeals holding to the contrary is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as announced by the supreme court.
this is not simply a matter of disagreement with the state court conclusion that the jury could consider and give effect to nelson mitigating evidence through the sentencing scheme.we are mindful that under aedpa a federal court may not grant habeas relief simply because it disagrees with the state court resolution of an issue it may grant relief only if the state court decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent.see d.indeed,chief judge jones dissent invokes this standard,asserting that our approach to the issue improperly relies upon a string of hypotheticals to create a penry violation and adopts an attenuated theory of the jury deliberations that extends penry i far beyond its intended boundaries.chief judge jones dissent at see also judge owen dissent.but rather than extending the reach of penry i or any other case in violation of the aedpa standard of review,our approach merely follows the supreme court longstanding directive to determine only whether the evidence is of such a character that it might serve as a basis for a sentence less than death,which was clearly established federal law at the time that nelson conviction became final.tennard,at.quoting skipper,at.emphasis added.
in contrast,the alternative approach,upon which the dissenting opinions of chief judge jones and judge owen base their conclusions that the texas court of criminal appeals did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law,would require us,sitting as a federal appellate habeas court,to weigh the evidence presented at sentencing in a manner that the supreme court in tennard held was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law at least as far back as.see id.at.like nelson case,tennard reached the supreme court on federal habeas review and was governed by the aedpa standard.as noted above,we measure clearly established federal law for aedpa purposes as of the date that the defendant conviction became final.while tennard conviction became final in,nelson conviction did not become final until.see supra note.therefore,the principles that the supreme court in tennard held had been clearly established in were certainly clearly established by the time that nelson conviction became final in.although chief judge jones and judge owen correctly recite the aedpa standard in their dissenting opinions,they simply fail to accept that stood for the propositions that a reviewing court may not reweigh or reassess the mitigating evidence presented at sentencing,and a jury must be able to give effect to the impact of that mitigating evidence on the defendant moral culpability via the special set forth the federal law that was clearly established for the purposes of nelson case.
specifically,the dissenting opinions of chief judge jones and judge owen run afoul of tennard by assuming that the jury in nelson case found that nelson borderline personality disorder was treatable,and that the texas court of criminal appeals would therefore not have acted unreasonably in treating it as akin to the mitigating evidence of youth at issue in graham and johnson.however,we know from the record only that the jury determined that nelson was a future danger after hearing conflicting expert testimony about whether he suffered from borderline personality disorder and,if so,whether it could be treated.despite the purportedly definitive reading of the record contained in chief judge jones dissent,we can not be certain of the precise reasons for the jury determination.instead,we know that the jury could have arrived at its conclusion for any of the following reasons the jury believed that nelson suffered from borderline personality disorder but that the disorder was not treatable the jury believed that nelson suffered from borderline personality disorder that was treatable but that some other factor rendered nelson a future danger or the jury did not believe that nelson actually suffered from borderline personality disorder.to conclude that the mental illness at issue was treatable in the face of these multiple possibilities,the dissenting opinions of chief judge jones and judge owen reassess and reweigh the evidence presented at sentencing,even though we,sitting as a federal appellate habeas court,have no way of knowing why the jury determined that nelson was a future danger 
weighing the evidence in this manner violates the supreme court express admonition in tennard that we not substitute our own interpretation of the evidence for that of the jury or assess the strength of the mitigating evidence presented except insofar as evidence of a trivial feature of the defendant character or the circumstances of the crime is unlikely to have any tendency to mitigate the defendant culpability.tennard,at.just as the supreme court in penry i made no determination as to whether the jury actually believed that penry was mentally retarded based on the conflicting trial evidence,we may not conduct an independent review of the conflicting evidence in this case to make a determination as to whether the jury actually believed that nelson mental illness was treatable.in short,under tennard,which clarified the clearly established law in this area as of,we may not graft a treatability test based on our view of the strength of the evidence onto the low relevance threshold as the dissenting opinions of chief judge jones and judge owen propose,and neither may the texas court of criminal appeals.rather,the only question we may ask regarding the jury interpretation of the mitigating evidence presented at trial is simply whether the evidence is of such a character that it might serve as a basis for a sentence less than death.id.at.quoting skipper,at.emphasis added.
further,the supreme court has made it clear in boyde and in johnson both issued before nelson conviction became final that once the low relevance threshold is satisfied,rather than inquiring into or second guessing the jury interpretation of the trial evidence,all a court must determine is whether a reasonable likelihood exists that the jury applied the instructions in a manner that precluded it from giving effect to the defendant mitigating evidence as it pertains to the defendant moral culpability.in the instant case,given the conflicting testimony regarding the treatability of nelson mental illness,there is certainly a reasonable likelihood that the jury felt precluded from giving full effect to the impact of the evidence on nelson moral culpability via the issue because it found that nelson illness could not be treated.see johnson,at.explaining that the boyde reasonable likelihood standard does not require that the defendant prove that it was more likely than not that the jury was prevented from giving effect to the evidence.
therefore,rather than extend ing penry i far beyond its intended boundaries,without instructions from the supreme court,chief judge jones dissent at,our approach is firmly grounded in supreme court precedent and consistent with the aedpa standard of review.the alternative upon which the dissenting opinions of chief judge jones and judge owen rely to affirm the state court denial of habeas relief in this we scour the trial record for evidence of treatability and substitute our interpretation of the evidence for that of the jury is not merely incorrect,but is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as announced by the supreme court.see tennard,at.see also smith,at.penry ii,at.penry i,at.skipper,at.
this case is therefore different from the supreme court recent decision in brown payton,d,which judge clement discusses in her dissenting opinion.in payton,the supreme court reversed the ninth circuit grant of habeas relief to a petitioner who challenged the constitutionality of california factor k jury instruction,concluding that the ninth circuit did not give proper deference to the state court decision.specifically,the court held that i t was not unreasonable for the state court to determine that the jury most likely believed that the evidence in mitigation,while within the reach of the factor k instruction,was simply too insubstantial to overcome the arguments for imposing the death penalty.id.emphasis added.in payton,the state court held that the mitigating evidence of the defendant religious conversion fell within the reach of the instruction directing the jury to consider a ny other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime,although the prosecutor argued to the jury that it could not consider this evidence.payton,at.alteration in original quoting code ann.west.in reversing the ninth circuit determination that the state court erred in denying habeas relief,the supreme court emphasized that the state court holding was a reasonable interpretation of its prior decision in boyde,d,in which the court upheld the validity of the factor k instruction in similar circumstances.see payton,at.as the california supreme court recognized,like in boyde,for the jury to have believed it could not consider payton mitigation evidence,it would have had to believe that the penalty phase served virtually no purpose at all.accordingly,the ninth circuit had deviated from the deferential aedpa standard when it reversed the state court determination.
nevertheless,judge clement dissenting opinion,which relies on payton to conclude that this court should defer to the texas court of criminal appeals denial of habeas relief,fails to recognize that t he aedpa standard is demanding but not insatiable d eference does not by definition preclude relief.dretke,d third alteration in original quoting cockrell,d.in contrast to the circumstances at issue in payton,nelson mitigating evidence clearly has relevance beyond the issues of deliberateness and future dangerousness under penry i and its progeny.if the jury concluded that nelson was likely to be dangerous in the future based on his mental disorder and abusive childhood,but also concluded that this evidence rendered him less morally culpable,it had no way to give effect to the mitigating aspect of that evidence through the two special issues.see smith,at.tennard,at.penry ii,at.penry i,at.moreover,tennard precludes a reviewing court from reweighing the evidence presented at trial to determine whether the alleged mitigating circumstance is treatable and therefore transient.tennard,at.thus,unlike the state court determination in payton,where the supreme court in boyde had previously held that the challenged california instruction was broad enough to allow the jury to consider the impact of the mitigating evidence on the defendant moral culpability,it was unreasonable for the texas court of criminal appeals in this case to conclude that nelson mitigating evidence was within the reach of the jury through the narrow special issues,given the law clearly established by the supreme court in penry i and its progeny.
finally,in support of its argument that evidence of a potentially treatable mental disorder should be analyzed similarly to the court consideration of youth,the state relies on fifth circuit case law that has erroneously interpreted penry as requiring that the mitigating evidence be given only some effect.specifically,it relies on this court opinion in lucas johnson,cir,in which the panel held that the special issues gave constitutionally sufficient effect to lucas evidence of schizophrenia coupled with a troubled upbringing.see id.at the prospect of medical treatment placed the evidence of his mental illness and abusive childhood within the effective reach of the sentencer as a potential mitigating factor with respect to the second issue,that is,the jury could have considered whether,in an institutional setting,the probability that lucas posed as a future danger to society was not so great as to merit imposition of the death sentence.in reaching this conclusion,lucas cited the supreme court decisions in johnson and graham for the proposition that penry application has since been limited to that narrow class of situations in which the petitioner mitigating evidence was placed beyond the jury effective reach,and that the evidence in that case was within the jury effective reach,because the jury could have given it partial effect.id.at.as explained above,the supreme court has clearly held that the standard is full effect.thus,continued reliance on the methodology is erroneous,because that standard fails to take into account,as penry i and its progeny require,a jury inability to give mitigating effect to a defendant moral culpability via the issue.see smith,at.tennard,at.penry ii,at.penry i,at.moreover,and most importantly,aedpa requires us to determine whether the state court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law as announced by the supreme court,not by the fifth circuit.d.accordingly,to the extent that this court cases have applied a standard to penry claims in the past,to the extent that past cases failed to account for the jury ability to give effect to the impact of mitigating evidence on a defendant moral culpability via the special issues,those cases were based on an erroneous interpretation of supreme court precedent.see smith,at.holding that a sentencing scheme that fails to give full consideration and full effect to mitigating circumstances in choosing the defendant appropriate sentence is constitutionally inadequate under penry i and its progeny internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
sufficiency of nelson mitigation evidence 
we also reject the argument that nelson evidence of borderline personality disorder is insufficient to warrant relief based on penry.the supreme court has recognized that 
gravity has a place in the relevance analysis,insofar as evidence of a trivial feature of the defendant character or the circumstances of the crime is unlikely to have any tendency to mitigate the defendant culpability.see skipper south carolina,d we do not hold that all facets of the defendant ability to adjust to prison life must be treated as relevant and potentially mitigating.for example,we have no quarrel with the statement that how often the defendant will take a shower is irrelevant to the sentencing determination.
tennard,at.the tennard court was discussing evidence that had no probative worth in the jury consideration of a defendant moral culpability,not evidence that the jury may choose to believe or disbelieve.in contrast,the strength of nelson evidence of borderline personality disorder and abusive childhood goes to the credibility of nelson mitigation evidence,which should be judged by the jury in answering effective supplemental instructions addressing the mitigation evidence.blue cockrell,cir,abrogated on other grounds by tennard,d.further,any argument that this court should dispose of nelson penry claim on grounds that the evidence is insufficient endorses precisely the type of judicial that the court in tennard expressly warned against 
t o say that only those features and circumstances that a panel of federal appellate judges deems to be severe let alone uniquely severe could have such a tendency is incorrect.rather,the question is simply whether the evidence is of such a character that it might serve as a basis for a sentence less than death,skipper,at.
tennard,at.nowhere does tennard prescribe or even allow for a balancing test that weighs the strength of the mitigating evidence against that of the aggravating evidence.such reasoning runs afoul of the low relevance standard that the court emphasized in tennard,any tendency to mitigate the defendant culpability,and comes perilously close to applying a test similar to the one that the court struck down in tennard.accordingly,we also reject this argument.
harmless error 
finally,we reject the state argument that any penry error in this case is subject to analysis under brecht abrahamson,d,which applies to error that is amenable to analysis because it may be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine the effect it had on the trial.id.at.omission and alteration in original quoting arizona fulminante,d.the state advances this theory for the very first time on en banc rehearing in a discussion that consumes less than a page of its brief it did not argue the applicability of harmless error before this court during nelson original habeas appeal,before the supreme court on certiorari review,or before this court when we initially reconsidered nelson habeas appeal on remand in light of tennard.it was not until a concurring panel member in the most recent nelson panel opinion suggested that brecht might be applicable that the state argued harmless error in its en banc brief.the state failure to argue this point prior to now is understandable because the supreme court has never applied a analysis to a penry claim or given any indication that harmless error might apply in its long line of cases addressing the jury ability to give full effect to a capital defendant mitigating evidence.see generally tennard,d penry ii,d penry i,d eddings,d lockett,d.indeed,the penry ii court applied the brecht test to penry claim that the prosecution use of a psychiatrist report violated his fifth amendment rights,see penry ii,at.conspicuously absent from the discussion regarding penry eighth amendment claim,however,is any mention of the test in either the majority or the dissenting opinions.
implicit in the court failure to apply harmless error in cases where the jury has been precluded from giving effect to a defendant mitigating evidence is the recognition that a penry error deprives the jury of a vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response to the defendant background,character,and crime,which precludes it from making a reliable determination that death is the appropriate sentence.penry ii,at.quoting penry i,at.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.this reasoned moral judgment that a jury must make in determining whether death is the appropriate sentence differs from those judgments made in response to the special issues.it also differs from those at issue in cases involving defective jury instructions in which the court has found review to be appropriate.neder united states,d applying review where the jury instructions omitted an element of the offense,reasoning that,given the evidence presented,the verdict would have been the same had the jury been properly instructed johnson united states,d applying review where the jury instructions omitted the materiality element of the perjury charge,noting that the error did not warrant correction in light of the overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence supporting materiality.given that the entire premise of the penry line of cases rests on the possibility that the jury reasoned moral response might have been different from its answers to the special issues had it been able to fully consider and give effect to the defendant mitigating evidence,it would be wholly inappropriate for an appellate court,in effect,to substitute its own moral judgment for the jury in these cases.see tennard,at.t o say that only those features and circumstances that a panel of federal appellate judges deems to be severe let alone uniquely severe could have such a tendency to serve as a basis less than death is incorrect.rather,the question is simply whether the evidence is of such a character that it might serve as a basis for a sentence less than death quoting skipper,at.sullivan louisiana,d refusing to apply harmless error where the jury was improperly instructed on the burden of proof at the phase,noting that the essential connection to a beyond a reasonable doubt factual finding can not be made where the instructional error consists of a misdescription of the burden of proof,which vitiates all the jury findings.a reviewing court can only engage in pure view of what a reasonable jury would have done.and when it does that,the wrong entity judge s the defendant guilty quoting rose clark,d.
therefore,given the supreme court refusal to allow an appellate court to substitute its own moral judgment for a moral judgment that the jury was unable to make in a penry case,we decline to do so now 
iii.conclusion 
at the time that nelson conviction became final,the supreme court had clearly established that the relevant inquiry is whether there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury would interpret the texas special issues in a manner that precluded it from fully considering and giving full effect to all of the defendant mitigating evidence.for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury was precluded from giving full consideration and full effect to nelson mitigating evidence via the texas special issues therefore the state court determination that the special issues were constitutional as applied to nelson case was unreasonable.accordingly,we reverse the district court denial of habeas relief and remand with instructions to grant the writ of habeas corpus.
in this case we must decide whether petitioner,billy ray nelson,was sentenced to death in violation of the eighth amendment because the jury was not instructed that it could consider and give effect to his mitigating evidence by deciding between the death penalty or a lesser sentence of life imprisonment.the panel of this court concluded that nelson death penalty must be affirmed,but its members did not agree upon a majority rationale or opinion.chief judge jones issued an opinion concluding that the texas capital sentencing statute as applied to nelson mitigating evidence and case did not violate the eighth amendment and affirming the district court judgment denying nelson federal habeas corpus petition.i filed an opinion concurring in that result,concluding that,under the supreme court decisions in penry lynaugh,d penry i and other cases,because nelson had introduced relevant mitigating evidence of impairment by mental disease,childhood abuse,and chemical abuse and dependency,the state use of the texas statutory scheme to sentence him to death violated his constitutional rights.however,i concluded that under the harmless error test of brecht abrahamson,d,the constitutional violation was harmless error.judge stewart also concurred in the result,but he did not join either opinion or assign reasons.
after rehearing the case en banc,the majority of this court has now decided that the application of the texas statutory capital sentencing scheme to nelson case violated the eighth amendment and that this violation can not be disregarded as harmless error.i join fully in the majority conclusions and agree substantially with its reasons.the majority analysis of nelson penry i claim is similar to that set forth in my separate panel opinions here and in other cases accordingly,i join the majority decision and assign additional reasons hereafter.
on the harmless error issue,i acknowledge my mistake at the panel level in undertaking a harmless error analysis of the constitutional defect in this case.after considering the parties briefs and conducting my own additional research,i now see that the state waived its harmless error argument by not urging it prior to this en banc rehearing and the constitutional deficiency in the capital sentencing mechanism as applied to this case was a structural defect,not a mere constitutional trial error,and therefore can not be subjected to harmless error analysis the reasons for these conclusions are set forth in the final section of this opinion.
the eighth amendment requirement of individualized sentencing obliges states,including texas,to enable capital sentencers to select the appropriate penalty after full consideration of the defendant mitigation evidence.
the supreme court recognition of the constitutional requirements regarding individualized sentencing began in,when the court issued a series of major decisions concerning the constitutionality of the death penalty that altered the fundamentals of the court death penalty jurisprudence these cases dealt with death penalty statutes enacted by various states in response to the supreme court decision in furman georgia,d,which had previously invalidated the death penalty.none of the five cases produced a majority opinion,but several major,enduring principles nevertheless emerged from these cases.first,states can not make the imposition of the death penalty mandatory from any class of crimes.see woodson,at.roberts,at.see also sumner shuman,d.second,state death penalty statutes must limit and guide the sentencer discretion to impose the death penalty in order to prevent its arbitrary and capricious application.see,johnson texas,d in the five cases,the controlling joint opinion of three justices reaffirmed the principle of furman that discretion must be suitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action.quoting gregg,at.third,the capital sentencer must be allowed to consider and give effect to the unique circumstances of the individual defendant and his particular crime when determining the appropriate sentence.see,shuman,at.in the two cases striking down as unconstitutional mandatory statutes,the opinions stressed that one of the fatal flaws in those sentencing procedures was their failure to permit presentation of mitigating circumstances for the consideration of the sentencing authority.these underlying principles have continued to guide the supreme court death penalty jurisprudence.
prior to penry i,and certainly before nelson conviction became final in,the relevant supreme court decisions had clearly established the eighth amendment requirement of individualized sentencing in capital cases.see,mccleskey kemp,d noting that the court has imposed a number of requirements on the capital sentencing process to ensure that capital sentencing decisions rest on the individualized inquiry contemplated in gregg and stating that the constitution limits a state ability to narrow a sentencer discretion to consider relevant evidence that might cause it to decline to impose the death sentence zant stephens,d what is important at the selection stage is an individualized determination on the basis of the character of the individual and the circumstances of the crime.eddings oklahoma,d holding that the capital sentencer may not be prevented from considering any relevant mitigating evidence presented by the defendant bell ohio,d plurality opinion same lockett ohio,d plurality opinion same.that is,in order to constitutionally impose and carry out the death penalty,a capital sentencer must at least be enabled although it need not be instructed to make an individualized assessment of the defendant moral culpability and deathworthiness,based on a full consideration of each defendant mitigating evidence,as well as the character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense and to give full effect to that evidence by selecting the appropriate sentence,either life imprisonment or death,according to each defendant level of moral culpability and deathworthiness.see cole,at dennis,dissenting nelson,at dennis,concurring in the judgment tennard,at dennis,dissenting.
nor is the eighth amendment concern with individual culpability limited to the selection phase rather,the principle that capital punishment must be reserved for the most culpable perpetrators of the most serious crimes is implemented throughout the capital sentencing process.roper simmons,d.indeed,the imperative that only the most culpable offenders be sentenced to death has also long animated the court decisions holding that certain classes of crimes and offenders are categorically ineligible for the death penalty,including persons under the age of at the time of their crime,see id.at.holding that reduced culpability of juveniles demonstrate s that juvenile offenders can not with reliability be classified among the worst offenders see also thompson oklahoma,d plurality opinion prohibiting imposition of death penalty for persons under at the time of their crime the reasons why juveniles are not trusted with the privileges and responsibilities of an adult also explain why their irresponsible conduct is not as morally reprehensible as that of an adult.the mentally retarded,see atkins virginia,d their deficiencies do not warrant an exemption from criminal sanctions,but diminish their personal culpability.persons convicted of raping an adult woman,see coker georgia,d rape is without doubt deserving of serious punishment but in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public,it does not compare with murder,which does involve the unjustified taking of human life.murderers whose killings do not involve an elevated level of moral depravity or any other aggravating circumstance,see godfrey georgia,d plurality opinion reversing death sentence where t he petitioner crimes can not be said to have reflected a consciousness materially more depraved than that of any person guilty of murder and persons convicted of felony murder who lack a sufficiently culpable mental state,see enmund florida,d enmund culpability is plainly different from that of the robbers who killed yet the state treated them alike and attributed to enmund the culpability of those who killed the kerseys.this was impermissible under the eighth amendment.
penry i recognized that the eighth amendment requires a capital sentencing jury to have the ability to both consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence in choosing a sentence.
given the eighth amendment requirement that a capital sentencer must have individualized sentencing capability,it is not surprising that the supreme court in penry i held that the texas sentencing scheme was unconstitutional as applied when the texas courts reading of the statute did not permit the jury as sentencer to either assess the defendant culpability or select the appropriate sentence.consistent with the well established individualized sentencing principles that it had held to be required by the eighth amendment,the supreme court in penry i held 
underlying lockett and eddings is the principle that punishment should be directly related to the personal culpability of the criminal defendant.if the sentencer is to make an individualized assessment of the appropriateness of the death penalty,evidence about the defendant background and character is relevant moreover,eddings makes clear that it is not enough simply to allow the defendant to present mitigating evidence to the sentencer.the sentencer must also be able to consider and give effect to that evidence in imposing sentence.only then can we be sure that the sentencer has treated the defendant as a uniquely individual human bein g and has made a reliable determination that death is the appropriate sentence.thus,the sentence imposed at the penalty stage should reflect a reasoned moral response to the defendant background,character,and crime.
penry i,at.italics in original emphasis added internal citations omitted.in penry i,t he state conceded at oral argument that if a juror concluded that penry acted deliberately and was likely to be dangerous in the future,but also concluded that because of his mental retardation he was not sufficiently culpable to deserve the death penalty,that juror would be unable to give effect to that mitigating evidence under the instructions given in this case.id.at.consequently,the court held that in the absence of instructions informing the jury that it could consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence of penry mental retardation and abused background by declining to impose the death penalty the jury was not provided with a vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response to that evidence in rendering its sentencing decision.id.at.emphasis added.
the supreme court has consistently reaffirmed penry i holding that a capital sentencing jury must be able to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence in selecting a sentence.
in its immediately following term,the supreme court repeatedly reaffirmed and applied the holding of penry i,that the eighth amendment requires that the capital sentencer be able to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence in selecting and imposing the appropriate life or death sentence.see boyde california,d the eighth amendment requires that the jury be able to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence offered by petitioner.citing,inter alia,penry i mckoy north carolina,d as the court stated in penry i t he constitution limits a state ability to narrow a sentencer discretion to consider relevant evidence that might cause it to decline to impose the death sentence.indeed,it is precisely because the punishment should be directly related to the personal culpability of the defendant that the jury must be allowed to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence relevant to a defendant character or record or the circumstances of the offense.internal citation omitted saffle parks,d in penry,we held that resolution of a claim that the texas death penalty scheme prevented the jury from considering and giving effect to certain types of mitigating evidence did not involve the creation of a new rule under teague.see penry,at.to the extent that penry claim was that the texas system prevented the jury from giving any mitigating effect to the evidence of his mental retardation and abuse in childhood,the decision that the claim did not require the creation of a new rule is not surprising.lockett and eddings command that the state must allow the jury to give effect to mitigating evidence in making the sentencing decision penry contention was that texas barred the jury from so acting.blystone pennsylvania,d last term,we elaborated on this principle,holding that the jury must be able to consider and give effect to any mitigating evidence relevant to a defendant background and character or the circumstances of the crime.penry lynaugh,d.
through the,the court continued to ratify the penry i requirement that the capital sentencing jury must able to consider and give effect to the defendant relevant mitigating evidence in selecting and imposing the appropriate sentence.see payne tennessee,d we have held that a state can not preclude the sentencer from considering any relevant mitigating evidence that the defendant proffers in support of a sentence less than death v irtually no limits are placed on the relevant mitigating evidence a capital defendant may introduce concerning his own circumstances internal citations omitted buchanan angelone,d in the selection phase,our cases have established that the sentencer may not be precluded from considering,and may not refuse to consider,any constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence.citing penry i,eddings,and lockett our consistent concern has been that restrictions on the jury sentencing determination not preclude the jury from being able to give effect to mitigating evidence.
in penry johnson,d penry ii,the supreme court emphatically reaffirmed and applied the rule of penry i.the court held that in penry i it had confirm ed that in a capital case,t he sentencer must be able to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence in imposing sentence,so that the sentence imposed reflec ts a reasoned moral response to the defendant background,character,and crime.id.at.quoting penry i,at.alterations in original.the court in penry ii made clear that a texas court violates the rule of penry i and the eighth amendment when it only allows the jury to use relevant mitigating evidence to answer the special issues without also allowing it to use such evidence to select the appropriate life or death sentence.the penry ii court explained the key under penry i as follows 
penry i did not hold that the mere mention of mitigating circumstances to a capital sentencing jury satisfies the eighth amendment.nor does it stand for the proposition that it is constitutionally sufficient to inform the jury that it may consider mitigating circumstances in deciding the appropriate sentence.rather,the key under penry i is that the jury be able to consider and give effect to a defendant mitigating evidence in imposing sentence,at,d emphasis added.see also johnson texas,d,dissenting a sentencer must be allowed to give full consideration and full effect to mitigating circumstances emphasis in original.for it is only when the jury is given a vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response to that evidence in rendering its sentencing decision,penry i,at,d,that we can be sure that the jury has treated the defendant as a uniquely individual human bein g and has made a reliable determination that death is the appropriate sentence,at,d quoting woodson north carolina,d.
penry ii,at.
applying the rule of penry i again,the court in penry ii held that the texas capital sentencing scheme was unconstitutional as applied in penry second capital sentencing for essentially the same reasons it was constitutionally defective the first time.the state trial court had attempted to cure the constitutional deficiency with an ad hoc supplemental instruction,but that instruction did not pass muster under the rule of penry i because it did not clearly inform the jurors that they were legally empowered to consider and give effect to penry mitigating evidence in selecting and imposing the appropriate life or death sentence.as the penry ii court stated,repeating the words of penry i a reasonable juror could well have believed that there was no vehicle for expressing the view that penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death based upon his mitigating evidence.id.at.quoting penry i,at.
in,the supreme court twice reaffirmed the rule of penry i in texas death penalty cases.in tennard dretke,d,and smith texas,d,the court confirmed penry i vitality and restated the rules governing its application.tennard and smith made plain that the inquiry that this court must undertake in a penry case is simply to consider whether the defendant evidence is relevant,whether it tends to prove or disprove any fact that the sentencer might deem mitigating,and,if so,determine whether the special issues inhibit the jury ability to consider and give effect to that evidence.tennard and smith also clearly instructed both this court and the texas courts to refrain from placing restrictive glosses on the court jurisprudence and creating unwarranted impediments to penry claims.
in tennard,the court first summarized the rules of federal law it had recognized in penry i,that the texas capital sentencing scheme provided a constitutionally inadequate vehicle for jurors to consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence of mental retardation and childhood abuse tennard,at.it is not enough simply to allow the defendant to present mitigating evidence to the sentencer but rather t he sentencer must also be able to consider and give effect to that evidence in imposing sentence,id.at.quoting penry i,at.the give effect to language of penry i was the key to that decision,id.at.the same two special issues that were presented to tennard jury were insufficient for the jury in penry case to consider and give effect to penry evidence of mental retardation and childhood abuse,penry mental retardation evidence had relevance to his moral culpability beyond the scope of the deliberateness special verdict questio n because p ersonal culpability is not solely a function of a defendant capacity to act deliberately,id.at.quoting penry i,at.alterations in original penry mental retardation evidence was relevant to the future dangerousness special issue only as an aggravating factor,id.at.quoting penry i,at.and the two special issues simply failed to provide a vehicle for the jury to give the evidence of childhood abuse mitigating effect.id.quoting penry i,at.
the tennard court next called upon us to comply with the rules of federal law it had established concerning the introduction and use by the sentencing body of a defendant mitigating evidence in a capital case.it adduced its holding in mckoy that in capital cases the meaning of relevance is no different in the context of mitigating evidence than in any other context,and thus the general evidentiary tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the.tennard,at.quoting mckoy,at.internal quotation marks omitted.then,the court in tennard recognized the effects of its previous holdings regarding the relevance standard in capital cases.once this low threshold for relevance is met,the eighth amendment requires that the jury be able to consider and give effect to a capital defendant mitigating evidence.id.at.quoting boyde,at.
further,the court commented on and quoted from its opinion in skipper south carolina,d,regarding its rules about the introduction and use of relevant mitigating evidence.we have never denied that gravity has a place in the relevance analysis,insofar as evidence of a trivial feature of the defendant character or the circumstances of the crime is unlikely to have any tendency to mitigate the defendant culpability.tennard,at.citing skipper,at.however,to say that only those features and circumstances that a panel of federal appellate judges deems to be severe let alone uniquely severe could have such a tendency is incorrect.rather,the question is simply whether the evidence is of such a character that it might serve as a basis for a sentence less than death.id.at.quoting skipper,at.
the tennard court also held that the fifth circuit had erred in creating and applying its own restrictive constitutional relevance as a threshold screening test to truncate its judicial review,rather than applying the federal rules clearly established by the court decisions to the defendant mitigating evidence and penry claim.the court disapproved of the constitutional relevance rule as ha ving no foundation in the decisions of this court.neither penry i nor its progeny screened mitigating evidence for constitutional relevance before considering whether the jury instructions comported with the eighth amendment.id.at.
finally,the tennard court held that evidence of impaired intellectual functioning is obviously evidence under the clearly established relevance standard that might serve as a basis for a sentence less than death,id.at.quoting skipper,at,and that t he relationship between the special issues and tennard low iq evidence has the same essential features as the relationship between the special issues and penry mental retardation evidence.impaired intellectual functioning has mitigating dimension beyond the impact it has on the individual ability to act deliberately.id.at.citing penry i,at.
justice wrote the opinion for a majority in tennard,and was joined by justices stevens,kennedy,souter,ginsburg and breyer.
shortly after tennard,in smith,the supreme court reiterated that the standard relevance test governs the admission and use of mitigating evidence in capital cases.the smith court also reaffirmed the rule that the jury must be given an effective vehicle with which to weigh mitigating evidence so long as the defendant has met a low threshold for relevance,which is satisfied by evidence which tends logically to prove or disprove some fact or circumstance which a could reasonably deem to have mitigating value.smith,at.quoting tennard,at.internal quotation marks omitted.
in smith,the defendant had presented evidence that he had potentially organic learning disabilities and speech handicaps he had a verbal iq of,a full iq of,and had been in special education classes in school his behavior at school was often exemplary,notwithstanding his low iq and learning disabilities his father was a drug addict and violent criminal who regularly stole money from his family to support his drug addiction and he was only years old at the time of his crime.id.at.according to the smith court,t hat petitioner evidence was relevant for mitigation purposes is plain under our precedents,even those predating tennard.id.at.citing penry i,at,payne,at,boyde,at,and eddings,at.having found the evidence relevant,the court stated that the eighth amendment required the trial court to empower the jury with a vehicle capable of giving effect to that evidence.see also id.at.noting that penry ii held that the key under penry i is that the jury be able to consider and give effect to a defendant mitigation evidence in imposing sentence quoting penry ii,at.
seven members of the court joined the per curiam opinion in smith,including chief justice rehnquist and justices,stevens,kennedy,souter,ginsburg,and breyer.justice scalia,joined by justice thomas,dissented,saying only that he would affirm the judgment of the texas court of criminal appeals and adhering to his longstanding position in walton arizona,d scalia,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment,of not vot ing to uphold an eighth amendment claim that the sentencer discretion has been unlawfully restricted.see smith,at.scalia,dissenting.
finally,in,the court again confirmed the penry i rule requiring that a capital sentencing jury be able to consider and give effect to relevant mitigating evidence in the selection of the appropriate life or death sentence.see oregon guzek,d the eighth amendment insists upon reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case.the eighth amendment also insists that a sentencing jury be able to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence about the defendant character or record or the circumstances of the offense.quoting penry i,at.internal citations omitted.
in sum,the supreme court has continued to reaffirm and apply the penry i rule in many cases since its inception in,has recognized its application to cases involving such relevant mitigating evidence as impaired intellectual function,low iq,troubled and abusive childhood,participation in special education classes,and mental retardation,and has developed numerous auxiliary jurisprudential rules in support of the application of the penry i rule.
the court cases demonstrate that johnson does not change or limit the penry i rule it merely establishes auxiliary principles relating to its application.
contrary to the argument by the state and my dissenting colleagues,the supreme court in johnson did not change or limit the penry i rule that the eighth amendment requires that a capital sentencing jury must be able to give full consideration and effect to all of a defendant relevant mitigating evidence in imposing the appropriate life or death sentence.in johnson,the court merely recognized three auxiliary principles for implementing the penry i rule because of the unique manner in which youth mitigation evidence aligns the inquiry into future dangerousness with an assessment of culpability or deathworthiness,a defendant relevant mitigating evidence of youth may be given full consideration and effect by the jury answer to the future dangerousness special issue in order to determine whether a penry violation occurred,a reviewing court must ask whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the special issues in a way that prevents it from giving full consideration and effect to any relevant mitigating evidence and the state may shape and structure the jury consideration so long as it does not preclude the jury from giving effect to any relevant mitigating evidence,because,as the court subsequently explained,o ur consistent concern has been that restrictions on the jury sentencing determination not preclude the jury from being able to give effect to mitigating evidence.buchanan angelone,d.
that johnson established these auxiliary principles and did not change or limit the rule of penry i itself was most clearly demonstrated by the court decision in buchanan.in that case,the court held that the state trial court refusal to give instructions on the concept of mitigation and on particular statutorily defined mitigating factors did not violate the eighth and fourteenth amendments.id.at.the court explained that the defendant,in arguing to the contrary,misunderstood the significant distinction it had drawn between the two phases of the capital sentencing process the eligibility phase,in which the jury narrows the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty,and the selection phase,with which buchanan was concerned,in which the jury determines whether to impose a death sentence on an eligible defendant.id.at.citing tuilaepa california,d.in explaining the eligibility and selection phases,the court again ratified the penry i rule and described the principles that had been generated by johnson in terms that indicate the court views them as supporting,rather than limiting,rules 
in the eligibility phase,the jury narrows the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty,often through consideration of aggravating circumstances.in the selection phase,the jury determines whether to impose a death sentence on an eligible defendant 
it is in regard to the eligibility phase that we have stressed the need for channeling and limiting the jury discretion to ensure that the death penalty is a proportionate punishment and therefore not arbitrary or capricious in its imposition.in contrast,in the selection phase,we have emphasized the need for a broad inquiry into all relevant mitigating evidence to allow an individualized determination.tuilaepa,supra,at,at romano oklahoma,d mccleskey kemp,d stephens,supra,at,at 
in the selection phase,our cases have established that the sentencer may not be precluded from considering,and may not refuse to consider,any constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence.penry lynaugh,d eddings oklahoma,d lockett ohio,d.however,the state may shape and structure the jury consideration of mitigation so long as it does not preclude the jury from giving effect to any relevant mitigating evidence.johnson texas,d penry,supra,at,at franklin lynaugh,d.our consistent concern has been that restrictions on the jury sentencing determination not preclude the jury from being able to give effect to mitigating evidence.
id.at.emphasis added.
thus,as the buchanan court read penry i together with johnson,tuilaepa,romano and other cases,the rule of penry i is not limited by johnson at all.instead,the penry i holding that the eighth amendment requires that a capital sentencing jury be able to consider fully and give effect to the defendant relevant mitigating evidence by selecting the appropriate sentence stands unlimited and unscathed by johnson.johnson,as read by buchanan,merely establishes precedent for application of the boyde test and adds that a state may shape and structure mitigation consideration so long as it does not prevent the sentencer from giving effect to the mitigating evidence.
moreover,as pointed out earlier,since johnson was decided,the court in penry ii,tennard,and smith repeatedly reaffirmed the rule and holding of penry i as justice described it,first,in penry i itself,next,in her dissent in johnson,again in the majority of penry ii,and finally in tennard.in her johnson dissent,justice stated 
in penry i,we plainly held that the texas special issues violated the eighth amendment to the extent they prevented the jury from giving full consideration and effect to a defendant relevant mitigating evidence.
penry was in no way limited to evidence that is only aggravating under the future dangerousness issue.we stated there that eddings makes clear that it is not enough simply to allow the defendant to present mitigating evidence to the sentencer.the sentencer must also be able to consider and give effect to that evidence in imposing sentence.that we meant full effect is evident from the remainder of our discussion.we first determined that penry evidence of mental retardation and his abused childhood was relevant to the question whether he acted deliberately under the first special issue.but having some relevance to an issue was not sufficient,and the problem was not,as the court today suggests,simply that no jury instruction defined the term deliberately.instead,we noted that the jury must be able to give effect to the evidence as it related to penry p ersonal culpability,which is not solely a function of a defendant capacity to act deliberately.the jury could not give full effect to penry evidence under the first special issue because deliberately was not defined in a way that would clearly direct the jury to consider fully penry mitigating evidence as it bears on his personal culpability.that is,the evidence had relevance beyond the scope of the first issue.
johnson,at,dissenting alteration in original internal citations omitted.
significantly,too,justice kennedy,johnson author,joined the six member majorities in penry ii and tennard,and the seven member majority in smith.further,tennard and smith made clear that the rule of penry i applies to all categories of mitigating evidence that are relevant to the assessment of a defendant diminished culpability or that might cause a jury through its reasoned moral response to select life imprisonment rather than a death sentence for the defendant.these decisions,along with buchanan,have resoundingly ratified and continued to uphold justice view as expressed in penry i that the eighth amendment requires that a capital sentencing jury be able to fully consider defendant relevant mitigating evidence by using that evidence to assess his moral culpability and to give full effect to that evidence by selecting the appropriate life or death sentence for him in that case.
also,as the court has made clear in buchanan,tennard,smith,and other cases,the state ability to shape and structure the capital sentencer consideration of mitigation evidence may not be used to preclude the jury from giving effect to any relevant mitigating evidence by selecting the appropriate sentence for the offender in each case.buchanan,at.the court emphasized its continued disapproval of the use of the texas special issues to in any way constrain the jury ability to give effect to mitigation evidence by selecting the appropriate sentence.in comparing the virginia sentencing system involved in buchanan with the texas system used in penry i,the court stated 
the instruction informed the jurors that if they found the aggravating factor proved beyond a reasonable doubt then they may fix the penalty at death,but directed that if they believed that all the evidence justified a lesser sentence then they shall impose a life sentence.the jury was thus allowed to impose a life sentence even if it found the aggravating factor proved.moreover,in contrast to the texas special issues scheme in question in penry,the instructions here did not constrain the manner in which the jury was able to give effect to mitigation.
id.at.internal citation and footnote omitted.
furthermore,as described earlier,the court in tennard and smith emphatically held that state and inferior federal courts may not through judicial glosses or otherwise create ad hoc or common law type threshold or screening rules that cut short appellate review of death penalty cases and thus indirectly have the effect of approving and encouraging constraints upon the manner in which the capital sentencing juries are able to give full effect to relevant mitigating evidence in the selection of the appropriate death or life imprisonment sentence in individual cases.
the reaffirmation of penry i rule that the capital sentencing jury be able to give both full consideration and full effect to relevant mitigating evidence,moreover,necessitates realigning the boyde test analogue for application to the present case in which,allegedly,the capital sentencer was incapable of either appropriately considering or giving effect to the defendant mitigating evidence for the purposes of individualized sentencing.due to the marked differences between the texas sentencing system in the present case and the california system in boyde,the boyde rule can not be applied in precisely the same way to the alleged dual error in the present case.
in boyde,although the jury was instructed that it must impose the death penalty if it found the aggravating circumstances to outweigh the mitigating circumstances and a life imprisonment sentence if it found vice versa,the jurors retained a great deal of discretion in that they could decide what weight to assign the aggravating and mitigating factors and they were fully enabled to make the ultimate choice of whether to impose or withhold the death penalty.thus,the california system in boyde was markedly different from the texas system under which the jury was not legally authorized to choose between life and death sentences in any case.in boyde,the defendant argued that although the jury retained significant sentencing discretion,his constitutional rights were violated because the jury was given an instruction that could have misled it into thinking it was not free to consider his mitigating evidence of background and character in deciding whether to impose the death penalty.near the beginning of the supreme court opinion,chief justice rehnquist reaffirmed the rule of penry i the eighth amendment requires that the jury be able to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence offered by petitioner.boyde,at.however,after that point the boyde opinion does not refer to the give effect part of the rule as it was not genuinely at issue,the only real question being whether the allegedly ambiguous jury instruction had prevented the jury from be ing able to consider all relevant mitigating evidence.id.the court decided that the rule to be applied to such an alleged ambiguous jury instruction would be the reasonable likelihood test and,upon applying that test,concluded that there was no reasonable likelihood that boyde jury had been precluded from considering the relevant background and character mitigation evidence.as chief justice rehnquist explained 
in this case we are presented with a single jury instruction.the instruction is not concededly erroneous,nor found so by a court,as was the case in stromberg california.the claim is that the instruction is ambiguous and therefore subject to an erroneous interpretation.we think the proper inquiry in such a case is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.although a defendant need not establish that the jury was more likely than not to have been impermissibly inhibited by the instruction,a capital sentencing proceeding is not inconsistent with the eighth amendment if there is only a possibility of such an inhibition.this reasonable likelihood standard,we think,better accommodates the concerns of finality and accuracy than does a standard which makes the inquiry dependent on how a single hypothetical reasonable juror could or might have interpreted the instruction.
because the capital sentencing jury in the present case,like the jury in penry i,was not free or able to choose a life imprisonment sentence for nelson,the alleged constitutional deficiency here affected the jury ability to both consider and give effect to nelson relevant mitigating evidence it is not merely an alleged ambiguous jury instruction that could have affected only their understanding of the types of mitigating evidence that they could consider.indeed,as i explain in the last section of this opinion,the constitutional deficiency here is a structural defect which affected the entire capital sentencing proceeding and can not be analyzed for harmless error,the alleged binary defect is the total absence of the jury ability to consider the mitigating evidence for purposes of assessing nelson moral culpability or deathworthiness and the total absence of the jury ability to give the evidence effect by selecting the sentence it deems appropriate based on that assessment.accordingly,if the boyde test is to be applied by analogy in the present case,it must be adjusted to properly and completely fit both elements of the alleged constitutional violation here.because,unlike the situation in boyde,there is a serious question here whether the jury was precluded from giving effect to nelson mitigating evidence,the proper inquiry here should be whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury was prevented from considering nelson mitigation evidence to assess his culpability or giving effect to that evidence by selecting the appropriate sentence.
because of the unique nature of the youth mitigation evidence at issue in johnson,the court there apparently considered that only an alleged failure in the jury ability to consider the evidence was at issue.the court in johnson must have concluded that the jury was fully capable of giving effect to the mitigating evidence by selecting the sentence if the jury instruction had not precluded them from giving it full consideration.thus,the situations posing only unitary errors in both boyde and johnson were quite similar in this respect despite other differences in the two sentencing systems.consequently,there was no need for the court to consider further reshaping the boyde test analogue that it derived from its boyde decision.for all of these reasons,the johnson court use of a boyde test analogue capable of testing only for a preclusion of the jury ability to consider the evidence should not prevent courts from reshaping the analogue test to make it suitable for detecting a preclusion of both the jury ability to consider and to give effect to relevant mitigating evidence.
considering all of the foregoing reasons,i conclude that the court decisions subsequent to johnson demonstrate that neither it nor any other decision has been read as limiting or changing the constitutional requirements and principles established in penry 
texas capital sentencing scheme provided a constitutionally inadequate vehicle for jurors to consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence that nelson presented.
as i explained above,by the time nelson conviction became final in,the relevant supreme court cases had clearly established that in order to constitutionally impose and carry out the death penalty,a capital sentencer must be enabled to make an individualized assessment of each defendant moral culpability and deathworthiness and to give full effect to that evidence by selecting between either life imprisonment or death as the appropriate sentence.
in this case,nelson presented evidence during the punishment phase of his trial that he was rejected by his mother he abused drugs and alcohol he had troubled relationships with his brother and with women he had fathered a child,with whom he was not allowed to have a relationship and he suffered from borderline personality disorder.the state courts held that all of nelson evidence could be adequately considered within the deliberateness and future dangerousness special issues.
it is abundantly clear that there is more than a reasonable likelihood that the jury was not permitted to fully consider and give effect to nelson mitigating evidence,as the deliberateness and future dangerousness special issues did not permit the jury to consider how that evidence affected their assessment of nelson moral culpability or to agree upon whether the death penalty or life imprisonment was the appropriate sentence in his case.there can be no question that nelson mitigating evidence,particularly his evidence of a frequently disorienting borderline personality disorder,a medically recognized mental illness implicates his deathworthiness and his moral culpability.nelson troubled background and mental disorder make him less morally culpable independently of the issues of whether he acted deliberately or would be a future danger.but because the jury was only called upon to answer two relatively simple yes or no questions,there is no reason to suppose that it could or would consider the evidence for the complex purpose of assessing the comparative level of nelson culpability.nelson,at dennis,concurring in the judgment.accordingly,for the reasons set forth in my concurring panel opinion,i agree with the en banc majority that a penry violation occurred in this case and that the state courts unreasonably applied clearly established federal law in denying nelson claim.
the restrictive glosses applied at the panel level in this case and others have no basis in the supreme court decisions.
as the supreme court made unmistakably clear in tennard,this court is not permitted to artificially or ingeniously narrow penry i by imposing screening tests or placing restrictive glosses on the supreme court jurisprudence.tennard,at.see also smith,at.in tennard,the court admonished this circuit that its constitutional relevance,uniquely severe permanent handicap,and nexus tests were restrictive glosses that had no foundation in the decisions of the supreme court.tennard,at.as tennard instructed,we are not permitted to alter or elaborate the tests outlined by the supreme court so as to fail to reach the heart of a defendant penry claims.id.at.
in holding that nelson mitigating evidence could be considered within the context of the special issues,the state court and chief judge jones panel opinion in this case erroneously relied on fifth circuit precedent that,like the defunct constitutional relevance test,are unsupported by the supreme court cases.the state court and chief judge jones panel opinion used such cases to find that both nelson evidence concerning his background and troubled relationships and his evidence of voluntary intoxication could be sufficiently considered within the scope of the special issues.see nelson,at.in light of the clearly established law described above,however,it was error to rely on prior fifth circuit threshold and screening rules in those cases.
even more troubling is chief judge jones panel opinion resort to yet another of this circuit restrictive glosses on the supreme court penry jurisprudence,in the form of the treatable mental disorder test,under which evidence of a mental disorder that is only theoretically treatable is not considered penry evidence.nelson,at citing coble dretke,cir.again,this test adds a gloss that has no basis in the supreme court decisions.this circuit rule that any theoretically mental illness can be given the requisite effect through the texas special issues is simply another contrivance to avoid the requirements of the supreme court individualized sentencing jurisprudence,and i agree with the majority that it should not be applied 
in addition,i agree with the majority decision to reject the evidence rule.this court has sometimes used johnson to deny penry claims by stating that johnson adopted a evidence rule,under which mitigating evidence does not trigger penry scrutiny unless a juror considering the evidence could give it only aggravating,and not mitigating,effect under the special issues.see,cole dretke,cir,cert.granted sub,quarterman,d.as the majority points out,although the penry i court remarked that one of the problems with the application of the special issues to penry case was that a juror could only find penry evidence of mental retardation to be an aggravating factor,see penry i,at,that observation was not the basis for the decision and penry i is not therefore limited to such evidence.moreover,as i explained in my dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc in cole,nothing in the court decision in johnson or subsequent cases indicates that the johnson court adopted such a rule.see cole,at dennis,dissenting.
the state failure to enable its capital sentencing jury to give full consideration and effect to nelson relevant mitigating evidence can not be harmless error.
i.the state waived its harmless error argument.
the state did not argue that any penry error in this case could be harmless until its en banc brief in this court.ordinarily,the state bears the burden of showing that a preserved error was harmless.see united states dominguez benitez,d.in addition,the state can waive harmless error review by failing to raise the issue in a timely and unequivocal manner in the district court.see sanders cotton,cir lam kelchner,cir randy hertz james liebman,federal habeas corpus practice procedure,at ed see also saldano roach,cir.although a court retains the discretion to consider the harmless error issue even when it has been waived,it should generally do so only if the error harmlessness is clear from even a cursory review of the record and reversal for further proceedings would be nothing more than a waste of resources.see sanders,at united states giovannetti,cir.whether the court should overlook the state waiver of harmless error in any particular case depends on the length and complexity of the record,whether the harmlessness of the error or errors found is certain or debatable,and whether a reversal will result in protracted,costly,and ultimately futile proceedings in the district court.giovannetti,at.
although i did not consider the effect of the state failure to raise harmless error in my concurring panel opinion,i am now convinced that the state waived any argument concerning harmless error by failing to raise it in the district court.moreover,applying the factors set out in giovannetti,it is clear that this is not a case in which we should exercise our discretion to overlook that waiver.the record in nelson case is substantial and the issues are complex it is certainly debatable whether the trial court error is,or could ever be,harmless indeed,i conclude below that such an error is reversible per se and reversing nelson death sentence and ordering a new sentencing proceeding at which the jury is permitted to fully consider nelson mitigating evidence in determining the appropriate sentence can not be considered a futile act.accordingly,this court can properly conclude that the state has waived harmless error review and that this is not an appropriate case in which this court should disregard the state waiver.
ii.a penry error is a structural defect that is not susceptible to harmless error review.
under principles of law clearly established by the supreme court decisions,the constitutional violation in this case was a structural defect that can not be analyzed as harmless trial error.this is because the violation was not a discrete error that a reviewing court can determine from the record had no substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury determination of the sentence.rather,the violation was the state failure in this case to enable its capital sentencing jury to give full effect to nelson relevant mitigating evidence in determining the sentence.
the history and purpose of harmless error review demonstrates why it is inappropriate in this case.the dichotomy between errors of constitutional dimension that may be found to be harmless and those that may not began with chapman california,d.in chapman,the supreme court recognized that there are some constitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error id.at.the court pointed to the rule against coerced confessions the right to counsel the right to an impartial judge and,in a later case,the rule against double jeopardy as belonging to the list of constitutional rights so important that their violation requires automatic reversal.see charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure ed.for errors that could be treated as harmless,chapman established that the prosecution has the burden of showing that the error was harmless,and reversal is required unless the court is able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.chapman,at.the chapman court warned against overemphasis on the notion that error is harmless if there is overwhelming evidence of guilt.wright et,supra,at.later,in bumper north carolina,d,the court struck a similar chord,emphasizing that it is not the function of this court to determine innocence or guilt,much less to apply our own subjective notions of justice.our duty is to uphold the constitution of the united states.
some years after chapman,building on the dichotomy it recognized,the court in arizona fulminante,d,developed a theory for distinguishing between constitutional trial errors,which can be harmless,and constitutional structural defects,which can not.the court explained that trial error occur s during the presentation of the case to the jury and is amenable to harmless error analysis because it may be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.at the other end of the spectrum of constitutional errors lie structural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism,which defy analysis by standards.the entire conduct of the trial from beginning to end is obviously affected by structural defects such as the absence of counsel for a criminal defendant and the presence on the bench of a judge who is not impartial.id.at.the existence of a structural defect affect s the framework within which the trial proceeds,rather than being simply an error in the trial process itself.id.at.a structural defect transcends the criminal process because w ithout these basic protections,a criminal trial can not reliably serve its function and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.id.at.quoting rose clark,d.
in fulminante,the court also recognized that since chapman it had added to the category of structural constitutional errors not subject to harmless error the following unlawful exclusion of members of the defendant race from a grand jury the right to at trial and the right to public trial.in fulminante itself,the court held that the admission of a coerced confession is a trial error subject to harmless error analysis,reversing its prior classification in chapman of that kind of error as a structural defect.ultimately,however,a majority of the fulminante court held that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in that particular case and affirmed the arizona supreme court decision to grant fulminante a new trial.id.at.
two years later,the supreme court in sullivan louisiana,d,a case on direct review,held that a constitutionally deficient reasonable doubt jury instruction,which carries with it consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate,unquestionably qualifies as a structural error.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.as justice scalia explained,the harmless error question chapman poses for reviewing courts is 
not what effect the constitutional error might generally be expected to have upon a reasonable jury,but rather what effect it had upon the guilty verdict in the case at hand.review looks to the basis on which the jury actually rested its verdict.the inquiry,in other words,is not whether,in a trial that occurred without the error,a guilty verdict would surely have been rendered,but whether the guilty verdict actually rendered in this trial was surely unattributable to the error.that must be so,because to hypothesize a guilty verdict that was never in fact matter how inescapable the findings to support that verdict might violate the guarantee.
id.at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.and,as he elaborated,
since,for the reasons just described,there has been no jury verdict within the meaning of the sixth amendment,the entire premise of chapman review is simply absent.there being no jury verdict of,the question whether the same verdict of would have been rendered absent the constitutional error is utterly meaningless.there is no object,so to speak,upon which scrutiny can operate.the most an appellate court can conclude is that a jury would surely have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable that the jury actual finding of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt would surely not have been different absent the constitutional error.that is not enough.the sixth amendment requires more than appellate speculation about a hypothetical jury action,or else directed verdicts for the state would be sustainable on appeal it requires an actual jury finding of guilty.
id.at.internal citations omitted.
also in,the supreme court in brecht changed the harmless error rule that applies to habeas corpus cases,holding that,on collateral review of state court decisions,federal courts should apply the standard of the kotteakos united states,which asks whether the error had a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict,rather than the chapman harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard,to decide whether a constitutional trial error was harmless.but the brecht court did not alter,and in fact reaffirmed as longstanding,the rule that a constitutional structural defect is reversible per se and not subject to harmless error analysis.citing fulminante,the court reiterated 
trial error occur s during the presentation of the case to the jury,and is amenable to analysis because it may be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine the effect it had on the trial.at the other end of the spectrum of constitutional errors lie structural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism,which defy analysis by standards.the existence of such of the right to counsel,for automatic reversal of the conviction because they infect the entire trial process.since our landmark decision in chapman california,we have applied the standard in reviewing claims of constitutional error of the trial type.
id.at.alterations in original internal citations omitted.
accordingly,in habeas corpus proceedings,even after brecht,structural constitutional defects,as opposed to constitutional trial errors,are always considered prejudicial and reversible per se.reviewing courts may not subject them to harmless error analysis or declare them to be harmless under any standard.
applying the foregoing principles,i conclude that the constitutional violation that occurred when the texas capital sentencing system was applied to a case in which a defendant had introduced mitigating evidence that reasonably may have caused a sentencer to impose a sentence of less than death,the violation was caused not by a trial error but by a structural defect that is not subject to harmless error analysis.
more specifically,the defect plainly is not a trial error,which occur s during the presentation of the case to the jury,and is amenable to analysis.fulminante,at.as chief justice rehnquist explained in fulminante,a trial error is one which may be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.fulminante,at.under his analysis,a penry i violation is not a trial error because it is impossible for a reviewing court to quantitatively assess what affect the mitigating evidence would have had on the sentencing jury if it had been granted the discretion to choose between a life or a death sentence for penry.instead,the defect is a structural defect in the constitution of the trial mechanism,which def ies analysis by standards.the entire conduct of the sentencing from beginning to end is obviously affected by a structural defect in the sentencing framework.id.at.consequently,penry i held that the texas capital sentencing scheme was unconstitutional as applied to that case and made clear that in a new capital sentencing proceeding the structural defect must be repaired so as to enable the jury to fully consider penry mitigation evidence and to decline to impose the death penalty if it decided that sentence to be inappropriate in penry case.
that the constitutional violation in penry i and this case resulted from a structural defect that is not susceptible to harmless error analysis is even more clearly shown by applying justice scalia first analysis in sullivan.according to sullivan,as a court reviewing for harmless error,we are instructed to consider not what effect the constitutional error might generally be expected to have upon a reasonable jury,but rather what effect it had upon the verdict in the case at hand the inquiry,in other words,is not whether,in a sentencing proceeding that occurred without the error,a death penalty would surely have been imposed,but whether the death penalty actually imposed in this capital sentencing proceeding was surely unattributable to the error.sullivan,at.once the proper function of harmless error review is understood,the illogic of review in the present case becomes evident.id.at.since there has been no jury consideration of nelson mitigating evidence for purposes of determining whether the death penalty is necessary for just retribution in his case,and no jury decision that the death penalty is indeed appropriate in his case,the entire premise of harmless error review is simply absent.id.because the jury could not fully consider the mitigating evidence and there was no jury decision upon whether the death penalty is appropriate here,the question of whether the same decision to impose the death penalty would have been rendered absent the constitutional error is utterly meaningless.id.the most we can conclude is that a jury would surely have found that nelson deserves the death that the actual imposition of the death penalty would surely not have been different absent the constitutional error.id.such a determination on our part in the present case would be nothing more than appellate speculation about a hypothetical jury action,not a meaningful appellate harmless error analysis of nelson jury actual determination to impose the death penalty 
having reached the foregoing conclusions after additional study and a better understanding of the applicable legal principles,i must acknowledge and correct the errors in the premise and the result of my separate panel opinion in this case.
my initial error resulted from my faulty appreciation of the correlation between the supreme court statement in johnson that t he standard against which we assess whether jury instructions satisfy the rule of lockett and eddings was set forth in boyde california.johnson,at.the court application by analogy of the boyde test in johnson to determine whether there was a penry i constitutional violation and the court holding in calderon coleman,d,that once the court of appeals had determined that the state trial court ambiguous jury instruction was a constitutional trial error under the boyde test,it was bound to apply the harmless error analysis mandated by brecht and find the error harmful before issuing a writ of habeas corpus.from these decisions,i incorrectly concluded that every penry i constitutional violation detected by application of the boyde test will be a trial error susceptible to harmless error analysis.this does not follow,however on the contrary,it seems probable that most penry i violations will be structural defects that are reversible per se,like the defect in the present case.by its nature a penry i violation consists of the absence of the jury constitutionally required capability to consider and give effect to relevant mitigating evidence.therefore,i conclude that after detecting a constitutional error by application of the boyde test,it is necessary for us to analyze the particular constitutional deficiency according to the supreme court jurisprudential principles to determine if it is a structural defect which is reversible per se or a trial error that is susceptible to harmless error analysis under brecht.
second,having erroneously concluded that a harmless error analysis could be performed on the structural defect in this case,i unintentionally compounded my mistake by attempting to apply the brecht test to the hypothesizing of events that never in fact occurred.such an enterprise is not factfinding,but closer to divination.dominguez benitez,at.scalia,concurring.in other words,i could not examine the jury decision choosing the sentence in this case,because the jury here never made such a decision.instead,i erroneously performed what i thought was a proper harmless error examination but which in reality was an improper hypothesization of what the jury would have done had it been enabled to give effect to the mitigating evidence by selecting the sentence.
for these reasons,the deprivation of the defendant right to a sentencing jury that was able to consider and give effect to all of his relevant mitigating evidence by selecting the appropriate sentence for him in the particular case,with consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate,unquestionably qualifies as structural defect,not a trial error.
conclusion 
for these reasons,i concur in the judgment of the majority opinion.
background 
this court voted to rehear nelson case en banc because we are divided over how to interpret recent supreme court ii,tennard,and texas death penalty statute.three years ago,we reheard the robertson case en banc because we were divided over interpretation of the supreme court texas death penalty case law leading up to and including penry ii the court continuing mixed signals on issues of critical importance to texas criminal justice system are unfortunate.it is to be hoped that,for the sake of certainty,the court will clarify its jurisprudence in the cases on which it just granted certiorari 
the majority opinion grants habeas relief to nelson based on an adjective.it concludes that nelson mitigating evidence could not be given full effect by the jury at sentencing due to the inadequacy of the texas death penalty special issues.it concludes,based on some language in the court opinions,that full effect,not just some effect,is now the baseline for constitutionally adequate jury evaluation of a defendant mitigating evidence.
this conclusion marks a surprising result in a habeas petition governed by aedpa,which mandates affirmance of state criminal convictions unless the state court decision was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,federal law.first,nelson proffered mitigating evidence of a sort that this court has frequently encountered his mother rejected him and he had no relationship with a child he had sired he was intoxicated by drugs and alcohol when he committed the crime he had troubled relationships with his brother and women and he suffered from a treatable borderline personality disorder.this court has upheld numerous capital sentences against claims that similar evidence could not be given sufficient effect by texas juries under the statutes.the supreme court has frequently refused to review those decisions,and prisoners were executed today result suggests a sea change from those decisions and their understanding of the court case law.
second,the majority reasoning implies that the penry line of cases,which was described by the court as an exception to the rule,commencing with jurek,of the overall constitutionality of the texas sentencing issues has become the new rule to which jurek,franklin,graham,and johnson are now exceptions.yet penry i is as not a new rule which means that it may be applied retroactively in habeas cases and none of its progeny has altered that characterization.even more potently,neither penry ii,tennard,nor smith overruled the other line of cases.if,however,full effect has become the test for mitigating evidence,rather than some effect or within the effective reach of the jury,then the majority decision is irreconcilable with the line of cases.
this court can not underrule the supreme court.our duty is to harmonize its decisions as well as possible.we are always bound by the force of stare decisis,which caused justice kennedy to comment in johnson that 
t he interests of the state of texas,and of the victims whose rights it must vindicate,ought not to be turned aside when the state relies upon an interpretation of the eighth amendment approved by this court,absent demonstration that our earlier cases were themselves a misinterpretation of some constitutional command.
johnson,at.at citations omitted.
ii.the clearly established law 
with this preface,a closer analysis of the majority opinion can begin.billy ray nelson habeas petition was rejected by the state courts for reasons that had nothing to do with this court constitutional relevance and uniquely severe evidentiary thresholds.see tennard dretke,d.the state courts conducted thoughtful and thorough analyses of nelson proffered mitigating evidence,and determined that all such evidence was sufficiently encompassed by the former texas special issues and did not run afoul of penry lynaugh,d penry i.
nevertheless,and despite the demanding aedpa unreasonableness standard,the majority now holds that nelson is entitled to relief because there was a reasonable likelihood that nelson jury was prevented from giving full effect to his mitigating evidence.whether the standard is that of full effect or something else is the principal issue before this court.only last year,the author of today majority opinion stated the test without a full effect gloss to grant relief on a penry claim,we must determine whether the mitigating evidence has met the low threshold for relevance,and,if so,that the evidence was beyond the effective scope of the jury.bigby dretke,cir stewart,citations omitted.the constitutional relevance of nelson mitigating evidence is not at issue here.but to say that a death penalty must be upheld unless such evidence was beyond the effective scope of the jury,as bigby does and as this dissent advocates,is a much different test than whether such evidence could be given full effect by the jury.
the majority opinion cites every instance in which opinions of the dicta or employed the term full effect.unfortunately,the course of the court jurisprudence,in our view,is far more complex than reliance on one adjective full would suggest.
in the beginning,in jurek texas,d,the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the texas special issues,noting that texas sentencing scheme permitted the jury to consider whatever evidence of mitigating circumstances the defense can bring before it.id.at.at.the special issues were not seen to preclude the consideration of mitigating evidence,but rather,served to guide and focus the jury objective consideration of the particularized circumstances of the individual offense and the individual offender.id.at.at.such focusing was seen as beneficial,as it promoted evenhandedness by the jury,allowed an individualized assessment of the defendant culpability,and guarded against arbitrary results.lockett ohio,d invalidating ohio death penalty statute that altogether prevented the jury from considering relevant mitigating evidence the ohio statute was explicitly compared unfavorably to the texas statute.there is thus no basis to conclude as a general matter that the texas special issues will fail to allow a jury to weigh a petitioner mitigating evidence.
this assessment of the special issues was confirmed in franklin lynaugh,d,as the supreme court again rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the special issues.in that case the petitioner argued that mitigating evidence of his good behavior while in prison presented in his defense had relevance beyond the special issues,particularly the second special issue,which concerns future dangerousness.in denying habeas,the court held that all relevant aspects of the petitioner character could be encompassed by the second special issue.id.at.at.more important,in commenting on the adequacy of the special issues,the plurality qualified the broad statement in eddings oklahoma,that the sentencing jury may not be precluded from considering any relevant,mitigating evidence.in the plurality view,eddings and lockett did not prevent a state from structuring or giving shape to the jury consideration of mitigating factors.franklin,at.at.the court thus rejected the contention that a instruction allowing the jury an independent basis for rendering a sentence other than death was necessary,as such an instruction would overrule jurek.id.at.at.jurek had approved the texas special issues,and the court had repeatedly referred with approval to texas sentencing scheme,see franklin,at.at citing cases,precisely because it reconciled the court twin concerns for statutory structuring and for jury flexibility to consider mitigating evidence.justice concurrence in the judgment presaged her view in penry i that jurek did not preclude a claim that,in a particular case,the special issues were constitutionally inadequate.penry i,at.at.however,from franklin,including justice special concurrence,it is clear that the texas special issues ought to be constitutional in the vast majority of cases.
ultimately,the question of what exactly it means for a court to give full consideration to a habeas petitioner mitigating evidence was answered in the cases of graham collins,d,and johnson texas,d.although graham came to the supreme court on collateral,as opposed to direct,review,and was thus subject to analysis under teague lane,d,the case was nevertheless instrumental in explaining the sufficiency of state death penalty statutes.in that case,the petitioner argued that evidence of his youth and transient upbringing had mitigating impact beyond the special issues.the court rejected this contention,again turning to jurek.death penalty statutes only had to supply the defendant with a constitutionally adequate consideration of his mitigating evidence,which texas special issues did.graham,at.at.the majority explained lockett,eddings,skipper hitchcock and penry i as being constitutionally defective because relevant mitigating evidence was placed beyond the effective reach of the jury.id.at.at.the fact that the defendant evidence might have some arguable relevance beyond the special issues did not invalidate the special issues.id.at.at.this is because virtually any mitigating evidence is capable of being viewed as having some bearing on the defendant moral culpability apart from its relevance to the particular concerns embodied in the texas special issues.id.at.at.again,citing franklin and jurek,the court determined that texas death penalty statute allowed mitigating evidence to be adequately considered while permissibly focusing the considerations of the sentencing jury.id.graham,a majority opinion,thus stands for the proposition that a texas jury may constitutionally render a sentence of death even where a defendant presents mitigating evidence that has some arguable relevance beyond the special issues.
just months later,a majority of the court in johnson reaffirmed the reasoning of graham,in a direct appeal in which the appellant youth as an offender was his major mitigating quality.justice kennedy opinion drew heavily from graham,that while 
lockett and eddings prevent a state from placing relevant mitigating evidence beyond the effective reach of the sentencer,we have held that there is no constitutional requirement of unfettered sentencing discretion in the jury,and states are free to structure and shape mitigating evidence in an effort to achieve a more rational and equitable administration of the death penalty.
johnson,at.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.recapitulating the cases construing texas special issues,the court confirmed a narrow interpretation of penry i,making it clear that jurek,lockett and eddings can stand together with penry.id.at.at.the court closely analyzed youthfulness as a mitigating factor and held that there is ample room in the assessment of future dangerousness for a juror to take account of the difficulties of youth id.penry condition,in contrast,rendered him unable to learn from his mistakes and could only be considered to aggravate,not lessen,his future dangerousness 
the court concluded johnson with the observation,originating in graham,that jurek would have to be overruled if,whenever a defendant proffers mitigating evidence that has some arguable relevance beyond the special issues,a fourth jury issue in mitigation would be required.id.at.at.such an issue,as the court reasoned,would effectively abrogate the state power,repeatedly affirmed by the court,to structure the consideration of mitigating evidence.
graham and johnson are majority opinions of the court penry i is also a majority opinion,but penry i represented a exception to the jurek line of cases.this was made abundantly clear in graham,at.at.what distinguished penry i from the aforementioned cases was that,according to penry experts,he had extremely poor impulse control,and,owing to his limited mental abilities,he was unable to appreciate the consequences of his actions or learn from his mistakes.unlike the instant case,there was no suggestion that penry condition would improve his brain damage was allegedly permanent.such evidence might have diminished penry culpability,but it also served to indicate,as all sides agreed,that he would always be a threat to society.as such,with regard to the future dangerousness special issue,penry evidence served only as an aggravating factor for the jury.id.at.at.the defense found itself in the unenviable position of arguing that a juror should vote no on one of the special issues even if she believed the state had proved the answer should be yes.id.at.at.the prosecution in turn stressed that the jurors had taken an oath to follow the law,and that they must follow the instructions.id.this created a uniquely unfortunate situation in which a reasonable juror could credit the mitigating evidence and feel a sentence other than death was warranted for penry,yet nevertheless be compelled to answer the special issues in the affirmative and render a sentence of death.unlike graham and johnson,in which the juries had the ability to give at least some effect to the mitigating evidence presented by the defendants,it was impossible to give meaningful mitigating effect to penry evidence through the special issues.graham,at.at.the penry i jury had no vehicle for expressing the view that penry did not deserve to be sentenced to death.penry i,at.at 
to quote graham again in penry,the defendant evidence was placed before the sentencer but the sentencer had no reliable means of giving mitigating effect to that evidence.graham,at,ct at emphasis added.penry i was thus limited in its scope,as otherwise,it could not be consistent with jurek and lockett,both of which were repeatedly reaffirmed by the court.johnson,at.at.in short,the clearly established law as of is not,as the majority argue,the penry i full effect test,but instead consists of penry i together with graham,johnson,franklin,and jurek.
the court subsequent decisions in penry ii,tennard dretke,and smith texas have muddied the waters,but they have not replaced,much less overruled,jurek,franklin,graham,and johnson.each of the more recent cases resolves a narrow procedural issue.penry ii considered the sufficiency of a nullification instruction to the jury that texas courts thought would alleviate the problem in penry case.the court explained why the nullification instruction would cause jurors to violate their oaths if they felt,notwithstanding that penry condition required a positive answer to his deliberateness and future dangerousness,he was less culpable because of his mental retardation.the court opinion mentions full effect once,but its overruling of the nullification instruction was not tied to whether the jury could give full effect to penry mitigating evidence.the jurors was independent of the amount of the mitigating effect.
in tennard,the court held that the fifth circuit uniquely severe permanent handicap and nexus tests for identifying penry evidence were incorrect,and that for coa purposes,reasonable jurists would find debatable or wrong the district court disposition of tennard penry claim.tennard,at.at.indeed,tennard found that the petitioner low iq evidence had the same essential features as penry mental retardation evidence his low iq could be considered irrelevant to mitigation while having only aggravating relevance to his future dangerousness.id.at.at.tennard did not cite graham or johnson.because the decision expressly models its analysis on penry i,it can not be said to extend penry i or to undercut graham or johnson.
nowhere does tennard require that the jury be able to give full effect to mitigating evidence in its sentencing deliberations.instead,the court quotes a potpourri of earlier decisions requiring states to enable the jury to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence forbidding states to preclude the sentencer from considering any relevant mitigating evidence and asserting virtually no limits on a defendant ability to proffer relevant mitigating evidence tennard compels texas courts confronted with low iq evidence to submit a proper special issue tennard also counsels evaluation of petitioners mitigation evidence for its application within the texas special issues.
a final word about tennard justice kennedy concurred.does this mean that he had changed his mind since he wrote johnson,or that he viewed tennard as reconcilable with johnson a reasonable jurist would draw the latter conclusion,since one can hardly assume justice kennedy would have failed to explain his departure from the very explicit cabining of penry i that he accomplished with the majority opinion in johnson.
smith texas,d,is the most recent case in the penry line,and it,too,represents a narrow procedural holding.the court reversed a texas court of criminal appeals decision that utilized the constitutional relevance tests adopted by the fifth circuit but rejected in tennard,and purported to distinguish a nullification instruction from the instruction overruled by the supreme court in penry ii.that the court would enforce its prior decisions with a per curiam reversal is hardly surprising.that the court would employ such a brief opinion to expand the reach of penry i and undermine graham and johnson sub silentio is unlikely.the majority in this case points to language supporting the unlikely reading.smith initially quotes penry ii as holding a similar nullification instruction inadequate to enable a jury to give full consideration and full effect to defendant mitigating circumstances.in the third paragraph of the decision,the court states approximately two years prior to the trial,we had held that presenting only these two special issues,without additional instructions regarding the jury duty to consider mitigation evidence,violated the eighth amendment.id.at.at citation omitted.after explaining the plain errors in the state court decision,the smith court states that as in penry ii,the burden of proof on the state was tied by law to findings of deliberateness and future dangerousness that had little,if anything,to do with the mitigation evidence petitioner presented.id.at.at footnote omitted.smith mitigation evidence included potentially organic learning disabilities and speech handicaps low iq and special education in school good behavior in school a criminal father and his age of nineteen at the date of the offense.smith concludes,without analysis of the types of mitigating evidence,that because it was relevant mitigation evidence for the jury under tennard and penry i,the nullification instruction was inadequate under penry ii.id.at.at.
this court may not overlook the potentially broad language in smith.on the other hand,smith failed to cite or distinguish jurek,franklin,graham,or johnson.since chief justice rehnquist and justice kennedy joined smith,the question again arises whether they did so in deference not just to a limited view of penry ii and tennard but also,and without explanation,to a de facto overruling of graham and johnson through smith casual incorporation of the appellant youth,good school behavior,and disadvantaged not abused childhood as penry mitigation evidence.
finally,notwithstanding smith two references to full effect,the opinion also quotes penry ii as recognizing that the key under penry i is that the jury be able to consider and give effect to a defendant mitigation evidence in imposing sentence.smith,at.at emphasis in original.
giving effect to mitigating evidence is not the same as allowing a jury to give full effect.the latter formulation,in effect,rejects a state ability to focus the jury consideration of mitigating evidence.here lies the crux of our difference with today majority opinion.despite its efforts to turn narrow procedural decisions and imprecise language into a constitutional mandate of full effect,the supreme court case law will not support that conclusion.as an inferior court,we can overlook neither jurek,franklin,graham,and johnson,nor penry i,penry ii,tennard and smith.sadly,for the state of texas,for certainty and stare decisis,and for defendants who deserve to know their fate before the last minute,we seem no further along in understanding the court pronouncements today than we were fifteen years ago when we reheard graham en banc.see graham collins,cir en banc,aff,d.
the interrelated rules we believe must be holistically drawn from the court we are told as follows first,courts must consider all mitigating evidence for its comprehensibility within the texas special issues.second,if,as with penry i and tennard low iq evidence,the proffered evidence has only aggravating force beyond the issues of deliberateness and future dangerousness,is required.in such cases,the proffered evidence was beyond the effective reach of the jury such that the jury was precluded from considering the evidence.third,evidence of such qualities as a defendant youthfulness at the date of the crime and a transient can,however,be considered within the special issues.
iii.the mitigating evidence 
nelson offered in evidence that l his mother rejected him he had troubled relationships with his brother and women he was denied a relationship with his child he was intoxicated by drugs and alcohol when he committed the crime and he suffered from a treatable borderline personality disorder.the majority opinion dwells principally on the last element,subsidiarily on the rejection by his mother,and not at all on nelson substance abuse or other troubled relationships.consequently,we focus on the first two characteristics.it must be pointed out,though,that the majority full effect test apparently renders the texas sentencing hearing constitutionally inadequate for any mitigating evidence except for youthfulness and good behavior in prison after all,nearly any mitigating evidence can be said to have some arguable relevance beyond the deliberateness and future dangerousness inquiries.
nelson expert,hickman,testified that nelson had anger issues resulting from his childhood experiences,and that treatment for his borderline personality disorder would require psychotherapy and medication.hickman also suggested that individuals with borderline personality disorder tend to be difficult to treat,and success with nelson was not guaranteed.however,hickman further testified that if successfully treated,nelson would no longer represent a danger to society.
nelson evidence is fundamentally distinguishable from that of penry,who was presented as being beyond treatment because of an insufficient mental acuity and inability to learn from his mistakes.in contrast,nelson defense offered the jury evidence that nelson could get better,and that if he spent the rest of his life in prison,he would no longer represent a future danger to society.unlike penry,but like the defendant in graham,nelson attorneys could honestly and vigorously urge the jury to answer no to the special issues based upon the evidence presented.graham,at.at.
with regard to the deliberateness of the crime,nelson jury could have concluded,based on his upbringing,his anger issues and his poor impulse control,that he did not sexually abuse his victims and murder charla wheat deliberately.he was,in other words,too warped to have acted responsibly.alternatively,the jury could have balanced these mitigating factors against his drug abuse and intoxication,and the speculation embodied in hickman connecting his behavioral problems to the crime,and found this crime to be deliberate.
nelson jury was also presented with clear alternatives in regard to future dangerousness.it could believe hickman testimony and conclude that nelson was less morally culpable,given his mental illness,and that with proper treatment,nelson would not present a future danger.alternatively,the jury could follow the prosecution theory that nelson was fully culpable for his actions and would continue to be dangerous even in prison that the jury chose the latter assessment of nelson does not mean that habeas relief must issue.indeed,in order to even make a plausible argument that a penry violation occurred in the instant case,the majority recasts the record to suggest that nelson would be untreatable.this is simply not the case.hickman purpose for testifying was not just to illustrate nelson condition but to demonstrate his potential for change.that potential clearly found mitigating expression in both the deliberateness and future dangerousness issues 
because this case is reviewed under aedpa,we must,as the majority acknowledges,find the state courts resolution of the penry issue not simply wrong,but unreasonable.further,the unreasonableness must here stem from a conclusion that there is a reasonable likelihood not a mere possibility that the jury applied the two issues in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.johnson,at.at paraphrasing boyde,at.at.the reasonable likelihood standard is applied according to a commonsense understanding of the record in the light of all that has taken place at the trial.id.at.at.finally,the fact that a juror might view the evidence as aggravating,as opposed to mitigating,does not mean that the rule of lockett is violated.johnson,at.at.as illustrated above,there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the special issues in an unconstitutional manner in expressing its reasoned moral response to nelson evidence,the jury could have relied upon hickman testimony and concluded that nelson would not remain a danger in prison.based on our interpretation that johnson and graham remain good law,coexisting with penry and its progeny,we can not subscribe to the unreasonableness of the state courts determination.
clearly,the evidence of a treatable mental condition and a deprived family background could be afforded decisive,if perhaps not full,mitigating effect under the sentencing scheme.the court stated in graham 
we see no reason to regard the circumstances of graham family background and positive character traits in a different light from franklin.graham evidence of transient upbringing while his mother spent long periods hospitalized for a nervous condition more closely resembles jurek evidence of age,employment history,and familial ties than it does penry evidence of mental retardation and harsh physical abuse.
graham,at.at.
the court,of course,held in graham that to require an additional jury instruction would be a new rule of constitutional law.we do not pretend that nelson evidence of personality disorder and maternal rejection is on all fours with jurek,franklin,graham,or johnson.but the majority can not pretend that such a treatable mental condition and not harsh physical abuse compels habeas relief based on penry i,penry ii,tennard or smith 
reinforcing our conclusion is the inconsistency between the majority analysis of a treatable mental disorder today and our court analysis of an untreatable mental year ago.see bigby dretke,cir.today majority overrules the decision in lucas johnson,cir,which held that the texas special issues furnished sufficient scope for a jury to give effect to evidence of a treatable mental condition.id.at.last year,in bigby,the author of today opinion distinguished lucas because of the different ramifications of a treatable mental disorder under the texas special issues.bigby,at.if bigby found no conflict between lucas and the court decisions in the penry line,how can the majority assert today that a comparable decision by the texas courts was unreasonable 
iv.conclusion 
nelson evidence had constitutionally adequate mitigating effect as to both of the special issues,and his jury was neither foreclosed from giving effect to the evidence by the texas special issues,nor was it put in the position of rendering a false verdict,as in penry i and penry ii.if the majority expansive reading of penry compels the result reached today,it is to be hoped that the supreme court will so inform us definitively in the cases now pending before it.because none of the court precedents to date compels the full effect test or the result reached by the majority,it can not be said that the state courts unreasonably applied federal law.i would deny habeas relief,and therefore,i respectfully dissent.
i enthusiastically join the superb dissenting opinions penned respectively by chief judge jones and judges clement and owen.i dissent separately,not to discuss the merits of this case but to highlight the embarrassing procedural tangle caused by the various actions of the supreme court and this court in cases.
in its penry cases,this court has been inconsistent in deciding whether to finalize a case and issue the mandate,grant en banc rehearing,or hold a case indefinitely.presumably the instant case nelson was taken en banc to reconcile this circuit penry is,to harmonize our numerous cases with each other and with the opaque pronouncements of the supreme court but if that were true,one would think the court would want to hold up on finalizing any penry decisions until the en banc court has spoken.instead,we have had a potpourri of actions on our various penry cases.any plan to step back and comprehensively review our penry jurisprudence has crashed and burned.
an examination of the time line in this court penry cases only adds to the confusion.the panel decision in nelson was issued on august,the supreme court issued tennard dretke,d,on june.four days later the court granted certiorari,vacated,and remanded nelson for further consideration in light of tennard 
on remand in nelson,this court issued its panel opinion on march,stating that t his death penalty case is reconsidered pursuant to the supreme court instruction following its summary grant of certiorari and the vacating of our prior opinion based on tennard no petition for rehearing or for rehearing en banc was ever filed in nelson.nonetheless,on march,this court,on the court own motion,voted to rehear nelson en banc 
in tennard,which is the most prominent recent fifth circuit penry case,however,no judge held the mandate to await an en banc decision in nelson.tennard is the most significant of our current penry cases because the supreme court vacated the panel opinion and,in an opinion by justice,rebuked this court for its approach to penry questions on remand in tennard,a fifth circuit panel issued its opinion on march,which is coincidentally the same day the panel opinion in nelson,remanded in light of tennard,also issued yet,no judge held the mandate in tennard,and no effort was made either to reconsider tennard en banc or to put that case on hold pending en banc review in nelson.one can only guess that a significant fact for some judges was that the habeas petitioner had prevailed on remand in tennard moreover,the losing party the state did not petition for rehearing.
other penry cases of note were active at this time.on november,the supreme court had vacated and remanded cole dretke.cir.may,per curiam,for reconsideration in light of tennard the panel issued its opinion on remand in cole dretke,cir.july,and affirmed the judgment denying habeas relief.in cole dretke,cir,per curiam,however,and unlike in nelson,this court,after a poll,denied rehearing en banc over a strong dissent that included the following statement the responsible,efficient and just course would have been for us to resolve promptly en banc the important issues raised by the cole panel decision and allow time for possible correction by the supreme court before permitting our numerous other death penalty panels to generate more decisions without either en banc or renewed supreme court guidance.this was four days after the court had granted en banc review in nelson.
also pending is coble dretke,cir,in which the panel,vacating the opinion it had issued in coble dretke,cir,took specific account of the supreme court decisions in tennard and smith texas,d,per curiam,in affirming the dismissal of the habeas petition a judge placed a hold on the mandate in coble from august,through march,and again from july,to the present.a petition for rehearing en banc is pending in coble,but there has been no en banc poll.
somewhat similarly situated to coble is the brewer case,in which the panel issued its initial opinion on may,on june,a judge placed a hold on the mandate and has not released it in the intervening eighteen months.on march,same day the panel opinion issued in panel,in brewer dretke,cir per curiam,denied the petition for panel rehearing taking no action on the petition for rehearing en banc,withdrew its opinion,and issued a new one.a petition for rehearing en banc remains pending in brewer.
and then there is,finally,garcia quarterman,cir.july.there the panel grappled with tennard and with this court relevant caselaw,including brewer and bigby dretke,cir,cert.denied,d.a judge held the mandate in garcia on july,and a petition for rehearing en banc remains pending.
the supreme court responses to the foregoing have been somewhat perplexing after the issuance of its latest opinion in tennard.the most surprising development is that on october,the court granted a petition for writ of certiorari in brewer this is peculiar,because in brewer the fifth circuit has not yet acted on the petition for rehearing en banc and has not issued the mandate.possibly the high court relied on the inaccurate statement in brewer certiorari petition that his petition for rehearing en banc was eventually denied.in fact,our order withdrawing the first opinion specifically stated that t he petition for panel rehearing is denied.brewer remains pending in this court,awaiting,at least in part,the issuance of the en banc decision in nelson.
there is no jurisdictional bar to supreme court review of cases from the courts of appeals,but it is unusual perhaps the court,in granting review in brewer despite its in this court,was influenced by brewer insistence that the court intervention is once again necessary to resolve once and for all the enduring confusion in the courts below regarding the scope of penry.yet,the postures of brewer,coble,and garcia are the same in this court in all three,panel opinions denying habeas relief have been issued,petitions for rehearing en banc have been filed,and the mandates have been stayed.the only difference is that in brewer the petitioner,based on a mistaken view of the procedural status of the case in the court of appeals,filed a certiorari petition and has been rewarded for whatever reason with the supreme court grant of review.
the supreme court has scheduled a trifecta of penry cases for argument on january.the same day it granted certiorari in brewer,it also did so in cole,with cole and brewer consolidated for argument one week before granting certiorari in brewer and cole,the court granted review in a penry case from the texas state courts the court willingness to address penry questions once again is welcome.perhaps the high court will issue a like the one justice penned in tennard if so,it will be despite this court honest attempts to apply the court sundry pronouncements.
as chief judge jones wisely states in her dissent in nelson,t his court can not underrule the supreme court.our duty is to harmonize its decisions as well as possible.we are always bound by the force of stare decisis.so maybe,on the other hand,the current court will determine that the various panels of this court,in the cases discussed above,have correctly applied the court precedents,as my dissenting colleagues show in their able opinions.
in this regard,it is unfortunate that the en banc majority in nelson has insisted on issuing its majority opinion at this time,in the wake of the grants of certiorari that i have noted.instead,this court should have denied en banc rehearing in all the recent penry cases nelson,brewer,cole,coble,and garcia,so as to give the supreme court the option of picking various ones of them for review.by our piecemeal and inconsistent approach,we have the incongruous situation of some cases held and others not,and of some with certiorari petitions and some not,and lastly of a case nelson in which this court granted en banc review without even the benefit of a petition for rehearing,and now has insisted on issuing an en banc majority opinion in nelson without the predictable guidance that will come from the supreme court review in the cases to be argued on january.the en banc majority rush to judgment is,in that sense,truly regrettable,and i respectfully dissent.
aedpa requires us to defer to the state habeas court determination that the jury was not prevented from considering all the mitigating evidence within the special issues because that holding is neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
while this court has had many occasions to address penry issues generally,the supreme court has spoken relatively very few times on the contentious issue presently before us jurek youth,employment history,aid to family,franklin good behavior in prison,penry i ii mental retardation,child abuse,graham youth,transient upbringing,good character traits johnson youth,tennard constitutional relevance,low iq,and smith constitutional relevance,penry ii instruction,youth,organic learning disability,low iq,good behavior in school,father.none of those cases deal specifically with the type of mitigating evidence offered by nelson,familial discord rejection by his mother,trouble with his brother,inability to relate to his illegitimate child,drug and alcohol addiction and abuse,and theoretically treatable borderline personality disorder.further,none of those cases gave the supreme court the before apply aedpa principles to focus on the reasonableness of the state court ruling rather than the merits of the petitioner claim since the supreme court has not spoken to the precise type of mitigating evidence at issue certainly had not done so by,when nelson conviction became will be difficult to say that,under aedpa,the state habeas court acted contrary to or unreasonably applied federal law as determined by the supreme court.the supreme court decision in brown payton,d,is and deserves more emphasis than the majority opinion grants it.there,the california supreme court,applying boyde california,d,had held that there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury believed it was required to disregard the petitioner mitigating evidence while applying the jury instructions payton,at.the ninth circuit,concluding that the state court unreasonably erred,granted habeas relief id.at.stringently applying aedpa deferential standard of review,the supreme court reversed the ninth circuit.id.at.the court held that,under aedpa,e ven on the assumption that the state court conclusion was incorrect,it was not unreasonable,and is therefore just the type of decision that aedpa shields on habeas review.id.at.concurring,justice breyer stated that,in my view,this is a case in which congress instruction to defer to the reasonable conclusions of judges makes a critical difference.id.at.breyer,concurring.
were i a california state judge,i would likely hold that payton proceedings violated the eighth amendment t here might well have been a reasonable likelihood that the jury interpreted the challenged jury instruction in a way that prevent ed it from considering constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence 
nonetheless,f or the reasons that the court discusses,i can not say that the california supreme court decision fails aedpa deferential test.
id.at.fourth alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
while payton does not address the texas special issues,it nonetheless supports the proposition that,under aedpa,federal courts sitting in habeas review of state convictions must defer to reasonable state court determinations regarding the constitutionality of jury instructions.where,as here,there is no directly applicable supreme court precedent and the question is so close,a federal court can not conclude that the state court unreasonably applied supreme court precedent.see payton,at.noting that the ninth circuit cited no precedent of this court to support its position that the state court acted contrary to or unreasonably applied supreme court precedent.see also mitchell esparza,d a federal court may not overrule a state court for simply holding a view different from its own,when the precedent from this court is,at best,ambiguous.
our circuit has spent considerable time and effort trying to divine whether the jury was precluded from considering various mitigating evidence within the confines of the special issues.such a close review of state court convictions is neither envisaged nor permissible under the standard of review imposed by aedpa.congress has limited the scope of our habeas review,and we must accede.under that deferential review,i simply fail to see how a majority of this court can hold unequivocally that the state habeas court not just has erred certainly a debatable prospect but has erred unreasonably so as to merit federal habeas relief.
the dissents of chief judge jones and judge clement make salient points.i write to emphasize the standard of review that must be applied and that,given the state of the law when nelson conviction and sentence became final in,the texas court application of united states supreme court precedent was not objectively unreasonable.the supreme court has admonished that in habeas review the most important point is that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.the majority has failed to draw this distinction.it was not objectively unreasonable to conclude that nelson mitigating evidence was distinguishable from the mental retardation and low intelligence at issue in penry lynaugh penry i tennard dretke and smith texas and was instead more similar to the transient qualities of youth at issue in johnson and graham collins 
the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed nelson sentence on direct review in,rejecting his argument that the special issues submitted to the jury failed to permit adequate consideration of mitigating evidence that judgment became final when the united states supreme court denied review in nelson then initiated habeas corpus proceedings.
habeas review in federal courts of state court proceedings is governed by,and the inquiry before us today is whether the state proceedings resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.the supreme court has held that the phrase clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court means the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of this court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.
at the time the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed the judgment in nelson direct appeal,the supreme court most recent pronouncements regarding the texas special issues submitted in death penalty cases tried before were graham collins which considered a habeas petition,and johnson texas which was a direct review of a death sentence.both decisions extensively surveyed the supreme court jurisprudence regarding mitigating evidence and the texas special issues under consideration today.in both graham and johnson,the primary question was whether the special issues allowed juries to give mitigating effect to a defendant youth 
in graham and johnson,the supreme court discussed its decision in penry i,a habeas proceeding in which penry presented evidence indicating that he had a low iq,had mild to moderate mental retardation,and had been beaten and received multiple head injuries at an early age the court held that the texas special issues did not allow the jury to give effect to all of penry mitigating evidence three issues were submitted to the jury,and a no answer to any of them would have resulted in a life sentence rather than the death penalty 
the first special issue inquired if penry acted deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased would result.the supreme court held that assuming the jury understood deliberately to mean something more than that penry was guilty of intentionally committing murder,those jurors may still have been unable to give effect to penry mitigating evidence.penry mental retardation,while relevant to whether he was capable of acting deliberately,also had relevance to his moral culpability.the supreme court concluded that because the first special issue did not defin e deliberately in a way that would clearly direct the jury to consider penry mitigating evidence as it bears on his personal culpability,the supreme court could not be sure that the jury was able to give effect to the mitigating evidence of penry mental retardation and history of abuse in answering the first special issue.the same could be said of nelson borderline personality disorder.
the second special issue inquired whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.in penry case,one effect of his retardation was his inability to learn from his mistakes.in penry i,the supreme court reasoned that penry mental retardation was relevant to the future dangerousness issue but only as an aggravating factor because it suggests a yes answer to the question of future dangerousness.the court held,the second special issue,therefore,did not provide a vehicle for the jury to give mitigating effect to penry evidence of mental retardation and childhood abuse.
subsequently,in graham the supreme court emphasized that the jury answer to the second special issue in penry case could not give effect to the mitigating aspects of his mental retardation and abuse because a lthough penry evidence of mental impairment and childhood abuse indeed had relevance to the future dangerousness inquiry,its relevance was aggravating only.the graham decision reasoned,penry evidence compelled an affirmative answer to that future dangerousness inquiry,despite its mitigating significance.by contrast,in graham,the defendant youth quite readily could have supported a negative answer.
the supreme court decision a few months later in johnson likewise draws a distinction between the type of evidence at issue in penry i and certain other categories of mitigating evidence the court that the constitutionality of jury submissions in death penalty cases turns on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.in making that determination,the johnson decision sets forth at least three important,principles even if a juror might view the evidence as both aggravating and mitigating,the eighth amendment has been satisfied a s long as the mitigating evidence is within the effective reach of a sentencer,a state is not required to allow a jury to give effect to mitigating evidence in every conceivable manner in which the evidence might be relevant,and a state is permitted to structure consideration of relevant mitigating evidence as long as the jury is allowed to give effect to that evidence through at least one vehicle in making the sentencing decision 
in johnson,the supreme court expressly rejected the argument that the perspective of the future dangerousness inquiry did not allow the jury to take account of how petitioner youth bore upon his personal culpability for the murder he committed.the supreme court reasoned that the inquiry is not independent of an assessment of personal culpability.it is both logical and fair for the jury to make its determination of a defendant future dangerousness by asking the extent to which youth influenced the defendant conduct.the court also expressly rejected the related argument that the texas special issues did not permit the jury to make a reasoned moral response to the defendant youth because the issue inquired only about future dangerousness the court concluded that the use of the term continuing threat to society in the future dangerousness special issue afford ed the jury room for independent judgment in reaching its decision,explaining,indeed,we can not forget that a texas capital jury deliberating over the special issues is aware of the consequences of its answers,and is likely to weigh mitigating evidence as it formulates these answers in a manner similar to that employed by capital juries in pure balancing states.
perhaps most importantly,the supreme court held in johnson that a state may structure consideration of mitigating evidence and that providing one vehicle through which to give effect to mitigating evidence satisfies constitutional requirements the court explained,it is true that texas has structured consideration of the relevant qualities of petitioner youth,but in so doing,the state still allow s the jury to give effect to this mitigating evidence in making the sentencing decision.a state is not required to provide more than one avenue for giving effect to mitigating evidence although texas might have provided other vehicles for consideration of petitioner youth,no additional instruction beyond that given as to future dangerousness was required in order for the jury to be able to consider the mitigating qualities of youth presented to it.
in answering the relevant question on direct review of a death sentence,which is whether the texas special issues allowed adequate consideration of mitigating evidence the supreme court reiterated in johnson that a reviewing court must determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.the court found no such likelihood with regard to a defendant youth.if any jurors believed that the transient qualities of petitioner youth made him less culpable for the murder,there is no reasonable likelihood that those jurors would have deemed themselves foreclosed from considering that in evaluating petitioner future dangerousness.
against this backdrop,we must determine whether the texas court decided nelson case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.as noted,this is not a direct appeal nelson seeks a writ of habeas corpus.a federal habeas court making the unreasonable application inquiry under d should ask whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.in light of penry i,graham,and johnson,it can not be said that it would be objectively unreasonable to conclude that nelson mitigating evidence is distinguishable from penry evidence or is more comparable to graham and johnson youth.even if a court might conclude,as the majority in this case does,that the texas court incorrectly applied federal law,that is not a basis for granting habeas relief.again,the supreme court has held that the most important point is that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.
unlike mental retardation or low intelligence,which are generally static conditions,the evidence regarding nelson borderline personality disorder is not solely aggravating with regard to his future dangerousness.the majority opinion and chief judge jones dissent describe the expert testimony in some detail,and i will not duplicate those discussions.the important point is that although nelson expert witness conceded that those suffering from borderline personality disorder can be difficult to treat and there was no guarantee nelson treatment would be successful,the expert opined that nelson disorder was treatable with medication and psychotherapy over a period of two to five years.i agree with judge clement dissenting opinion that nelson borderline personality disorder falls somewhere on a continuum between penry mental retardation and graham youth 
the established law in johnson and graham is that the attributes of youth place it in a different category than mental retardation the relevance of youth as a mitigating factor derives from the fact that the signature qualities of youth are transient as individuals mature,the impetuousness and recklessness that may dominate in younger years can subside.a jury can give adequate effect to the mitigating aspects of youth in answering the future dangerousness issue because the inquiry is not independent of an assessment of personal culpability.it is both logical and fair for the jury to make its determination of a defendant future dangerousness by asking the extent to which youth influenced the defendant conduct.the future dangerousness issue is adequate even though a jury is free to conclude that youth did not influence the defendant conduct or that the attributes of youth,such as impetuousness and recklessness,will not subside as to this defendant.it was not unreasonable for the texas court to conclude that the same can be said of the evidence regarding nelson borderline personality disorder and the prospects for its treatment.the jury may have concluded that nelson disorder was treatable,or that it was not,just as juries may conclude that the attributes of youth are not transient as to a particular defendant.a court conducting a direct review of the texas court decision to place the evidence of nelson borderline personality disorder in the same category as youth might conclude that the texas court erred,but it was not unreasonable for the texas court to treat nelson evidence as similar to evidence of youth,given the supreme court precedent.
the evidence also reflected that nelson mother did not love him and shunned him.nelson expert testified that his mother conduct likely contributed to or exacerbated nelson borderline personality disorder.to the extent nelson abusive treatment from his mother must be considered independently from his mental condition,it is not unreasonable to conclude that this evidence,as well as evidence regarding nelson troubled relationships with his brother and women and his inability to have a relationship with his child born out of wedlock,is more similar to graham evidence of transient upbringing and otherwise nonviolent character than it is to the harsh,physical abuse inflicted upon penry as a child the texas court did not unreasonably apply the supreme court holding in graham and johnson that additional instructions or an additional jury issue are not required simply because mitigating evidence has some arguable relevance beyond the special issues.the supreme court said in both graham and johnson 
h olding that a defendant is entitled to special instructions whenever he can offer mitigating evidence that has some arguable relevance beyond the special issues would be to require in all cases that a fourth special issue be put to the jury does any mitigating evidence before you,whether or not relevant to the above three questions,lead you to believe that the death penalty should not be imposed 
the court observed that t he first casualty of a holding that would require an additional issue whenever evidence had some relevance beyond the special issues would be jurek.the inevitable consequence of petitioner argument is that the texas special issues system in almost every case would have to be supplemented by a further instruction.the supreme court held that as long as a jury was able to consider in some manner all of a defendant relevant mitigating evidence,a state was not required to allow a jury to give effect to mitigating evidence in every conceivable manner in which the evidence might be relevant.the texas court was not unreasonable in applying this precedent.
additionally,during closing arguments,the prosecutor twice suggested that the jury might conclude that nelson was not morally culpable for the murder because of his mother or others treatment of him and urged the jurors not to do so this indicates it was unlikely the jury thought that it could not give effect to evidence of childhood abuse in considering nelson moral culpability and answering the future dangerousness issue.as was the case in ayers belmontes,it is improbable the jurors believed that the parties were engaging in an exercise in futility when respondent presented and both counsel later discussed his mitigating evidence in open court.at the very least,the record indicates that the texas court would not have been unreasonable in concluding the jury could give effect to this evidence.
as to evidence of nelson substance abuse,no one questions that the deliberateness issue provided an adequate vehicle.
the supreme court decisions in penry johnson penry ii tennard dretke and smith do not render the texas court application of established supreme court precedent unreasonable.none of those decisions holds that additional instructions or another issue is necessary when mitigating evidence can be given effect in answering either the deliberately special issue or the future dangerousness special issue under texas law.
in penry ii,penry had been retried subsequent to penry i,and the trial court submitted a third issue,in addition to the deliberately and future dangerousness issues the supreme court held that the third issue was subject to two possible interpretations,and that neither interpretation cured the infirmity of the first two issues as applied to penry evidence the third issue either had no practical or essentially directed the jury to change truthful yes answers to the first two issues to no.
in penry ii,in a see also cite,the court quoted from justice dissent in johnson,noting in a parenthetical,a sentencer must be allowed to give full consideration and full effect to mitigating circumstances emphasis in original.but in the very next sentence,the court adhered to penry i,requiring only a vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response to that evidence in rendering its sentencing decision.the reference to full effect and full consideration can not be taken as a retraction of one of johnson core holdings although texas might have provided other vehicles for consideration of petitioner mitigating evidence,no additional instruction beyond that given as to future dangerousness was required in order for the jury to be able to consider the mitigating qualities of youth presented to it.
in tennard,the supreme court considered in some detail what constitutes mitigating evidence,explaining that the threshold was a low one in deciding if there was a mitigating aspect the court rejected this circuit uniquely severe permanent handicap and nexus tests and held that reasonable jurists would find debatable or wrong the state court disposition of tennard penry claim.
in smith,the supreme court again quoted the passage from justice dissenting opinion in johnson that said a sentencer must be allowed to give full effect to mitigating circumstances.at issue was a nullification question,similar but not identical to the one submitted in penry ii that essentially instructed the jury to return a false answer to a special issue in order to avoid a death sentence.the supreme court explained in smith the import of its holdings in tennard and penry ii 
rather,we held that the jury must be given an effective vehicle with which to weigh mitigating evidence so long as the defendant has met a low threshold for relevance,which is satisfied by evidence which tends logically to prove or disprove some fact or circumstance which a could reasonably deem to have mitigating value.
the court held in smith that the burden of proof on the state was tied by law to findings of deliberateness and future dangerousness that had little,if anything,to do with the mitigation evidence petitioner presented.smith had a low iq and was placed in special education classes,indicating low intelligence,a condition that was not transient or treatable similarly,in tennard,the defendant had an iq of,indicating low intelligence no mitigating effect could be given to low intelligence through a jury answer to the future dangerousness issue it is not unreasonable to conclude that nelson borderline personality disorder and potential treatment for that condition is distinguishable from smith and tennard mitigating circumstances in this regard.
neither tennard nor smith purports to overrule the holding in johnson that a state is only required to provide one avenue for giving effect to mitigating evidence,not multiple vehicles a no answer to the future dangerousness issue based on nelson mitigating evidence would have given full effect to that evidence.to paraphrase johnson,if any jurors believed that nelson borderline personality disorder was transient because it was treatable and his condition made him less culpable for murder,there is no reasonable likelihood that those jurors would have deemed themselves foreclosed from considering that in evaluating nelson future dangerousness 
the texas court was not objectively unreasonable in applying the supreme court established precedent to the facts presented.it was not objectively unreasonable to conclude that evidence of nelson borderline personality disorder and the prospects for its treatment was less similar to mental and low and more similar to the transient qualities of youth accordingly,i dissent.
although the texas legislature amended the special issues sentencing scheme in,nelson was sentenced under the version of the special issues.in some cases,the jury was also given a third special issue addressing provocation.nelson jury did not receive a provocation instruction,and therefore we do not address that aspect of the special issues sentencing scheme here.
the test required that petitioner evidence show a uniquely severe permanent handicap with which the defendant was burdened through no fault of his own and that the criminal act was attributable to this severe permanent condition.davis scott,cir citations omitted alteration in original.as discussed below,in tennard dretke,at,the supreme court rejected the constitutional relevance test and reaffirmed that the standard for relevance is any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.id.internal quotations omitted.

tennard conviction became final when the supreme court denied certiorari on his direct appeal on june.tennard texas,d.under aedpa,therefore,the supreme court duty in tennard was to determine whether the texas court of criminal appeals unreasonably applied federal law that was clearly established as of june.in light of aedpa mandate,the tennard court insistence that a jury be able to consider and give effect to evidence with mitigating relevance to a defendant moral culpability in addition to the special issues indicates that the standard was well in place by indeed,as explained above,this standard,which is the same standard that the court applied in penry i,was dictated by eddings and lockett.penry i,at.nelson conviction became final in,three years after tennard.nelson texas,d.
the sui generis nature of youth in the death penalty context is perhaps best evidenced by the supreme court categorical holding in roper simmons,d,that the constitution prohibits the execution of persons who were under eighteen years of age at the time of their crime.see id.at.noting that three unique characteristics of youth mitigate juveniles moral culpability for certain behavior a lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,which often result in impetuous and actions and decisions increased vulnerab ility or susceptib ility to negative influences and outside pressures,including peer pressure and that the character of a juvenile is not as well formed as that of an adult.the personality traits of juveniles are more transitory,less fixed citing johnson,at.eddings,at.
compare johnson,in which the supreme court singled out youth,as opposed to other conditions that could be transitory,because its ephemeral nature is bound up in its mitigating impact such that a juror could not reasonably assess youth as a mitigating factor without taking into account this aspect of transience.see johnson,at.emphasizing that the impact of youth on the defendant conduct is not independent of an assessment of personal culpability.because this transient quality is so subsumed within the mitigating relevance of youth,the court did not inquire whether the jury might have found that johnson was likely to mature as he grew up before it held that the jury could give full effect to youth through the issue the undisputed chronological fact of the defendant age was enough.in contrast,under the approach favored by the dissenting opinions of chief judge jones and judge owen in this case,when presented with mitigating evidence of a possibly treatable mental illness,an appellate habeas court must conduct such an inquiry into the jury findings and weigh the evidence to determine whether the illness is treatable.perhaps for this very reason,the supreme court,which spoke about youth in very specific terms in johnson,has never extended johnson reasoning to any other mitigating possibly treatable mental might have transient characteristics.
the state reliance on calderon coleman,d,in support of its argument that the brecht test is applicable is misplaced.coleman involved a jury instruction that gave the jury inaccurate information on the governor power to commute a sentence,which the lower court found might have misled the jury and distracted it from the mitigating evidence presented.coleman is not at all comparable to cases involving penry violations,where the jury is precluded from giving its reasoned moral response to the defendant mitigating evidence.

in my dissent from a previous decision,i reached the same conclusion with respect to the penry i violation in that case,that it was a structural defect,not a trial error,and therefore could not be subjected to harmless error analysis.see hernandez johnson,cir dennis,dissenting.later,however,i became dissuaded of that view by my imperfect understanding of the relationship between the supreme court decisions in johnson texas,d,boyde california,d,calderon coleman,d,and the court structural error jurisprudence.after additional study and a better understanding of these supreme court decisions,i have returned to my original view that the type of constitutional violation here is a structural defect,not a trial error.i have set forth the reasons for my error and the need for its correction in the last section of this opinion dealing with the harmless error question.

in tuilaepa california,d,the court recognized that there were two phases of the capital sentencing process the eligibility decision,which serves to narrow the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty,and the selection decision,where the sentencer determines whether a defendant eligible for the death penalty should in fact receive that sentence.

under the fifth circuit rule at that time,to be constitutionally relevant,the defendant mitigating evidence had to show a uniquely severe permanent handicap with which the defendant was burdened through no fault of his own,and that the defendant criminal act was attributable to that severe condition.
