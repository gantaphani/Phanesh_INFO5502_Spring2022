this case arises from an act of filicide,in truth three acts of filicide,for reginald brooks murdered not just one of his sons but all three of them as they lay sleeping.outside of greek myth and the more fortunate sons of cronus,this is not something we want to read about or indeed frequently ever hear about.this father,no surprise,suffered from a serious psychological illness and engaged in several odd forms of behavior during the years before the murders,information that the sentencing court was told and that it accepted.the court also was told that brooks knew what he was doing on the morning of the murders,that he evaded responsibility for the crimes and that he had the capacity to appreciate what he did was wrong.
as is often true in the most appalling murder cases,the facts of the crime themselves add weight to both sides of the scales.the planned act of murdering one three children confirms the utter depravity of the crime at the same time it suggests the seriousness of the defendant psychological illness.in the end,the sentencing court found that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors and imposed three capital sentences on brooks.
the debate today is whether brooks trial counsel provided ineffective assistance during the penalty phase of the trial by failing adequately to investigate his history and background.in support of this theory,brooks principally offered three pieces of new evidence that his three lawyers,one investigator,one psychiatrist and one psychologist apparently did not discover and that they did not introduce during the mitigation that,during the two or so years before the murders,brooks had practiced voodoo,accused his wife of having an incestuous relationship with their oldest son and refused to allow the same son to display his athletic trophies.the state courts rejected this claim in part because the sentencing court already had ample evidence of brooks serious psychological illness and other manifestations of that illness in front of it.the district court rejected his federal habeas claim as well.because the state courts resolution of this claim was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established supreme court precedent,we affirm.
on saturday morning,march,beverly brooks left her home in cleveland,ohio,to go to work,leaving behind her three sons,who were still asleep,and her husband,reginald,who was awake and upon whom she had served divorce papers two days earlier.at roughly,after beverly had left the house,reginald shot each of his sons in the head while they were asleep in their beds.
by the time beverly returned home from work that day and discovered her dead children,brooks had boarded a bus to las vegas,nevada.on march,after tracing the credit card brooks had used to purchase his bus ticket,police took him into custody in utah.although brooks told the police he was carrying just one piece of luggage,a search of his wallet produced a check for a second suitcase.inside that suitcase were brooks personal items and a box containing a fully loaded special revolver and ammunition.fingerprints on the gun box and two cartridges matched brooks fingerprints,and ballistics testing showed that the only two slugs that could be recovered from the victims were fired from the same special.authorities traced the gun to one that brooks had purchased on february,and found nitrate on the right sleeve of brooks coat.
on march,a grand jury indicted brooks on three counts of aggravated murder.brooks pleaded not guilty,after which the trial court referred him for a competency hearing.following a hearing at which a psychiatrist,aaron billowitz,testified that brooks suffered from schizophrenia,the court found brooks competent to stand trial,reasoning that he has the ability to understand the charge against him and work and cooperate with his attorneys in his defense.
brooks waived his right to a jury trial and,as permitted under ohio law,proceeded to trial before a panel.during the guilt phase of the trial,brooks prohibited his lawyers from presenting an opening or closing statement,putting on any witnesses or certain witnesses.on september,the panel found brooks guilty of the aggravated murders of his sons and referred him for a presentence investigation and psychiatric evaluation.
at the sentencing hearing on november,brooks presented three witnesses stanley althof,kurt bertschinger and paul hrisko.althof,the chief psychologist at the cuyahoga county court psychiatric clinic,testified that brooks suffered from paranoid schizophrenia,which impair s a person,reduce s his judgment,reduce s his control,and likely did contribute to the commission of some crime.bertschinger testified that brooks suffered from psychogenic amnesia,which prevented him from having conscious recall of the alleged criminal activities in which he was involved.because brooks amnesia prohibited bertschinger from obtain ing from brooks anything about the incident,and because there was absolutely no collateral information concerning brooks mental state at the time of the murders,bertschinger could make no opinion as to mitigating circumstances.hrisko,one of the three attorneys who represented brooks during the guilt and penalty phases of the trial,indicated that brooks refused to testify at both phases of the trial and that brooks refused to submit to a test,which psychiatrists use with trauma survivors to access repressed or unconscious material.
the state presented three witnesses at sentencing james hughey,brooks wife,beverly,and billowitz.trying to show that brooks understood psychology and had contrived his amnesia to appear incompetent,the state called hughey a cleveland police officer and beverly brooks to testify that,in the early,brooks had taken psychology courses and that books were recovered from brooks residence after the murders.the state called billowitz,a psychiatrist who evaluated brooks on four occasions and who submitted multiple reports to the court,to testify that brooks was legally sane at the time of the act.billowitz conceded on that brooks was schizophrenic at the time of this act and may have experienced paranoid delusions at that time,but nonetheless concluded that brooks maintained the capacity to appreciate that killing was wrong and had the capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law as indicated by the great amount of circumstantial evidence showing detailed planning and awareness of escaping detection.
on november,the panel sentenced brooks to death for each of the murders.in its written opinion,the panel recognized that brooks suffered from a mental before,during,and after commission of the murders,but concluded that the mental illness or defect did not cause him to lack substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.the panel also acknowledged that brooks family relationship had steadily deteriorated since and that i t was entirely conceivable that brooks was under extreme stress due to this deteriorated relationship,his lack of employment,and the threat of divorce including being served with divorce papers two days before the found that brooks free will was not impaired by these events or his mental illness.brooks,the court stated,in a single course of conduct,with prior calculation and design,chose to take a gun to the heads of his three sons and execute them through a twisted sense of jealousy,hatred,or despair.he had the ability to refrain from commission of those heinous acts.in reaching this conclusion,the panel rejected brooks claim of psychogenic amnesia,reasoning that he had amnesia only about those things that were incriminating,remembering things that were not incriminating,even though the incriminating and incidents or facts occurred at exactly the same time or close together in time h is denials were lies,not memory lapses,and he clearly was not a victim of psychogenic amnesia.the court in the end conclude d beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh all of the mitigating factors.
brooks appealed,arguing that his counsel provided ineffective assistance during the competency phase of the trial,that the trial court erred in finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors and that ohio scheme was unconstitutional.the state courts rejected all three arguments and affirmed his conviction and sentence.see state brooks,wl ohio,ohio brooks,ohio,ohio per curiam.the supreme court denied review.brooks ohio,d.
in,brooks filed a petition for relief in state court.among other claims,brooks contended that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel during the mitigation phase of the trial because his lawyers fail ed to adequately conduct a mitigation investigation and thus precluded his experts from receiving valuable information concerning his history.in support,brooks submitted affidavits from family members,friends,experts,attorneys and prison officials.those affidavits said that brooks counsel had not contacted certain family members and friends of brooks and that those family members and friends,if contacted,would have told brooks counsel additional information about his history.
ten years later,the trial court rejected all of brooks claims.it concluded that brooks arguments are without merit legally or factually and not supported by sufficient evidence through affidavits to require a hearing in this matter.nothing in the record explains why it took ten years for the court to decide this case.the court of appeals affirmed,see state brooks,wl,at ohio.june,and the state supreme court denied review,see state brooks,ohio,ohio.
on april,brooks filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court,raising claims for relief.in his ninth claim,brooks argued that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel during the mitigation phase of his trial.the district court held that the claim was procedurally defaulted and rejected it on the merits as well.the court rejected brooks other claims and denied brooks a certificate of appealability on any of his claims.we issued a certificate of appealability for three related claims arising from the mitigation phase of the trial whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance for failing to provide requested information to the retained mental health experts whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance for failing to investigate brooks background and personal history and whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance for failing to present mitigating evidence other than that addressing brooks competency.
because brooks filed his habeas petition after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,that statute potentially governs this case.we say potentially because aedpa deference applies only with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.d emphasis added.and in this case the ohio court of appeals seemed to reject brooks claim on alternative grounds,one of which was on the merits,the other of which was not the ruling.
because we doubt the soundness of the state court ruling and indeed whether it even enforced a procedural bar,we must consider whether the court alternative merits ruling receives aedpa deference.we think that it does.the language of the statute does not draw a distinction between cases involving alternative rulings it refers broadly to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.id.while the state court of appeals need not have addressed the claim on the merits once it identified a procedural bar,it surely had the authority to do so as an additional ground for this additional ground no less a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings than if the case had not presented a issue at all.in this respect,we see no material difference between this type of alternative ruling and another a state court offers alternative merits grounds for rejecting a claim.here,for example,the state court ruled that brooks failed to satisfy the and prejudice prongs of an claim,even though it need only have determined that brooks failed to satisfy just one of these prongs to resolve the claim.yet it would be strange to say that just one of these contentions was resolved on the merits or,worse,that neither one was.see wiggins smith,d applying aedpa deference to those prongs of strickland that the state courts reached.
this interpretation,moreover,would seem to favor judicial practices that in the main will benefit both sides in criminal cases.it is the rare criminal defendant who would prefer that the state courts not reach the merits of his constitutional claim.and it is the rare state that would object to a state court ruling that offers an additional ground for denying the defendant relief.above all,this practice will show a prisoner that it was not merely a procedural technicality that precluded him from obtaining relief.carey saffold,d.just as a state court wishing to invoke an independent and adequate state ground to dispose of a case need not fear reaching the merits of a federal claim in an alternative holding,harris reed,d emphasis omitted see also white schotten,cir,overruled on other grounds by lopez wilson,cir en banc,so it need not fear losing the benefit of the doubt that aedpa gives to state court rulings whenever it invokes an independent and adequate state ground as an alternative holding.
we have some company in taking this approach.all of the circuit courts that have considered the question to our knowledge have determined,albeit with little discussion,that an alternative ruling does not alter the applicability of aedpa.see zarvela artuz,cir busby dretke,cir johnson mckune,cir bacon lee,cir massachusetts united states.united states title ins.trust.
we therefore must review brooks claims based on the deferential requirements of aedpa.that means we may grant brooks application for habeas relief only if the state court adjudication of his claims resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
brooks does not contend that the state appellate court decision was contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent.and with good reason that decision correctly identifie d strickland as the controlling legal authority and thus was not mutually opposed to strickland itself.williams taylor,d.he instead contends that the decision unreasonably applied strickland.see id.at.
to establish ineffective assistance,a claimant must show that the attorney performance was deficient and that this performance prejudiced the defense.strickland washington,d.deficient performance occurs when the representation falls below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.prejudice occurs when there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.the question in this case is not whether brooks three attorneys had a duty to conduct an adequate investigation into his history and to provide his experts with the information they needed to present an effective defense.they clearly did.see id.at.glenn tate,cir.the question rather is whether counsel satisfied that duty and,if they did not,whether that failing prejudiced brooks defense.
in support of his and prejudice arguments,brooks presented several affidavits to the state courts in his papers.in rejecting his claim,the state court of appeals offered the following reasons,among others 
t he information in the affidavits submitted by him in support of his petition was not sufficient to warrant relief or an evidentiary hearing.the information is similar to that rejected in other cases denying petitions raising claims of ineffective assistance in litigating a capital defendant mental status.new information that provides only additional detail to that presented at trial or that is simply cumulative or alternative to that presented at trial does not provide grounds for relief.
brooks,wl,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we will consider each of these affidavits in turn.
affidavit of tyrone brooks.the affidavit of brooks brother,tyrone,says that defense counsel did not contact him and that,if they had,he would have told them that he suffered from schizophrenia.the record casts considerable doubt on the premise of this counsel never spoke to tyrone or that they never otherwise learned this information.the itemized statement of mark angelotta,brooks investigator,who worked at the direction of brooks attorneys,indicates that he met with tyrone on three separate before the guilt phase and twice between the guilt and penalty that brooks counsel attended the last meeting.angelotta notes refer to tyrone mental illness,indicating that tyrone has been in mental hospitals for paranoid schizophrenia or depression.
but even if this affidavit could be construed to support a claim,it does not establish prejudice.the sentencing court was well aware that reginald brooks suffered from,no one disputed the the additional evidence that another family member suffered from the disease is the kind of cumulative evidence that does not show prejudice.see durr mitchell,cir.
affidavit of beverly brooks.the affidavit of brooks wife,who was a witness against brooks at the trial,focuses on brooks increasingly strange patterns of behavior.in,brooks quit his job because he thought his were trying to poison him.and in and,brooks became isolated and rarely left his home or visited with family members,accused beverly of trying to poison him,mutilated a child doll by a cutting a hole in the doll chest and hang ed the doll by its neck from a chandelier,tore the telephone off the wall,believed in voodoo and the occult and thought that magic spells could be placed on people,destroyed his record albums and mutilated a wall ornament of a cat by scratching out the eyes of the cat and struck beverly with his hands for the second time in their marriage.what is more,d uring the latter years of the marriage,brooks accused her of having incestuous relations with the couple oldest son,and brooks was jealous of their oldest son athletic abilities and refused to allow his son to display his trophies in the house.beverly indicated that she would have divulged these facts to defense counsel for use in the mitigation phase but was not contacted by defense counsel at or prior to either the guilt or mitigation phase of brooks trial.
the records of brooks investigator also cast doubt on the allegation that beverly and the trial team did not communicate.they show that he had a conference with beverly brooks,tyrone brooks and one of brooks attorneys on october,over a month before bertschinger issued his report and a month before the sentencing hearing.they also show that he interviewed beverly,and his itemized statement shows that he met or talked with all three of brooks attorneys on the same day as the interview.bertschinger,brooks primary expert during the mitigation hearing,testified that he called brooks,the defendant,and spoke with her for approximately half an hour getting some background information and some of her observations,particularly as they pertained to brook s behavior just prior to the alleged incident.bertschinger pointed to specific comments that beverly made to him concerning brooks behavior on the day of,and the years preceding,the murders.
all of this suggests that brooks counsel either spoke to beverly or at least learned what she had to say through their investigator.but even if,despite this evidence,it could be said that her affidavit establishes deficient performance,it does not show prejudice.if the thrust of the affidavit is that counsel did not talk to beverly about brooks history,that does not show prejudice if counsel investigator spoke to beverly and no one claims that brooks attorneys failed to talk to their investigator and if counsel chief expert,bertschinger,spoke directly to beverly about the background information and some of her observations,particularly as they pertained to brook s behavior just prior to the alleged incident.
not only did bertschinger speak to beverly about brooks background and the events leading up to the murders,but he also testified about most of the pieces of information mentioned in beverly affidavit anyway.bertschinger testified that,beginning around,brooks quit working,develop ed some suspicions regarding people at work,withdr e w from contacts with friends,and to some degree with family,had paranoid ideation s,thought people were trying to poison his food,accused beverly of trying to poison his food and had an idea at one point in time that his phone was being tapped.billowitz discussed some of the same background information in his report and testimony,see,ja explaining that brooks had significant difficulties in functioning in the last years and appears to have become socially isolated and aggressive at home,as did the sentencing panel in its opinion,see,ja after the defendant brooks quit working,their family relationship steadily deteriorated.at times,he was physically abusive toward his wife and children.
that leaves three topics beverly mentioned in her affidavit that did not come out at trial brooks belief in voodoo,his mutilation of dolls and his destruction of albums and a wall ornament brooks accusation that beverly was having an incestuous relationship with the couple oldest son and brooks refusal to allow his oldest son to display athletic trophies.these items were cumulative of the information already provided and,no less importantly,none of brooks experts explains why these additional items by themselves would have changed the diagnoses.
in this regard,this case is similar to hill mitchell,cir.in hill,the petitioner argued that affidavits submitted by a psychiatrist and by a psychologist established prejudice under strickland because they demonstrate d how a properly prepared expert could have and should have testified.id.at.we rejected that a de novo standard of review no less,see id.at,although the affidavits provide d more information about the petitioner background than was presented at trial,the petitioner fail ed to explain why this additional information would have been likely to persuade a jury to give him a life rather than a capital sentence and why at any rate its absence from trial testimony affected the jury deliberations given that much of this background information was in the psychological reports presented to the jury,id.at.i n order to establish prejudice,we noted,the new evidence that a habeas petitioner presents must differ in a substantial strength and subject the evidence actually presented at sentencing.id.at.yet there,as is true here,the information in the affidavits simply echoed points already presented to,and weighed by,the sentencer.id.at see also clark mitchell,cir williams coyle,cir.
keep in mind,moreover,the context in which this information was sought.brooks refused to allow his counsel to call beverly as a witness at the guilt phase and apparently took the same view at the penalty phase of the trial,and he instructed counsel that they were to in no way beverly as to the substantive facts that she might put forth.the point of any interviews with beverly thus was not,quite improbably,to consider using her as a witness on brooks behalf or to establish a basis for her when she testified for the state during the mitigation phase it was to obtain additional background information for the experts.yet with the information the experts did possess,a diagnosis of schizophrenia was made,and the trial panel accepted that diagnosis.
affidavit of franklin hickman.filed by one of brooks attorneys,this affidavit says that hickman was not provided with information concerning brooks o ther than the information contained in the psychological and psychiatric reports and that he was not aware of,among other things,brooks belief that he was being poisoned at work or the fact that prior to brooks brother tyrone was hospitalized for treatment of schizophrenia.like beverly and tyrone affidavits,hickman affidavit runs into contrary record evidence.angelotta itemized statement indica
