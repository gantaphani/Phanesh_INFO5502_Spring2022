opinion of the court 
karim eley,a prisoner of the commonwealth of pennsylvania in custody of the state correctional institution rockview,seeks federal habeas relief under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.after a joint trial with lester eiland and edward mitchell in the dauphin county common pleas court,a jury convicted eley of murder.b,robbery,and conspiracy to commit robbery,for his role in the murder and robbery of angel dejesus in harrisburg,pennsylvania,in july.eley now claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment under jackson virginia,d his confessions were admitted against him in violation of the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment under bruton united states,d,richardson marsh,d,and gray maryland,d and the trial judge reasonable doubt jury instruction reduced the commonwealth burden of proof in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment under boyde california,d.the district court rejected eley claims and denied his petition.for the reasons stated below,we will reverse.
on july,cab driver angel dejesus suffered multiple fatal gunshot wounds during a robbery while his taxi was parked at the intersection of kittatinny and hummel streets in harrisburg,pennsylvania.before oral argument,we requested that the commonwealth of pennsylvania submit a letter specifying the evidence reflected in the record from which the jury could have rationally concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that karim eley was guilty of murder,robbery,and conspiracy to commit robbery in connection with these crimes the commonwealth directed our attention to the evidence we now summarize 
vivian martinez testified that she remembered that dejesus,her fianc√©e,had purchased a pouch to hold his money a couple of days before july.she also knew that he always kept this money pouch in his taxi while he was working.and she believed that he had about in his possession around on july.
guadalupe fonseca testified that he was standing outside his home on kittatinny near the intersection with hummel around on july.he saw three african american men standing by a taxi,and he did not see anyone else in the general area.he then observed one of the three men enter the taxi,and he heard two gunshots.at the same time,he noticed that the other two men remained right beside the taxi.app.at.he next watched the first man exit the taxi and rejoin the other two men by the side of the taxi,and he heard a third gunshot he finally saw all three men depart down hummel together.
jennifer mcdonald testified that after on july,she was walking down hummel towards her home on kittatinny.she passed by three men,who she identified as eley,lester eiland,and edward mitchell,hanging out in the area of an abandoned house on hummel right before the intersection with kittatinny.eley recognized her and did a little dance,and she called him stupid.she turned down kittatinny,and a taxi passed her travelling toward the intersection with hummel.about a minute and a half later,she heard a slam,and she looked back up kittatinny toward the intersection with hummel.she saw the taxi stopped at the intersection,but she did not see eley,eiland,or mitchell around the taxi.about five minutes after she arrived at her home,she heard police sirens.she was aware that eley,eiland,and mitchell hung out at the abandoned house.id.at.
rufus hudson testified that he was driving around hummel and kittatinny from to on july.around,he identified eley,eiland,and mitchell,who were standing at the intersection of hummel and kittatinny.then,around,he recognized dejesus in his taxi,which was parked on street at the intersection with kittatinny.later,he again saw dejesus in his taxi,which at that time was parked on hummel at the intersection with kittatinny,and he again noticed eley,eiland,and mitchell standing at the intersection of hummel and kittatinny.finally,around,he watched the defendants run real fast away from the taxi,which was still parked at the intersection of hummel and kittatinny,towards the abandoned house.id.at.he knew that eley,eiland,and mitchell hung out in the area of hummel and kittatinny near the abandoned house every day.id.at.
cindy baldwin,a harrisburg police bureau forensic investigator,testified that on july,she responded to the intersection of hummel and kittatinny where she searched the taxi and collected two shell casings.she also went to the hershey medical center where she gathered dejesus clothing,which did not include any cash,wallet,or purse.she then searched the taxi a second time,and again failed to recover any cash,wallet,or purse.on july,she was present at dejesus autopsy and determined that he had been shot three times with a caliber gun.she next searched the taxi a third time and discovered a third shell casing.she later learned that all three shell casings may have been fired from the same caliber gun.
wayne ross,a dauphin county coroner office forensic pathology expert,testified that on july,he performed dejesus autopsy.he observed that dejesus had suffered three gunshot wounds to the head and neck area.he opined that dejesus cause of death was homicide by multiple gunshot wounds to the head.
david lau,a harrisburg police bureau criminal investigator,testified that on july,he recovered two firearms and three shotguns from the abandoned house.on july,at the harrisburg police bureau,he took a statement from eley.eley told him that he had not been in the area of hummel and kittatinny for the past three weeks.eley specifically said that between and on july,he had been with various acquaintances,friends,and family at several locations other than hummel and kittatinny.
eley,eiland,and mitchell were arrested,charged,and jointly tried before three successive juries in the dauphin county common pleas court.the first two trials ended in mistrials at the third trial,eley was convicted of murder.b,robbery,and conspiracy to commit robbery.he was acquitted of conspiracy to commit murder.id.he was sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment of life without parole for murder,seven to twenty years for robbery,and four to twelve years for conspiracy to commit robbery 
on direct appeal,eley raised numerous substantive issues,including whether there was sufficient evidence to convict him he should have been granted a severance and the trial judge biased the jury by telling it to ignore the possibility that someone other than he and his committed the crimes.the common pleas court upheld his convictions on the merits,and a divided panel of the pennsylvania superior court affirmed his convictions on the merits under pennsylvania law commonwealth eley,unpublished opinion.the pennsylvania supreme court denied his petition for allowance of appeal.commonwealth eley.
on collateral appeal under pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.et,eley the substantive issues he had raised on direct appeal as ineffective assistance challenges based on his counsel failure to frame his claims under federal law.the common pleas court dismissed his pcra petition the superior court affirmed,commonwealth eley,unpublished opinion,and also denied his request for.the supreme court again denied his petition for allowance of appeal.commonwealth eley.
eley filed a pro se habeas petition under,claiming u nder jackson virginia,evidence was insufficient to prove guilt i mproper redaction of codefendants statements,misuse of same by prosecutor and improper jury instruction and i mproper,unconstitutional reasonable doubt instruction.petition under for writ of habeas corpus by a person in state custody at,eley erickson,cv.the district court,without holding a hearing,ordered the dismissal of the petition on the merits and declined to order the issuance of a certificate of appealability.eley appealed.determining that his claims were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further,miller el cockrell,d citation omitted,we granted eley application for a certificate of appealability.
the district court had jurisdiction over eley habeas petition pursuant to and.we have jurisdiction over the district court order denying eley habeas petition pursuant to and.our review of the district court decision is plenary because no evidentiary hearing was held.lewis horn,cir.thus,we review the superior court decision on direct appeal under the same standard that the district court was required to apply,namely,aedpa id.quotation omitted.
aedpa imposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings on habeas review,which demands that decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.renico lett,d quotations omitted.aedpa difficult to meet standard,harrington richter,d,establishes a substantially higher threshold for obtaining relief than de novo review,renico.at quotation omitted.thus,aedpa reflects the view that habeas corpus is a guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems,not a substitute for ordinary error correction through appeal.harrington.at quotation omitted.
aedpa prohibits us from granting habeas relief 
unless it is shown that the earlier state court decision was contrary to federal law then clearly established in the holdings of the united states supreme court,d williams taylor,d or that it involved an unreasonable application of such law,d or that it was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the record before the state court,d.
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court precedent,williams,at,or if it confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from that reached by the supreme court,id at.
a state court decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case.id at.we may not grant habeas relief merely because we believe that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.renico.at quotation omitted.rather,that application must be objectively unreasonable.id.quotation omitted.thus,even a strong case for relief does not mean the state court contrary conclusion was unreasonable.harrington.at citation omitted.
a state court decision is based on an unreasonable determination of the facts only if the state court factual findings are objectively unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the proceeding.miller el,at citing,inter alia,d.moreover,the factual determinations of state trial and appellate courts are presumed to be correct.duncan morton,cir.the petitioner bears the burden of rebutting the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.rice collins,d quoting e.
our analysis under aedpa follows a prescribed path.we must first determine what arguments or theories supported or could have supported,the state court decision.harrington.at.we must next ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of the supreme court.id.we may,at last,grant habeas relief only if the petitioner demonstrates that the state court decision was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.id at.
even if the petitioner is entitled to habeas relief under aedpa,we will grant the writ only if the error was not harmless.under the harmless error standard,we must assess the prejudicial impact of the constitutional error in the criminal trial.fry pliler,d.we will hold the error harmless unless it led to actual prejudice,in the form of a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brecht abrahamson,d quotation omitted.
eley first claims that his fourteenth amendment due process right was violated when he was convicted of murder,robbery,and conspiracy to commit robbery based on insufficient evidence.specifically,he contends that the superior court rejection of his sufficiency of the evidence challenge was both contrary to and an unreasonable application of jackson under d,as well as an unreasonable determination of the facts under d.we agree with the district court that eley is not entitled to habeas relief on this issue.
we begin with an analysis of this issue under d.the clearly established federal law governing eley first claim was determined in jackson,where the supreme court announced the constitutional minimum standard governing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence a reviewing court must ask whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.at citation omitted.stated differently,a court reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence may overturn a conviction only if it is found that upon the record evidence adduced at trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.
we first decide whether the superior court adjudication of eley sufficiency of the evidence challenge was contrary to jackson.the superior court described its standard of review as follows 
w hether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the commonwealth,and drawing all reasonable inferences favorable to the commonwealth,there is sufficient evidence to find every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.commonwealth george.this court may not reweigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of the factfinder.commonwealth foster.
app.at.we agree with the superior court later conclusion on pcra appeal that these rules do not contradict jackson.id.at t he federal standard enunciated in jackson is not any different from that employed in pennsylvania when reviewing sufficiency of the evidence questions.nor does eley argue that the facts of his case are materially indistinguishable from jackson.thus,we hold that the superior court adjudication of eley sufficiency of the evidence claim was not contrary to jackson.
we next decide whether the superior court adjudication of eley sufficiency of the evidence challenge was an unreasonable application of jackson.we review the evidence with reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.jackson,at.but we also recognize that the minimum amount of evidence that the due process clause requires to prove the offense is purely a matter of federal law.coleman johnson,d per curiam.
we first address whether a rational jury could have found eley guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery beyond a reasonable doubt.in pennsylvania,to convict a defendant of criminal conspiracy,the jury must find that 
the defendant intended to commit or aid in the commission of the criminal act the defendant entered into an agreement with another to engage in the crime and the defendant or one or more of the other committed an overt act in furtherance of the agreed upon crime.
commonwealth johnson,quotation omitted.because it is hard to prove,the unlawful agreement may be established inferentially by circumstantial evidence,the relations,conduct or circumstances of the parties or overt acts on the part of.commonwealth spotz,citation omitted.
separately,evidence of a defendant association with the perpetrator of the crime,presence at the scene of the crime,or knowledge of the crime can not establish an unlawful agreement,commonwealth murphy,but together,such evidence may coalesce to establish a conspiratorial agreement beyond a reasonable doubt where one factor alone might fail,commonwealth devine,quotation omitted.similarly,evidence of flight may support an inference of an unlawful agreement,but only where other evidence of guilt consists of more than mere presence at the scene.commonwealth hargrave.finally,evidence of a false statement may support an inference that it was made with an intent to divert suspicion or to mislead the police or other authorities,or to establish an alibi or innocence.commonwealth kravitz,quotation omitted.
the superior court found that the evidence showed that eley,eiland,and mitchell were seen together near the scene of the crime by several individuals prior to the time of the incident.they were seen acting together when the victim was shot.the shooter exited the cab and joined the other two men.all three fled the scene together.app.at.based on this evidence,the superior court concluded that the jury could infer that eley and his had conspired together to attack and rob the victim,and that the shooting of the victim and the entry into the cab were acts in furtherance of their plan.id.thus,according to the superior court,the evidence was sufficient to support eley conspiracy to commit robbery conviction.
eley takes issue with the superior court finding that he acted together with his during the crime.appellant br.at.he argues that,at most,the evidence showed only that he was present at and fled from the scene of the crime.he also asserts that there was no evidence linking him to the abandoned house or the weapons found therein.for this reason,eley maintains that there was no evidence that he had agreed to take part in a robbery.id.at.
eley analogizes his case to our decision in johnson mechling,app x cir.there,the prisoner appealed the district court denial of his habeas petition,challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions for murder as an accomplice and for conspiracy to commit murder.in rejecting the prisoner claim,the superior court had relied on the following evidence on the night of the murder,the prisoner,his,and the victim were kicked out of a bar after an argument when they left the bar,the victim was walked between the prisoner and his when the group arrived at an alley,there was a gunshot after the gunshot,two people fled from the alley and later,the victim body and the murder weapon were discovered in the alley.in reviewing the superior court decision,we held that such evidence does not permit any reasonable fact finder to reasonably infer specific intent to kill.id.at.accordingly,we reversed and remanded for the district court to issue the writ.
unfortunately for eley,after he filed his brief,the supreme court in coleman summarily reversed our decision in johnson.in coleman,the court first admonished us for imping ing on the jury role as factfinder through factual parsing,and reminded us that jackson leaves juries broad discretion in deciding what inferences to draw from the evidence presented at trial.at.the court then summarized additional relevant evidence the prisoner and his were close friends on the day of the murder,the prisoner heard his repeatedly proclaim that he was going to kill the victim right before the murder,the was noticeably concealing a weapon in the prisoner presence the prisoner helped his escort the victim to the alley and the prisoner stood at the entrance of the alley while his killed the victim in the alley.based on this evidence,the court concluded that a rational jury could have inferred that the prisoner knew that his was armed with a shotgun knew that his intended to kill the victim helped usher the victim into the alleyway to meet his fate and may have been prepared to prevent the victim from fleeing.id.at.therefore,the court held that the evidence was not nearly sparse enough to sustain a due process challenge under jackson.id.emphasis added.
although the evidence is less compelling in this case than in coleman,a rational jury could have made the same inferences in both cases.here,there was testimony that eley and his would hang out in the area near the abandoned house every day that they were hanging out in the area of the abandoned house before the crime that they ran fast together away from the taxi and towards the abandoned house after the crime and that two firearms and three shotguns were recovered from the abandoned house during the investigation.from this evidence,a jury could have rationally inferred that eley was close friends with his that they had a weapons stash in the abandoned house that they picked up weapons from the abandoned house before the crime and that they dropped off weapons at the abandoned house after the crime.thus,a rational jury could have inferred that eley knew that one of his was armed.
additionally,witnesses testified that eley and his were hanging out in the area of hummel and kittatinny before the crime that during the crime,three black men were by the taxi,and that no one else was in the general area that one of the three men entered the taxi and two shots were fired that the other two men,instead of running away,waited for the first man right beside the taxi that the first man exited the taxi and rejoined the other two men,and that another shot was fired while all three men were together by the side of the taxi and that after the crime,eley and his ran fast away from the taxi towards the abandoned house.from this evidence,a jury could have rationally inferred that eley and his approached the taxi together that eley waited right beside the taxi while one of his entered the cab and shot dejesus twice that eley remained next to one of his when he exited the taxi and shot dejesus a third time and that eley fled with his.a rational jury could have thus inferred that eley knew that one of his intended to rob dejesus.
finally,a jury could have rationally inferred that eley intended and agreed to rob dejesus with his.from the testimony that two men waited right beside the taxi while one man entered and two shots were fired,a rational jury could have inferred that eley was prepared to prevent dejesus from fleeing.coleman.at.further,from the testimony that eley fled with his towards the abandoned house where multiple weapons were found,a rational jury could have inferred that eley was ready to help one of his hide the murder weapon.finally,from the testimony that eley made a false statement to the police during the investigation,a rational jury could have inferred that eley was attempting to hide his guilt.
undeniably,in this case we are faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences.jackson,at.for example,from the fact that eley and his were loitering in the area of hummel and kittatinny before the crime plus the fact that they regularly hung out there,a rational jury could have inferred that they were standing around innocently.however,we must presume even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution,and must defer to that resolution.id.returning to the previous example then,from the fact that eley and his were hanging out in the area of hummel and kittatinny before the crime plus the fact that the abandoned house to which they fled and at which multiple weapons were found was nearby,we must presume that the jury actually inferred that they were plotting to rob dejesus.thus,the evidence was sufficient to support eley conviction for conspiracy to commit robbery.
we next address whether a rational jury could have found eley guilty of robbery beyond a reasonable doubt.in pennsylvania,a defendant is guilty of robbery if,in the course of committing a theft,he physically takes or removes property from the person of another by force however slight.a v.a defendant is,in turn,guilty of theft if he unlawfully takes,or exercises unlawful control over,movable property of another with intent to deprive him thereof.a.because eley was guilty of conspiracy,he could be guilty of robbery if either he or one of his committed robbery in furtherance of their conspiracy.murphy,at a conspirator may be liable for the overt acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy regardless of which committed the act.citation omitted.
the superior court found that the evidence indicated that eley and his confronted the victim with a gun and shot him three times.one of the attackers entered the cab.when the police arrived,the victim money was missing.no one else was seen entering the cab before the arrival of the police.app.at.while this evidence was circumstantial,the superior court concluded that it was sufficient to convict eley of robbery.id.at.
eley argues that there was no evidence that he was part of a robbery.appellant br.at.but because eley conspired to commit robbery,the commonwealth was not required to prove that he participated in the robbery,only that one of his did so.murphy,at.eley also asserts that there was no evidence that he benefited in any way from the robbery,such as possession of money.appellant br.at.however,such evidence is unnecessary to support his conviction because proof of an attempted theft is sufficient to establish the in the course of committing a theft element of robbery.commonwealth sanchez,quoting.a.
at trial,there was testimony that dejesus possessed before the crime that he always kept his money in a pouch in his taxi while he was working that eley and his were hanging out in the area of hummel and kittatinny before the crime that during the crime,three black men were by the taxi and no one else was in the general area that one of the men then entered the taxi and two shots were fired that eley and his fled from the taxi after the crime and that neither dejesus cash nor his pouch was found on his person or in his taxi during the investigation.from this evidence,a rational jury could have inferred that eley or one of his physically took dejesus cash by force with the intent to deprive him thereof.thus,there was sufficient evidence supporting eley conviction for robbery.
we finally address whether a rational jury could have found eley guilty of murder beyond a reasonable doubt.in pennsylvania,m urder of the second degree is a criminal homicide committed while a defendant was engaged as a principal or an accomplice in the perpetration of a felony.commonwealth lambert,en banc citing.b.further,perpetration of a felony includes the commission or the attempted commission of a robbery as a principal or as an accomplice.d,and criminal homicide means intentionally,knowingly,recklessly or negligently caus ing the death of another human being,a.finally,the intent to commit the underlying crime is imputed to the killing to make it murder.lambert,at citing,inter alia,commonwealth mikell.again,eley could be guilty of murder if either he or one of his committed murder in furtherance of their conspiracy.murphy,at.
the superior court found that dejesus was killed by three shots fired by eley or a while they were committing the felony of robbery.app.at.for this reason,the superior court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to convict eley of murder.id.
a review of the testimony reveals that dejesus possessed before the crime that he always kept his money in a pouch in his taxi while he was working that eley and his were hanging out in the area of hummel and kittatinny before the crime that during the crime,three black men were by the taxi and no one else was in the general area that one of the three men entered the taxi and two shots were fired that the first man exited the taxi and rejoined the other two men by the side of the taxi and a third shot was fired that eley and his fled from the taxi after the crime that neither dejesus cash nor his pouch was found on his person or in his taxi during the investigation and that dejesus later died from three gunshot wounds to his head and neck.a rational jury could have inferred from this evidence that eley or one of his killed dejesus while robbing him.thus,eley conviction for murder was supported by sufficient evidence 
we acknowledge that under jackson which allows us to set aside the jury verdict on the ground of insufficient evidence only if no rational trier of fact could have agreed with the jury this is a close case.coleman.at quotation omitted.but in addition to the first layer of deference we owe to the jury under jackson,we owe a second layer of deference to the superior court under aedpa.see also cavazos smith,d per curiam a federal court may overturn a state court decision rejecting a sufficiency of the evidence challenge only if the state court decision was objectively unreasonable.citation omitted.had we been the jury,we might have acquitted eley had we been the superior court,we might even have reversed his conviction.but applying our doubly deferential standard of review,we simply can not conclude that it was objectively unreasonable for the superior court to decide that a rational jury could have found eley guilty of murder,robbery,and conspiracy to commit robbery beyond a reasonable doubt.see cavazos.at recognizing that the inevitable consequence of this double deference is that judges will sometimes encounter convictions that they believe to be mistaken,but that they must nonetheless uphold.
having rejected eley claim under d,we conclude with an analysis of this issue under d eley contends that the determination that he agreed with eiland and mitchell to rob dejesus was based on an unreasonable finding that he act ed together with his.appellant br.at.we have recounted that there was testimony that eley waited right beside the taxi while one of his entered the cab and fired two shots that instead of immediately fleeing,he waited for his to exit the cab and rejoin him by the side of taxi and fire another shot that he fled with his from the taxi towards the abandoned house,and that two firearms and three shotguns were recovered from the abandoned house during the investigation.although this evidence could have been interpreted as mere presence and flight,that alternative interpretation does not by itself rise to the level of clear and convincing evidence,necessary for eley to rebut the presumptive correctness attached to the superior court factual finding under e.rountree balicki,cir quotation omitted.
we have also described testimony that eley was close friends with his that he left the abandoned house and approached the taxi with his and that a cache of weapons was later recovered from the abandoned house.from this evidence,plus the fact that eley acted together with his during the crimes,we hold that the superior court determination that he agreed with eiland and mitchell to rob dejesus was not objectively unreasonable under d.see wood allen,d holding,under d,that even if the state court decision was debatable,it was not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.therefore,we will affirm the district court denial of eley first claim.
eley next claims that his sixth amendment confrontation right was violated when his confessions were admitted against him at their joint trial.specifically,he contends that the superior court rejection of his challenge to the trial judge denial of his motion to sever was contrary to or an unreasonable application of bruton,richardson,and gray.on this issue,we part ways with the district court and conclude that eley is entitled to habeas relief 
before analyzing eley claim,we present the relevant confession testimony and jury instructions.at eley joint trial,the commonwealth introduced into evidence two extrajudicial statements by eiland and one extrajudicial statement by mitchell,neither of whom testified.the commonwealth first called matthew levan,who was incarcerated with eiland at the dauphin county prison in july.the prosecutor began by asking levan if eiland was in the courtroom.app.at.after levan responded in the affirmative,the prosecutor then requested that levan identify eiland,inquiring of the three defendants,which is he farthest middle closest id.at.levan selected eiland as the closest of the three defendants at the counsel table.moments later,levan testified that eiland confessed to him that 
t hey they,as in whoever was with him he did say the names of those people when he went up to them,it was supposed to be a robbery,and he was he the one that shot him,but he did mean to do it.it was the other two idea or something like that,in that sense.
id.at.no limiting instruction accompanied levan testimony.
the commonwealth next called steven taylor,who was eiland cellmate at the dauphin county prison in july.according to taylor,eiland confessed to him that they were there to rob a cabdriver,and i guess with different things you sic did or whatnot during the evening,somewhere,somehow,something went wrong and whatnot.somebody ended up dead from that.id.at.again,the trial judge gave no limiting instruction for taylor testimony.
the commonwealth finally called kevin duffin,a harrisburg police bureau detective,who took mitchell written statement in july.according to duffin,mitchell confessed to him 
b etween and,i think,in the morning,july,that he was at the corner of kittatinny and elm street f iring weapons into the air with two other people they took the three firearms and two shotguns to a house on hummel street before they placed one of the shotguns under a mattress and took one to the second floor.but pretty much they hid the weapons loaded them and hid them in the house.
id.at.immediately after duffin testimony,the trial judge instructed the jury 
now,the reference by mitchell to they,the pronoun they,we have,as you see here,three defendants on trial.but i instruct you that you may not draw any assumption or conclusion from this testimony of the officer that edward mitchell was speaking about the other two defendants in this case.
when edward mitchell speaks,he speaks for himself in other words.so anything that the officer is saying about it or mitchell should be limited to edward mitchell and not to the other two defendants in this case.
during the jury charge,the trial judge gave two more limiting instructions.the jury was first instructed 
earlier in the trial you heard me give you an instruction regarding a statement several statements that were made by one or more of the defendants,and i want to repeat that instruction to you now.this involves any statement by an individual to the police.
that statement can only be used against the person speaking.it can not be used against anyone else.there is a rule which restricts use by you of the evidence offered to show that the defendants,eiland and mitchell,made statements concerning the crime charged.
a statement made before trial may be conferred as evidence only against the defendant who made that statement.thus,you may consider the statement evidence against eiland and mitchell if you believe they made the statement voluntarily.you must not,however,consider the statement as evidence against the statement of sic karim.you must not use the statements in any way against them sic.
id at.and the trial judge later instructed 
oh,there was one other point i was supposed to give you and i neglected.again,in giving the example of felony murder and whether a robbery did occur here,and i said one of the examples of direct evidence of that was the statement of one of the defendants.
once again,as i told you,i think before,that statement by that defendant who indicated,if you believe that he did make the statement and you believe it to be true,if the purpose was robbery,that can only be held against that person who made the statement and no one else.
our summary of the relevant confession testimony and jury instructions complete,we next review bruton,richardson,and gray,which establish the controlling precedent for eley claim for purposes of d.vazquez wilson,cir.the supreme court first decided bruton,where a defendant and his were jointly tried for robbery.the unredacted confession that he and petitioner committed the armed robbery was admitted.at.at the close of the government case,the jury was instructed that the confession could not be considered as evidence against the defendant.
the bruton court held that a defendant sixth amendment confrontation right is violated when a extrajudicial statement inculpating the defendant is introduced at a joint trial,even if a jury is instructed that the confession may be considered as evidence only against the declarant.the court reasoned that there are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not,or can not,follow instructions is so great,and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant,that the practical and human limitations of the jury system can not be ignored.id.at citations omitted.the court concluded that s uch a context is presented where the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant,who stands accused with the defendant,are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial,id.at,and thus,that the defendant sixth amendment confrontation right is violated in this situation,regardless of whether the jury receives an appropriate limiting instruction.
the court revisited bruton in richardson,where two of three alleged perpetrators were jointly tried for murder.the confession was redacted to omit all reference to the defendant and all indication that anyone other than the declarant and a participated in the crime.at.as redacted,the confession only revealed that the declarant and the planned the murder during a car ride to the victim house.but the defendant herself later testified that she had been along for the ride.after the confession was admitted and after closing arguments,the jury was instructed that the confession could not be used against the defendant.
limiting bruton,the richardson court held that the confrontation clause is not violated by the admission of a nontestifying codefendant confession with a proper limiting instruction when the confession is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant name,but any reference to her existence.id.at.the court explained that the confession at issue was not incriminating on its face,and became so only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial.id.at.the richardson court distinguished the confession that expressly implicated the defendant in bruton from the confession that contextually implicated the defendant in that case,reasoning that because testimony that the defendant helped me commit the crime is more vivid than inferential incrimination,and hence more difficult to thrust out of mind,jury instructions are ineffective against confessions,but effective against confessions.id.
the court again returned to bruton in gray,where a defendant and his were jointly tried for murder.the had confessed that he,the defendant,a,and a few other guys were in the group that beat the victim to death.at.this confession was redacted by substituting a kind of symbol,namely,the word deleted or a blank space set off by commas for the names of the defendant and the.id.at.after closing arguments,the jury was instructed that it should not use the confession against the defendant.
the gray court held that as a class,redactions that replace a proper name with an obvious blank,the word delete,a symbol,or similarly notify the jury that a name has been deleted are similar enough to bruton unredacted confessions as to warrant the same legal results.id.at.the court arrived at this holding despite acknowledging that in some instances the person to whom the blank refers may not be clear,id.at,such as in a case where a confession uses two or more blanks,even though only one other defendant appears at trial,and in which the trial indicates that there are more participants than the confession has named,id.at.in so holding,the gray court expanded bruton,concluding that a confession redacted in this way is directly accusatory,id.at,because it facially incriminat es the defendant,id.at quotation and emphasis omitted.
the gray court holding also limited richardson.the gray court reasoned that although richardson seemed to exempt all inferentially incriminatory confessions from the bruton rule,the richardson rule actually depended in significant part upon the kind of,not the simple fact of,inference.id.the court elaborated richardson inferences involved statements that did not refer directly to the defendant himself and which became incriminating only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial.id.quotation omitted.in contrast,gray inferences involved statements that,despite redaction,obviously refer directly to someone,often obviously the defendant,and which involve inferences that a jury ordinarily could make immediately,even were the confession the very first item introduced at trial.id.
having presented the applicable clearly established federal law,we first analyze whether the superior court decision affirming the trial judge denial of eley motion to sever was contrary to bruton,richardson,and gray.the superior court described the law as follows 
admission of an inculpatory statement by a implicating the defendant violates a defendant sixth amendment right to the witnesses against him.courts have addressed this problem by redacting confessions of to remove references implicating the defendant however,the sixth amendment is only violated where the implication arises from the face of the redacted statements and not from linkage to other evidence.
app.at citation omitted.we conclude,like the superior court on pcra appeal,that these rules do not contradict the clearly established federal law in bruton and its progeny.id.at eley fails to persuade us that,had trial counsel argued that the redaction was insufficient in accordance with federal cases including bruton and its progeny,the outcome would have been different.again,eley does not argue that the facts of his case are materially indistinguishable from the facts in bruton and its progeny.thus,we hold that the superior court decision was not contrary to bruton and its progeny.
we next analyze whether the superior court decision upholding the trial judge rejection of eley severance request was an unreasonable application of bruton,richardson,and gray.although eley takes exception to all three of the extrajudicial statements of his admitted at their joint trial,our discussion focuses on levan testimony that eiland confessed that he the one that shot him,but that i t was the other two idea.app.at.because we conclude that the superior court adjudication of eley claim with respect to this confession was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under bruton and its progeny,we need not decide whether taylor testimony that eiland confessed that they were there to rob a cabdriver,id.at,or duffin testimony that mitchell stated that he was firing weapons around the time and near the vicinity of the crimes with two other people,id.at,constituted additional bruton violations.
eley argues that the admission of eiland confession was error because it referred to his existence.appellant br.at.specifically,eley asserts that gray controls because eiland confession made clear that three men the precise number in the courtroom participated in the crime s.id.at.thus,eley claims that he was directly implicated in the crimes.id.at.the commonwealth counters that the confession was redacted so that it did not refer to any other person than the speaker,and that eley contention regarding the reference in the confession to the number of participants in the crimes is a clear attempt at contextual implication governed by richardson appellee br.at.
the superior court first found that the trial court ordered that statement by eiland be redacted so that it did not refer to eley,app.at,and that,as redacted,that statement only indicated that eiland had pulled the trigger,id.at.the superior court then concluded that n one of the statements by eiland or mitchell that were presented to the jury referred to eley or directly implicated him in any way,id.at,and that t he trial court properly instructed the jury that such statements were to be used as evidence against only the individual who made the statement,id.at.thus,according to the superior court,the trial judge did not err in denying eley motion to sever his trial from that of his.
the superior court reliance on the trial judge jury instructions reveals that it believed that richardson governed eley case.but richardson does not support the superior court conclusion that eiland confession did not refer to eley.richardson holding is explicitly limited to a confession that is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant name,but any reference to his existence.at emphasis added.here,eiland confession was redacted to omit any reference to eley name.however,eiland statement that he the one that shot him,but that i t was the other two idea expressly referred to the existence of exactly three people himself and two others.app.at.eiland express reference to the existence of eley and mitchell as the other two,could not have been lost on the jury because,as the commonwealth emphasized shortly before introducing the confession into evidence,there were exactly three defendants sitting at the defense table in the courtroom,id.at.
gray,moreover,contradicts the superior court conclusion that eiland confession did not directly implicate eley.gray holding explicitly extends to a confession that is redacted to replace a proper name with a symbol,at,which facially incriminat es a defendant,id.at quotation and emphasis omitted.here,the commonwealth merely replaced eley and mitchell names in eiland confession with a type of symbol the number two.further,all three defendants were charged together and jointly tried under conspiracy,accomplice,and principal theories of liability.for this reason,eiland confession that he the one that shot him directly implicated himself as a principal,and his statement that i t was the other two idea directly implicated both eley and mitchell as his and accomplices.app.at.
although we are mindful of the deference that we owe to the commonwealth courts,we are constrained to conclude that fairminded jurists could not disagree that the superior court decision is inconsistent with richardson and gray.we have no doubt that the jury inferred,on the basis of eiland confession alone,that eley was one of the other two whose idea it was to rob dejesus.app.at.as in gray,t he inferences at issue here involve d statements that,despite redaction,obviously refer red directly to someone and which involve d inferences that a jury ordinarily could make immediately,even were the confession the very first item introduced at trial.at.indeed,a juror who wondered to whom the other two referred,app.at,need ed only lift his eyes to eley and mitchell,sitting at counsel table,to find what seem ed the obvious answer,gray,at.therefore,we hold that the superior court affirmance of the trial judge denial of eley motion to sever was an unreasonable application of bruton and its progeny 
we had occasion to address a scenario similar to this one in vazquez,vazquez concerned the joint trial of a defendant and his for murder.prior to trial,the told police that the defendant was the shooter and that he and a were surprised when the defendant opened fire.id.at.at trial,the declarant statement was redacted by replacing the names of the defendant and the with the neutral terms my boy and the other guy.id.at.after closing arguments,the jury was instructed that it could not consider the confession as evidence against the defendant.
on habeas review,we recognized that ordinarily the use of a term like the other guy will satisfy bruton.id.at.however,we reasoned that the redacted confession indicated there were only two possible shooters my boy and the other guy.id.at.we determined that it was highly probable that the jury would believe that the declarant was referring to the defendant as the shooter because the was not on trial,and the commonwealth argued that the defendant was the shooter.thus,we granted habeas relief,concluding that if that case did not involve an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under bruton and its progeny,it would be difficult to conceive of any case that could meet that admittedly exacting standard.id.
eley presents an even more compelling case for habeas relief than vazquez.in vazquez,the jury had to decide whether the declarant statement,which implicated a single shooter in the murder,referred to the defendant or the absent.in other words,vazquez presented the unclear case,foreshadowed by gray,where a confession uses two blanks,even though only one other defendant appears at trial.at.here,the jury was not required to make a comparable choice eiland confession expressly implicated exactly three people in the crimes and exactly three defendants appeared at the joint trial.if the defendant in vazquez merited habeas relief,it is difficult to conceive of any reason that eley is unworthy of such relief.
vazquez is analogous for another reason.in vazquez,the superior court affirmed the common pleas court admission of the confession by relying heavily on the pennsylvania supreme court decision in commonwealth travers.on habeas review,we indicated that while we were cognizant of the respect that we owed to the commonwealth courts,we were compelled to recognize that the supreme court in travers and its progeny came close to endorsing a rule that when terms like my boy,the other guy,or the other man are used to substitute for an actual name there can not be a bruton violation.vazquez,at.we concluded that the adoption of such a rule was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under bruton and its progeny.
regrettably,the commonwealth courts,which did not have the benefit of our decision in vazquez,appear to have made the same mistake here.the trial judge evidently replaced the names of eley and mitchell with the term the other two rather than replacing each of their names with the term the other man.the superior court,citing only travers,affirmed because the trial court ordered that statement by eiland be redacted so that it did not refer to eley.app.at.if as we suspect the superior court affirmed the trial judge through a mechanical application of the travers rule,it thereby unreasonably applied clearly established federal law under bruton and its progeny.
finally and this should come as no surprise in light of our discussion of eley jackson claim in part we conclude that the bruton error was not harmless.indeed,the commonwealth makes no argument to the contrary.here,as in bruton,the admission of levan damning testimony about eiland confession implicating eley added substantial,perhaps even critical,weight to the commonwealth case in a form not subject to.at.because the devastating effect of such a nonadmissible declaration can not be wiped from the brains of the jurors,we conclude that the bruton error substantially influenced the jury verdict.id.at.accordingly,we will grant eley habeas relief on his bruton claim 
for the reasons stated above,we hold that although eley is not entitled to habeas relief on his jackson claim,he is entitled to such relief on his bruton claim.accordingly,we will reverse the district court denial of his habeas petition,and we will remand this case with instructions that the district court order that the commonwealth retry eley within days or else dismiss the charges against him and release him from custody.
it is well established that,without some real evidence of guilt,a defendant presence at and then flight from the scene of a crime are insufficient to prove his or her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.accordingly,it appears that never before in anglo american jurisprudence has any court decided that a rational jury could have found a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt based on nothing more than his or her presence and flight or otherwise concluded that such decision was a reasonable application of clearly established federal law.because i believe that the pennsylvania superior court decision thereby constituted an objectively unreasonable application of supreme court precedent,i must respectfully dissent.
like the majority,i recognize the doubly deferential nature of our standard of review under jackson virginia,d,and aedpa.in coleman johnson,d per curiam,the supreme court recently determined that we failed to afford due respect to the role of the jury and the state courts of pennsylvania,id.at.under jackson,the relevant question is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson,at citing johnson louisiana,d.this reasonable doubt standard of proof requires the finder of fact to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused.id.at citing in re winship,d harlan,concurring.the jackson court also pointed out that a properly instructed jury may occasionally convict even when it can be said that no rational trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.in addition,the writ of habeas corpus the great writ still stands as a safeguard against imprisonment of those held in violation of the law.harrington richter,d.judges must be vigilant and independent in reviewing petitions for the writ,a commitment that entails substantial judicial resources.id.as the majority recognized,habeas relief under aedpa still represents a guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems.majority opinion at quoting harrington.at.
it is undisputed that a defendant can not be convicted based solely on evidence of his or her presence at and then flight from the scene of the crime,although the pennsylvania superior court did not expressly reference this fundamental principle in its own disposition of eley sufficiency of the evidence challenge.m ere association with the perpetrators,mere presence at the scene,or mere knowledge of the crime is insufficient to establish that a defendant was part of a conspiratorial agreement to commit the crime,and,accordingly,there must be some additional proof that the defendant intended to commit the crime together with his or her.commonwealth murphy,quoting commonwealth lambert.likewise,a defendant can not be an accomplice simply based on evidence that he knew about the crime or was present at the crime scene.id.at citing commonwealth wagaman,see also,commonwealth kimbrough,noting that it is well settled that mere presence at scene of crime is not enough to establish accomplice liability.there must be some additional evidence that the defendant intended to aid in the commission of the underlying crime,and then did or attempted to do so.murphy,at citing wagaman,at.flight may indicate consciousness of guilt and may be considered as evidence,along with other proof,supporting an inference of guilt.see,commonwealth hargrave.nonetheless,this only holds true in cases in which the other evidence of guilt consists of more than mere presence at the scene.id.at.in the end,mere presence on the scene both immediately prior to and subsequent to the commission of a crime and flight therefrom is not sufficient to prove involvement in the crime.id.at quoting commonwealth goodman.
the majority itself acknowledges that this is a close case under jackson,going so far as to state that,had we been the superior court,we might even have reversed his conviction.majority opinion at.ultimately,eley conviction for conspiracy to commit robbery,robbery,and murder was based on nothing more than his presence at the scene of the crimes and his flight from the scene.applying the legal principles summarized above,i conclude that his conviction can not be allowed to stand.in short,it was objectively unreasonable for the pennsylvania superior court to decide that a rational jury could have found eley guilty of murder,robbery,and conspiracy to commit robbery beyond a reasonable doubt.this case thereby presents us with the kind of extreme malfunction in the state criminal justice system that federal habeas relief under aedpa is actually meant to remedy.harrington.at quoting jackson,at stevens,concurring in judgment.
focusing in particular on the conspiracy charge,the majority summarizes the evidence presented to the jury in some detail and also identifies a rather extensive range of inferences that a rational jury allegedly could have drawn from this evidence.i observe that,in contrast,the pennsylvania superior court own discussion of eley sufficiency of the evidence claim was rather cursory.for example,it stated,without any explanation,that they eley and his two were seen acting together when the victim was shot.in any case,i must reject the majority own approach because it would have been clearly unreasonable for a jury to draw many of these proffered inferences given the evidence that was presented at trial.
for instance,the majority concluded that a jury could have rationally inferred that eley intended and agreed to rob dejesus with his because,in turn,a rational jury could have inferred that eley was prepared to prevent dejesus from fleeing based on the testimony that two men waited right beside the taxi while one man entered and two shots were fired he was ready to help in hiding the murder weapon based on the testimony that he fled with his towards an abandoned house where multiple weapons were found and he was attempting to hide his guilt given his false statement to the police.majority opinion at.nevertheless,i observe that none of the witnesses actually testified that the other two men attempted to block the victim escape,acted as a lookout,or did anything else to aid or support the shooter.as the majority itself notes,a mere five seconds elapsed between the second and third shots.it also acknowledges that eley and his were loitering in the area of hummel and kittatinny and that they regularly hung out there.id.at.furthermore,mcdonald testified that she did not see any weapons,and fonseca similarly told the jury that he did not see the men carrying anything while they were running away.there was no evidence that eley benefited from the robbery itself,possession of the money stolen from dejesus or that there were any earlier encounters with,or threats against,dejesus himself.the police officers likewise did not find any of the fingerprints on the abandoned house doorknobs or the weapons they recovered and,more broadly,did not uncover anything else,any identification or pictures connecting eley with this building.i further note that eley police statement,like his flight from the scene,at best indicated consciousness of guilt.given the absence of any real evidence indicating that he intended and agreed to engage in criminal activity or at least intended to aid or promote such activity and then actively participated in the activity itself this statement was clearly not sufficient to sustain his conviction.
the supreme court recent coleman opinion further highlights the objective unreasonableness of the pennsylvania superior court decision.the majority itself acknowledges that the evidence is less compelling in this case than in coleman.id at.in fact,the coleman court observed that the prisoner and his who ran the streets together attempted to collect a debt from the victim earlier on the day of the murder,the victim resisted and humiliated the in public by beating him with a broomstick,and the enraged repeatedly declared his intent to kill the victim in the prisoner presence.coleman.at.the prisoner then helped the,who was noticeably concealing a bulky object under his trenchcoat,to escort the victim into the alley.id.while the prisoner stood at the entryway,the pulled out a shotgun and shot the victim in the chest.id.as i have already observed,one of the witnesses at eley trial actually testified that she did not see any weapons.there also was an absence of any evidence of either any prior encounters with or threats against dejesus or that the two men by the taxi acted to block his escape or otherwise assist the shooter.given the circumstances,the pennsylvania superior court decision clearly constituted an objectively unreasonable application of jackson.
for the foregoing reasons,i would vacate the district court denial of eley sufficiency of the evidence claim and direct the district court to order his unconditional release from custody with prejudice to any.see,cir because double jeopardy principles apply here,we remand to the district court to order unconditional release with prejudice to reprosecution.citing burks united states,d.i therefore can not join the majority discussion of the confrontation clause claim or its judgment remanding this case for a possible retrial.
karim eley declined our invitation to submit a response to the commonwealth of pennsylvania letter.
because one of eley claims is a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions,we review the facts in the light most favorable to the commonwealth,jackson virginia,d,and we resolve conflicting inferences in the commonwealth favor,id.at.
at oral argument,the commonwealth stated that about five seconds elapsed between the second and third gunshots.eley did not rebut this fact.
at the first trial,the jury deadlocked.at the second trial,a police witness recited eley name while reading edward mitchell confession,in violation of bruton united states,d.
on direct appeal,eley challenged the legality of his sentence.concluding that the dauphin county common pleas court had erred in failing to merge eley sentences for murder and robbery,the pennsylvania superior court vacated his sentence.commonwealth eley,unpublished opinion.on remand,eley was to consecutive terms of imprisonment of life without parole for murder and robbery and four to twelve years for conspiracy to commit robbery.
the dissenting judge took issue with the superior court majority resolution of eley jury instruction claim.specifically,the dissent concluded that the trial judge on several occasions,suggested that the jury could ignore or disregard collateral issues about which they had doubt,such as the credibility of witnesses who claimed to be at the scene of the crime.app.at.thus,the dissent would have held that the jury instructions were unclear,confusing and prejudicial,vacated the judgment of sentence,and remanded the case for a new trial.id.at.
while eley direct appeal to the superior court was pending,he unsuccessfully moved for a new trial based on evidence in the common pleas court,alleging that the murder weapon had been found in the possession of a.
while eley first pcra petition was pending before the common pleas court,he filed a second pcra petition based on additional evidence.he alleged that a had admitted to being one of the three persons involved in the crimes and had implicated two additional in the crimes.the common pleas court dismissed eley second pcra petition,and the superior court affirmed.
eley also claimed i neffectiveness concerning evidence.petition under for writ of habeas corpus by a person in state custody at,eley erickson,cv.the district court denied this challenge on the merits,and we rejected eley application for a certificate of appealability as to this issue.
aedpa governs our review of a state court adjudication on the merits of a habeas petitioner claim.d.under aedpa,we review the last state court decision on the merits.garrus sec y of the.dep t of,cir en banc citing greene fisher,d.unfortunately,neither eley nor the commonwealth has explicitly addressed whether the superior court decision on direct appeal or the superior court decision on pcra appeal was the last state court decision on the,by citing to the superior court decision on direct appeal,eley has implicitly identified the last state court decision on the merits.appellant br.at citing app.at.we agree with eley suggestion.eley presented his claims as substantive challenges on direct appeal and as ineffective assistance of counsel challenges on pcra appeal,and o ur practice is to entertain the merits of the claims advanced.thomas horn,cir citation omitted.further,the fact that the superior court on direct appeal decided these issues under state law does not preclude its determination from being on the merits under aedpa.see priester vaughn,cir recognizing that a state court decision may be on the merits under aedpa even if it cites no united states supreme court precedent,so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the state court decision contradicts clearly established federal law quoting early packer,d per curiam.therefore,we will review the superior court decision on direct appeal.
the supreme court has explicitly left open the question whether e applies in every case presenting a challenge under d.wood allen,d citation omitted.in the absence of supreme court guidance,we have explained that e applies to a state court subsidiary factual findings,and that a challenge under that section may be based wholly or in part on evidence outside the state trial record.lambert blackwell,cir citations omitted.we have also indicated that d applies to a state court ultimate factual findings,and that a challenge under that section is based on the totality of the evidence presented in the proceeding.id.quotation omitted.thus,we have applied e to challenges under d,but we have cautioned that even if a state court individual factual determinations are overturned under e,what factual findings remain to support the state court decision must still be weighed under the overarching standard under d.id.at.
the jackson court provided several definitions of reasonable doubt.for example,a mere modicum of evidence can not by itself rationally support a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.at.instead,reasonable doubt requires a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused.id.at citation omitted see also id.at a reasonable doubt has often been described as one based on reason which arises from the evidence or lack of evidence.quotation omitted.
eley argues that the evidence was too circumstantial to sustain a judgment under jackson.but it is well established that the commonwealth may sustain its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt by means of wholly circumstantial evidence.commonwealth gibbs,quotation omitted.
the superior court did not analyze eley challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence under an accomplice theory of liability.nonetheless,we note that even if no rational jury could have found eley guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery beyond a reasonable doubt,the evidence was sufficient to support his convictions for murder and robbery as an accomplice.because eley was to a term of life imprisonment without parole for his murder and robbery convictions,reversing his conviction for conspiracy to commit robbery would provide little pennsylvania law,the difference between conspiracy and accomplice liability is that accomplice liability,unlike conspiracy liability,does not require proof of an unlawful agreement.commonwealth murphy.thus,accomplice liability only requires proof of two elements that the defendant intended to aid or promote the underlying offense and that the defendant actively participated in the crime by soliciting,aiding,or agreeing to aid the principal.id.at citation omitted.both requirements may be established wholly by circumstantial evidence.commonwealth kimbrough,en banc citing murphy,at.while a defendant can not be an accomplice simply based on evidence that he knew about the crime or was present at the crime scene,murphy,at citation omitted,the least degree of concert or collusion in the commission of the offense is sufficient to sustain a finding of responsibility as an accomplice,kimbrough,at quoting commonwealth coccioletti.without belaboring the point,a rational jury could have inferred that eley intended to aid and actively participated in the crimes by standing right beside the taxi to prevent dejesus from fleeing while one of his was inside the cab and by fleeing with his to the abandoned house to hide their weapons.therefore,in the alternative,the evidence was sufficient to support eley convictions for murder and robbery as an accomplice.
we note that one court of appeals has held that d is not readily applicable to jackson cases.sarausad porter,cir,rev on other grounds sub nom.waddington sarausad,d but see,cir declining to adopt the sarausad analysis.we will assume that d is applicable to jackson cases and decide eley claim on the merits.
to be fair,we note that the district court analyzed this issue as a claim that eley counsel provided ineffective assistance by not objecting to the admission of statements made by,app.at,since eley framed this issue as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in his pro se memorandum of law in support of his pro se habeas petition,petitioner memorandum of law in support of his previously filed petition for writ of habeas corpus and addressing the anti terrorism and effective death penalty act at,eley erickson,cv.however,we granted the certificate of appealability in this case as to claim in eley habeas petition,app.at,which presents a bruton claim,petition at.additionally,the parties have briefed this issue as a bruton claim.appellant br.at appellee br.at.accordingly,we will analyze this issue as a bruton claim rather than as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under strickland washington,d.
levan testimony that eiland did say the names of those people arguably implies that the confession was not.at.however,the commonwealth admits that the trial court ordered that the statements by eley,eiland and mitchell,be redacted so that they did not refer to any other person than the speaker.appellee br.at.moreover,the superior court found that the trial court ordered that the statements by eiland and mitchell be redacted so that they did not refer to eley,app.at,and we must presume that this factual determination was correct,e.
the commonwealth also argues,in the alternative,that eiland confession made no contextual implication of eley because it did not refer to eley involvement in the crimes.appellee br.at.for this reason,according to the commonwealth,richardson is inapplicable and limiting instructions were not required.the commonwealth misunderstands the nature of contextual implication,which may occur even if a confession is redacted so that it does not reference a defendant name or his participation in a crime.the confession in richardson was redacted in this way,and the supreme court nonetheless found that the confession contextually implicated the defendant when linked with evidence introduced later at trial.at.the richardson court went on to hold that the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment was not violated by the confession introduction into evidence so long as it was accompanied by a proper limiting instruction.id.at.in any event,we believe that eiland confession expressly implicated eley.see infra part.
although we conclude that eley case is controlled by gray maryland,d,we pause to point out that we would likely reach the same conclusion even if it were governed by richardson marsh,d.eley argues that the limiting instruction was woefully inadequate because it was only offered after and only applied to duffin testimony about mitchell confession.appellant br.at.the commonwealth disagrees and asserts that richardson was satisfied because the trial judge charged the jury on at least three occasions that any statement by a defendant was to be used as evidence against that defendant only,and s pecifically instructed the jury not to use the statements against eley.appellee br.at.the superior court,in turn,denied eley appeal because t he trial court properly instructed the jury that the statements were to be used as evidence against only the individual who made the statement.app.at.here,the trial judge likely violated richardson by failing to instruct the jury contemporaneously with the admission of eiland confession.richardson held that the admission of a confession that contextually implicates a defendant is permissible only if it is accompanied by a proper limiting instruction.at.in delli paoli united states,the supreme court defined an appropriate instruction as one that is made at the time of the admission and that make s it clear that the evidence is limited as against the declarant only,d emphasis omitted,overruled on other grounds by bruton,at.although bruton overruled delli paoli holding that a limiting instruction is sufficient to protect a defendant sixth amendment confrontation right when his confession expressly implicating him is admitted at their joint trial,richardson demonstrates that delli paoli definition of an appropriate limiting instruction survives in contexts.moreover,a compelling case could certainly be made that the instructions that the trial judge later provided were incorrectly limited to any statement by an individual to the police,app.at,and thus insufficient to dissuad e the jury from entering onto the path of inference in the first place,richardson,at.therefore,if eley case were not controlled by gray,the superior court affirmance of the trial judge denial of eley motion to sever would likely be an unreasonable application of richardson.
we recognize that under aedpa,court of appeals precedent is irrelevant to the ultimate issue,because we are obliged to ascertain whether the state court decision being examined was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the unite
