charkeem hyatt,contests the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.hyatt argues that massachusetts state courts failed to apply the united states supreme court holding in snyder massachusetts,in denying his request to be present during the jury view of the crime scene.after careful consideration,we affirm the district court denial of habeas corpus relief.
background 
on federal habeas review,the findings of fact of a state court shall be presumed to be correct.e see sumner mata,per curiam.accordingly,we must accept them unless convinced by clear and convincing evidence that they are erroneous.lynch ficco,cir.quoting mccambridge hall,cir.en banc.we take the facts as presented by the massachusetts appeals court,which affirmed hyatt conviction,supplemented with other record facts consistent with the state court findings.scoggins hall,cir.
in july,hyatt was involved in the shooting of four people outside a bar in the roxbury neighborhood of boston,massachusetts.a grand jury in suffolk county indicted hyatt on the following counts one count of unlawful possession of a firearm,one count of unlawful possession of ammunition,one count of possession of a loaded firearm,three counts of aggravated assault and battery with a dangerous weapon,three counts of assault with a dangerous weapon,and four counts of possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony.
hyatt pled not guilty to all counts,and a jury trial commenced on february,before justice brady of the massachusetts superior court.on february,justice brady discussed the logistics and rules for a jury view of the scene where the shooting took place,which would take place on the following day.hyatt trial counsel requested hyatt presence during the view.justice brady responded that hyatt could not go because of security reasons.he added,he in custody.i ca bring him.i do have enough security people for that.i never had a defendant attend a view,other than one who on the street.
later that day,hyatt counsel renewed her request that hyatt be allowed to accompany the jury on the view.in response to the request,the court engaged in the following exchange 
the court look,i sorry.he in custody for very serious charges.it a very serious event.i not going to allow him to come on the view because i just do have adequate security.further,i ca have him without chains out there,so the jury is going to be there.it just is a workable situation.so i understand that the massachusetts supreme judicial court has never changed the judge discretion about that,so if you want,you made an objection,that fine,i overruled it.but i not going to allow it.
odiaga i think the jury is going to be made more aware of the fact that he is in custody by his absence.
the court i probably have done maybe thirty views without defendants there,and i never said anything special.if you can think of anything you want me to say,i be happy to do it,but i think probably most lawyers feel that it better left unsaid.maybe the jury will just assume that they never come.but if you can think of anything tomorrow,by all means i be happy to consider it,okay 
the next morning,the view proceeded as scheduled,without hyatt in attendance.both hyatt counsel and the prosecutor representing the commonwealth were permitted to point out certain features of the scene to the jury,but neither was allowed to make any argument or offer other commentary.at no point before or during the view did anyone draw any attention to the fact of hyatt absence.
on february,the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts except the three counts charging him with assault by means of a dangerous weapon.following the jury verdict,hyatt was sentenced to a term of twelve to fifteen years of imprisonment.
proceedings in massachusetts appellate courts 
hyatt appealed his conviction to the massachusetts appeals court,alleging that his exclusion from the view violated his constitutional rights to due process and his presumption of innocence.the appeals court rejected his arguments and affirmed the conviction.commonwealth hyatt,p,wl,at.app.may.it noted that it was bound by a precedent that a defendant does not have the right to be present for a view and that a defendant absence does not offend his rights under the united states constitution or the massachusetts declaration of rights.id.at citing cases.relying on this precedent,the appeals court held that justice brady had acted well within his authority when he cited security as the reason to deny hyatt request to attend the view.id.
the appeals court also noted that even if exclusion from a jury view could constitute a due process violation,hyatt had failed to make the required showing that that violation had caused him substantial harm.id.it also mentioned that it was unpersuaded by hyatt attempt to analogize justice brady refusal to allow him to attend the view to allowing a defendant to be seen by the jury in prison garb or shackles,which requires particularized findings.id.
hyatt petitioned the massachusetts supreme judicial court for further review,but his petition was denied.commonwealth hyatt.
hyatt then filed a petition for habeas corpus relief under in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,alleging that the trial court violated his due process and equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment when it denied his request to accompany the jury on a view of the crime scene.the district court denied the petition,but granted a certificate of appealability.hyatt gelb,supp.this appeal ensued.
