kevin hutchings filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus under after he discovered that the government would not move to reduce his sentence under federal rule of criminal procedure,contrary to what his attorney had allegedly promised him.hutchings argues that his attorney false guarantee of a rule reduction in his sentence violated his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.the district court denied hutchings petition,and we affirm.
background 
hutchings was sentenced by a texas court in to a prison sentence for an aggravated drug offense,but was released on parole in.his parole is not scheduled to terminate until.the year after he was released on parole,hutchings began trafficking marijuana,cocaine,and methamphetamine,by purchasing the drugs in texas and selling them in peoria,illinois.he was arrested in october in cleveland,ohio.he was charged in federal court in ohio with,and pled guilty to,possession with intent to distribute cocaine,for which he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment.in august,a federal grand jury in peoria charged hutchings with conspiracy to distribute more than grams of methamphetamine and more than five kilograms of cocaine.based on hutchings five prior felony drug convictions,the government sought to enhance his sentence under,which would result in a mandatory minimum life sentence.
the court appointed mark wertz to represent hutchings regarding the charges in peoria.wertz told hutchings that if he pled guilty,the court would sentence him to life in prison.however,according to hutchings,wertz also told him that if he pled guilty and cooperated with the government,one year later the government would move to reduce his sentence to twenty to years under federal rule of criminal procedure.wertz allegedly did not tell hutchings that the government had broad discretion to bring a rule motion,and that the district court had the ultimate discretion whether to grant it.according to hutchings,wertz explained to him that the government would not ask for a reduced sentence in exchange for his initial guilty plea because the government wanted to appear to the public to be tough on crime.the reduced sentence would have to wait for one year when it could be arranged with less publicity.
in response to hutchings habeas petition,the government attached an affidavit of attorney wertz.although wertz spends significant ink describing his impression of whether hutchings voluntarily pled guilty,conspicuously missing from the affidavit is any statement by wertz negating hutchings version of,that wertz guaranteed a sentence reduction.
prior to pleading guilty,hutchings wrote several letters to the district court in which he admitted his guilt and requested the opportunity to plead guilty as soon as possible.the apparently hutchings wrote to the district court,among other things,that he bought cheap drugs and sold them in illinois at,that he set out to break the law and did exactly that id.at,that involving himself in a long,trial was pointless because he had a life sentence from previous cases id.at,and that he was impatient to get back to lovely three rivers,texas,where he was previously incarcerated,because his fellow hearts players in prison missed him id.at.
the district court held a change of plea hearing in february,when hutchings pled guilty to a superseding indictment.as part of the properly conducted rule colloquy,after placing hutchings under oath,the district court asked him if there had been any promises or assurances of any kind made to him in an effort to induce him to plead guilty,to which hutchings replied,no,sir.at.the district court also confirmed with hutchings that he understood that pleading guilty would result in a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.id.at.hutchings pled guilty,and in june the district court sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
of course,now in his habeas petition,hutchings alleges that in fact there was a promise made to induce him to plead guilty he argues that had his attorney not guaranteed him a sentence reduction for pleading guilty,he would have gone to trial rather than plead guilty.he alleges that he lied to the district court about wertz guarantee because of what wertz had allegedly told him about the government wanting to appear tough on crime.
hutchings later signed a cooperation agreement with the drug enforcement administration,pursuant to which he twice met with a government agent to provide evidence.hutchings alleges that he called wertz sixty times between may and october to find out when he would be resentenced.wertz told him that he would check with the government to find out.finally,on october,wertz told hutchings that the government said that it would not move to reduce his sentence because he had not provided substantial assistance.
this petition for a writ of habeas corpus followed,arguing,among other things,that his guilty plea was involuntary because wertz guarantee of a sentence reduction constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court denied hutchings petition without holding an evidentiary hearing,and subsequently denied hutchings motion for a certificate of appealability.in january,however,this court gave hutchings a certificate of appealability,finding that hutchings has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right as to whether counsel advice regarding hutchings plea of guilty was ineffective assistance.
ii.analysis 
this appeal raises two issues first,whether wertz advice to hutchings violated hutchings constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel,and second,whether the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing before ruling on hutchings habeas petition.
the government initially urges us to reject hutchings petition outright because his memorandum of law and facts was not signed under penalty of perjury.but the government waived this argument by failing to present it to the district court.bus.eng g,int l bus.machs,cir quoting hicks midwest transit,cir.even if the argument was not waived,we find that hutchings properly incorporated by reference his memorandum into his sworn petition,especially considering his pro se status at the time of his original filing.anderson hardman,cir.
ineffective assistance 
turning now to the merits,we review the district court denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under de novo as to legal questions and for clear error as to factual questions.sandoval united states,cir.we analyze a petitioner claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the inquiry described in strickland washington.to prevail on an claim under strickland,a petitioner must demonstrate that his counsel assistance was objectively unreasonable and resulted in a substantial risk of prejudice.brown finnan,cir.under our highly deferential review of an attorney performance,we presume that the attorney advised his client effectively.berkey united states,cir.only if the petitioner comes forward with specific acts or omissions of his counsel that constitute ineffective assistance will we then consider whether these acts or omissions were made outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.id.
if we find that hutchings was not sufficiently prejudiced,however,we need not address the adequacy of wertz representation.strickland,at united states taylor,f d,cir.to establish prejudice in the pleading context,the petitioner must prove that there is a reasonable probability that he would not have pled guilty absent his attorney deficient conduct.hill lockhart,morales boatwright,cir.to make that showing,the petitioner must do more than simply allege that he would have insisted on going to trial he must also come forward with objective evidence that he would not have pled guilty.united states cieslowski,cir.objective evidence includes the nature of the misinformation provided by the attorney to the petitioner and the history of plea negotiations.see julian bartley,cir.
we find that hutchings ineffective assistance claim fails because he did not adequately show that he would not have pled guilty even had his attorney full
