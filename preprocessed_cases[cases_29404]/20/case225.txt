willie furr appeals from the district court order which denied his petition for habeas corpus relief,which sought to set aside his state court conviction for possessing a firearm,receiving a firearm with an altered serial number,being an armed career criminal,and attempting to obstruct justice and to intimidate a witness.we affirm.
background 
furr was arrested on november,outside dorchester high school upon their arrival at the scene,the police observed furr run toward them holding his right side,then toss what appeared to be a gun,and yell to his nearby friend,rahshjeem benson yo,six,grab the gun.furr told the police that he had been shot by an unknown person,who had already fled the scene that is,by someone other than benson.the police located and arrested benson,who was found hiding between two nearby cars,and who pointed out to the police the firearm laying at his feet.the gun appeared to the police to be the one furr had tossed away moments before.
in due course,furr was arrested and charged in state juvenile court with possessing a firearm.laws ann.ch,a,receiving a firearm bearing an altered serial number,id,being an armed career criminal,id.a and attempting to obstruct justice and intimidate a witness.laws ann.ch.laws ann.ch.benson provided a written statement to the police,stating that the firearm belonged to furr,and that furr had gotten rid of the gun and yelled to benson to pick it up.while in prison pending trial,furr sent an anonymous letter to benson,stating that he had seen and was disappointed by benson written statement to the police,that benson statement was a lie,and that benson should testify at trial that he and the police had concocted the untruthful statement.the furr letter made veiled threats about harming benson mother and siblings.the letter was intercepted by the police before it reached benson.
at trial,the prosecution introduced both the benson statement to the police and furr threatening letter.furr objected to the benson statement,claiming that it was hearsay by a witness,benson,and that its introduction would violate his rights under the confrontation clause.the court overruled the objection,on the ground that benson statement was not introduced to establish the truth of its contents,that the gun belonged to furr on the firearm possession count,but rather for a legitimate nonhearsay purpose relating to the count,to establish that petitioner knew of benson statement and intended to intimidate him.the jury was instructed that it should consider the benson statement only in relation to the obstruction count,and not the count.the jury found petitioner guilty on all counts.
the trial court decided the armed career criminal charge,without a jury with petitioner consent,and found him guilty based upon his prior juvenile adjudications.see supra note.after petitioner was sentenced to years imprisonment,he appealed to the state appellate court,which affirmed in due course,commonwealth furr,and the supreme judicial court denied the ensuing application for further appellate review.
in november,the instant habeas petition was filed in federal district court,on the grounds that i the admission of the benson statement violated furr rights under the confrontation clause and ii the trial court ruling that his prior juvenile adjudications qualified as convictions for purposes of the armed career criminal statute was unforeseeable and therefore violated his federal due process right to receive fair and adequate warning that his conduct would expose him to criminal liability under that statute.
the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the habeas petition be denied,which was adopted in toto by the district court,which subsequently granted a certificate of appealability as to both the confrontation clause and due process claims,which furr now challenges on appeal.
discussiona.the standard of review 
we review the denial of the habeas corpus petition de novo.see phoenix matesanz,cir.pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,we may grant habeas relief only if the challenged state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.d.the contrary to criterion is not satisfied unless the state court arrive d at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the united states supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decide d a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d see horton allen,cir,cert.denied,d.the unreasonable application criterion is satisfied where the state court identifie d the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applie d that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.williams,at.as this is indeed a high hurdle,habeas relief will not lie,even though the interpretation or application of federal law was erroneous,unless it is also shown to be objectively unreasonable.see horton,at.
b.the confrontation clause claim 
furr initially contends that the admission of the benson statement,absent any opportunity to benson,violated furr rights under the confrontation clause.he relies upon bruton united states,d,and tennessee street,d.the bruton court held that the government could not introduce a codefendant statement at a joint trial which also inculpated defendant,even if the trial court instructed the jury that it should consider the codefendant extrajudicial statement only as evidence of the codefendant guilt,not the defendant.bruton,at.the court observed that,although juries normally are presumed to follow instructions,the bruton situation created too great a risk that the jury either would not or could not segregate its reliance upon the inculpatory evidence only in relation to the codefendant,and consequently that avoidance of any such jury confusion was vital to the defendant.id.
in street,however,the state introduced a codefendant written statement to rebut the defendant contention that law enforcement officials had coerced his confession.street contended that,prior to his confession,the sheriff had read the codefendant statement to him,then forced street to parrot the details of that statement in street own confession.street,at.in order to rebut the defense theory that the street confession was coerced in this way,the state introduced the codefendant written statement to demonstrate how it differed in significant details from the street confession.id.at.the trial court instructed the jury that the codefendant statement could not be considered for the truth of the matters asserted,street participation in the burglary and murder,but only to rebut the defense claim that street had been coerced into parroting the codefendant statement.id.at.
in upholding the admission in evidence of the written statement given by street codefendant,the court distinguished bruton on the ground that the codefendant statement there was hearsay,in that it was introduced to prove the truth of the matters asserted,codefendant guilt,whereas the state use of the codefendant statement against street was not hearsay,in that it was introduced solely to enable the jury to compare the two confessions and to assess street contention that the sheriff had coerced him into parroting his codefendant statement,rather than to prove that street had participated in the burglary and murder.id.at.the nonhearsay aspect of the codefendant to establish what happened at the murder scene but what happened when street no confrontation clause concerns.id.at.
the court then observed that street case was similar to bruton in one respect only the jury might have disregarded the limiting instruction and used the codefendant statement for the improper purpose of inferring street participation in the burglary and murder.id.in rejecting this prospect,the court first the crucial presumption that juries normally follow their instructions.id.at.the street confession also was crucial to the government ability to establish his participation in the burglary and murder,and the street allegation that his confession had been coerced hence was inadmissible could only be accurately evaluated if the jury were permitted to compare it with the codefendant statement to determine what differences if any the two versions contained.id.unlike in bruton,severance of the two codefendants trial,the trial court had no practicable alternatives to the admission of the codefendant statement which not only would have fostered this essential function but also eliminated the risk that the jury would disregard the limiting instruction and misuse the evidence,given that i a redaction of the codefendant statement to remove all references to street would have provided the jury an inaccurate depiction of the codefendant statement,likely resulting in more differences between it and the street confession,and further undercutting the street coercion defense theory and ii the street joint trial had already been severed from his codefendant.id.at.finally,the court rejected the street argument that it was constitutionally mandated that the state call his codefendant to testify at street trial,then noted that the codefendant had no personal knowledge as to the particular issue regarding which his written statement was introduced whether the sheriff subsequently coerced street into parroting the codefendant confession.id.at.
citing street,the state appeals court affirmed the admission of the benson nonhearsay statement for the purpose of establishing the obstruction and intimidation count,rather than the firearm possession count.furr,at.the court noted further that the jury need not have decided whether the contents of the benson statement were true or false,but merely that the benson statement had induced furr to threaten him.id.at.
now,on appeal from the district court order denying the habeas petition,furr contends that the state appeals court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of street,because it held that it was entirely sufficient for confrontation clause purposes that the benson statement was nonhearsay and that the trial court had given a limiting instruction,whereas the street court went on to weigh several additional factors i how important the codefendant statement was to the prosecution case ii whether there were practicable alternatives to admitting the codefendant statement,severance and iii whether the prosecutor closing arguments encouraged the jury to misuse the codefendant statement against furr.furr maintains that,had the state appellate court considered these mandatory additional factors,it would have concluded that the benson statement was inadmissible,because i it was not critical to the state case,since it unquestionably was inadmissible on the firearm possession count ii it was practicable to require that the state sever the trial of the count from the count and iii the prosecutor closing argument implicitly utilized the benson statement for hearsay purposes by asserting that furr letter to benson evidenced furr consciousness of guilt.
the state appellate court interpretation and application of street to the furr case readily passes muster under d.furr inappropriately extracted his proposed interpretation not from the street majority opinion,but from its concurrence.street,at.brennan,concurring the confession is admissible for nonhearsay purposes only because that confession was essential to the state rebuttal of respondent street defense and because no alternative short of admitting the statement would have adequately served the state interest t he record contains no suggestion that the state was engaged in any improper effort to place prejudicial hearsay evidence before the jury.as the court issued a majority decision endorsed by six other justices,however,and not merely a plurality opinion,the concurrence can not be considered a viable court holding.see alexander sandoval,d marks united states,d when a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.citation omitted.thus,the concurrence simply did not command support from a majority of justices.
as we noted in outlining the street majority opinion,the court did not purport to prescribe a mandatory checklist of factors to be considered in every case.rather,it noted that,absent other circumstances,it is sufficient that the codefendant statement is,not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted,and provided the court gives a limiting jury instruction to that effect.street,at.the nonhearsay aspect of the codefendant to prove what happened at the murder scene but to prove what happened when street no confrontation clause concerns.see crawford washington,d the confrontation clause also does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.the court then observed that,in some cases,circumstances might exist which nonetheless could create a risk that the jury might misuse the evidence,and thus rebut the normal presumption that juries would follow limiting instructions.turning to the facts in the street case,the court noted the absence of such special circumstances,observing that the government obviously needed the jury to compare the contents and details of the two confessions to rebut the street coercion defense.id.at.at no point in its discussion,however,did the majority purport to endorse the mandatory consideration of a checklist of factors,let alone the factors which the two justices in concurrence considered dispositive.
furr points to no subsequent case which has interpreted street as imposing such a mandatory checklist.we frequently have stated the street case holding as in general,nonhearsay statements or statements not offered for the truth of the matter asserted do not raise confrontation clause concerns.united states trenkler,cir.thus,the determination as to whether the general rule of admissibility in street applies is assessed case by case,based upon the presence of whatever special circumstances would create an unreasonable risk that the jury disregarded their instructions.
of course,for purposes we need not determine whether the state appellate court interpretation and application of street is legally correct,but simply that it was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,street.horton,at.for the reasons,we must conclude that it obviously was not.the state court determined that the benson statement was nonhearsay,because the jury did not need to decide whether the contents of the benson statement were true or false,but merely whether the statement prompted furr to threaten him.furr,at.the fact that the appeals court did not proceed to discuss the other factors mentioned in the street concurrence connotes,at most,that it did not consider that the furr case gave rise to any special circumstances that might risk jury disregard of the limiting instruction.
insofar as furr suggests that the appeals court was compelled,on the present record,to find and hence discuss any such special circumstances,we must disagree.it is quite obvious that the benson statement was crucial for the prosecution to establish the count,because it was necessary to prove that benson made a statement,of which furr had acquired knowledge,and on account of which furr threatened and intimidated benson.see commonwealth perez,the witness intimidation statute.laws ann.ch,applied if the defendants knew of the criminal proceeding and believed that the victim was a potential witness,review denied.
further,the street court simply observed as an aside,in a footnote,that the trial court could not sever the defendant and the codefendant trials as an alternative to admitting in evidence the codefendant statement because their trials already had been severed.street,at.this the nature of a negative can not be construed either as holding that the court would have reached a different decision had the trials not been severed,or that trial courts must invariably consider severance as an alternative to admitting nonhearsay evidence for limited purposes.
