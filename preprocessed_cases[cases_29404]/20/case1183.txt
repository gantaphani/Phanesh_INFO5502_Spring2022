a jury in harris county,texas,convicted martin allen draughon of murdering armando guerrero during a robbery and sentenced him to death.the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence the state trial court filed findings of fact and conclusions of law denying habeas relief which were in turn adopted by the court of criminal appeals in an unpublished order in draughon filed his federal petition in,and the federal district court entered the judgment now before us on september,
in its opinion,the district court held that draughon counsel provided ineffective assistance at both the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial,and that the state court contrary decision was an unreasonable application of settled federal law.it ordered the state of texas to either release him or try him again.draughon convictions stemmed from his robbery of a restaurant.as he fled the scene of the crime,he shot and killed a pursuing bystander.he denied any intent to harm,insisting that he had been attempting to fire over the heads of his pursuers.the state offered testimony that the fatal shot that struck guerrero in the chest was fired at close range,approximately ten steps away.the court found that defense counsel failed draughon in not obtaining expert forensic examination of the path of the fatal shot that such an effort could have provided the jury with evidence that the fatal bullet had bounced off the pavement in front of the victim and was fired some distance away.
the state filed a timely notice of appeal.in turn,draughon seeks a certificate of appealability on a penry claim should this court reverse.
on november,draughon attempted to rob a long john silver restaurant in houston,texas.hubbard eugene taylor,the assistant manager,closed the restaurant at approximately.as he finished closing up,taylor saw two relatives of his cashier gesturing to him through the window.taylor and two employees went outside.a man wearing a stocking mask pointed a gun at them and said,this is a stick up.get back inside.the four complied.the robber told taylor to g et that alarm in the back.i know it in the back.taylor went to open the safe.the safe had a delay mechanism that required taylor to wait ten minutes after entering the combination for a green light to come on,signifying that the safe could be opened.while taylor waited,the robber approached him and asked,w here is that green light while still waiting for the green light,taylor heard some noise coming from the front of the restaurant.he later learned that the noise was caused by several people banging on the doors and windows.the robber then went to the back of the restaurant.taylor heard the alarm go off and saw the robber leaving through the back door.restaurant employee susan cuellar later identified draughon as the robber.
ricardo guerrero lived near the restaurant.as he drove up to his apartment shortly before midnight on november,he saw eva cuellar running,crying and screaming for help.guerrero followed cuellar to the back of the restaurant.attracted by her pleas for help,others also followed.guerrero saw the back door of the restaurant open and a man run through it.the man ran into the parking lot and turned around.guerrero heard a shot,threw himself to the ground,and heard several more shots.he also heard a truck.when guerrero looked up,he saw the man jumping into the bed of a moving truck.guerrero testified at trial that the man fired no additional shots after jumping onto the truck.after the truck left,guerrero stood up and saw his cousin,armando guerrero,lying on the ground with a bullet wound in his chest.several of the men in the parking lot drove armando to an emergency room,where he died.
eva cuellar,the mother of the restaurant cashier,was the key witness.she was standing near armando when he was shot.she testified that she lived across the street from the long john silver where her daughter susan worked.with the late hour she became apprehensive about her daughter as the restaurant was preparing to close.accompanied by her young son eddie and armed with a knife,she walked to the restaurant and peered into the window.all appeared well at the time and she started back to the family home,leaving eddie at the restaurant to accompany his sister home at closing.not satisfied,she returned and this time saw that a man had drawn a stocking over his face and was holding a gun on the workers,including her daughter,susan,and her son,eddie.it was then that she fled down the street securing the help of some men who were having a beer in front of their homes.they returned to the restaurant and armando suggested he and cuellar go to the rear of the building and catch the robber if he fled out the back door.as they arrived at the rear draughon suddenly burst through the door in a run.cuellar testified that draughon took about ten running steps after leaving the restaurant,and began shooting.she saw the fire from the pistol and armando fall,holding his chest.according to her testimony,draughon fired three to six times before jumping into the back of a waiting truck which was pulling away.the pursuers were not armed except for the knife cuellar had earlier procured.thinking that draughon had harmed her children,she chased the fleeing draughon,throwing her knife at him in frustration and without effect.
norene smith,a nurse working in the emergency room when armando was brought in,described the medical staff unsuccessful efforts to resuscitate him.smith explained that the bullet struck guerrero heart,leaving a great deal of blood in the chest cavity.aurelio espinola,a forensic pathologist,testified that the gunshot wound caused the death.
following his arrest,draughon was tried for capital murder.the parties agree that the following summary of evidence found by the federal district court is accurate 
draughon testified on his own behalf during the punishment phase of trial draughon explained the events that led to the shooting.kenneth gafford had formerly worked for the long john silver and knew how the restaurant was set up and how the safe and alarm system worked.his information led to the planned robbery.draughon testified that he saw a crowd forming outside the restaurant during the attempted robbery,became nervous,and ran out the back door toward the pickup truck where gafford was waiting to drive away.the pickup was parked near the back of the restaurant.as draughon neared the truck,he turned and saw several people chasing him.draughon testified that he dove into the back of the truck bed,leaned over the railing,and fired four shots.he testified that he aimed over the heads of the crowd and was only trying to scare people so they would stop chasing him.draughon did not know that he shot guerrero.draughon offered no expert ballistics testimony in his defense.charles anderson,firearms examiner for the houston police department,testified that nothing on the bullet recovered from guerrero body showed that it had hit an object and ricocheted before striking guerrero 
the district court also summarized the testimony offered by draughon during the evidentiary hearing in support of his claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to present ballistics evidence during trial 
lucian haag,a certified criminalist,testified at the evidentiary hearing in this court haag has particular training and expertise in firearms evidence and has published several papers on firearms evidence.haag testified that draughon counsel asked him to try to determine whether the fatal bullet could have hit a surface or object and ricocheted before striking guerrero to assess the distance from which the bullet was fired to evaluate the quality of police investigation into guerrero death and to opine on the work a ballistics expert could have done at the time of draughon trial.haag testified that there were criminalists doing such work at the time of draughon trial.
haag tested a raven pistol with a magazine and a single live round of ammunition and examined a fired bullet.haag examined the rifling characteristics against those on the fired bullet,which was retrieved from armando guerrero body.haag noted damage to the fired bullet in the ogive narrower part of the bullet that does not come into contact with the gun barrel.he observed heavy striations over the length of the bullet.haag testified that the damage was caused by the bullet impacting a flat,unyielding,abrasive surface.haag concluded that this damage occurred after the rifling marks were made,meaning that the striations occurred after the gun discharged the bullet.haag concluded that this damage was a consequence of the bullet ricocheting off a hard,flat,unyielding surface,such as concrete or asphalt.haag also concluded that the bullet had struck this hard,flat surface at a low angle,estimating it to be five degrees or less,and deflected or ricocheted off this surface before striking guerrero.haag opined that this damage would be obvious to any competent firearms examiner.
haag also examined the bullet under a scanning electron microscope sem.he explained that the sem gives an examiner greater depth of field and a better view of any particles transferred to the bullet from a ricochet surface.haag found many grains of mineral materials embedded in the bullet.specifically,he found grains of quartz and silicon dioxide,which he identified as sand.he also found grains containing silicon,aluminum,and calcium.sand is found in concrete,and silicon,aluminum,and calcium are found in stones,asphalt,or concrete.haag testified that the presence of the particles support the conclusion that the bullet hit and ricocheted off an abrasive surface before striking guerrero.
haag also studied the report of the autopsy performed on armando guerrero and testified that autopsy findings were consistent with the findings of ricochet damage to the bullet.the autopsy report stated that the bullet entered guerrero body pointing up and to the side.the bullet traveled between two ribs,grazed the heart and stopped inside the chest cavity,penetrating only a few inches into guerrero body.haag testified that a bullet entering soft tissue will ordinarily penetrate ten to twelve inches.if the bullet has ricocheted,however,it will tumble rather than going sic straight,and will not penetrate as deeply as it would with a direct shot.a tumbling bullet will also cause an asymmetric abrasion rim on the entrance wound,which was found on guerrero body.haag ran tests on ordnance gelatin and other tissue stimulant to confirm these conclusions.
haag also calculated the approximate distance between draughon and guerrero when draughon fired the gun.haag estimated that the bullet struck an object or at approximately a five degree angle and ricocheted.haag based the estimate on the condition of,and markings on,the bullet.when a bullet strikes the ground at a angle,it ricochets from the ground at an angle of one to two degrees.the autopsy report stated that the bullet struck guerrero at a point on his body approximately inches above the ground.based on these figures,haag calculated the distance the bullet traveled before striking the ground or object from which it ricocheted and the distance the bullet traveled after striking the ricochet surface but before hitting guerrero.haag estimated that draughon stood from thirty to one hundred yards from guerrero when he fired the gun.haag could not be more precise about the distance from which guerrero was shot because the evidence conflicted as to whether draughon was on the ground or on the truck bed when he fired the gun.in addition,haag had no information as to whether guerrero was standing straight up or stooping when he was shot.as a result,haag could only provide estimates of the impact and departure angles of the bullet.
our question is whether the adjudication of the claim by the state court resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
the supreme court has explained that a state court decision is contrary to established federal law if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the court cases,or confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent,yet reaches an opposite result alternatively,a state court unreasonably applies clearly established federal law if it correctly identifies the governing precedent but unreasonably applies it to the facts of a particular case 
a federal habeas court inquiry into unreasonableness should be objective rather than subjective,and a court should not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly rather,federal habeas relief is only merited where the state court decision is both incorrect and objectively unreasonable.finally,in evaluating the district court resolution of the merits of issues presented to it,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.
the state court rejection of draughon claim that his counsel was ineffective in failing to obtain forensic examination of the path of the fatal bullet is measured by the test of strickland the objective reasonableness of the decision to not pursue forensic examination and its prejudicial effect the first inquiry asks whether counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness as measured by prevailing professional norms.the second inquiry asks whether there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.we conduct these inquiries against the overarching principle of a strong presumption that an alleged deficiency falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,and ultimately through the prism of aedpa.in our analysis we do not attempt to place the events of trial into two separate airtight containers of the first and second prongs of strickland.the facts that demonstrate a reasonable probability of a different outcome but for counsel decisions can cast light on their reasonableness.
draughon attempted to develop his ineffective assistance claim before the state habeas court,but was denied access to the ballistics evidence despite affidavits from the chief and deputy medical examiners of bexar county expressing their view that forensic examination was necessary because the limited evidence that was available raised the possibility of a ricochet.the state habeas court did not hold an evidentiary hearing and adopted the state proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,including a ruling that c ounsel can not be held ineffective based on possibly differing expert opinions concerning the trajectory of the bullet.the texas court of criminal appeals by per curiam order denied relief based upon the trial court findings and conclusions and our own review.
the federal district court conducted a full evidentiary hearing and entered her findings in a comprehensive memorandum opinion the crux of her holding was that the evidence offered by haag should have been presented in the state trial.the court found that had this evidence been adduced at trial,it would have directly confronted the state core theory that draughon turned and shot armando in the chest from a distance of about ten running steps,a deliberate act that defies draughon claim that he did not intend to kill and was firing over the heads of his pursuers.the federal district court ultimately concluded that the state habeas court rejection of the strickland claim was an unreasonable application of federal law.
we turn first to the performance prong of the strickland test.there is little question that haag presented a strong case that the fatal bullet struck the pavement in front of the victim and was fired at a much greater distance than the ten or so running steps estimated by eva cuellar.the importance of this test
