john lee conaway appeals from the dismissal of his petition for federal habeas corpus relief with respect to his north carolina convictions and sentences,including his two death sentences.on april,we granted conaway a certificate of appealability the coa on the two claims he raises on appeal that his sixth amendment right to an impartial jury was contravened because a trial juror concealed a close familial relationship to a who was also a key prosecution witness the juror bias claim and that,because conaway is mentally retarded,his execution is precluded by the eighth amendment,as enunciated in atkins virginia,d the atkins claim.after unsuccessfully pursuing these and other claims in state court,conaway filed his federal habeas corpus petition in the middle district of north carolina,where he sought an evidentiary hearing to prove his underlying allegations.in january,the district court denied conaway request for a hearing and dismissed the petition.conaway french.
as explained below,the state court rejection of the juror bias claim involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court,and conaway allegations entitle him to an evidentiary hearing.we therefore remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on the juror bias claim,and we affirm the court dismissal of the atkins claim.

on the afternoon of october,the second day of the jury selection proceedings,the prosecutor asked juror waddell if he knew any of the individuals who had repeatedly been identified as potential state witnesses.juror waddell acknowledged that he was familiar with the witness list and that he knew one potential witness,sheriff sam jarrell.id.juror waddell did not,however,acknowledge knowing or being related to harrington.the prosecutor asked juror waddell whether he,any close friend,or any family member had any dealings with the district attorney office,and waddell responded,no.id.at.the prosecutor further inquired whether juror waddell had formed an opinion about the case,and he again responded in the negative.id.at.when the prosecutor asked whether there was any reason whatsoever,whether i asked you or not that you could think of that would keep you from being fair and impartial in this case,juror waddell answered,no,sir.id.juror waddell acknowledged that he had read about the case in a newspaper approximately a year earlier,but when conaway lawyer asked if juror waddell had talked about the case with any family members or friends,or had heard anyone else discussing the matter,he asserted that he had not.id.at.later that day,while juror waddell was yet present,several other prospective jurors were asked whether they recognized any of the,including harrington.juror waddell remained silent,and he was ultimately selected to serve on the jury.
on saturday,october,after the jury had been selected,but before it was impaneled,conaway lawyer received an anonymous phone call at his office.the caller advised the lawyer secretary that juror waddell was harrington cousin,may be even his first cousin.id.
the guilt phase of conaway trial began on monday,october,after the jury was impaneled and sworn.later that day,harrington testified for the state and denied any responsibility for the murders of weatherford and callahan.he acknowledged that he faced the same charges as conaway,but maintained that the state had not offered to reduce the charges against him,or made other promises to him in exchange for his testimony.harrington admitted that,after the murders of weatherford and callahan,he had spent several days in the washington,area with mckinnon and scott,and that the three had discussed what they were going to say about the murders.id.at.according to harrington,they considered blaming the murders on a fictitious man named bro,but later decided to tell the truth and implicate conaway.id.harrington testified that,although he had grown up with scott and mckinnon,he had met conaway less than two months before the murders.id.at harrington asserted that he decided to testify against conaway because it was the right thing for me to do,but he acknowledged that by so doing,he was defending him self.id.at.
after the state rested its case,conaway took the stand in his own defense.conaway testified that,on the night of august,in hamlet,north carolina,he loaned his grandmother handgun to harrington.conaway,at.conaway then went alone to his girlfriend apartment in hamlet,where the couple had an argument and conaway soon departed.id.conaway did not see the again until they picked him up the next morning.id.harrington returned the handgun to conaway while the four men were driving together from north carolina to washington,id.conaway maintained that he did not learn about the murders of weatherford and callahan until after his maryland arrest,and he denied any knowledge of,or responsibility for,the crimes.id.at.
the trial evidence essentially presented the jury with a swearing contest between conaway,on one side,and his,including harrington,on the other.indeed,in closing argument,the prosecutor told the jury that if you believe what kelly harrington told you y ou can convict conaway of all the charges.if you believe conaway then you will acquit conaway.it really simple.on october,the jury returned guilty verdicts against conaway on all charges two for murder,two for kidnapping,a single charge of robbery with a dangerous weapon,and one larceny offense.the court then recessed until the following monday,october,when the sentencing phase of the trial was to begin.
when the proceedings resumed on october,conaway lawyer,benny sharpe,informed the court of the anonymous phone call received by his office on saturday,october,which had advised that juror waddell was a cousin,and may be even a first cousin of the,kelly harrington.sharpe explained to the court that w e do have anything to substantiate this information at this time,and we do know where the anonymous caller got this information,but we felt we needed to bring this to the attention of the court.id.at.sharpe requested that the court question juror waddell to ascertain his kinship,if any,to harrington.id.sharpe also sought to have the court examine a transcript of the voir dire proceedings and review juror waddell answers to the questions concerning waddell relationship or knowledge of the incident,or people involved.id.at.the court inquired whether conaway lawyer had found any authority requiring a hearing because of an anonymous phone call,and sharpe responded that he had not yet checked.id.the court then denied all of the defense motions.id.at.the court did not inquire about the apparent delay in bringing the phone call to its attention,and no explanation was offered 
at the sentencing hearing,conaway lawyers presented the testimony of two witnesses cynthia mcrae,his cousin,and brad fisher,a forensic psychologist who had interviewed conaway and his family and reviewed his records.fisher testified that conaway was disturbed due to childhood abuse and neglect,and that he had abused alcohol and drugs since the age of ten.on,fisher opined that conaway was not mentally retarded.id.at.he explained that,because conaway had scored on an intelligence quotient iq test in,and scored on a second iq test in,his iq scores were above the range for mental retardation which is generally defined as an iq score of or below.id.for its part,the state presented the jury with the results of pretrial tests indicating that conaway intellectual functioning falls within the average range of cognitive abilities.
on the evening of october,at the conclusion of the trial sentencing phase,the jury returned its sentencing verdicts,recommending that conaway be sentenced to death on each of the murder convictions.the trial court accepted the jury recommendations and forthwith imposed two death sentences on conaway.the court also sentenced conaway to forty years in prison on each of the two kidnapping convictions,forty years for robbery with a dangerous weapon,and two years on the larceny conviction,to run concurrently with each other,beginning at the expiration of his death sentences.state conaway,crs,felony judgment.
conaway thereafter appealed his convictions and sentences to the supreme court of north carolina,contending,inter alia,that the denial of his motions concerning juror waddell alleged relationship to harrington had deprived conaway of his constitutional right to trial before an impartial jury.by its opinion of february,the supreme court of north carolina denied conaway appellate claims.conaway,at.on the juror bias claim,the court concluded that the trial court had not erred in refusing to question juror waddell,given conaway critical delay in bringing this alleged telephone call to the trial court attention and the lack of evidence to substantiate this alleged anonymous telephone call.id.at.the supreme court of the united states thereafter denied certiorari.conaway north carolina,d.

meanwhile,conaway lawyers continued their efforts to substantiate the allegation that harrington and juror waddell were related on march,conaway lawyer,berry,interviewed harrington in a north carolina prison.according to affidavits later filed by berry,harrington was wary and guarded and not particularly knowledgeable of his forebears,but nonetheless confirmed that he was related to juror waddell.harrington provided berry with his father phone number.berry also sought unsuccessfully to contact juror waddell by calling his home several times in early.on may,berry called the home and spoke to a man identifying himself as juror waddell son,who informed berry that juror waddell had recently passed away.id.at.on june,berry spoke by telephone with harrington father,theodore roosevelt johnny harrington,who was curt and somewhat hostile,but nonetheless confirmed that he was a double first cousin to juror waddell,in that brothers married sisters.id.johnny harrington also informed berry that he was aware that juror waddell had passed away.
on june,conaway filed an amended mar,raising the juror bias claim in the mar court for the first time.by that claim,conaway contended that he had been denied his right to a fair and impartial jury under both the federal and state constitutions due to juror misconduct on the part of juror waddell.on september,conaway requested that the mar court conduct an evidentiary hearing on several issues,including the juror bias claim.
on november,conaway filed a second amended mar mar i,incorporating his previous mars and particularizing the juror bias claim.in that regard,conaway contended that his constitutional right to an impartial jury had been contravened because juror waddell was presumptively biased against conaway due to juror waddell familial relation to harrington juror waddell was excusable for cause from the jury and juror waddell was untruthful during the voir dire proceedings.conaway asserted that the trial jury could not factually accept kelly harrington testimony and that of conaway,and that d isbelieving kelly harrington testimony would have meant believing that he was the trigger man or with the trigger man and not merely present at the scene of a crime.id.at.mar i was supported by an affidavit of attorney berry,stating that juror waddell was a double first cousin to the father of kelly harrington,and spelling out the facts surrounding the anonymous phone call received by the trial lawyer office.

on december,conaway filed a petition for federal habeas corpus relief in the middle district of north carolina asserting,inter alia,the juror bias claim,and requesting an evidentiary hearing in federal court.by his petition,conaway alleged that juror waddell was a double first cousin to harrington father,see pet.that juror waddell did not disclose the familial relationship on voir dire,see that kelly harrington was a whose testimony for the state exculpated harrington by implicating conaway,see id.at and that juror waddell was subject to challenge for cause based on his relationship to harrington,see id.at.in making these allegations,conaway incorporated by reference the transcript of the voir dire proceedings at his trial,as well as the affidavit of berry,filed in support of mar i,stating that juror waddell and harrington were double first cousins,once removed.see id.at.
on july,conaway filed a motion in the district court seeking funds to hire an investigator to assist counsel on the juror bias claim.the motion was supported by another affidavit of lawyer berry,stating that she had spoken in person with kelly harrington and by telephone with harrington father,each of whom confirmed their family relationship with juror waddell.on march,the federal magistrate judge declined to authorize the hiring of an investigator,ruling that conaway had failed to allege facts that would entitle him to relief,and that his allegations were speculative.conaway french,slip op.at.
on april,conaway filed a motion for funds to hire a genealogy expert to assist in establishing the familial relationship between harrington and juror waddell or,alternatively,for authorization,pursuant to the applicable rules of procedure,to supplement the record with affidavits.see foll.the motion was supported by the affidavit of juror waddell son,michael waddell,who stated that he had lived with juror waddell during conaway trial,and that juror waddell knew,prior to serving on the jury,that harrington was the son of juror waddell first cousin.in further support of this motion,conaway submitted the affidavit of his lawyer marsh smith,setting forth,inter alia,his conversations with juror waddell daughter,celia waddell.by his affidavit,smith stated that he had spoken with waddell by telephone several times in.smith explained that he had prepared a draft affidavit for her on the basis of her statements to him,that he read the draft affidavit to her by phone,and that he revised its contents according to her requests.id after waddell consulted with her own attorney to whom smith referred her,she refused to execute the affidavit or return smith phone calls.id.at.smith incorporated waddell draft affidavit into his own affidavit,specifying therein the evidence that she would present if called to testify.
according to smith affidavit,waddell would testify to the following and other facts relevant to the juror bias claim 
that her father knew that kelly harrington was the son of his first cousin,theodore roosevelt johnny harrington,prior to serving on conaway jury 
that the fact that kelly harrington was the son of his first cousin is not something my father would have easily forgotten 
that kelly harrington bore a strong resemblance to his father johnny harrington 
that she heard juror waddell say on several occasions prior to conaway trial that i hope i get on this jury because if conaway did it,he should die 
that when juror waddell was called for jury duty,she had a heated discussion with him 
that she told juror waddell you not supposed to be on this jury,because you related to one of the guys involved and 
that she told her father that not disclosing his family relationship to kelly harrington was wrong,and he responded that she did know what she was talking about.
in testifying,waddell would also,according to smith,explain the familial relationship between juror waddell and harrington as follows rannie waddell,juror waddell father and willie harrington kelly harrington grandfather were who had the same mother.rannie waddell,and willie harrington married sisters,aggie and nancy mckay.their respective juror waddell and johnny harrington kelly father were first cousins who shared three of four grandparents two maternal grandparents and a paternal grandmother.see id.at by his affidavit,smith related that he had previously met with juror waddell brother,vance waddell,who confirmed that he and juror waddell were first cousins to johnny harrington,kelly father.according to smith,vance waddell initially agreed to execute an affidavit to that effect,but he thereafter failed to return smith calls.id 
on february,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny each of conaway claims for federal habeas corpus relief,including the juror bias claim,as well as his request for funds to hire a genealogy expert and to supplement the record.conaway french,slip op.at filed.according to the magistrate judge,conaway had not been diligent in attempting to develop the factual basis for his allegations,in that he did not attempt to obtain affidavits from harrington or waddell family until.id.at.the judge further observed that,even if conaway allegations were true,he had presented no evidence to show actual bias,and the relationship is not close enough to presume bias.id.at

on july,the federal magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny the atkins claim because conaway had been accorded an ample opportunity to litigate the mental retardation issue in state court,and because the mar court factual determination was entitled to a presumption of correctness under e.conaway french,slip op.at filed july.the magistrate judge saw no error in the mar court determination that conaway had failed to establish that he was mentally retarded under north carolina law.id.

by the juror bias claim,conaway contends that juror waddell concealment on voir dire of his relationship to harrington,a key prosecution witness,deprived conaway of his sixth amendment right to trial by an impartial jury.the sixth amendment,made applicable to state criminal proceedings through the fourteenth,affords an accused the right to trial by an impartial jury.see duncan louisiana,d jones cooper,cir.as the supreme court has observed,a touchstone of a fair trial is an impartial trier of fact a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it.mcdonough power,greenwood,d quoting smith phillips,d.
in contesting conaway position on the juror bias claim,the state makes three principal contentions that conaway procedurally defaulted on the claim that the mar court decision on the claim was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court and that conaway is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing in federal court because he failed to diligently pursue the juror bias claim and because his allegations are insufficient to entitle him to relief thereon.as explained below,we reject each of these contentions.
as a preliminary matter,we conclude that conaway has not procedurally defaulted on the juror bias claim by failing to support mar i with admissible evidence.a claim asserted in a federal habeas corpus proceeding has been procedurally defaulted,and is therefore not subject to federal review,when a state court has declined to consider the claim merits on the basis of an adequate and independent state procedural rule.fisher angelone,cir.if the decision of the last state court to which the petitioner presented his federal claims did not clearly and expressly rely on an independent and adequate state ground,a federal court may address the petition.coleman thompson,d recognizing that state court resolution does not clearly rest on independent procedural bar if interwoven with federal claim see also jenkins hutchinson,cir.
in asserting that conaway procedurally defaulted,the state misconstrues the mar court decision in mar i,as well as the governing procedural requirements in north carolina.although the mar court remarked that conaway had failed to support the claim with any affidavit or documentary evidence that waddell is,in fact,related to the harrington,state conaway,crs,slip op.at,it did not premise its denial of the juror bias claim in mar i on a lack of admissible evidence as the state would now have it.rather,the mar court conclusion relied on its determination that the mar i allegations,if substantiated,would not constitute a violation of the state or federal constitution.see id.as the district court recognized,the mar court thereby denied the juror bias claim on the merits.by reaching the merits of the juror bias claim,the mar court thus did not clearly and expressly rely on an independent and adequate state procedural rule.see coleman,at.
moreover,contrary to the state contention,north carolina does not mandate that admissible evidence must be submitted to an mar court before an evidentiary hearing can be conducted.see robinson polk,cir.rather,the applicable north carolina statute requires that an mar premised upon facts not in the trial court record be supported by affidavits or documentary evidence.b.there is no authority under north carolina law nor has the state asserted any to us requiring that such affidavits and documents themselves constitute admissible evidence.in deciding whether an evidentiary hearing is warranted,an mar court is obliged,under the applicable north carolina statute,to determine whether the allegations of an mar and the materials submitted in support thereof raise questions of fact which,if resolved in the defendant favor,would entitle him to relief.see id.c see also state mchone,a n evidentiary hearing is required unless the mar presents assertions of fact which will entitle the defendant to no relief even if resolved in his favor,or the mar presents only questions of law.if such questions are raised,the mar court must then conduct an evidentiary hearing and,at that time,assess the admissibility of the proffered evidence.see.c.indeed,it would create a classic if an mar defendant were obliged to submit admissible evidence to the mar court in order to be accorded an evidentiary hearing,when the defendant is seeking the hearing because he can not,without subpoena power or mechanisms of discovery,otherwise secure such evidence.see united states mason,cir.in these circumstances,we are unable to conclude that conaway has procedurally defaulted on the juror bias claim,and he is therefore entitled to pursue the claim in his federal habeas corpus proceeding 
turning to the merits of the juror bias claim,we conclude that the mar court denial of mar i involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.the text of the sixth amendment mandates that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a trial by an impartial jury.const.amend.vi.and the supreme court has long recognized that the sixth amendment prohibits biased jurors from serving on criminal juries.see united states wood.recognizing sixth amendment text prohibits partial jurors,whether bias is actual or implied.the court has explained that a juror bias may be established by showing that the juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire and that a correct response to that question would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.see mcdonough power,greenwood,d the mcdonough test additionally,a litigant must show that the fairness of his trial was affected either by the juror motives for concealing the information or the reasons that affect the juror impartiality.id 
by mar i,conaway alleged that juror waddell failed to disclose that he was harrington double first cousin,once removed,and conaway supported his allegations with an affidavit of his lawyer berry,as well as the trial voir dire transcript.the mar court denied the juror bias claim on the merits,concluding that conaway mar i allegations,if substantiated,would not constitute a violation of the state or federal constitution.see state conaway,crs,slip op.at.as explained below,the mar i allegations were sufficient under mcdonough to state a constitutional claim for relief,and thus the mar court ruling on the juror bias claim was unreasonable.
turning to the first part of the mcdonough test,conaway allegations in the mar court demonstrated that juror waddell had failed to answer honestly several material question s on voir dire.see mcdonough,at.on voir dire,juror waddell was asked whether he kn e w any of those people who may testify for the state.in response,juror waddell asserted that he was familiar with the list of the state prospective witnesses,acknowledging only that he knew sheriff jarrell.juror waddell was asked whether a close friend or family member had any dealings with the district attorney office,to which he responded negatively.when the prosecutor asked juror waddell whether there was any reason whatsoever,whether i asked you or not that you could think of that would keep you from being fair and impartial in this case,juror waddell again responded,no.
conaway alleged in mar i that juror waddell knew he was related to harrington,and that waddell failed to disclose this information in response to material questions on voir dire.given the multiple questions posed to juror waddell that could candidly be answered only by acknowledging his kinsman,it was unreasonable for the mar court to conclude that conaway mar i allegations were insufficient to satisfy the first part of the mcdonough test.
conaway allegations to the mar court also satisfy the second part of the mcdonough test had juror waddell truthfully responded at voir dire,his answers would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause,under the applicable federal constitutional principles.see mcdonough,at.the supreme court has long recognized the constitutionally based principle that a prospective juror may be validly challenged for cause if he can not be impartial.see,mcdonough,at.voir dire examination serves to protect th e right to an impartial jury by exposing possible biases,both known and unknown,on the part of potential jurors.demonstrated bias in the responses to questions on voir dire may result in a juror being excused for cause united states wood.all persons otherwise qualified for jury service are subject to examination as to actual bias.and close kinship between a juror and a participant in a criminal trial constitutes a classic form of juror partiality.as far back as the early,justice cardozo clairvoyantly predicted the factual scenario underlying the juror bias claim when,in writing for the court,he utilized a hypothetical juror related to a litigant as the ultimate example of a partial juror 
what was sought to be attained was the choice of an impartial arbiter.what happened was the intrusion of a partisan defender.if a kinsman of one of the litigants had gone into the jury room disguised as the complaisant juror,the effect would have been no different.

on the basis of conaway allegations in mar i,juror waddell familial relationship to harrington was sufficiently close that waddell bias would have been implied that is,presumed as a matter of law.see,wood,at.the bias of a prospective juror may be actual or implied that is,it may be bias in fact or bias conclusively presumed as a matter of law.see also jones cooper,cir.such a presumption is justified where a juror is a close relative of one of the participants in the trial or the criminal transaction.see smith phillips,d,concurring.if juror waddell had responded candidly on voir dire about his relationship to harrington,the doctrine of implied bias would have provided conaway with a valid basis for a challenge for cause.
in contesting conaway invocation of the implied bias principle,the state incorrectly asserts that the doctrine of implied bias was abrogated by the court over twenty years ago in smith phillips.to the contrary,the doctrine of implied or presumed bias has been recognized from our country earliest days,and it remains firmly rooted.as judge kozinski aptly explained in for an en banc ninth circuit majority 
presumed bias dates back in this country at least to aaron burr trial for treason,where chief justice marshall,riding circuit,noted that an individual under the influence of personal prejudice is presumed to have a bias on his mind which will prevent an impartial decision of the case,according to the testimony.marshall explained,he may declare that notwithstanding these prejudices he is determined to listen to the evidence,and be governed by it but the law will not trust him.united states burr,cas,emphasis added.
dyer,at presuming bias where juror concealed that her brother was victim of similar crime.moreover,as the dyer court observed,n o opinion in the two centuries of the republic has suggested that a criminal defendant might lawfully be convicted by a jury tainted by implied bias.id.at see also smith,at,concurring none of our previous cases preclude the use of the conclusive presumption of implied bias in appropriate circumstances.
to be sure,the smith court declined to presume such bias in a setting where a juror had applied for employment with the prosecutor office during the defendant trial,and a hearing disclosed no indication that the juror was,in fact,biased.see at.nothing in the smith decision,however,indicates that the court intended to discard the doctrine of implied or presumed bias.indeed,justice wrote separately on this point,expressing her view that the majority opinion does not foreclose the use of implied bias in appropriate circumstances,such as a close familial relationship.id.at,concurring.and in mcdonough,decided by the court two years after smith,five justices wrote or joined concurring opinions emphasizing that the doctrine of implied bias was yet available.see mcdonough,at.blackmun,concurring,joined by stevens,and,observing that in exceptional circumstances,the facts are such that bias is to be inferred id.at.brennan,concurring in the judgment,joined by marshall,recognizing that b ecause the bias of a juror will rarely be admitted by the juror himself it necessarily must be inferred from surrounding facts and circumstances see also solis cockrell,cir noting that five justices in mcdonough agreed on vitality of implied bias doctrine it would be unreasonable to conclude,as the state urges here,that this bedrock principle of constitutional jurisprudence was abandoned without so much as a whisper from the supreme court.
not surprisingly,each court of appeals to have addressed the issue agrees that the doctrine of implied bias remains,after smith,a settled constitutional principle as the fifth circuit observed,w hile the supreme court has application of the implied bias principle,it has never rejected the principle itself.brooks dretke,cir reversing death sentence due to presumption of bias where juror was charged during trial with weapons offense by district attorney office which was prosecuting case.in these circumstances,we are constrained to agree with the observation of judge kozinski in dyer courts disagree,smith about when the doctrine applies,not whether it exists.dyer,at.accordingly,the implied bias principle constitutes clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.and,on the basis of conaway mar i allegations,it was unreasonable for the mar court to conclude that,even if juror waddell had been candid on voir dire,conaway would nevertheless have lacked a valid basis for challenging juror waddell for cause 
even where,as here,the two parts of the mcdonough test have been satisfied,a juror bias is only established under mcdonough if the juror motives for concealing information or the reasons that affect the juror impartiality can truly be said to affect the fairness of the trial.mcdonough,at.see also conner polk,cir.in mar i,conaway alleged facts sufficient to establish that juror waddell concealed crucial information in order to serve on conaway jury.such dishonesty,of itself,is evidence of bias.burton johnson,cir see also united states colombo,cir recognizing that lying during voir dire is inconsistent with obligation to weigh the evidence fairly and obey the instructions of the court.
moreover,juror waddell relationship to harrington necessarily affected the fairness of conaway trial.put simply,conaway trial was a swearing match,with conaway and his accusing each other of the heinous murders of weatherford and callahan.as the prosecutor acknowledged in his closing argument,the jury could not convict conaway without crediting harrington version of events over that presented in conaway own testimony.see i f you believe what kelly harrington told you y ou can convict conaway of all the charges.if you believe conaway then you will acquit conaway.it really simple.and as lord coke aptly observed,no matter how remote soever,the law presumeth that one kinsman doth favor another before a stranger.state allred,quoting thomas coke,vol.internal quotation marks omitted.
as a result,it was unreasonable for the mar court to conclude that the allegations in mar i were legally insufficient,under the clearly established mcdonough principles,to show that juror bias infringed conaway constitutional right to an impartial jury.section d of aedpa therefore does not preclude conaway from obtaining federal habeas corpus relief on the juror bias claim,because the mar court decision involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.
for similar reasons,the district court erred in dismissing the juror bias claim without an evidentiary hearing.as explained below,the district court erroneously determined that e precluded conaway from being accorded an evidentiary hearing on that claim,and it erred in ruling that conaway had not alleged facts sufficient to entitle him to relief.
under aedpa,a federal district court may not ordinarily grant an evidentiary hearing on a claim that was presented to a state court when the petitioner has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings.see e.a petitioner has not failed to develop the facts of his claim,however,if he has made a reasonable attempt,in light of the information available at the time,to investigate and pursue claims in state court.williams michael taylor,d.at a minimum,a diligent petitioner must seek an evidentiary hearing in state court in the manner prescribed by state law.id.at.
on the facts presented in this record,conaway reasonably attempted,in light of the information available to him at the relevant times,to investigate and pursue the juror bias claim in state court.his efforts were thwarted,however,by reluctant witnesses and unreceptive courts.conaway direct appeal was not resolved until october,and his lawyers were not appointed until july.although conaway request for funds to hire an investigator was denied,his attorneys personally investigated the juror bias claim,sometimes at their own expense.see.despite their efforts,potential witnesses in both the waddell and harrington families were reluctant to cooperate with the lawyers,or they flatly refused to do so.and,as conaway lawyer smith explained by affidavit,the official records of richmond county are for establish the relationship between juror waddell and harrington.moreover,conaway request for an evidentiary hearing in the mar court was denied,depriving him of the opportunity to build a factual record.because conaway has been reasonably diligent in pursuing his claim,and his failure to fully develop the facts related to the juror bias claim in state court is attributable to external causes,e does not preclude him from being accorded an evidentiary hearing in federal court.see williams,at.
when a state court has denied a habeas corpus petitioner the opportunity to develop his claims,he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing in federal court if he can establish one of the six factors enumerated by the supreme court in townsend sain,d,and if he has alleged facts which,if true,would entitle him to relief.see walker true,cir.a petitioner is not to be awarded relief,however,on the basis of an error that was harmless,in that it did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the outcome of the underlying proceeding.fullwood lee,cir quoting brecht abrahamson,d.and where the court is in grave doubt,as to the effect of a constitutional is,if the court is in virtual equipoise regarding an error petitioner is entitled to an evidentiary hearing.see fullwood,at.
conaway has never been afforded an opportunity to develop the facts underlying the juror bias claim,and he can therefore satisfy at least the fifth townsend factor.see townsend,at.listing factors that require hearing,including the material facts were not adequately developed at the hearing.and,as our foregoing analysis demonstrates,conaway has stated a valid claim for relief under mcdonough conaway has alleged in his federal habeas corpus petition,as he did in mar i,that juror waddell concealed his relationship to harrington during the voir dire proceedings,which affected the fairness of conaway trial.
furthermore,in addition to the mar i allegations,conaway has alleged in his federal proceedings that,during voir dire,juror waddell failed to honestly answer several material as whether he had formed any opinion concerning conaway would have exposed juror waddell previous statements that he hope d to get on this jury because if conaway did it,he should die.in morgan illinois,the supreme court reiterated that a juror who will automatically vote for the death penalty in every case will fail in good faith to consider the evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances as the instructions require him to do.see,d.accordingly,juror waddell could have been challenged for cause under morgan if he had answered truthfully on voir dire.and as the court said,if even one such juror is empaneled and the death sentence is imposed,the state is disentitled to execute the sentence.id.
conaway has alleged that he was convicted and sentenced to death by a jury that included a primary accuser double first cousin,once removed,and his affidavits reflect that the juror had previously asserted that,if conaway was guilty,he should die.in these circumstances,we need not labor to conclude that such a serious constitutional injury affected conaway substantial rights,nor are we in doubt as to the necessity of an evidentiary hearing.see fullwood,at concluding that allegations that spouse pressured juror to vote for death sentence are of a type that draw into question the integrity of the verdict,and give rise to a presumption of prejudice internal quotation marks and citation omitted.yet conaway has never been accorded the opportunity to develop the facts underlying his claim.see townsend,at.as the supreme court has long held,the remedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity to prove actual bias.see,smith phillips,d.the district court therefore committed an error of abused its denying conaway an evidentiary hearing on the juror bias claim 
finally,we turn to the atkins claim,which was first raised in mar ii,and upon which we also awarded the coa.on appeal,conaway asserts that the district court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing to prove that he is entitled to relief from execution under atkins virginia,d.in atkins,the court declared that the execution of mentally retarded offenders contravenes the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.id.at.in so doing,the court left to the various states the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,to prevail on the atkins claim,conaway must show that he should be deemed mentally retarded under north carolina law.see walker true,cir.
in north carolina,a convicted offender seeking to prove that he is mentally retarded is obliged to prove that he has significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning,and significant limitations in adaptive functioning,both of which had manifested before the age of.a a a.the statute defines significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning as a n intelligence quotient of or below.id.a c 
conaway contends in these proceedings,as he did in mar ii,that he is entitled to be deemed mentally retarded because he has an iq of and a lifetime record of major impairment in academics,employment,and life skills.in support of mar ii,conaway submitted the affidavit of fisher,asserting that conaway had scored on an iq test in when conaway was years old,and that,based on a examination,fisher believed conaway to be mentally retarded.the mar court rejected conaway claim,concluding that conaway had consistently received an iq score of or on tests administered prior to the age of,and had presented absolutely no affidavit or documentary evidence that he had an iq of or below before the age of.state conaway,crs,slip op.at.the mar court further explained that the iq score of represented only conaway current is,it did not show that conaway had manifested the requisite iq of or below before the age of that fisher had testified at conaway sentencing hearing that conaway was not mentally retarded.id.
although the mar court denied mar ii prior to the supreme court atkins decision,it determined that conaway is not mentally retarded under north carolina law,thereby deciding the dispositive issue in the atkins claim.accordingly,the court disposition of mar ii constitutes an adjudication on the merits of the atkins claim for purposes of aedpa.see early packer,d per curiam concluding that state court ruling which did not cite supreme court precedent was nonetheless on the merits hill ozmint,cir a state court may adjudicate a claim on the merits without relying on or citing relevant supreme court precedents.citing early.on the record before the mar court,neither its application of the law nor its determination of the facts on the atkins claim was unreasonable.see d.we therefore affirm the district court denial of the atkins claim 
pursuant to the foregoing,we affirm the district court dismissal of the atkins claim.on the other hand,we remand for an evidentiary hearing on the juror bias claim and for such other and further proceedings as may be appropriate 
affirmed in part and remanded in part.
i concur in the majority opinion in the decision that conaway execution is not precluded by the eighth amendment under atkins virginia,d.i also concur in the remand of the case for further consideration of the juror bias claim,but for a different reason than does the majority.
conaway attorneys knew of the telephone call with respect to the relationship between the juror waddell and the witness and harrington at october.october was two days prior to the commencement of the trial,which started on october,with the empaneling of the jury,it having not been previously sworn,although selected,in proceedings in the trial court from monday,october through friday,october.the telephone call referred to was described as anonymous and as follows 
the gist of the call was that juror,i believe,is a cousin,and may be even a first cousin of the kelly harrington.
the jury had not been empaneled until the trial began,the morning of october,and north carolina law was quite clear that the juror waddell was disqualified as a cousin of a prosecuting witness as a matter of law under state allred.but no challenge was made to the seating of waddell at that time,or later,before verdict,and conaway attorneys moved only that the trial court examine,juror,waddell to ascertain his kinship,if any.the motion was denied.
the trial on the merits commenced on october,and continued on october,and,when the case was sent to the jury.the jury returned its verdict the afternoon of the.conaway testified for himself on october and,and harrington had testified on october and on behalf of the state.both were,as were all of the witnesses whose testimony was other than purely routine and subject to little contradiction or interpretation.through all four days of the trial on the merits,conaway and his attorneys sat silent as to waddell disqualification,with the disqualified juror,waddell,sitting on the jury.this was no defense but was active and strenuous.i am convinced that,on this record,conaway and his attorneys suffered waddell to be on the jury and can not now take advantage of any error relating to his sitting.
