steven smith is an ohio inmate sentenced to death for raping and murdering a baby.we affirm the district court denial of a writ of habeas corpus.
background 
on september,smith was living with his girlfriend,keysha frye,and her two young daughters,ashley and autumn.that evening,smith drank three beers while he,frye,and the children visited a friend.on the way home,smith bought a of beer and drank one in the car.once back at frye apartment,smith and frye put the children to bed,then watched television and had sex.frye went to bed around,but smith stayed up drinking.
at approximately,smith woke frye by placing autumn naked body next to her.frye realized that autumn was not breathing and accused smith of killing her smith threw an alarm clock and said that she was not dead.frye quickly took autumn body and ashley to a neighbor apartment,screaming that smith had killed her baby.smith followed,exclaiming that he did do anything and asking why was she fucking lying,but the neighbor did not let him in.a short while later,another neighbor observed smith throw a trash bag in the dumpster and heard smith say that he did not do anything and that he was leaving.this neighbor convinced smith not to leave.
when the police arrived,they saw no signs of forcible entry in frye apartment,and they found the television on and extremely loud.they discovered autumn pink baby sleeper under the coffee table and smith cutoffs and jeans near the couch.they also found material,later determined to be pieces of shredded diaper,scattered on the floor in the same area,and piles of autumn hair were found on the coffee table.the police also retrieved a garbage bag from the outside trash dumpster that contained a torn baby diaper,smith,and ten empty beer cans.
when approached by an officer,smith preemptively exclaimed,i did do it,i did do it he smelled of alcohol and swayed back and forth while speaking.at the police station,smith told detectives that he had drunk four beers that night.he stated that he and frye had gone to bed at midnight and that he was awakened by frye,who was accusing him of killing autumn.a month later,smith changed his story,telling police that he had consumed nine beers,and that he awoke downstairs at and,believing that something was wrong with autumn,carried her upstairs.he also denied putting trash in the dumpster.
smith was charged with aggravated murder for raping and killing a child under the age of thirteen.at trial,the coroner who performed the autopsy testified extensively,using autopsy photographs and slides.he explained that autumn died from compression asphyxia and blunt trauma to the head.the injuries to her head and the abrasions on her forehead,cheek,and chin indicated that she was lying on her abdomen and that her face had been forced into a pillow.contusions to her buttocks indicated that they were subject to pressure from the weight of another person.other bruising and abrasions revealed that autumn had resisted the attack.she also suffered subarachnoid and retinal hemorrhages consistent with shaken baby impact syndrome,indicating that she had been restrained,and she was missing hair from the back of her head,suggesting that the attacker had forcefully grasped it.furthermore,her clitoris was red,her vagina was ten times the normal size for a baby her age,and there was a hemorrhage in her anus,all indicative of attempted penetration.additionally,autumn blood was found on two seat cushions and on her pink sleeper.no semen was found.
smith offered the testimony of a forensic toxicologist to support his intoxication defense.the police tested smith level at on september,approximately seven hours after he was arrested,as.the toxicologist testified that,based on this result,smith level would have been at least and possibly as high as at on september.smith also offered evidence that he drank as many as fifteen beers that night,and that he was an alcoholic who drank heavily and frequently blacked out.
the jury found smith guilty as charged and sentenced him to death.the ohio supreme court affirmed smith conviction and sentence on direct appeal,state smith,ohio,and the ohio court of appeals denied his petition for postconviction review.the district court denied smith petition for a writ of habeas corpus.smith appeals,having received a certificate of appealability on four claims that the prosecutor improperly commented on his failure to testify that the jury instructions were misleading that counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the misleading penalty instructions and for not requesting clarifying instructions and that the trial court should have instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter.
ii.standard of review 
when a state court has adjudicated the merits of a defendant claim,we may only grant a writ of habeas corpus if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.an adjudication on the merits is contrary to clearly established supreme court law if,for example,the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court cases.williams taylor,d.an adjudication on the merits unreasonably applies supreme court law if,for example,the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case.id.at.the application must be objectively unreasonable,not merely incorrect.id.at.when a state court adjudication on the merits is either contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent,we must then resolve the claim without the deference aedpa otherwise requires.panetti quarterman,d.
iii.prosecutorial misconduct 
smith first claim is that the prosecutor improperly commented on his failure to testify during the guilt phase by telling the jurors to ask themselves,d id smith claim accident,that he did do this on purpose see griffin california,d.this claim is procedurally defaulted counsel failed to object to the comment at trial,and the state court enforced the procedural bar by reviewing the claim only for plain error.see seymour walker,cir.
smith asserts that we should not enforce his default.but his claim that the state courts do not regularly enforce ohio contemporaneous objection rule is squarely foreclosed by our precedent.nields bradshaw,cir holding that ohio state courts have not applied its contemporaneous objection rule unevenly and inconsistently with regard to prosecutorial misconduct claims.and he can not excuse his default through the ineffectiveness of counsel because he can not show that counsel failure to object to this one drawing attention to deficient.lundgren mitchell,cir a ny single failure to object to closing arguments usually can not be said to have been error d efense counsel must so consistently fail to use objections,despite numerous and clear reasons for doing so,that counsel failure can not reasonably have been said to have been part of a trial strategy or tactical choice.
iv.misleading jury instructions 
we address smith second and third claims together because both relate to the jury instructions.smith second claim is that the penalty instructions violated caldwell mississippi,d,because they affirmatively misled the jury regarding its role in the sentencing process,romano oklahoma,d.under ohio law,the jury must unanimously recommend the death penalty thus,a solitary juror may prevent it.state brooks,ohio.smith contends that the instructions wrongly suggested that the jury was required to reject the death penalty unanimously,rather than to choose it unanimously.
this claim is also procedurally defaulted.counsel did not object to the instructions as given.smith wrongly suggests that the state court did not enforce the procedural bar because it did not discuss this claim in terms of plain error.after reviewing the several claims that smith had preserved for appeal,the court stated as for the remaining arguments regarding jury instructions,since smith did not raise an objection,we apply a analysis it then rejected,inter alia,this claim.thus,the court enforced the procedural bar,see seymour,at.
smith third claim is that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the penalty instructions as misleading and for not requesting an additional instruction explicitly stating that a solitary juror could prevent the death penalty.see strickland washington,d.although the state court rejected this claim on the merits,we review it de novo because smith also argues that it excuses the default of his second claim.see girts yanai,cir.c ounsel can not be ineffective for a failure to raise an issue that lacks merit.the instructions stated you shall impose the death sentence only if all of you unanimously find that the death penalty is appropriate.you shall impose one of the life imprisonment verdicts if all of you do not unanimously find that the death penalty is appropriate emphasis added.this unmistakably informed the jury that the death penalty must be endorsed by every juror,and thus that one juror could prevent it.hartman bagley,cir rejecting an identical claim about the instruction,i f you can not unanimously agree that the death penalty is appropriate,you will then impose a life sentence.no other aspect of the instructions or the verdict forms undermined this clarity.
smith counsel was also not ineffective for failing to request an additional solitary juror instruction,to which smith was entitled under ohio law,brooks,at.even if smith counsel was deficient for failing to request the additional instruction,smith can not show a reasonable probability that the instruction would have led to a different outcome the instructions as given adequately informed the jury that a single juror could prevent the death penalty,and thus an additional instruction would not have told the jury anything it did not already know.
instruction 
smith final claim is that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter.in capital cases,beck alabama requires that the jury be instructed on a noncapital offense if,and only if,the evidence would permit a jury rationally to find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense and acquit him of the greater,d internal quotation marks omitted.beck explained that when the evidence unquestionably establishes that the defendant is guilty of a serious,violent leaves some doubt with respect to an element that would justify conviction of a capital failure to give the jury the third option of convicting of a lesser included offense would seem inevitably to enhance the risk of an unwarranted conviction.id.at.
under ohio law,involuntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of aggravated murder,distinguished by the lack of intent to kill.state campbell,ohio.smith contends that the trial court should have instructed the jury on involuntary manslaughter because,while there was overwhelming evidence that smith raped and killed autumn,the evidence of his voluntary intoxication would allow a rational jury to reasonably doubt whether he intended to kill her.the state court denied this claim on the merits,carefully recounting autumn injuries and concluding that no reasonable juror could have found that smith did not intend to kill her,given the brutality and duration of the crime.
smith contends that the state court decision is both contrary to and an unreasonable application of beck.he argues that the decision is contrary to beck because the court did not,in fact,determine whether a rational jury reasonably could have doubted his intent to kill rather,he maintains that the court rejected his claim only because he did not provide evidence of a specific intent to molest autumn and because the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict.this argument fails.the court noted that smith had not provided any evidence of an intent only to molest rather than to kill.also,smith never admitted that he molested her.and,while the state court opinion is not ideal,it plainly did not review the verdict only for the sufficiency of the evidence the court properly recited beck rule,it relied on three cases that properly applied beck,and its analysis is consistent with beck.smith has failed to rebut the presumption that state courts know and follow the law,woodford visciotti,d per curiam.
smith argument that the state court unreasonably applied beck requires more analysis,but also fails it is well established that a instruction is not required where the facts of a murder so strongly indicate intent to kill that the jury could not rationally have a reasonable doubt as to the defendant intent.see,hopper evans,d denying a beck claim where the defendant testimony and evidence that he shot the victim in the back during an armed robbery affirmatively negated any claim that he did not intend to kill the victim campbell coyle,cir holding that the defendant beck claim failed because the number and location of the victim five stab wounds compelled a reasonable jury to find that the defendant possessed the intent to kill,despite evidence of a struggle see also slaughter parker,cir rejecting a beck claim in the alternative because the facts that the victim was bludgeoned in the head and stabbed five times foreclose the conclusion that the defendant acted with any mental state other than intent bell,cir rejecting a beck claim in the alternative because t he fact that the defendant shot the victim with a pistol five to six times makes it virtually impossible to find that the killing was accidental.
this case law reflects the sensible view that,as a general matter,repeated violent conduct conclusively proves intent to kill.autumn death reflects such conduct for ten to thirty minutes,smith violently raped a baby,during which time the baby resisted the attack and smith forcibly subdued her by forcing her face into a pillow,ripping out her hair,shaking her,and causing deadly blunt force trauma to her head.compared to the overwhelming proof of intent from such directed and persistent brutality,smith intoxication evidence,which was not connected to any testimony that he was too drunk to form any intent,does not allow a juror rationally to acquit him of aggravated murder.palmer bagley,cir concluding that a jury could not rationally have found that the defendant lacked the specific intent to kill each victim where both were shot twice in the head at close range,despite the defendant evidence that he was severely intoxicated from alcohol and lsd,that there had been a struggle,and his testimony that he did not intend to kill the victims.therefore,we can not say the state court decision was unreasonable.
smith case may be compared usefully with the cases cited in the previous two paragraphs.smith fundamental claim is that a jury could reasonably make the leap from his obvious intoxication to the conclusion that he did not intend to kill autumn frye.and,it is certainly not physically or logically impossible that he did not harbor such an intent,because the ultimate fact of intent can only be inferred,rather than ever known.
however,what smith seeks from a jury would be a leap of faith,not an inferential leap based on evidence.we note that smith did not contend,through his own testimony or any other type of circumstantial evidence,that he intended only molestation,but not killing.his basic position was always that no molestation occurred.
in the cases cited above,it was equally true that it was not physically or logically impossible that there was no intent to kill.in hopper,it was not impossible that a gunman firing a shot that struck the victim in the back intended only to frighten or wound.in campbell,it was not physically impossible that an assailant in a struggle might strike five wounds in the chest while intending only to disable but,as judge gilman opinion there ably showed,a conclusion need not be impossible to be unreasonable.at.similarly,the wounds delivered in slaughter and in could in principle have been inflicted by a flailing assailant intending only minatory action,but there was no evidence that this theoretically possible situation occurred,just as in our case there is no evidence from which a jury could reasonably draw the conclusion that smith intended some outrage,but not killing.in particular,the evidence showed not only simple asphyxiation,which might in theory have been caused only by smith weight pressing on the baby in the course of a rape.instead,the evidence directly showed blunt trauma to the head and shaken baby impact syndrome,indicative of lethal force purposefully applied.
and even if the state court analysis under beck were unreasonable,we would analyze smith claim under de novo review,panetti,at,and reject it because his evidence of intoxication was insufficient as a matter of state law to negate intent to kill.a instruction is required only where the facts of the case and the laws of the state warrant such an instruction.hill black,cir emphasis added hopkins reeves,d holding that beck requires instruction only on crimes that are lesser included offenses under state law spaziano florida,d holding that a instruction was not required when the lesser offense statute of limitations had run.
under montana egelhoff,states may regulate of voluntary intoxication can negate specific intent,d.we agree with our apparently unanimous sister circuits that,given egelhoff,beck claims based on voluntary intoxication that negates intent will fail unless the evidence of intoxication satisfies the state law requirements for negating intent.see,spears mullin,cir applying oklahoma rule that the defendant must be so intoxicated that his mental abilities were overcome or that the intoxication prevented him from acting with malice skipper lee,table,wl,at cir applying north carolina rule that the defendant must produce substantial evidence which would support a conclusion by the judge that he was so intoxicated that he could not form a deliberate and premeditated intent to kill goodwin johnson,cir holding that the laws of texas foreclose our finding a beck violation on the basis of evidence of the defendant voluntary intoxication because texas does not allow voluntary intoxication to negate intent clabourne lewis,cir explaining that in evaluating beck claims based on intoxication,the court must first consider whether arizona recognizes intoxication as a defense to the premeditation element of murder.
at the time of smith conviction,ohio law allowed voluntary intoxication to create a reasonable doubt as to the defendant intent to kill o nly where the defendant was so intoxicated as to be mentally unable to intend anything.state otte,ohio.thus,even belief in a claim not made here that smith only intended rape,but not murder,would not justify the instruction.the state court rejected smith request for a instruction,concluding that the evidence demonstrated that he could intend some thing at the time of the murder.smith claim that this holding was error was not certified for appeal,and the state court holding therefore forecloses his beck claim as a matter of state law,smith intoxication evidence could not create a reasonable doubt as to his intent to kill.
nonetheless,we note our agreement with the state court conclusion.as we explained above,the facts of the crime demonstrate that smith could intend some thing.so do his actions immediately before and after the murder.smith apparently was aware enough to turn up the volume on the television to drown out autumn cries remove her baby sleeper and tear apart her diaper carry her body upstairs to her mother have conversations with the neighbors and the police,and deny responsibility for her death repeatedly and clean up the evidence of the murder and throw it away.these are not the aimless and uncontrolled actions of an individual incapable of intend ing anything.otte,at finding that the defendant was not so intoxicated as to be mentally unable to intend anything because,inter alia,he turned up the volume of the television to drown out the victims cries,he shot them in the head,and he left the crime scene state tillman,wl,at ohio app,rejecting a request for instructions where the defendant was able to ride a bike and complet e the physical acts necessary for his part in getting aboard and absconding with the victim vehicle,and where the defendant assault of the victim indicated the cognitive wherewithal to understand that the vehicle owner stood as an impediment to getting away with the crime state adkins,wl,at ohio app,rejecting a request for instructions because,although the defendant was too intoxicated to give a statement to police upon arrest,he had been able to drive a car,have a conversation,and retrieve a gun before the murder.
vi.conclusion 
we affirm the district court denial of habeas relief.
i concur in parts iii prosecutorial misconduct and iv misleading jury instructions of the lead opinion without reservation.because ohio state law at the time of smith conviction severely restricted the consideration of his intoxication evidence to the point of rendering it unhelpful to smith,i also reluctantly join in part v the instruction.but i write separately to express my concerns regarding the ohio supreme court analysis of the issue of the jury instruction under beck alabama,d.
in beck,the supreme court held that the death penalty may not be imposed where the jury is not permitted to consider a verdict of guilt of a lesser included offense,and where the evidence would have supported such a verdict.at.the petitioner in that case,gilbert beck,participated in a robbery with an accomplice.id.at.beck maintained that he never intended to kill the victim,and that his accomplice unexpectedly struck and killed the man after beck had bound him to a chair.id.
the state charged beck with intentional killing during the course of a robbery,and the trial judge was precluded by a state statute from instructing the jury as to the offense of felony murder.id.at.after beck was convicted and sentenced to death,his punishment was upheld by the alabama supreme court.id.at.the united states supreme court reversed,identifying the need for a procedural safeguard that would afford the jury a less drastic alternative than the choice between conviction of the offense charged and acquittal.id.at.in particular,the court recognized that 
when the evidence unquestionably establishes that the defendant is guilty of a serious,violent leaves some doubt with respect to an element that would justify conviction of a capital failure to give the jury the third option of convicting on a lesser included offense would seem inevitably to enhance the risk of an unwarranted conviction.
beck therefore identifies the need to provide jurors with this third option in order to avoid two results convicting a defendant based on a belief that the defendant is guilty of some serious crime and should be punished,or acquitting a guilty defendant based on the belief that,whatever his crime,the defendant does not deserve death.id.at.and although both of these two outcomes are undesirable,the fundamental concern in beck is that a jury convinced that the defendant had committed some violent crime but not convinced that he was guilty of a capital crime might nonetheless vote for a capital conviction if the only alternative was to set the defendant free with no punishment at all.schad arizona,d.
when evaluating smith appellate argument that he was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter instruction which,unlike the charge of aggravated murder,does not require a showing of an intent to kill,the ohio supreme court misapplied beck in two respects.the court first noted that,contrary to smith contention,he presented no evidence at trial indicating that he intended to sexually assault,rather than kill,autumn.state smith,ohio.the lead opinion echoes this assertion,stating that smith did not present any evidence that he intended only molestation.lead op.at lack of proof from the defendant,however,is irrelevant under beck because a reviewing court analysis is limited to whether the evidence as a whole supports the giving of such an instruction.see hopper evans,d.moreover,the defendant in a criminal case is never obligated to present any evidence.united states hynes,cir approving the
