obadyah,formerly known as christopher peterson,was convicted of two counts of murder by an indiana jury.after extensive proceedings through the indiana and federal courts,he was ultimately sentenced to two consecutive terms of imprisonment.he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,claiming various constitutional violations.the district court denied the petition in part and granted the petition in part.we reverse the district court grant of the petition and affirm the denial.
background 
on the afternoon of december,ilija eli and george balovski were found dead inside their tailor shop in gary,indiana.both died of shotguns wounds to the head.
shortly after the balovski killings,antwion mcgee,a friend of,met with,who told mcgee that he got the guys at the tailor shop and then described the murders in detail.mcgee passed this information on to the police.the police then went to home and obtained consent to search the home from petitioner mother,who lived with him.after searching the home,the police discovered a shotgun in closet,which tests later confirmed had fired a spent shell casing found at the scene of the balovski murders.the police took into custody,whereupon he confessed to shooting the balovskis,giving a detailed account of the murders.was further questioned about a series of other murders that had occurred in the area surrounding gary which,because of the weapon involved,were called in media reports the shotgun killings.admitted to being the shooter in all seven of these other shootings.
was tried for the seven shootings over a span of four trials.at each trial,the prosecution relied on evidence that the shotgun used in the shootings was found in bedroom and confessed to the shootings.presented evidence that a man matching the description of a composite sketch obtained by the police was seen in the vicinity of each of the crimes describes himself as a black man.in the first two trials,was acquitted.he was convicted in the third trial of two counts of murder the porter county convictions,but this court held that the prosecutor improper closing statements rendered the convictions constitutionally invalid.davis,cir.he has yet to be retried for these shootings.it is the fourth trial,in which was convicted,that gave rise to the appeal before us today.
on may,a jury convicted of murdering the balovski brothers.on june,the indiana trial judge,over the jury recommendation,imposed the death penalty.conviction and sentence were affirmed by the indiana supreme court.peterson state.he filed a petition for relief,which the trial court denied the indiana supreme court affirmed the denial.state.the state court judgment against became final on december.
next he turned to the federal court,filing a motion for writ of habeas corpus challenging his conviction and sentence.that petition was denied.davis,d.while his appeal from that decision was pending,the indiana supreme court issued saylor indiana,ruling that a defendant could not be sentenced to death over a jury recommendation to the contrary.then filed a new petition for relief,which the indiana supreme court granted,vacating his death sentence.we then dismissed appeal before this court on october,under younger harris,d for lack of jurisdiction,finding that,because had not been resentenced by an indiana court,the judgment had not become final.davis.cir unpublished order.we noted that could refile his habeas petition after resentencing and after he exhausted his state court remedies.
on december,the indiana trial court imposed two consecutive terms.the indiana court of appeals affirmed the sentence.after his petition for rehearing and petition to transfer jurisdiction to the indiana supreme court were both denied,filed the habeas petition at bar.
the district court entered an amended memorandum opinion and order on may,granting the writ with regard to the two terms of incarceration based on the court conclusion that the invalid porter county convictions played too great a role in the imposition of the sentence,but denying the remainder of the petition,relying on the reasoning in the first denial of habeas in.this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,argues that the district court erred by finding that the indiana supreme court had not unreasonably applied strickland washington rejecting challenge to the admission of his confession and rejecting brady claim regarding a failure to disclose exculpatory evidence.on,the state argues that the district court had no authority to grant habeas relief with respect to sentence.we review each issue in turn.
we review de novo the district court denial of a habeas petition.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,we may grant habeas relief only if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d,williams taylor,d.under the contrary to clause of d,the habeas petitioner must show that the state court decision applie d a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court cases or if the court decides a case differently than the supreme court has done on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.calloway montgomery,cir citing williams,at,d and bell cone,d.under the unreasonable application clause,a petitioner must show that the state court decision unreasonably extended a rule to a context where it should not have applied or unreasonably refused to extend a rule to a context where it should have applied.virsnieks,at citing jackson miller,cir see also wright van patten,d emphasizing that a state court application of clearly established law is acceptable,even if it is likely incorrect,so long as it is reasonable.we presume state factual findings to be correct,unless the petitioner rebuts the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.see e dretke,d wiggins smith,d barrow uchtman,cir.the presumption of correctness also applies to factual findings made by a state court of review based on the trial record.sumner mata,d rodriguez peters,cir see matthews ishee,cir.
as a general matter,under habeas law,we defer to a great extent to the decisions of the state courts,and review these decisions for reasonableness only.badelle correll,cir.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
argues that his sixth amendment right to counsel was violated by his trial counsel negligent failure to call patrick fleming to testify he argues that,in ruling against him,the indiana supreme court unreasonably applied strickland and unreasonably determined the facts in doing so.
as part of his petition,submitted the affidavit of fleming,who stated that he was in eli balovski tailor shop on the afternoon of the murders,and that as he was leaving the shop at or,he noticed a car on the opposite side of the street from the tailor shop with a person in the driver seat.fleming got in his own car,made a,and drove past the car.he noticed that the man was white with dark hair and dark eyes,and when he drove past,the man reached between his legs and made sure that i could see what he had there.fleming thought the man had a gun.he also thought that the man in the car was one of the men in the composite sketches published in area newspapers relating to the shotgun shootings.this information was available to counsel at trial 
argument before the indiana supreme court rested primarily on a comparison of the evidence in the gary murder trial,where he was convicted,and the first two trials,where he was acquitted.specifically,he noted in his first two trials he was able to present evidence placing a man at the scene of the crime,whereas in the gary murder trial he was not.had he introduced this evidence through fleming at the trial for the balovski murders,argued before the indiana supreme court and argues before us,the outcome would have followed that of his earlier acquittals.
the indiana supreme court examined strickland washington,d,in evaluating claim of ineffective assistance.to succeed under strickland,as the indiana supreme court understood,one must show that trial counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that prejudice resulted.id.at,d.for the first prong,review of trial counsel performance must be highly deferential and every effort must be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.johnson loftus,cir quoting strickland,at,d.a petitioner must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.id.quoting strickland,at,d.to show prejudice,the petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at,d.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.again,for the purposes of our review,the state court application of these principles must be objectively unreasonable and not merely erroneous.yarborough gentry,d.
claims the indiana supreme court made two errors,one under d and another under d.first submits that the indiana supreme court unreasonably applied supreme court precedent in finding that he was not prejudiced by his trial counsel failure to call fleming.the indiana supreme court,applying the strickland standard,assumed a deficiency of counsel performance but found failed to satisfy the prejudice requirement.the court pointed to the substantial evidence presented at critically,the shotgun found in closet and his confession to the noted that fleming testimony would not have unerringly or unmistakably led to a different conclusion.though fleming thought the man had a gun in the car,he did not actually see a gun and though there is some dispute about the timing of the identification and the shooting more on this below,fleming would not have been able to undisputably put the man in the car at the scene near the time of the shooting.without these potentially exculpatory details,the indiana supreme court found,the strickland claim must fail.
disagrees with this result again,our review under the unreasonable application clause of d is limited to whether the court extended a rule to an inapplicable context or refused to extend a rule to an applicable context.neither of these situations is present here.the court properly weighed the strength of the evidence against against fleming affidavit,and did not find a reasonable probability of a different outcome from calling fleming.accordingly,we will not disturb the indiana supreme court reasonable application of strickland.
the second error claimed by concerns the facts as determined by the indiana supreme court.in analyzing the prejudice prong of strickland,the court decline d to attach much significance to the two previous acquittals,but engaged in argument regarding these acquittals anyway.it held that the evidence presented in the first two trials regarding another possible shooter was much more compelling than that presented in flemings affidavit.state,at.in one case,the court noted,an eyewitness sitting in the victim car when she was shot testified that she observed a light complected male wearing a trench coat standing next to the car.in another,two witnesses testified that they saw a white male with a trench coat walking toward a car with a cylindrical object parallel to his leg shortly before they heard a shotgun blast.in both of these cases the witnesses saw a man directly before the shootings.the court concluded by contrast,fleming observations do not place anyone at the crime scene at the time of the shooting.rather,fleming places someone across the street a half hour before the shootings.the court also noted that fleming did not actually see a gun,even though he thought the man had a gun in his lap.
argues that this decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,in violation of d.he musters several inconsistencies between the record and the indiana supreme court factual determinations,but only one comes close to having merit the timing of the identification and the shooting.fleming affidavit indicates he saw the man across the street of the tailor shop at or according to,a brother of the two balovskis testified that he saw a man with a shotgun pointed at his brother at either or.therefore,argues,the shooting was at most twenty minutes after,and potentially contemporaneous with,fleming identification,and not a half hour before the shootings.this factual issue is relevant only because the indiana supreme court,in analyzing the prejudice element of strickland,disregarded fleming observations in his affidavit because they did not place anyone at the crime scene at the time of the shooting.the state chose to ignore this issue in its brief.
a petitioner challenge to a state court decision based on a factual determination under d will not succeed unless the state court committed an unreasonable error,and e provides the mechanism for proving unreasonableness.see ward sternes,cir.if the petitioner shows that the state court determined an underlying factual issue against the clear and convincing weight of the evidence,the petitioner has gone a long way towards proving that it committed unreasonable error.ward,at.a state court decision that rests upon a determination of fact that lies against the clear weight of the evidence is,by definition,a decision so inadequately supported by the record as to be arbitrary and therefore objectively unreasonable.id.quoting hall washington,cir.this is a daunting standard,but not insurmountable.see cockrell,d deference does not by definition preclude relief.a federal court can disagree with a state court credibility determination and,when guided by aedpa,conclude that the decision was unreasonable.
upon careful review of the record,we find that the indiana supreme court determined a factual issue against the clear and convincing weight of the evidence when it found that the identification was a half hour before the shootings.the testimony of slavko balovski,the brother who saw the shooter in the tailor shop,contradicts the supreme court of indiana version of the facts.on direct examination,balovski was asked about the timing of the shooting.he said that prior to the shooting,he and his two brothers were eating lunch at the tailor shop.
q shortly after,had you and your brothers finished your food,sir 
a just around after,or or something.
afterwards,he went back to work at the shop sometime later,he saw a man with a shotgun pointed at his brother.he then ran out of the tailor shop to get help at a muffler shop down the street,and on the way,he heard a gunshot.three to four minutes had passed between the time the shooter entered the store and the time he reached the muffler shop.he then was asked 
q was this at approximately in the afternoon 
a yes,it was after.
on,he was asked about the lighting conditions when he left the tailor shop and fled to the muffler shop it was dark,it was like sunset,it was very dark,it was imagine at that time,sic.
according to this record,balovski places the time of the shooting at some point between after and after.separate testimony by police officers indicated that they had been dispatched to the scene at.comparing this evidence with fleming that he identified the individual in the car at to the length of time between the identification and the shooting is at most minutes extending the period of bolovski after until the dispatch of the police and at least,potentially,within the same range of time.therefore,the indiana supreme court finding that this time period was a half hour was a factual error against the clear and convincing weight of the evidence.
because the half hour finding falls directly within the indiana supreme court analysis of the prejudice element of the strickland,the finding reflects an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.d see wiggins,at,d recognizing that a clear factual error reflects an unreasonable determination of the facts under d.the fact that the indiana supreme court decision only partially rested on this fact does not alter the reasonableness of the determination of the strickland claim.as in wiggins,even a partial reliance on an erroneous fact finding can support a finding of unreasonableness.id.finding that,in the particular circumstances before the court,the state court partial reliance on an erroneous factual finding further highlight ed the unreasonableness of the state court decision.
however,our analysis does not end here.despite a conclusion that the indiana supreme court finding was unreasonable,still must still establish that he is entitled to habeas relief.see aleman sternes,cir see also harrison mcbride,cir citing aleman,at e ven when the aedpa standard does not because the state court opinion was unreasonable or because the state judiciary did not address the constitutional claim a prisoner still must establish an entitlement to the relief he seeks.in this situation,a sets the standard the court issues a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.see aleman,at.
we turn,then,to whether counsel failure to call fleming constituted deficient performance.we assume,arguendo,that can meet the first prong of the strickland analysis.our primary focus rests upon whether counsel failure to call fleming prejudiced his defense.strickland,at,d.in doing so,we weigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of available mitigating evidence.wiggins,at,d.
argues that fleming,had he testified,would have placed a man matching the composite sketch of the shotgun killer in the vicinity of the crime within a brief window of time before the shootings.he further argues that he then would have introduced additional evidence that the witness who helped the police prepare the composite sketch later identified the killer as ronald harris.harris,an associate of mcgee and acquaintance of,was later convicted of shooting one of the victims in the original set of seven shotgun killings.see harris state.
against this,we weigh the substantial evidence introduced against at trial,including his confession the ballistic evidence of the shotgun found in his home and mcgee testimony.certainly casts doubt on mcgee story at trial,but the jury ultimately accepted the testimony.as the state points out,the arguably mitigating evidence regarding the composite sketch and the ronald harris information might not be as helpful as claims.introducing the composite might have opened the door to introducing the facts of the other shotgun killings,a potentially adverse outcome regardless of whether was ultimately convicted of the other murders.in the ronald harris conviction,the witness who identified harris also saw and heard another individual acting as an accomplice.had any of this information been produced at trial,the state could have argued that and harris acted as accomplices in a string of killings in northwest indiana.any mitigating effect of the harris evidence,therefore,must be tempered by the potential for the evidence to strengthen the case against.
putting aside these issues,we return to the core of fleming testimony that he saw a character in the vicinity of the tailor shop at some point prior to the shooting weighing this against the overwhelming evidence against,we can not say with any confidence that the introduction of this sparse testimony would have altered the outcome of trial.accordingly,even though the indiana supreme court made an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented,has failed to establish that he is entitled to habeas relief.
admission of confession 
next contends that his his false the result of an unreasonable restraint that violated his fourth amendment rights.under indiana law,a person who is arrested without a warrant must be brought before a magistrate for a determination of probable cause within hours.was detained for hours before he was taken before a magistrate,and in the last twelve hours,he confessed to the shotgun murders.the indiana supreme court found that,despite the delay in bringing before a magistrate,the appropriate remedy would not be to exclude his confession.the court,after examining gerstein pugh,d and county of riverside mclaughlin,d,found that the hour delay was not a per se violation of the supreme court mandate to promptly bring individuals arrested without a warrant before a magistrate.peterson state,cert.denied,d.
our review of this issue will be short.as long as a habeas petitioner enjoyed an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a fourth amendment claim in state court,federal habeas review of the claim is barred.stone powell,d miranda leibach,cir hayes battaglia,cir.as a general principle,absent a subversion of the hearing process,we will not examine whether the state courts made the right decision.watson hulick,cir citing cabrera hinsley,cir.
claims that he was deprived of a full and fair opportunity to litigate his fourth amendment claim because the indiana supreme court failed to apply the relevant constitutional case law to the facts.he argues that the indiana supreme court failed to address brown illinois,d,a case which,he now points out,he presented to every indiana court he faced in the course of his direct appeal.but therein lies the rub had the full opportunity to litigate his claim and argue the relevant supreme court precedent,including brown,at every stage of his proceedings in indiana.there is no indication that the indiana courts precluded that right.regardless of our own judgment of whether brown has any impact on case,he received a full and fair hearing on this issue,and we will not the indiana supreme court reasoning.see watson,at hayes,at petitioner simply asks us to disagree with the state courts decision,a path that stone closes.cabrera,at.
failure to disclose exculpatory evidence 
finally argues that the state failed to disclose material exculpatory evidence in violation of brady maryland,d.specifically,he claims that the prosecution did not disclose that state witness ivory tito maxwell was a paid informant for the fbi and that the government investigation of and search for the shotgun killer continued after arrest and purported confession.when the government deliberately or inadvertently withholds evidence that is material and favorable to the defense,it violates the defendant right to a fair trial,which is guaranteed by due process.brady,at,d united states wilson,cir.the government has a duty to disclose evidence,regardless of whether the criminal defendant requests it,and that duty applies equally to impeachment and exculpatory evidence.united states bagley,d united states agurs,d wilson,at.
couches his claim in terms of habeas relief,but for all intents and purposes,he has brought a new brady claim in the federal court,and requests plenary review from us.habeas petitions do not proceed in this fashion.fails to point us to any specific indiana decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.see badelle,at.he notes that he raised the brady issue in the indiana courts during his petition and successor petition but he does not suggest any constitutional violations in the ultimate resolution of those issues by the indiana courts.id.at citing harding sternes,cir noting that t he habeas applicant has the burden of proof to show that the application of federal law was unreasonable.
hints at the fact that the two pieces of evidence are new evidence that were not presented at the trial court,perhaps invoking the principle that brady claims not raised at the state level are not procedurally defaulted when the petitioner was unable to present the claim to the state courts because of the state misconduct.see crivens roth,cir citing reed ross,d we will not penalize petitioner for presenting an issue to us that he was unable to present to the state courts because of the state misconduct.b
