montoyae dontae sharpe was convicted of first degree murder in north carolina superior court and sentenced to life in prison.after exhausting state remedies,sharpe petitioned for habeas corpus in federal court,claiming that his conviction was unconstitutional because it resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel.although he had procedurally defaulted on this claim,the district court held that sharpe had come forward with new evidence of actual innocence sufficient to excuse his default.the district court then ruled in sharpe favor on the merits of his constitutional claim.yet in reaching its conclusions,the district court ignored the several state proceedings which had determined that the evidence sharpe presented was not credible and that his constitutional claim was without merit.
such a de novo was impermissible under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.sharpe would have us substitute our own judgment for the state court credibility determinations,disregard the fact that the state courts soundly assessed each of his contentions,and unfairly hindsight the performance of his own trial counsel.such an approach undermines the principles of comity and federalism that the supreme court and congress have set forth in the context of federal habeas review.we therefore reverse and remand with directions to dismiss the petition.
dontae sharpe was charged with killing a man named george radcliffe,who was shot to death on the night of february,in downtown greenville,north carolina.radcliffe body was found inside his pickup truck on a grassy lot,just off a downtown street.inside the truck,police officers found radcliffe wallet,which contained dollars,and a coat later identified as belonging to one wilbur mercer.
at trial,the state offered the testimony of two purported eyewitnesses to the killing.beatrice stokes,years old,and charlene johnson,fifteen years old,both testified that sharpe sold drugs with a man named mark joyner and was a leading drug dealer in the neighborhood where radcliffe body was found.both testified that on the night of the murder,they saw sharpe,joyner,and radcliffe standing in the street next to radcliffe pickup truck,that an argument broke out,and that sharpe shot radcliffe.both stated that wilbur mercer was also at the scene,and stokes noted the presence of several others.
stokes testified that she immediately fled and called the police when the shot went off.johnson testified that she watched sharpe and joyner load radcliffe body into the truck and drive it into the lot where it was found.johnson admitted that she had received a reward for coming forward.stokes testified that she had not received a reward but admitted that she was probably using drugs at the time.
a third eyewitness,alonzo vines,lived in a house adjacent to the lot where radcliffe truck was found.he testified that he was in his house on the night of the murder when he heard a loud noise,looked out his window,and saw that a pickup truck had been driven into the lot.he stated that he saw the truck door was open and that two or three people were standing next to it.he could not identify them,however,because his view was blocked by dust on his windows.seven other witnesses testified for the state.the state medical examiner testified as to the trajectory of the bullet and opined that radcliffe could have remained conscious after the shooting for no more than seconds.police officers investigating the murder testified that local residents appeared to be afraid to get involved.
in his defense,sharpe offered the testimony of his aunt and her neighbor,who offered partial alibis,and of two witnesses who testified that stokes was untrustworthy.sharpe also attempted to introduce further testimony from one of these witnesses,a woman named tracy highsmith.on voir dire,highsmith stated that her boyfriend,damien smith,had come home on the night of the murder and confessed to shooting a man,presumed to be radcliffe,whom he had attempted to rob.according to highsmith,smith repeated comments to this effect several times over the next three weeks.smith committed suicide days after the murder,and while highsmith asserted that he had become increasingly agitated after radcliffe was killed,she also admitted that he had repeatedly threatened suicide before radcliffe death.although sharpe attorney argued that highsmith testimony should be admitted under the dying declaration and state of mind exceptions to the bar on hearsay evidence,the court held that the testimony was inadmissible.a jury found sharpe guilty on july,and the north carolina supreme court sustained his conviction on appeal.state sharpe.
on the day sharpe was first arrested for the murder,charlene johnson had been beaten and stabbed by a group of women for being a snitch.sharpe mother and aunt had followed behind the women as they set out for johnson home and rescued johnson from the attack.in the course of taking her to the emergency room,they told her,in johnson words,that the word on the street was that johnson was the one that said something about dontae murdering radcliffe.for safety reasons,johnson went to live outside of greenville,but her mother could not come with her,and she returned after a few weeks.johnson came to form a relationship with sharpe family,and eventually with sharpe himself,visiting him in prison at least twice.not long after his conviction,johnson recanted her testimony.
in february,sharpe filed a motion for appropriate relief mar in north carolina superior court,alleging that the recantation entitled him to a new trial and raising,for the first time,a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.the mar court held an evidentiary hearing and determined that johnson recantation was not credible.it also held that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim had been defaulted.
sharpe then filed for habeas corpus in federal court,and the district court scheduled an evidentiary hearing on his claims.just prior to the hearing,a man named dearl powell came forward,claiming to have witnessed the shooting and indentifying smith as radcliffe killer.in powell account,radcliffe was in the driver seat of the truck and wilbur mercer was in the passenger seat when smith shot radcliffe through the driver side window.according to powell,after being shot,radcliffe drove the truck off.powell began to testify at the habeas hearing,but the district court cut him off before he could be and ordered that his evidence be presented first in north carolina court.
sharpe filed another mar in november,seeking a new trial under north carolina law on the basis of newly discovered evidence of actual innocence and renewing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.a second evidentiary hearing was held before the same judge who had considered sharpe earlier.after listening to powell and considering the entire evidentiary record,the court concluded that his testimony was not credible and denied sharpe actual innocence claim.in addition,the court held that sharpe ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not only defaulted,as it had done previously,but also that it would fail on the merits.
sharpe then returned to federal court.without holding an evidentiary hearing,the district court concluded that sharpe had sufficiently made out a claim of actual innocence under schlup delo,to justify setting aside his procedural default under north carolina law.sharpe bell,d.it also rejected the state defense.id.at.the district court then concluded that the failure of sharpe counsel to argue for the admission of highsmith testimony under the hearsay exceptions identified in sharpe habeas petition violated the sixth amendment.sharpe bell,d.this appeal followed.
we begin with the district court conclusion that sharpe procedural default in raising his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be excused in general,a federal habeas court may not review constitutional claims when a state court has declined to consider their merits on the basis of an adequate and independent state procedural rule.burket angelone,cir see also wainwright sykes.the mar court held that sharpe had procedurally defaulted under a,a statute we have repeatedly held to be both adequate and independent.lawrence branker,f d,cir citations omitted.a federal habeas court does not have license to question a state court finding of procedural default or to question whether the state court properly applied its own law.barnes thompson,cir citations omitted.nor is a procedural default waived when a state court reaches the merits of a federal claim as an alternative basis for dismissal.harris reed,ashe styles,cir.
although the doctrine of procedural default limits federal habeas review of state convictions,it does not provide an absolute bar.in order to balance the societal interests in finality,comity,and conservation of scarce judicial resources with the individual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinary case,the supreme court has recognized an exception for situations in which a petitioner incarceration represents a fundamental miscarriage of justice.schlup,at.this exception excuses a procedural default where a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.murray carrier.if a petitioner presents new reliable evidence supporting a claim of actual innocence,the habeas court must determine whether it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.schlup,at.this assessment is based on a review of all the evidence,old and new,incriminating and exculpatory,without regard to whether it would necessarily be admitted under rules of admissibility that would govern at trial.house bell,u,internal quotation marks omitted citing schlup,at.
whether and to what extent aedpa applies to schlup claims is the threshold question.one of the most significant changes wrought by aedpa was to provide that,with certain limited exceptions,a petition for federal habeas must be denied if it is founded on a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.d.with respect to a schlup claim of actual innocence,however,we do not believe that this provision applies.state courts have no occasion to adjudicate a schlup claim as such and the mar court primary the ineffective assistance of counsel claim was procedurally not an adjudication on the merits under d.stephens branker,cir but see cooper brown,cir rymer,concurring in denial of rehearing en banc.
but while a state court does not adjudicate a schlup claim,it may well decide matters relevant to one,quite possibly in the course of deciding highly similar issues of state or federal law.in addition to section d,aedpa also provides that in a habeas proceeding challenging a state conviction,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.e.the habeas petitioner bears the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.id.while section d thus has no application in the context of a schlup claim because it pertains only to a claim that was adjudicated in state court,section e does come into play because it refers to the determination of a factual issue that is,to a state court findings of fact,rather than its conclusions of federal law.see appel horn,cir see also goldblum klem,cir applying presumption of correctness under section e in resolving schlup claim.this conclusion is generally consistent with the standard of review for factual matters,which recognized the need to defer to state court as a matter of comity and federalism.see marshall.lonberger,sumner mata.
aedpa does not make deference to state court dependent on the adequacy of the procedures followed by the state court.teti bender,cir valdez cockrell,cir mendiola schomig,cir.nonetheless,the character of the process upon which the state court based its conclusion may have some bearing on whether a petitioner showing amounts to clear and convincing evidence that the state court erred.mendiola,at.where the state court conducted an evidentiary hearing and explained its reasoning with some care,it should be particularly difficult to establish clear and convincing evidence of error on the state court part.this is especially so when the court resolved issues like witness credibility,which are factual determinations for purposes of section e.wilson ozmint,cir.f or a federal habeas court to overturn a state court credibility judgments,the state court error must be stark and clear.cagle branker,cir citing lonberger,at see also miller fenton.
this all makes sense in the general scheme of things.aedpa in general and section e in particular were designed to further the principles of comity,finality,and federalism.williams taylor.section e plainly seeks to conserve judicial resources and reflects congress view that there is no reason for a in federal court when it comes to facts already resolved by state tribunals.that section also reflects congress respect for principles of federalism,recognizing that a decision to set aside state court factual findings intrudes on the state interest in administering its criminal law.see cockrell.the deference section e requires has particular salience when a state court determinations closely track the legal issues before the federal habeas court.where a state court looks at the same body of relevant evidence and applies essentially the same legal standard to that evidence that the federal court does under schlup,section e requires that the state court findings of fact not be casually cast aside.see miller,at citation omitted.indeed,the cavalier treatment of such findings in federal schlup proceedings would contravene the course of relations set by the congress and the supreme court with great consistency over a very considerable period of time.
in considering sharpe petition,the district court found that the combination of sharpe two alibi witnesses,johnson recantation,an absence of physical evidence linking sharpe to the crime,and the testimony of highsmith and powell amounted to a strong showing under schlup,and that sharpe procedural default on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim should therefore be excused.sharpe,d at.yet the mar court considered all this evidence and more,and specifically found that powell testimony,highsmith hearsay testimony,and johnson recantation were not credible and that johnson original testimony at trial was.unless sharpe could present clear and convincing evidence that those findings were unwarranted,see e,the district court was obliged to respect them in ruling on sharpe schlup claim.the district court,however,did not so much as acknowledge the mar court efforts,other than to note in passing that the motion based on powell testimony had been rejected.sharpe,d at.nowhere in its discussion of sharpe actual innocence claim did it so much as mention the mar court having probed and assessed the evidence that was the basis for the claim.see id.at.
the court failure to do so was error.at the outset,we note that the mar court provided a much more substantial process than the district court and was far better positioned to decide the sorts of factual matters that the district court opted to decide for itself.the mar court heard from nineteen witnesses altogether.the transcripts of the mar evidentiary hearings total more than three hundred pages.lest there be any doubt,the mar court repeatedly alluded to its impressions of the demeanor and comportment of various witnesses and made it clear that its judgments were informed by those observations.the district court,by contrast,held only a truncated evidentiary hearing and made no findings of fact or assessments of credibility.where,for example,the mar court concluded that johnson recantation was untrustworthy after hearing from a dozen different witnesses on the matter,the district court credited johnson recantation without hearing even from johnson,let alone anyone else who could speak to the veracity of her statements.
we also note that the mar court was tasked with an inquiry similar to that required of the district court.it considered sharpe claim for a new trial under north carolina law based on new evidence of actual innocence.the claim was rejected after considering powell testim
