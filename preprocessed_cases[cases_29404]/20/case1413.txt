frank lawrence,filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court after the district court in bloomfield township,michigan convicted him of interference with a police officer in the discharge of his duties the district court denied lawrence petition.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the bloomfield township ordinance under which lawrence was convicted,a,titled interference with police department,provides 
no person shall resist any police officer,any member of the police department or any person duly empowered with police authority while in the discharge or apparent discharge of his duty,or in any way interfere with or hinder him with the discharge of his duty.
lawrence conviction was for circumstances that took place on august.lawrence brother,christian lawrence,called to report that his father,frank lawrence,had struck him with a board.he reported that three people were in the house,lawrence,lawrence father,and himself.the police arrived at the house and looked in the doorway to see that christian was in the home holding his eye.christian stepped outside where paramedics tended to him.police next ordered lawrence father to exit the home,at which point he was arrested.additional officers arrived on the scene and inquired as to whether anyone else was inside of the home.the officers knew that lawrence remained inside the home,but did not know who else might also be inside.an officer called to lawrence to tell him to step outside the home pursuant to the department general order which directed police officer response to domestic violence calls.lawrence refused to exit,stating,fuck you,in addition to citing some case law,and demanding that the officers obtain a warrant before entering.the officer informed lawrence of the need to check for additional suspects,victims,or evidence,but lawrence refused to allow entry into the home,and blocked the door by standing in front of it.the officer then pulled lawrence out onto the porch,entered to conduct a sweep of the home,and with christian help retrieved the weapon,a board.lawrence was then placed under arrest.
lawrence was arraigned on september,in the district court.on october,in federal district court,lawrence brought a suit with pendent state law claims against bloomfield township,police officers at the scene of the incident,the police chief,and the township supervisor for the arrest.he then filed a motion in federal district court for a preliminary injunction,seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance against him in state court.the district court denied the injunction and stayed the proceedings on the remaining claims in the district court pending the resolution of the state prosecution lawrence then filed a motion to dismiss in the district court which judge edward avadenka denied with an opinion dated february.
on april,in the oakland county circuit court,lawrence sought leave to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss and to enjoin the state court prosecution.circuit judge rae lee chabot denied the leave to appeal in part on the merits and in part on ripeness grounds in an opinion dated august.the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court both denied lawrence leave to appeal the decision as well on october,and april,respectively.
lawrence was found guilty following a jury trial in the district court on april.on june,judge avadenka sentenced lawrence to months probation in addition to hours of community service.in the same proceeding,judge avadenka recused himself.judge charles bokos was assigned the case.on january,judge bokos denied lawrence motion for a new trial on his criminal conviction.judge bokos released lawrence on personal bond pending the resolution of lawrence appeal.lawrence appealed the denial of a motion for a new trial to the oakland county circuit court,where circuit judge colleen affirmed the denial of a motion for a new trial on february.the michigan court of appeals and supreme court both denied lawrence leave to appeal judge decision on july,and june,respectively.
on july,lawrence filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.at that time,lawrence had not yet been sentenced by judge bokos which did not occur until december.judge bokos gave lawrence a penalty.lawrence habeas petition was denied by the district court on december.the denial is the subject of this appeal.
standard of review 
we review the district court denial of the requested writ of habeas corpus de novo.mendoza berghuis,cir.
we will grant a writ of habeas corpus if and only if the judgment of the state court with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits resulted in a decision that was contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented d.lawrence argues that this standard that normally governs habeas petitions should not govern here because judge declined to opine on a constitutional issue and instead relied upon judge chabot determination of that issue.br.at.judge concluded that judge chabot decision denying leave to appeal held that exigent circumstances existed to legitimize warrantless entry into lawrence home,and that holding constituted the law of the case.since judge chabot determination of the constitutional issue of exigency occurred in her denial of lawrence leave to appeal,lawrence argument goes,judge decision does not deserve deferential review because denials of leave to appeal do not constitute rulings on the merits of a case,br.at quoting people hines,such that the claim had not been adjudicated in a state court on the merits according to d.in other words,lawrence argues that no michigan court adjudicated the issue of exigency on the merits because judge considered the issue to be law of the case and did not to go the merits,and judge chabot determination as part of a leave to appeal is not a ruling on the merits of a case.
lawrence argument fails because judge chabot denied leave for appeal for lack of merit in lawrence claims which included the issue of exigency.under michigan law,a court can consider itself bound by a decision rendered in the denial of a leave to appeal as law of the case where the denial of the leave to appeal came on the merits of the case.people collier,wl,at.may,citing people hayden,although denial of an application for leave to appeal where the court expresses no opinion on the merits does not implicate the law of the case doctrine,this court has consistently held that denial of an application for lack of merit in the grounds presented is a decision on the merits of the issues raised,which precludes subsequent review of those issues pursuant to the law of the case doctrine.internal citations omitted people shook,wl,at,citing people phillips,a denial of leave to appeal by the supreme court,without explanation,is generally not considered a decision on the merits and is not precedentially binding.lawrence cites hines for the general proposition that denials of leave to appeal do not constitute rulings on the merits of a case.at,which is indeed true,but with the caveat that denials of leaves to appeal based on lack of merit may constitute rulings on the merits of a case.
judge chabot,in her denial of lawrence leave to appeal,held that the likelihood that a piece of evidence,namely a board lawrence father purportedly used to hit christian,was inside the home provided the exigent circumstances necessary to permit the police officers into the home.the court concluded with the court finds lawrence arguments regarding exigency without merit.judge considered judge chabot decision a ruling on the merits which became the law of the case similarly then,we must give judge chabot decision due deference in accordance with the comity that habeas deferential standard was meant to foster.see,williams taylor,d.therefore,the standard of review with respect to all of lawrence claims is that prescribed by d.justiciability issues are reviewed de novo.
b.in custody 
provides that a court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states emphasis added.whether a habeas petitioner is in custody is determined at the time of the filing of the petition.northrop trippett,cir citing carafas lavallee,d.actual physical custody is sufficient but not necessary to satisfy the custody requirement.jones cunningham,d.the writ of habeas corpus exists to allow a petitioner to attack and secure release from illegal custody.preiser rodriguez,d.
on june,judge avadenka sentenced lawrence to one year probation in addition to hours of community service and recused himself in the same proceeding.on september,judge charles bokos was assigned the case.judge bokos released lawrence on personal bond pending the resolution of lawrence appeal of the court denial of his motion for a new trial.by the end of june,all of lawrence appeals had been resolved against him.on july,lawrence filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.on december,judge bokos sentenced lawrence to a penalty 
at that time he filed his petition,lawrence had been sentenced and then released on personal bond pending the resolution of his appeals.a habeas petitioner on a recognizance bond at the time of the filing of the habeas petition meets the custody requirement.mcveigh smith,cir citing hensley mun.court,d.in mcveigh,we held that a petitioner with a probation sentence that had been stayed met the in custody requirement.id.that case is on point here.however,we take this opportunity to further explain our reasoning in mcveigh where we relied on hensley but without much explanation.
the supreme court in hensley emphasized three points in holding that a habeas petitioner released of his own recognizance following the receipt of a prison sentence met the in custody requirement the personal recognizance bond subjected the prisoner to restraints not shared by the public generally,hensley,at.the sentence that had been stayed involved incarceration,id.at.and a petitioner still must exhaust his state remedies,id.at.
restraint on liberty.the court in hensley held that a person released on a personal recognizance bond is subject to restraints not shared by the public generally.id.at.quoting jones,at.internal quotation marks omitted.such a person can not come and go as he pleases h is freedom of movement rests in the hands of state judicial officers who may demand his presence at any time and without a moment notice and punish d isobedience as a criminal offense.id.that is the case here.generally,we have interpreted the supreme court decisions in hensley and justices of boston municipal court lydon,d,to mean that personal recognizance bonds categorically suffice as restraints on liberty.see malinovsky court of common pleas,cir citing lydon,at.mcmaster city of troy,wl,at cir,unpublished mcveigh,at citing hensley,at.
stayed sentence.in hensley,the court looked to the severity of the stayed sentence restraints on liberty.there,the petitioner received a stay of the execution of his prison sentence.at.therefore,his incarceration was not a speculative possibility because,but for the stay,authorities could seize him.id.at.here,the stayed sentence involved probation and hours of community service probation restraints on liberty suffice to satisfy the in custody requirement.see lewis randle,app x,wl,at cir,unpublished mcveigh,at stayed probation sentence sufficed for in custody requirement see also chaker crogan,cir lee stickman,cir citing mabry johnson,d olson hart,cir tinder paula,cir duvallon florida,cir.the same is true for community service.see williamson gregoire,cir barry bergen county prob.dep t,cir an individual who is required to be in a certain in one of several attend meetings or to perform services,is clearly subject to restraints on his liberty not shared by the public generally.together,probation and an onerous community service requirement imposes significant restraints on liberty.in addition,should lawrence have violated the terms of his probation or community service,the court could revoke his probation and incarcerate him.
the parties have had some dispute over whether judge bokos vacated judge avadenka sentence and him at the later time,or whether judge bokos merely amended judge avadenka sentence.first,even if judge bokos had vacated judge avadenka sentence,we are unable to find any evidence in the record to support the proposition that judge bokos vacated the sentence before lawrence filed his habeas petition.second,the court in hensley focused on the conditions imposed on petitioner as the price of his release,not the sentence that had been stayed.at.as in hensley,the petitioner remains at large only by the grace of a stay.id.at.the state court here could order lawrence to appear for sentencing at any time,which it did on december.for both the petitioner in hensley and the petitioner here,the failure to obey the terms of the personal recognizance bond subjects the petitioner to arrest and incarceration.see id.at.
exhaustion.the hensley court emphasized that it did not intend to open the doors of the district courts to all persons released on bail or on their own recognizance only in those cases where a petitioner released on his own recognizance has exhausted all available state court opportunities does a federal court have jurisdiction to decide.id.at.that is the case here.altogether,a petitioner who has had a sentence of probation and community service stayed and exhausts his state court opportunities meets habeas in custody requirement.
since the filing of the petition judge bokos has imposed a sentence on lawrence,giving him a penalty.the penalty,as a direct consequence of lawrence conviction,preserves lawrence stake in this case therefore,the penalty keeps lawrence habeas petition from becoming moot.port heard,cir.because the penalty,as a direct consequence of the conviction,keeps the controversy live,we need not address lawrence arguments that a collateral consequence of his conviction,namely his rejection from the michigan state bar,helps him avoid mootness.
overbreadth and vagueness challenges 
lawrence arguments with regard to overbreadth and vagueness fail because he can not demonstrate that the state courts in his case rendered decisions contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d.the as determined by the supreme court of the united states clause limits our analysis to those cases decided by the united states supreme court.williams,at.lawrence lacks sufficient support for his arguments in united states supreme court decisions.
for overbreadth,city of houston hill,d,does not provide the clearly established federal law necessary to grant lawrence habeas petition.while hill did invalidate a statute prohibiting a person from in any manner oppos ing,molest ing,abus ing or interrupt ing any policeman in the execution of his duty,at,the court focused on the interrupt element of the crime,not the in any manner portion which shares similarity with the in any way part of the statute here.id.at.that the law prohibited interruption meant that the law prohibited speech,as interruption suggested verbal interruption.id.at.the ordinance here prohibits resist ing,interfer ing,and hinder ing,none of which suggest speech,and on the contrary,suggest some kind of physical interference.without any other united states supreme court decisions to support his claim,lawrence overbreadth argument fails.
as for vagueness,lawrence does not cite established supreme court precedent that supports his argument.he relies on landry daley,a federal district court case which does support his argument.id.at.the court there held that the words and phrases resist,obstruct,interfere,and in the discharge of his duties rendered the statute void for vagueness.id.however,the case does not amount to clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.the decision was not from the supreme co
