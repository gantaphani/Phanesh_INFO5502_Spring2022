james goff goff appeals the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to.goff was convicted in ohio state court in of two counts of aggravated murder each with one capital specification three counts of aggravated burglary,two counts of aggravated robbery,and one count of grand theft.he was sentenced to death.
the district court certified seventeen claims for appeal,but we are primarily concerned with only two.first,goff asserts that the jury instructions given during the penalty phase of his trial regarding unanimity and mitigating factors were flawed.second,goff asserts that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a claim during goff direct appeal to the ohio court of appeals that goff was denied his right,under ohio law,to allocute before sentencing.
for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that goff is entitled to relief on the basis of the second issue,but that recent supreme court precedent precludes his first issue.we conclude that goff remaining assignments of error are meritless.we therefore reverse the decision of the district court and grant goff a conditional writ of habeas corpus based on goff ninth and twelfth assignments of error.
background 
on january,a clinton county,ohio,grand jury indicted goff on two counts of aggravated murder each with a capital specification,three counts of aggravated burglary,two counts of aggravated robbery,and two counts of grand theft with specifications.following a trial,goff was convicted of all counts except for one count of grand theft and the specifications.at the conclusion of the hearing,the jury recommended that goff be sentenced to death.the trial judge then conducted his own weighing of the mitigating and aggravating factors and sentenced goff to death.goff appealed to the twelfth district court of appeals for clinton county,ohio,which affirmed his convictions and sentence.state goff,no,wl,at ohio.goff then appealed to the ohio supreme court,which affirmed goff death sentence and made the following findings of fact 
myrtle rutledge,an woman,was in the process of moving out of her old farmhouse and into a new doublewide trailer home that was built directly behind the farmhouse.her daughter,esther crownover,had been helping her sort out items from the old house,in which she had lived for years.
rutledge decided to purchase some new furniture for her new house,and on september,she and crownover went to butler home furnishings in wilmington,ohio.after purchasing a new mattress,box springs,chair,ottoman,and sofa,rutledge made arrangements for the furniture to be delivered the next day.
butler home furnishings had employed appellant for furniture deliveries for about a year.harold butler,the son of the owner,would contact appellant when he had a delivery and then,depending on the item,would get another person to assist appellant with the delivery.butler furnishings had also used manuel jackson as a delivery person for the seven months prior to september.
appellant and jackson were contacted to make the delivery to rutledge on september.when appellant and jackson arrived with the furniture,rutledge directed them to put the new furniture in the new house.since there was no bed frame in the new house,appellant asked whether rutledge wanted them to obtain the frame from the old house and assemble the bed in the new house.after they indicated that they would not charge rutledge any additional money for this service,rutledge took them into the old house,up to the second floor,and pointed out the bed frame that was to be used with the new bedding.the old house was in a state of disarray from the ongoing moving process.jackson thought he saw appellant snooping through rutledge belongings.
appellant and jackson disassembled the old bed,took the frame to the new house,and set up the new bed.while jackson finished the assembly,appellant obtained rutledge signature on the delivery form.
later that afternoon,rodney rutledge,the victim son,arrived at his mother house around to mow the lawn.she showed him her new furnishings that had been delivered that day.when he left around,his mother car was parked in the driveway next to the house.
on the night of september,myrtle rutledge spoke on the telephone to her sister and her around concerning the upcoming family reunion on saturday,september.on friday,september,rutledge son drove past his mother house six different times during the course of his employment.each time his mother car was not parked in the driveway next to the house.rutledge sister also drove past the house and noticed the car was not there.
on saturday morning,crownover went to rutledge home to pick her up for the reunion.the car was not there,and when her mother did not answer the door,crownover assumed that she had already left for the reunion.when she arrived at the reunion her mother was not there.she went back to her mother house,entered,and went upstairs to her mother bedroom.there she found her mother battered and naked body lying on the floor of the bedroom.a pool of blood was on the bed,as well as the floor area.after ascertaining that there was no pulse,she tried using the phone to call the police,but there was no dial tone.she covered her mother with a blanket and drove to the police station.
the police and an ambulance were dispatched.once it was determined that rutledge was dead,the police secured the scene and began a criminal investigation.deputy sheriff fred moeller,the crime scene investigator,determined that the door to the victim house had been forced open.someone had apparently tried to enter the home through a window,because the window screen was lying on the ground outside the house,but entry was not made though the window.the phone wires on the outside of the house were cut.
no fingerprints were found in the bedroom.in moeller opinion,the room had been cleaned.other fingerprint smudges were found in the house,but never matched.there was no evidence of blood anywhere else in the house except the bedroom.denise rankin,a serologist,identified a pubic hair found at the scene as being consistent with a pubic hair obtained from appellant after his arrest.
after moeller left the scene to return to the police station,he was notified that the victim car was found on north high street in the city of wilmington.he went to the scene,and the keys to the car were found on the floor on the driver side.a pink towel was on the front seat of the car,and no prints were found anywhere on the car.moeller believed that someone had wiped down the car.
the deputy coroner testified that rutledge died from blunt and sharp trauma to the head,neck,shoulders,and ankle.her death also resulted from blood loss due to multiple stab wounds,one of which severed the carotid artery.the coroner was unable to determine the time of death.
when appellant and jackson left rutledge house after delivering the furniture on september,they purchased some crack cocaine and went to appellant house to smoke it.appellant later returned the truck to the furniture store.
jackson did not see appellant again until the following morning when he saw him running through an alley.jackson later saw him on grant street.appellant had changed his clothes from earlier in the day when they had delivered the furniture.
appellant asked jackson whether he wanted to smoke some crack,showing him what jackson thought was about worth of crack.jackson was with tim bart,and all three proceeded to appellant house.after they smoked the crack,which took a couple of hours,bart suggested stealing some meat to trade for more crack.they were going to walk to the store,when appellant indicated he knew where there was a car they could use,but it was stolen.appellant said the car was on north high street.bart and jackson opted not to use the stolen car,and they walked to bob and carl meat store.bart stole the meat,and he and appellant took off.
jackson saw appellant around noon the next day,and appellant asked him to tell anyone who asked,that he appellant had been with jackson from on september until on september.
later,on september,timothy shaffer found appellant playing pool at a game room in wilmington.appellant,shaffer,and david walls ended up at shaffer trailer,where they smoked three to four joints.all three left the trailer and went to buy some crack.after the purchase,shaffer and appellant went to appellant house to smoke the crack.appellant wanted shaffer to sign a note saying that he shaffer helped in a crime committed on september,but shaffer refused to sign.appellant went and stayed at shaffer trailer until september.
while staying with shaffer,appellant talked with him about rutledge death.appellant asked shaffer what he would do if he killed someone.appellant then told him he stabbed a lady and bent the blade of the knife.he also choked her.appellant then told shaffer he took her car and left it in front of the mulberry hill apartments.after wiping the steering wheel,he drove the car to north high street,where he left it,and then bought about worth of crack and smoked it.appellant admitted that he went to rutledge house to rob her.
on september,shaffer saw a newspaper article about the rutledge murder and asked appellant to leave his trailer.about two weeks later,shaffer received a letter from appellant telling him that his appellant life was in shaffer hands and to not tell anyone.shaffer eventually called colonel tim smith at the sheriff department,and turned over a pair of tennis shoes and a laundry basket belonging to appellant.shaffer ultimately told smith all of what appellant had said about the murder.
appellant was arrested on september,on a drug charge.during the interrogation,appellant admitted that he had a crack habit,that he bought crack whenever he could,and that he would steal and trade items to buy crack.he indicated that he delivered furniture to the rutledge residence,but when questioned about the murder,appellant asked for an attorney and questioning ceased.
the state also presented three inmates,jerry lee price,danny smith,and keith jones,to testify to various statements appellant had made to them regarding the rutledge crime while incarcerated on the drug charge.smith testimony was excluded,since he failed to identify appellant in court however,both price and jones testified regarding the murder.
jones testimony was by far the most damaging.appellant told jones that he had delivered furniture to an old lady in her late.she had given appellant some money when he put the new bed together and later that night he went back to get the rest of the money he saw she had.appellant entered through the kitchen and found rutledge in the bedroom.appellant told him that rutledge called him jimmy,so he had to get rid of the bitch.jones asked him questions concerning the crime because jones could not believe appellant could do such a thing to an old woman.appellant asserted that she had lived her life,and since she could send him to prison,he had to kill her.after he took the money and the car,he went and bought crack.appellant ran into a friend and they went and smoked it.appellant said he killed her by himself,using a fishing tackle knife from his house.he told jones they would never find the knife because he got rid of it.jones wrote a letter to the prosecutor office,although he was not sure he believed appellant,but that he jones had an elderly mother and could not think of something like that happening to her.
state goff goff i,ohio.goff filed a motion to reconsider in the ohio supreme court,which denied the motion on july.state goff,ohio.goff then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court,which denied the writ on june.goff ohio,d.

ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in a habeas corpus proceeding,this court reviews a district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.smith mitchell,cir.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.goff filed his habeas petition in may,after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,and,thus,aedpa governs our review of goff claims.lindh murphy,d.aedpa provides that 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d emphases added.the supreme court has explained that 
u nder the contrary to clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.
williams taylor,d,opinion of the court for part ii.we have stressed that clearly established law under the act encompasses more than just rules laid down by the court.it also clearly includes legal principles and standards enunciated in the court decisions.taylor withrow,cir.we apply a presumption of correctness to state court findings of fact,and the petitioner may rebut this presumption only by clear and convincing evidence.bailey mitchell,cir quoting e citing seymour walker,cir sanders freeman,cir.
jury instructions 
in his first and second assignments of error,goff argues that the state court failure to provide clearer jury instructions on mitigation impermissibly required the jury to reject unanimously a sentence of death,based on unanimous mitigation findings,before considering a life sentence alternative and did not provide adequate guidance on the use of mitigating factors.while the instant appeal was pending,the united states supreme court granted certiorari and decided smith spisak spisak iii,d,rev g spisak mitchell spisak i,cir,vacated by hudson spisak,d,reinstated by spisak hudson spisak ii,cir,the resolution of which controls our disposition of goff first claim and counsels against our granting relief on the second.
jury instructions regarding and unanimity in mitigation factors 
in his first assignment of error,goff relies heavily on this court opinion in spisak i,which the supreme court reversed in spisak iii.at.indeed,goff states in his brief that the identical issue is presented here.goff br.at.goff filed a motion for a jury instruction that,in essence,the jury need not unanimously reject the recommendation of a death sentence before proceeding to consider the life sentences,specifically requesting an instruction that 
you,the jury,should first consider whether to return a verdict of recommend a sentence of death.
you must unanimously agree that the aggravating circumstances are sufficient to,and do outweigh,the mitigating circumstances in order to return a verdict recommendation of death.
if you are unable to agree unanimously that a death sentence is appropriate under this standard of proof,you are to proceed to consider which of the life sentence verdicts recommendations to return.
you are not required to determine unanimously that the death sentence is inappropriate before you consider the life sentences.
at mot.for penalty phase jury instruction.goff also requested an additional instruction relating the lack of a unanimity requirement in finding mitigating factors.id.at mot.to instruct the jury on the lack of requirement.the trial court rejected both of goff proposed instructions,id.at,penalty phase hr g tr.at,and instructed the jury as follows 
in making your decision you will consider all the evidence,the arguments of counsel,and all other information and all other reports which are relevant to the nature and circumstances of the aggravating circumstances or to any mitigating factors including,but not limited to,the nature and circumstances of the offense,and the history and character and background of the defendant,the youth of the defendant,and any other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the defendant should be sentenced to death.
you are to weigh the aggravating circumstances which you have already found against any mitigating factors which you find to exist.you are limited in your consideration solely to your findings in count and count relating to the death of myrtle rutledge and those aggravating circumstances which you have found to exist.
explaining findings related to count and count 
mitigating factors must be considered collectively when they are weighed against the aggravating circumstances.the prosecution has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance s,of which the defendant was found guilty,outweigh the factors in mitigation of imposing the death sentence.to outweigh means to weigh more than or to be more important than.the existence of mitigating factors does not preclude or prevent the death sentence,if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors.however,if you are not convinced by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors,then you must choose one of the two life sentences.
you shall recommend death only if you unanimously find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors.i f you do not so find,you shall unanimously sign a verdict for either a sentence of life with parole eligibility after serving years of imprisonment or a sentence of life with parole eligibility after serving full years of imprisonment.verdict forms with these three options will be furnished to you.
id.at penalty phase hr g tr.at.as to the verdict forms,the trial court instructed the jury 
at this point i want to make a few comments with regard to the verdict forms.you will have you in the court sic six verdict forms.they read as follows,in the court of common pleas,clinton county,ohio,they will have the same heading,state of ohio james goff,case,verdict,recommendation of death,and then there is a recitation of the specification to count,and it says,we,the jury,being duly impaneled,do hereby find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors and recommend to the court the imposition of the death penalty.if this is your verdict form you would date it and sign it on one of the lines provided.
the next one also refers to count,same heading,but it reads,we,the jury being duly impaneled,do not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors and recommend to the court that the defendant receive life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving full years.if this is your verdict,then you would date it and you would sign it.
the next one has the same heading,specification to count,verdict,life imprisonment after full years.it reads,we the jury being duly impaneled do not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors and recommend to the court that the defendant receive life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving full years.again,if this is your verdict form then you would date it and each of you would sign it.
those are the verdict forms with regard to specification to count.the same three verdict forms exist for specification to count.again,the specification to count is listed at the top of the page.it would have three forms,verdict,life imprisonment after full years verdict,life imprisonment after full years and verdict,recommendation of death.
each verdict form,if that is your verdict,then you would date it and you would sign it.if it the verdict for recommendation of death,if that your verdict form,each of you must date it and sign it.if it life imprisonment after full years,you would date it and sign it,and if it life imprisonment after full years,then you would date it and you would sign it.
when all of you agree on a verdict,all of you should sign the appropriate form in ink,as i already indicated to you,and advise the bailiff and you will then be returned to the courtroom.
id.at penalty phase hr g tr.at first alteration in original.
on appeal,goff presents a single argument that the trial court impermissibly utilized an jury instruction coupled with an instruction requiring unanimity in finding mitigation factors,and that these instructions were unconstitutional under spisak i.the ohio supreme court rejected both the and arguments on direct appeal,specifically finding that the instructions were not invalid under state brooks,ohio,even though goff was tried six months before the brooks decision,and that t he jury was never told that it had to make a unanimous finding on the individual factors before weighing them.goff i,at.the ohio supreme court concluded that the substance of what the jury must determine was included in the charge given therefore,goff was not prejudiced.id.at.the district court also rejected goff arguments,finding that the instructions did not violate the supreme court opinions in mills maryland,d,and mckoy north carolina,d,and that this court prior decision in davis mitchell,cir,while not a supreme court precedent,was also distinguishable.goff iv,wl,at.
because we are constrained by spisak iii,we agree with the district court.we conclude that the jury instructions and verdict forms that goff trial court utilized are conceptually indistinguishable from those at issue in spisak iii,see spisak iii.at spisak i,at,as goff acknowledges in his brief.see goff br.at spisak is significant since the identical issue is presented here.therefore,we are constrained to follow the spisak iii court reasoning and to conclude that the jury instructions properly focused only on the overall balancing question,a nd the instructions repeatedly told the jury to conside r all of the relevant evidence.spisak iii.at third alteration in original see also hartman bagley,cir distinguishing case from davis and spisak i,cert.denied,d.goff is not entitled to relief on this claim.
although a challenge to the jury instructions based on the perceived requirement to unanimously reject a death sentence before considering other sentencing alternatives might still be available on aedpa habeas review after the court opinion in spisak iii see spisak iii.at quoting spisak i,at id.at stevens,concurring,neither goff nor any previous court below referred to beck alabama,d,or identified any other precedent from th e supreme court setting forth this rule,and the court ha s not,however,previously held jury instructions unconstitutional for this reason,id.at.majority opinion.thus,this court need not decide whether any further arguments on this ground could invalidate goff jury instructions.see united states hall,cir.
refusal to instruct jury on meaning of mitigating factors 
in assignment of error two,goff argues that the trial court committed a constitutional error in refusing to instruct the jury on the meaning of mitigating factors because the instruction given provided no standard upon which to base their decision and le ft the jury with the impression that they we re to consider mitigation as lessening blame or culpability.goff.br.at.goff requested the following instruction 
mitigating factors are factors that,while they do not justify or excuse the crime,nevertheless in fairness,sympathy and mercy,may be considered by you,as they call for a penalty less than death,or lessen the appropriateness of a sentence of death.
at mot.to alter definition of mitigating circumstances.the trial court rejected goff alternative instruction,id.at penalty phase hr g tr.at,and instructed the jury according to ohio b c as follows 
in making your decision you will consider all the evidence,the arguments of counsel,and all other information and all other reports which are relevant to the nature and circumstances of the aggravating circumstances or to any mitigating factors including,but not limited to,the nature and circumstances of the offense,and the history and character and background of the defendant,the youth of the defendant,and any other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the defendant should be sentenced to death.
you are to weigh the aggravating circumstances which you have already found against any mitigating factors which you find to exist 
mitigating factors must be considered collectively when they are weighed against the aggravating circumstances.the prosecution has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance s,of which the defendant was found guilty,outweigh the factors in mitigation of imposing the death sentence.to outweigh means to weigh more than or to be more important than.the existence of mitigating factors does not preclude or prevent the death sentence,if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors.however,if you are not convinced by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors,then you must choose one of the two life sentences.
at penalty phase hr g tr.at emphases added.
the ohio supreme court rejected goff argument on direct appeal,concluding that a failure to define mitigation was not prejudicial error because t he trial court defined what factors the jury was to consider,and implicit in the trial court instruction was that the factors set forth by the defense were factors relevant to whether appellant should be sentenced to death.goff i,at id.at citing buchanan angelone,d.the district court also rejected goff argument on the grounds that the instruction given did not violate state law and that the constitution did not require the requested mitigation definition.goff iv,wl,at.we agree.
the eighth amendment requires that the jury be able to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence offered by petitioner.boyde california,d buell mitchell,cir.because the supreme court has held that the state may shape and structure the jury consideration of mitigation so long as it does not preclude the jury from giving effect to any relevant mitigating evidence,buchanan,at.citing johnson texas,d penry lynaugh,d franklin lynaugh,d,the issue is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence,boyde,at.any barrier to such consideration of mitigating evidence must fall.mckoy,at.however,o n habeas review,errors on instructions are not reviewable unless they deprive a defendant of constitutional due process.mason mitchell,cir quoting gall parker,cir.
in buchanan,the supreme court explicitly stated that we have never gone further and held that the state must affirmatively structure in a particular way the manner in which juries consider mitigating evidence.buchanan,at.the court rejected the defendant argument that the trial court should have included additional explanations with the state pattern instruction,specifically a further explanation of the concept of mitigation stating,i n addition to the mitigating factors specified in other instructions,you shall consider the circumstances surrounding the offense,the history and background of the defendant,and any other facts in mitigation of the offense.id.at.first alteration in original.the court held that a specific instruction on the concept of mitigating evidence generally is not constitutionally required.id.at.here,as the ohio supreme court concluded,the trial court instruction essentially tracked the language of the jury instruction,which itself provided more general information on the concept of mitigation than the challenged all the evidence instruction upheld in buchanan see state holloway,ohio,looking to b for proper definition of mitigating factors and finding trial court use of different definition in subsequent written opinion was harmless error in part because jury was given proper b instruction at time.where the trial court instructs the jury in accordance with state law and sufficiently addresses the matters of law at issue,no error results and the petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief.white mitchell,cir.
contrary to goff assertion,we conclude that the instruction given,considered in the context of the entire instructions and proceedings,see boyde,at,did not fail to provide the jury with a standard upon which to base their decision or leave the jury with the impression that they we re to consider mitigation as lessening blame or culpability,goff.br.at,rather than as relevant to lessen the sentence imposed.neither the use of the instruction given nor the failure to use the proposed instruction violated clearly established federal law under either the eighth amendment or the due process clause.see spisak iii.at finding similar instructions sufficiently explained the concept of a mitigating factor mason,at holding that supreme court precedent prior to conviction did not clearly establish a defendant due process right to a jury instruction on the definition of mitigation and rejecting exact same argument buell,at upholding similar,but more limited,instruction against challenge that mitigating factors were not appropriately defined.goff is not entitled to relief on this claim.
ineffective assistance of appellate counsel 
on the first appeal of right,a defendant is entitled to effective assistance of appellate counsel.mahdi bagley,cir,cert.denied,d.as we have previously stated,
c laims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are judged under the strickland standard,which requires that the appellant affirmatively establish that counsel performance was objectively deficient and prejudice,which means that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.
id.internal quotation marks omitted mason mitchell,cir claims of ineffective assistance of counsel have two components a petitioner must show that counsel performance was deficient,and that the deficiency prejudiced the defense.quoting wiggins smith,d,cert.denied,d.to establish that counsel was deficient,the defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.smith,at quoting strickland washington,d.prejudice is shown if there is a reasonable probability that,but for his counsel failings,the defendant would have prevailed on his appeal.mapes tate mapes ii,cir alterations in original quoting smith robbins,d.
in his ninth assignment of error,goff contends that he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel due to appellate counsel failure to raise the following issues on direct appeal the trial court failure to afford goff his right to allocution trial counsel failure to recognize that the alternate juror substituted midstream during the hearing tainted that hearing trial counsel failure to recognized the need for a instruction during the penalty phase trial counsel failure to request that the trial court give a jury instruction regarding the credibility of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for informing the jury during voir dire that goff would not testify at trial trial counsel failure properly to prepare the psychologist who testified at the hearing trial counsel failure to exclude reference to goff request for an attorney during the guilt phase and trial counsel failure to raise an issue.none of these claims are specifically argued under this assignment of error rather,five of the arguments are presented in conjunction with other assignments of error.the three arguments not so six,seven,and waived on appeal.see united states hall,cir i ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.quoting united states johnson,cir alteration in original each of the remaining arguments are addressed below.
right to allocution 
in his ninth and twelfth assignments of error,goff contends that he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because his appellate counsel did not raise the failure of the trial court to afford goff his right to allocute before sentencing.bagley contends that this claim is procedurally and that,on the merits,this claim fails because there is no constitutional right to allocution,and goff chose not to make an unsworn statement to the jury during the penalty phase,which allegedly discharged the trial court duty with regard to allocution.we disagree with bagley contentions and conclude that goff is entitled to relief on this ground.
bagley contention that goff claim must fail because there is no constitutional right to allocution misconstrues the framework.although it is correct,as the district court noted,that there is no right to allocution under the federal constitution,goff iv,wl,at citing,inter alia,cooey coyle,cir,there is a constitutional right to the effective assistance of appellate counsel,see,mahdi,at.if it was both deficient and prejudicial for goff appellate counsel to fail to raise the allocution claim,then goff constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel on appeal has been violated,regardless of the fact that counsel underlying failure is a matter of state law.see mason hanks,cir concluding that the fact that an claim is based on a failure to pursue certain claims poses no impediment to a petitioner claim of ineffectiveness alvord wainwright,cir on the one hand,the issue of ineffective when based on the failure of counsel to raise a state law one of constitutional dimension on the other hand,the validity of the claim that alvord appellate counsel failed to assert is clearly a question of state law,and we must defer to the state construction of its own law.citations omitted,superseded by statute on other grounds see also bedford collins,cir t he invocation of this right to allocution could implicate the sixth amendment if the prosecution violated rules about the allocution procedure and defendant counsel unreasonably failed to object,petition for cert.filed,reutter sec y for dep t of,cir.unpublished opinion even though petitioner claim was based on counsel failure to raise a issue,the claim itself was a federal constitutional claim.citing alvord,at,cert.denied,d mapes coyle,cir citing mason hanks,at lewis smith,cir.same,cert.denied,d.we conclude that counsel performance was both deficient and prejudicial.
ohio law provides all criminal defendants with the right to allocution before a sentence is imposed.ohio crim.a at the time of imposing sentence,the court shall address the defendant personally and ask if he or she wishes to make a statement in his or her own behalf or present any information in mitigation of punishment.state campbell,ohio.it is the duty of the sentencing court to inform the defendant of this right to allocution,and failure to do so is typically reversible error.see campbell,at.at the time of goff sentencing,there was a substantial amount of caselaw confirming this fact.see,silsby state,ohio,holding that an ohio statute impose s a mandatory duty upon a trial judge to ask an accused person whether he has anything to say why judgment should not be pronounced against him and that failure to discharge that duty requires reversal and remand for resentencing syllabus state hays,ohio app d,noting that ohio crim.a require s that the accused be granted an opportunity to be heard in mitigation of punishment citing silsby,ohio,see also city of defiance cannon,ohio app d,stating that ohio crim.a and ohio both clearly mandate that a court give the defendant an opportunity to speak prior to the imposition of sentence,and that the trial court failure to ask the defendant if he or she wishes to allocute requires remand for the sole purpose of resentencing citing,inter alia,silsby,ohio,accord state hawkins,wl,at ohio,unpublished opinion same city of cleveland justice,wl,at ohio,unpublished opinion same state priest,ca,wl,at ohio,unpublished opinion same state sullivan,no,wl,at ohio.june,unpublished decision same.
in the instant case,there is no evidence in the record that the state trial court common pleas court ever addressed goff right to allocution.under ohio law at the time of goff direct appeal,this omission was reversible error.failure on the part of goff appellate counsel to raise such an obviously winning claim clearly falls below an objective standard of is established by the fact that appellate counsel failed to raise the allocution issue on appeal in the face of overwhelming caselaw regarding the right to allocute.moreover,this same caselaw holds that a sentencing court failure to provide the right to allocution requires a remand for resentencing,thereby establishing prejudice.see mapes ii,at explaining that prejudice exists if there is a reasonable probability that the appeal would have been successful had the claim been raised.thus,we conclude that there is a reasonable probability that,but for appellate counsel unprofessional errors,the result of goff direct appeal would have been different.the ohio supreme court conclusion that goff failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding ineffective assistance of appellate counsel constitutes an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.
bagley contends that goff decided not to give an unsworn statement and that this decision waived his right to allocution.this argument is meritless.in addition to the right to allocution before the court imposes sentence discussed above,capital defendants in ohio also have the right to make an unsworn statement at the penalty phase.ohio ann.d the court,and the trial jury if the offender was tried by a jury,shall hear the statement,if any,of the offender,and the arguments,if any,of counsel for the defense and prosecution,that are relevant to the penalty that should be imposed on the offender if the offender chooses to make a statement,the offender is subject to only if the offender consents to make the statement under oath or affirmation.see also campbell,at.although d permits a capital defendant to make a statement without oath or,an unsworn statement under d is not an allocution under the rule ohio crim.a.campbell,at emphasis added citing state reynolds,ohio.the penalty phase in a capital case is not a substitute for a defendant right of allocution at sentencing.reynolds,at.the right to allocution is associated with the sentencing proceeding before the judge,and t he purpose of allocution is to allow the defendant an additional opportunity to state any further information which the judge may take into consideration when determining the sentence to be imposed.cannon,at.moreover,n o authority requires a trial court to inform a capital defendant of his right to make an unsworn,statement.campbell,at.
bagley correctly notes that the transcript reflects that a conference occurred wherein the parties were slated to discuss goff rights relative to giving an unsworn statement.at penalty phase hr g tr.at.the contents of that conference reveal that goff trial counsel had advised him of his right to make an unsworn statement to the jury,and that goff declined to so address the jury contrary to bagley contention,at the conference the trial judge did not inform goff of his right to give an unsworn statement only goff counsel addressed him at the conference,although goff did waive his right to make an unsworn statement on the record.even if the trial judge had been the one to address goff relative to making an unsworn statement,the right to make an unsworn statement to the jury at the penalty phase is not equivalent to the right of allocution before the judge imposes sentence.campbell,at cannon,at.thus,even if the sentencing court informed goff of his right to give an unsworn statement to the jury at the penalty phase,such information could not discharge the sentencing court duty to inform goff about his right to allocution before sentencing by the judge,and any wavier by goff of his right to give an unsworn statement to the jury would not have impacted his right to allocute.see campbell,at i n this context where the trial court failed to inform the defendant of the right to allocution,we find the doctrine of waiver inapplicable.accepting bagley contention that goff chose not to make an unsworn statement to the jury,bagley br.at nevertheless conclude that the trial court failed in its duty to inform goff of his right to allocute before sentencing by the judge.
accordingly,we hold that goff appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise on direct appeal the issue of goff right to allocution before sentencing and that the opposite conclusion reached by the ohio supreme court in rejecting goff ohio rule of appellate procedure b application on the merits constitutes an unreasonable application of federal law.
substitution of alternate juror during penalty phase 
in his ninth and fourteenth assignments of error,goff asserts that trial counsel caused a constitutional,structural error when it allowed an alternate juror,who did not deliberate with the jury during the guilt phase,to take the place of a sitting juror during the penalty phase and that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this issue on direct appeal.goff presented this claim in an ohio rule of appellate procedure b motion to reopen his direct appeal,claiming that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel established cause and prejudice for failing to raise the issue on direct appeal the ohio court of appeals denied the motion and the ohio supreme court affirmed this denial,concluding that goff failed to raise a genuine issue as to whether he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal before the court of appeals,as required by.b.goff iii,at internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.the district court rejected goff underlying claim of error as procedurally defaulted because goff did not establish that his appellate counsel was ineffective and thus could not establish cause and prejudice for his failure to raise the underlying claim on direct appeal.goff iv,wl,at.we also reject goff claim.
as an initial matter,goff has cited no caselaw to support his argument that the substitution of an alternate was present for both the and hearings but did not participate in the a sitting juror before the commencement of deliberations is a constitutional violation,nor could we find any.moreover,goff repeated assertion that the substitution of the juror caused goff not to be convicted by a unanimous jury is also unsupported by caselaw and defies common sense.a unanimous jury convicted goff at the end of the proceedings no later change in the of the jury could alter that fact.thus,goff has not established that the substitution of the alternate juror,in and of itself,caused a constitutional violation.
as to goff counsel claim,at the time of goff direct appeal,the ohio supreme court,in a case with materially indistinguishable facts,had held that it did not violate state law to replace a sitting juror with an alternate juror between the guilt and penalty phases.see state hutton,ohio.additionally,goff has not asserted that the substitution procedure used in his case violated state law.thus,there seems no likelihood that,had goff appellate counsel raised this issue,the result of his appeal would have been different,and we can not say that goff appellate counsel was ineffective for not raising a claim that had little to no possibility of success.see valentine united states,cir rejecting a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel where the underlying claim had little probability of success,cert.denied,d.we conclude that goff is not entitled to relief on this claim.
instruction 
in his ninth and fifteenth assignments of error,goff contends that the trial court should have instructed the jury regarding the definition of principal offender and that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this issue on appeal.goff raised the underlying claim in his failed ohio rule of appellate procedure b motion.the district court also rejected the claim.we conclude that this claim is meritless.
goff argument under these assignments of error is confusing,to say the least.it appears that goff is asserting that,at the guilt phase and at the penalty phase,the jury was not instructed regarding the requirement that goff be a principal offender in order to be death eligible instructed regarding the definition of principal offender or provided verdict sheets that reflected the requirement.the record reveals that goff assertions are baseless.
according to ohio law,t o be eligible for the death penalty under ohio a as the principal offender,the defendant must have been the actual killer.state taylor,ohio.in the context of aggravated murder,principal offender has been defined as one who personally performs every act constituting the offense.state sneed,ohio,internal quotation marks omitted.at the guilt phase of goff trial,the trial court instructed the jury that b efore you can find the defendant guilty of specification under count,you must find that the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant personally committed each act which constituted the aggravated murder,including the act or acts that caused the death of myrtle rutledge.at guilt phase hr g tr.at emphasis added.this instruction correctly defined the term principal offender.see sneed,at holding that a trial court instruction defining principal offender as one who personally performs every act constituting the offense,in this case aggravated murder was sufficient to comply with ohio a internal quotation marks omitted.after receiving this correct instruction,the jury specifically found,via a verdict form,that goff was the principal offender 
we,the jury,having found the defendant,james goff,guilty of aggravated murder as he stands charged in count of the indictment now further find that the aggravated murder was committed while the said james goff was committing or attempting to commit,or while fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit aggravated burglary and the offender was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder.
at guilt phase hr g tr.at reading of verdict form emphasis added.there is simply no merit to goff assertions,and goff appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise such a frivolous claim on direct appeal.goff is not entitled to relief on this claim.
instruction 
in goff ninth and sixteenth assignments of error,goff argues that the trial court erred in failing to give a specific instruction to the jury regarding the credibility of testimony by accomplices and informants and that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this issue on direct appeal.goff raised the underlying claim as part of his ohio rule of appellate procedure b motion,which the ohio courts denied.the district court rejected this argument,and we conclude that goff is not entitled to relief on this claim.
we have noted that accomplice instructions as a general matter are not required,and we have held that a trial court does not violate a defendant constitutional rights by failing to give a specific accomplice instruction so long as the jury instructions adequately informed the jury regarding the credibility of witness testimony and alerted the jury to the various considerations that it should take into account in weighing testimony.scott mitchell,cir quoting united states carr,cir.in the instant case,the trial court gave the following instruction 
you are the sole judges of the facts and the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.to weigh the evidence you must consider the credibility of the witnesses.you will apply the tests of truthfulness which you apply in your daily lives.these tests include the appearance of each witness upon the stand,their manner of testifying,the reasonableness of their testimony,the opportunity they had to see,hear,and know the things concerning which they testified about,their accuracy of memory,their frankness or lack of it,their intelligence,their interest and bias,if any,together with all the facts and circumstances surrounding their testimony.applying these tests you will assign to the testimony of each witness such weight as you deem proper.
you are not required to believe the testimony of any witness simply because he or she was under oath.you may believe or disbelieve all or any part of the testimony of any witness.it is your province to determine what testimony is worthy of belief and what testimony is not worthy of belief.
at guilt phase hr g tr.at emphases added.this instruction both informs the jury regarding credibility and alerts the jury to what is properly considered when determining credibility thus it satisfies the criteria established in scott.therefore,the failure to give a specific accomplice instruction did not violate goff constitutional rights 
moreover,goff appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise this issue on direct appeal.goff correctly points out that,under ohio law,i f an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with an offense,the trial court is required to state substantially a specific jury instruction regarding accomplice testimony 
the testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his complicity,moral turpitude,or,but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject to grave suspicion,and require that it be weighed with great caution.
it is for you,as jurors,in the light of all the facts presented to you from the witness stand,to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and worth or its lack of quality and worth.
ohio ann.d however,at the time of goff trial and direct appeal,ohio law held that this section applied only if a witness had been indicted as an accomplice.see state wickline,ohio,defining accomplice under a former version of d as a person who at the very least was indicted for the crime of complicity state lordi,ohio app d,applying the wickline accomplice definition to a later version of d state royce,nos,wl,at ohio,applying d the version applicable during goff trial and holding that a trial court did not err in refusing to give the accomplice instruction because the witness was not charged with complicity as a result of his involvement with appellants criminal activities.none of the witnesses who testified against goff were indicted as accomplices,and goff points to no contrary ohio authority to support an argument that d applies under such facts.goff can not demonstrate prejudice because he has not shown that there is any likelihood that his appeal would have had a different outcome had appellate counsel raised this issue.we conclude that this claim is meritless.
right to testify 
in his ninth and seventeenth assignments of error,goff asserts that he was denied his right to testify on his own behalf when trial counsel foreclosed his ability to testify by informing prospective jurors at voir dire that goff would not testify at any point during the proceedings,and that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this issue on direct appeal.goff raised the underlying claim for the first time as part of his failed ohio rule of appellate procedure b motion.the district court rejected this claim,noting that the trial record is devoid of any evidence that petitioner right to testify was usurped against his will or in violation of his fundamental rights.goff iv,wl,at.we agree.
the right of a defendant to testify at trial is a constitutional right of fundamental dimension and is subject only to a knowing and voluntary waiver by the defendant nevertheless,b arring any statements or actions from the defendant indicating disagreement with counsel or the desire to testify,the trial court is neither required to sua sponte address a silent defendant and inquire whether the defendant knowingly and intentionally waived the right to testify,nor ensure that the defendant has waived the right on the record.united states webber,cir.indeed,when a tactical decision is made not to have the defendant testify,the defendant assent is presumed,and if a defendant disagrees with this decision,he must alert the trial court that he desires to testify or that there is a disagreement with defense counsel regarding whether he should take the stand.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.when a defendant does not alert the trial court of a disagreement,waiver of the right to testify may be inferred from the defendant conduct.waiver is presumed from the defendant failure to testify or notify the trial court of the desire to do so.id.
as the district court correctly noted,there is no evidence that goff ever alerted the trial court to his desire to testify at trial.accordingly,we will presume that goff waived this right,and,applying that presumption,we must conclude that goff constitutional rights were not violated by either trial counsel statements at voir dire or appellate counsel failure to raise this issue on direct appeal.we therefore conclude that goff is not entitled to relief on this claim.
conclusion on claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel 
in sum,although we reject most of goff arguments regarding ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,we conclude that goff appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue of goff right to allocution and that the opposite conclusion reached by the ohio supreme court constitutes an unreasonable application of federal law.we grant goff relief on this basis,the scope of which is explained below.
scope of remedy 
having concluded that goff is entitled to relief based on appellate counsel failure to raise during goff direct appeal a claim based on goff right to allocution before sentencing,we now turn to the question of the proper scope of relief to accord goff.mapes ii is instructive on this point.in mapes ii,we concluded that the petitioner received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel due to counsel failure to raise an eighth amendment claim regarding the trial judge instruction to the jury not to consider some mitigating evidence.mapes contended that,by granting the writ based on the sixth amendment violation,the court also established that there was an eighth amendment violation at sentencing,and that this conclusion was now the law of the case.mapes tate mapes ii,cir emphasis removed.we rejected mapes argument,noting that we were 
present ed with a very narrow question whether mapes was deprived of effective assistance of appellate counsel in violation of the sixth amendment.contrary to mapes contention,determination of this issue does not require us to decide the underlying issue whether mapes eighth amendment rights were violated at sentencing.as we stated repeatedly in mapes i,mapes underlying claims were not raised on direct appeal and are thus barred by procedural default,an adequate and independent ground for affirming his sentence.mapes coyle mapes i,cir.we further pointed out in mapes i that these underlying claims are relevant only insofar as they bear on the question whether appellate counsel was unconstitutionally ineffective in failing to raise them.id.at.
id.at fifth,sixth,and seventh alterations in original.we further noted that,although it was necessary to evaluate the underlying eighth amendment claim when determining if mapes had received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,such an evaluation does not require a decision on or a determination of these issues the underlying claim.all that is required is a determination that,based on the nature of the underlying claims,there is a reasonable probability that,but for his counsel failings,the defendant would have prevailed on his appeal.id.quoting smith robbins,d first alteration added.we granted the writ conditioned upon ohio courts granting a new,direct appeal,stressing that t he further remedy mapes requests goes far beyond neutraliz ing the constitutional deprivation suffered by the defendant and would,therefore,contravene the rule announced in magana hofbauer,cir.id.at third alteration in original see also magana,at a remedy for a sixth amendment violation should be tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.internal quotation marks omitted.
applying the rationale of mapes ii to the instant case,we conclude that the only appropriate remedy that we can provide is to grant the writ of habeas corpus unless the ohio courts reopen goff direct appeal.this narrow relief will allow us to neutralize the constitutional violation without overstepping the bounds of our power in this case.therefore,we grant goff petition for a writ of habeas corpus unless the ohio courts reopen goff direct appeal within days to allow goff to raise his allocution argument.
remaining claims 
we now turn to goff remaining claims,none of which provide him any further relief.
life sentence is a life sentence jury instruction 
as his third assignment of error,goff contends that the trial court should have submitted to the jury goff proposed jury instructions regarding parole eligibility because the prosecution alluded to goff future dangerousness during the prosecution closing argument.bagley counters that the trial court properly rejected goff proposed instructions because the jury could have recommended life with the possibility of parole.
goff filed a motion to submit to the jury the following instruction 
if sentenced to life imprisonment,under no circumstances could defendant be considered for parole for years.if i deem it appropriate,i may,upon your verdict of life,sentence defendant to consecutive life sentences whereupon he could not be considered for parole for at least years.
there is no certainty that defendant would ever be released on parole.after the minimum eligibility period i have already mentioned,the state parole board would be required by law to make a determination that there is a reasonable probability that,if defendant is released,he will assume his proper and rightful place in society,without violation of the law,and that his release is not incompatible with the welfare of society.the board may not make this determination without consulting those concerned with the decision.you,as jurors,retain a right under the law to express your views to the board.a prisoner released on parole remains on parole for the balance of his life and if he violates the terms of the parole he may be returned to prison to serve the life sentence.
so that you will have no misunderstanding concerning the sentence of life imprisonment,i have instructed you concerning the law as it relates to parole.however,i further instruct you that the subject of possible parole must be excluded from your deliberations.so far as you are concerned,a life sentence is a life sentence.if upon and after consideration of all evidence you believe your verdict should be imprisonment for life,it would be a violation of your oaths as jurors to refuse to make that recommendation because of a baseless doubt that the state parole board will properly carry out its legal duties.
at mem.in supp.of mot.to instruct the jury regarding parole at.the trial court denied the motion,instead instructing the jury as follows 
members of the jury,you have heard the evidence and the arguments of counsel and you will now decide whether you will recommend to the court that the sentence of death shall be imposed upon the defendant,and if not,whether the defendant shall be sentenced to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving full years of imprisonment or to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving full years of imprisonment.
at penalty phase hr g tr.at.
goff presented this claim on direct appeal,and the ohio supreme court rejected it 
we have consistently held that consideration of parole and consecutive or concurrent sentences is not for the jury consideration.see state mills,ohio,state mitts,ohio.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to instruct the jury as appellant requested.further,appellant trial counsel made it clear in closing argument that the sentence imposed on the aggravated murder count would be in addition to the sentences he would receive on the other charges.defense counsel also emphasized in voir dire and in closing argument that even if a life sentence was imposed,there was no guarantee that parole would be granted.
goff i,at.the district court also rejected goff claim on the merits,explaining that a capital defendant is not entitled to an instruction about his parole ineligibility if a life imprisonment without possibility of parole is not an option,and that,a t the time that goff was convicted and sentenced,there were only three sentencing options,none of which involved life without the possibility of parole.at op.and order at.we agree with the district court.
the supreme court has held that,if the state rests its case for imposing the death penalty at least in part on the premise that the defendant will be dangerous in the future,and life without the possibility of parole is the only alternative to a death sentence,due process plainly requires that the defendant be allowed to bring it the fact that the defendant is ineligible for parole to the jury attention by way of argument by defense counsel or an instruction from the court.simmons south carolina,d shafer south carolina,d reiterating that if a capital defendant future dangerousness is at issue,and the only sentencing alternative to death available to the jury is life imprisonment without possibility of parole,due process entitles the defendant to inform the jury of his parole ineligibility,either by a jury instruction or in arguments by counsel quoting ramdass angelone,d alteration in original.in the instant case,at the time of goff sentencing,ohio law provided for three alternative sentences in capital cases death,life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving twenty years,and life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving thirty years.at op.and order at.none of these alternatives involve life without the possibility of parole.therefore,simmons and its progeny are not applicable to goff case.thus,goff can not demonstrate that the ohio supreme court decision regarding this jury instruction was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent.
disclosure of plea agreement 
in his fourth assignment of error,goff contends that the prosecution committed a brady maryland,d,violation by failing to disclose a plea agreement between a key witness,keith lamar jones,and federal prosecutors.goff raised this claim on state postconviction review.when evaluating and ultimately rejecting goff claim,the ohio court of appeals made the following findings of fact 
unbeknownst to either the state or appellant,on june,jones had signed a written plea agreement with the united states attorney which included the following paragraph 
finally,the united states attorney for the southern district of ohio agrees that if jones provides substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of others who have committed criminal offenses,the united states attorney may move the court for an appropriate departure from the otherwise applicable guideline range for jones sentence and will in connection therewith make known to the court the nature and extent of jones assistance.jones understands that whether such motion should be made lies within the discretion of the united states attorney and that whether and to what extent such motion should be granted are solely matters for determination by the court.
on july,jones entered a guilty plea to one count of false use of a social security number in violation of section a b,title.
on during his testimony at appellant trial,when asked whether he was under indictment or investigation in federal court,jones replied that he was for misuse of a social security number.appellant trial counsel further delved into the pending federal charge.appellant trial counsel elicited not only that jones had been indicted under the federal charge,but that he had also pled guilty to the federal charge.jones admitted that in addition to the time he had already served,he was looking at more time.appellant was subsequently convicted in july and sentenced in august.
on september,the united states attorney filed a motion for substantial assistance asking the federal court to consider jones substantial assistance in a case prosecuted by local authorities in determining an appropriate departure from the applicable sentencing guidelines.on september,the state received a letter from jones attorney seeking a letter on behalf of jones regarding his assistance in appellant trial.on september,the state addressed a letter to the federal court which stated that jones testimony was critical in the successful prosecution of appellant.jones voluntarily contacted our office and provided us with information and testimony that was extremely beneficial in the preparation of our case.
during jones october,sentencing hearing,the united states attorney stated that jones was the state key witness in appellant trial and that his testimony was critical.jones attorney,in turn,stated that jones had been very cooperative not only in appellant trial,but also with agents of the united states government from divisions of the irs,health and human services and others.that same day,jones was sentenced to a month term of imprisonment,instead of a possible maximum term.
goff ii,wl,at alterations and omissions in original.the ohio court of appeals then concluded that there is no evidence of any consideration to be given jones in exchange for his testimony.the affidavits and exhibits reflect that the state did not receive any requests until some days after jones testified.there is no evidence of any prior promises or agreements.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.additionally,the court of appeals noted that w hile the record indicates when the state became aware of jones federal charge,it is not clear when,if ever before jones testimony,the state learned about jones plea agreement guilty plea.id.the court of appeals also concluded that,even assuming that the state failed to disclose jones plea agreement to appellant,we find,based upon the totality of the circumstances,that there is no reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at quoting united states bagley,d.
the district court also denied relief on this claim,noting that t here is no evidence that the state prosecutors ever promised jones any consideration in exchange for his testimony or that they were aware that jones had entered into a plea agreement.goff iv,wl,at.the district court explained that a prosecutor has no obligation under brady to learn of information possessed by other government agencies having no involvement in the investigation or prosecution at issue,and rejected goff contention that the knowledge of the federal prosecutors should be imputed to the state prosecutors.id.citing united states morris,cir.we agree.
it is true that,p ursuant to brady,the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment,irrespective of good faith or bad faith of the prosecution,united states garner,cir quoting brady,at.however,brady clearly does not impose an affirmative duty upon the government to take action to discover information which it does not possess,united states graham,cir quoting united states beaver,cir,cert.denied,d.goff has failed to demonstrate that the ohio court of appeals factual the state prosecutor had no knowledge of jones plea agreement before jones clearly erroneous,and thus we take that fact as true.see bailey,at.furthermore,goff has pointed to no federal authority requiring a state prosecutor to inquire into the federal prosecution of a witness that is unrelated to the state case and that does not involve any persons acting on behalf of the state prosecutor.indeed,there is federal law supporting the opposite brady and its prodigy do not impos e a duty on the prosecutor office to learn of information possessed by other government agencies that have no involvement in the investigation or prosecution at issue.morris,at moon head,th cir refusing to impute to a georgia prosecutor information that tennessee authorities possessed regarding a defendant,where there was no evidence that the georgia and tennessee agencies shared any resources or labor,the two agencies worked together during the investigation of the defendant,or the tennessee authorities were under the direction or supervision of the georgia prosecutor.under these circumstances,we can not say that the ohio supreme court conclusion on this issue was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent.goff is not entitled to relief on this claim.
jury instruction regarding specific mitigating factors 
in his fifth assignment of error,goff contends that the trial court refusal to submit to the jury goff proposed jury instruction regarding specific mitigating factors that the jury could consider resulted in an unfair trial.such factors included 
goff personality disorder 
any residual doubt about the defendant guilt of the offense charged,or an aggravated circumstance 
goff potential for rehabilitation 
goff ability to make a and peaceful adjustment to life in prison 
goff ability to lead a useful life behind bars if sentenced to life imprisonment 
goff devotion to and care of his family members 
goff deprivation of parental nurturing,and the fact his conduct disorder was caused by family environment and 
the youth of the offender.
goff br.at.additionally,goff asserts in assignment of error eight that it was error for the trial court not to instruct the jury regarding goff drug use as a mitigating factor.rather than submit goff proposed instructions,the trial court instructed the jury as follows 
in making your decision you will consider all the evidence,the arguments of counsel,and all other information and all other reports which are relevant to the nature and circumstances of the aggravating circumstances or to any mitigating factors including,but not limited to,the nature and circumstances of the offense,and the history and character and background of the defendant,the youth of the defendant,and any other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the defendant should be sentenced to death.
you are to weigh the aggravating circumstances which you have already found against any mitigating factors which you find to exist.
at penalty phase hr g tr.at emphases added.
goff raised this issue on direct appeal,and,citing eddings oklahoma,d,the ohio supreme court rejected goff claim.goff i,at.the district court also rejected the claim,noting that the jury instruction given did not violate state law and that petitioner was not denied due process because t he court instructions permitted the jury to consider all the evidence presented by petitioner in mitigation.goff iv,wl,at.we,too,reject goff claim.
as stated above,t he eighth amendment requires that the jury be able to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence offered by petitioner.boyde,at.an instruction is constitutional so long as the jury is permitted to consider all of the relevant mitigation evidence.buell,at.where the trial court instructs the jury in accordance with state law and sufficiently addresses the matters of law at issue,no error results and the petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief.white,at.
here,the trial court instruction allowed the jury to consider all of goff mitigation evidence,and thus adhered to supreme court doctrine.buell,at denying habeas relief where the trial court gave a jury instruction very similar to the one at issue in the instant case.moreover,goff has not argued that the trial court instruction violated ohio law.because the instruction did not violate state law,and did not limit the jury consideration of mitigating factors,we conclude that the ohio supreme court resolution of this claim was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,federal law.
refusal to instruct the jury not to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense 
in his sixth assignment of error,goff asserts that the trial court should have instructed the jury not to consider the nature and circumstances of the crime when weighing the mitigating and aggravating factors.instead,the trial court specifically instructed the jury to consider all the evidence,including the nature and circumstances of the offense.at penalty phase hr g tr.at.the ohio supreme court denied this claim on direct appeal.goff i,at.the district court also rejected this claim,finding that t he ohio supreme court has held that under b,it is proper,and indeed required,that the court instruct the jury to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense as a mitigating factor,and that a state statute which requires the jury to consider the circumstances of the crime for which the defendant was convicted is not unconstitutional.goff iv,wl,at.we agree.
we have noted that ohio law requires the jury to consider,and weigh against the aggravating circumstances proved beyond a reasonable doubt,the nature and circumstances of the offense.slagle bagley,cir quoting ohio,cert.denied,d.such a requirement is not unconstitutional.see tuilaepa california,d o ur capital jurisprudence has established that the sentencer should consider the circumstances of the crime in deciding whether to impose the death penalty.slagle,at.therefore,we can not conclude that the ohio supreme court rejection of this claim was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,federal law.
refusal to instruct the jury not to consider the aggravated murder itself 
in his seventh assignment of error,which is very similar to his sixth assignment of error,goff argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury not to consider the aggravated murder itself when weighing the mitigating and aggravating factors.the ohio supreme court rejected this claim on direct appeal,noting that the trial court correctly identified the aggravating circumstances,and the process of weighing the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors.goff i,at.the district court agreed,concluding that the instruction was correct under state law and that it did not violate the constitution.goff iv,wl,at.as we explained above,the trial court jury instruction regarding the nature and circumstances of the crime comports with both state law and the constitution.moreover,goff has pointed to no authority requiring that a jury be specifically instructed that it can not consider the aggravated murder itself.therefore,the ohio supreme court decision on this matter was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,federal law.
trial court refusal to consider drug abuse as a mitigating factor 
in assignment of error ten,goff asserts that the trial court refused to consider goff drug abuse at the time of the commission of the crime as a mitigating factor,rendering goff death sentence unfair.the trial court made the following observations in its sentencing opinion 
b the defendant has argued that he suffered from alcohol drug impairment at the time of the offense.
although there was evidence that the defendant had used crack cocaine earlier in the day,there was no evidence that at the time of the offense he had used alcohol or was under the influence of either alcohol or crack cocaine at the time of this offense.furthermore,the use of alcohol or drugs is not an excuse for committing a crime.
the court assigns no weight to this as a mitigating factor.
at decision at.the ohio supreme court rejected this claim on the merits during goff direct appeal 
the trial court statement that it assigns no weight to this as a mitigating factor indicates clearly that the trial court did not refuse to consider alcohol and drug abuse as a mitigating factor.at the same time,we also agree that some of the trial court earlier chosen language may be inartful,to the extent that the trial court sentencing opinion may be susceptible of a reading that indicates no need to consider the factor simply because appellant was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the offense.the court statement in that regard would be an incorrect definition of mitigation,one that relates directly to culpability,as opposed to those factors that are relevant to whether the offender should be sentenced to death 
however,when this portion of the sentencing opinion is considered in its entirety,there is no error.moreover,if there was error,our independent review would cure it.

we have held that reweighing by the ohio supreme court under ohio a satisfies the requirements of clemons mississippi,d,which allows an appellate court to cure errors by the trial court in weighing mitigating and aggravating factors,when the court either eliminates impermissible aggravating factors or adds overlooked mitigating factors.lundgren mitchell,cir citing baston bagley,cir.in the instant case,the ohio supreme court independently reweighed the mitigating and aggravating factors,concluding that goff used marijuana,speed,and inhalants.his crack cocaine dependency occurred during a period of several months in,leading to this crime.however,we give little weight to appellant voluntary substance abuse.goff i,at.this reweighing,which considered goff argument,cured any failure on the part of the trial court in regard to weighing goff substance abuse.goff is not entitled to relief on this ground.
prosecutorial misconduct 
in his thirteenth assignment of error,goff contends that he was denied a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct,which occurred when the prosecutor made the following statement in his closing argument 
i heard this on the radio and it really,really strikes home.i heard an individual on the radio say that the juries of today,of which you are one,when they reach their verdicts,when they reach their recommendation of sentencing,as in this case,are setting the standards of behavior acceptable to society,and ladies and gentlemen of the jury,that is true.and the question is,what standard of behavior are you going to set for society as you go back in that jury room and deliberate what is your standard is the standard going to be you can kill somebody with no remorse because you want money to go buy crack or is the standard going to be,we will not accept that
