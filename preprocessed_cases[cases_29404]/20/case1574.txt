david patrick lakin appeals the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging constitutional error because he was forced to wear leg iron shackles during his trial in state court.the district court found that lakin due process rights were violated when he was forced to wear leg irons during his trial,but concluded that the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of lakin guilt.consistent with the supreme court analysis last term in deck missouri,d,we agree with the district court and hold that the shackling was constitutional error,but that it was nevertheless harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of lakin guilt.we therefore affirm the district court judgment denying lakin petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
lakin was serving a year prison sentence when he and four other inmates attempted to escape in january.see lakin stine,wl,cir lakin i.the inmates escaped by crawling through a storm drain pipe to reach the outside of the prison where they acted as if they were on a work detail.this court previously summarized the facts as follows.
two corrections officers,sheila duncan and danny norman,drove over to the inmates in a state vehicle to determine if they were authorized to be there.during the encounter,the inmates assaulted the two officers,placed them into the vehicle and handcuffed them.the inmates then drove off in the vehicle,taking the handcuffed officers with them.after eluding law enforcement in a chase,lakin and his fellow escapees surrendered after an ensuing chase.lakin and his were returned to prison and charged with kidnapping,prison escape,assault on a prison employee,and unlawfully driving away an automobile.
id.lakin was convicted on all counts.on appeal,the michigan court of appeals addressed only one of lakin and his five the trial court failed to comply with applicable rules governing the defendants decision to discharge counsel and represent themselves.finding that reversal was not required,the court affirmed the convictions.regarding all other claims,the court wrote we have carefully considered the remaining issues raised by defendants.however,we conclude they require neither reversal nor discussion.the michigan supreme court declined discretionary review.
lakin then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.the district court granted a conditional writ finding that lakin sixth amendment right to counsel was violated when he was denied the opportunity to consult with counsel outside of the presence of prison guards.this court reversed and remanded.see lakin i,wl.on remand,the district court addressed another of lakin he was denied a fair and impartial trial when the trial court prevented him from presenting a duress and necessity again issued a conditional writ.this court again reversed and remanded.lakin stine.cir lakin ii.
on the second remand,the district court addressed lakin remaining claims including the only claim now before this lakin due process rights were violated when he was forced to wear leg irons during his trial.because the michigan court of appeals provided no explanation for the basis of its denial of lakin claim,the district court proceed ed with an independent review of this claim through the lens of d.the district court concluded that lakin due process rights were violated because the trial court failed to conduct any inquiry into or make any findings regarding the necessity of the shackles.nevertheless,the district court found that the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of lakin guilt presented at trial,and denied lakin petition for relief.
standard of review 
lakin petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed under and this court must therefore apply the standard of review set forth in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of.d.pursuant to that section,a writ of habeas corpus may not be granted unless the state court adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states d.to determine what constitutes clearly established law,this court looks to the law as established by the supreme court holdings and not its dicta.see ruimveld birkett,cir citing williams taylor,d and yarborough alvarado,d.nevertheless,an explicit statement by the supreme court is unnecessary rather,the legal principles and standards flowing from supreme court precedent also qualify as clearly established law.ruimveld,at quoting taylor withrow,cir.this court reviews the district court decision to deny the writ de novo and its factual findings for clear error.towns smith,cir.
review of supreme court law 
recently in ruimveld,this court conducted a brief review of supreme court cases related to prejudicial trappings at trial.at.just one month later,the supreme court issued its opinion in deck missouri addressing whether shackling a convicted offender during the penalty phase of a capital trial violates the federal constitution.deck,d.in deck,the supreme court held that the constitution forbids the use of visible shackles during the penalty phase,as it forbids their use during the guilt phase,unless that use is justified by an essential state as the interest in courtroom to the defendant on trial.id.at quotations omitted and emphasis in original citing holbrook flynn,d and illinois allen,d.
citing deep roots in the common law,the supreme court held that t he answer is clear the law has long forbidden routine use of visible shackles during the guilt phase it permits a state to shackle a criminal defendant only in the presence of a special need.id.at.the court further stated that 
it is clear that this court prior statements gave voice to a principle deeply embedded in the law.we now conclude that those statements identify a basic element of the due process of law protected by the federal constitution.thus,the fifth and fourteenth amendments prohibit the use of physical restraints visible to the jury absent a trial court determination,in the exercise of its discretion,that they are justified by a state interest specific to a particular trial.such a determination may of course take into account the factors that courts have traditionally relied on in gauging potential security problems and the risk of escape at trial.
notwithstanding the constitutional rule,the court noted that there will be cases where these perils of shackling are unavoidable.id.at citation omitted.the court did not underestimate the need to restrain dangerous defendants or the need to give trial courts latitude in making individualized security determinations,but given shackles prejudicial effect,due process does not permit the use of visible restrains if the trial court has not taken account of the circumstances of the particular case.id.
in deck itself,the supreme court applied these principles and rejected missouri argument that the trial judge acted within his discretion.id.at.this argument,the court wrote,founders on the record failure to indicate that the trial judge saw the matter as one calling for discretion.the record contains no formal or informal findings.id.the absence of findings,according to the court,does not meet the determination that the due process clause requires.id notwithstanding,the court hypothesized that there might be an exceptional case where the record itself makes clear that there are indisputably good reasons for shackling.id.
finally,the supreme court held that the defendant need not demonstrate actual prejudice to make out a due process violation.id.instead,harmless error analysis is,t he state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the shackling error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.id.second alteration in original quoting chapman california,d.
c.the law was clearly established 
although deck was only recently decided,the supreme court made clear that the guilt phase rule was clearly established law prior to the date of the deck decision.deck addressed whether the guilt phase rule is applicable in the capital sentencing context.furthermore,t
