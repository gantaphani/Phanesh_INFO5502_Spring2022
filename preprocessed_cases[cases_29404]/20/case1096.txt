a jury convicted robert tassin of capital murder in a louisiana state court.his wife georgina,believing that she might receive a sentence in exchange for her testimony,testified that robert had planned to commit armed robbery.robert denied that there was any plan.the state suppressed evidence of georgina sentencing agreement,arguing in close that there was no deal and that georgina had no reason to lie.robert challenged his conviction on numerous grounds,including an argument that the state misled the jury in violation of the fourteenth amendment.the state court found that there had been no promise of a lenient sentence and no fourteenth amendment violation.robert filed a habeas claim in federal district court that court held that the state court decision was contrary to federal law and vacated his conviction,ordering that the writ issue unless louisiana retried tassin within days louisiana appeals.
wayne stagner and eddie martin worked on a mississippi tugboat.when they completed a shift one night,they met a young woman named shirley,sheila,or shelia mills at the shady lady lounge in louisiana.martin,stagner,and sheila had several rounds of drinks and then drove away from the bar in an attempt to find cocaine to buy.martin drove,stagner rode in the passenger seat,and sheila sat between them.after stopping at another bar,where they found no cocaine,mills suggested that they stop at the home of georgina and robert tassin.the men agreed,and sheila went inside.georgina later testified that while martin and stagner were waiting in the car,the tassins and mills hatched a plan to rob martin and stagner.the tassins also informed sheila that they did not have cocaine but they had dilaudid,and that they would provide sheila with the drug if she could get enough money from mills and stagner to pay for dilaudid for the group.mills emerged to ask martin for money in exchange for sex.she the tassins home,where she paid the tassins and they all injected dilaudid.mills from the home,this time with the tassins.
the five individuals drove elsewhere,allegedly to look for more drugs.they stopped at another home,where the state argued that the tassins borrowed a gun and robert said that he obtained needles.while driving back to the tassins home,sheila asked martin to stop the car under a bridge because she was going to be sick.she exited the car.robert claims that at this point,stagner pointed a gun at him,demanded drugs and money,and wrestled with him.during the tussle,robert got possession of stagner gun and shot the gun in self defense,wounding stagner and killing martin.stagner,on the other hand,claimed at trial that robert shot from the back seat in a surprise attack on stagner and martin.
the state court severed georgina,robert,and mills cases.georgina was indicted for first degree murder but pled guilty to armed robbery and received a sentence.stagner and robert also testified at robert trial,but mills did not.
before trial,robert asked the state to disclose any information it had on potential deals for a lenient sentence in exchange for georgina testimony against her husband the state responded that it had no information on any deal.georgina testified that she faced the possibility of a five to sentence for armed robbery.when asked before the jury if her testimony would affect her sentence,she responded that she did not know if it would,and that no promises relating to her testimony had been made the prosecution then suggested to the jury that georgina had no reason to lie,since she faced up to a year sentence according to an affidavit of georgina attorney,however,the judge presiding over her case had indicated that he would sentence her to twenty to thirty years,or as low as fifteen years,if she waived the marital privilege and possibly ten years if her testimony was consistent with her police statement georgina also testified in proceedings that when she had testified at trial,she believed that she would receive a sentence at trial,robert and his attorney were unaware that georgina had a favorable sentencing bargain,more favorable than a plea of armed robbery with the potential for years in prison.they learned of the deal only when an inmate forwarded robert a letter following robert conviction and sentencing.georgina had been writing letters to a male pen pal inmate named jenkins or shorty,who sent robert one of georgina to reassure him that georgina letters to jenkins were friendly and not amorous.the letter referenced the possibility of a sentencing deal 
a jury found robert guilty of first degree murder in may,and the court sentenced him to death.the louisiana supreme court affirmed robert conviction on direct and rejected robert later application for a.robert filed his first application for post conviction relief in august.the state court rejected that petition in august,rejecting tassin claim that the state suppression of the agreement between georgina and the trial court violated the fourteenth amendment,as well as his other claims.
following rejection of his application for writ of certiorari and review to the louisiana supreme court robert brought his first federal habeas petition arguing,inter alia,that the lower court determination that no deal existed was an unreasonable application of federal law.while these claims were pending,robert discovered new evidence and the state permitted robert to bring a second state application for post conviction relief the successor petition based on this evidence,which he filed in january.the federal court dismissed his habeas claim without prejudice,and the state court considered the successor petition.the state court rejected the second petition for relief in november.in january,the state court rejected robert motion to reconsider its denial of the successor petition.that court did,however,permit additional scientific testing to determine whether stagner initiated the violence on the night of the murder.in december,the state court considered the results of the scientific testing and denied robert claims in his amended successor petition.then the federal district court again addressed robert habeas claims.
robert had presented evidence to the state court that georgina expected to receive only ten years,not,in the letter that she wrote to a friend before the original trial,as well as testimony of georgina and her lawyer indicating that georgina attorney had discussed a deal with the court and had communicated this to georgina the state court concluded that robert had failed to prove that such an arrangement existed and therefore denied robert habeas claim,stating,
tassin alleges that his wife,georgina tassin georgina was promised a lenient sentence by the trial judge in return for her testimony against petitioner.tassin further alleges that this arrangement was unknown to him.at the evidentiary hearing on this claim,the trial judge,georgina,and georgina attorney all denied that such an arrangement was made.robert tassin presented no convincing evidence to contradict the testimony of these individuals.accordingly,relief based on this claim is denied.
the district court granted relief on this issue,finding that the state habeas court had erroneously required robert to show that the court had promised georgina a lenient sentence and that this promise was unknown to robert the district court held that the state court ruling was contrary to federal law because it applied a more stringent standard than the one established by supreme court precedent.specifically,the district court found that the state court determination was contrary to giglio united states napue illinois and brady because the suppressed bargain need not have been a firm promise in order to mislead the jury with respect to georgina credibility,and because the state failed to disclose the bargain.the court found that the state was constitutionally required to reveal its deal with the witness to the jury and had failed to do so.the state appealed,arguing that the district court holding was erroneous,urging that there was no promise and that georgina testimony was not misleading.alternatively,the state argues,even if georgina testimony was misleading,her testimony was not material.we address each argument in turn.
robert tassin filed his federal habeas petition on january,so aedpa applies under aedpa,the state court factual findings are presumed to be correct,and the habeas petitioner has the burden of rebutting that presumption by clear and convincing evidence.in reviewing a state trial court decision,a district court may grant a habeas writ only if the court decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases,or the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from supreme court precedent.
the federal district court presumed that the state court findings of fact were correct but concluded that the state court decision,holding that there was no due process violation under the fourteenth amendment,was contrary to clearly established federal law.the federal court correctly found that the state had erroneously concluded that there was no duty of disclosure absent a firm promise of leniency from the judge or prosecutor.we agree.it also concluded that there was an understanding sufficient to trigger giglio and brady,albeit not a firm promise,that georgina had expected to gain beneficial treatment in sentencing,provided she testified at trial consistently with her prior statements inculpating robert.the court did not err in that conclusion.finally,the federal court concluded that nondisclosure of the understandings violated brady.we turn first to giglio and then to brady.
in giglio,the petitioner discovered after his conviction that the government had told a testifying witness that the witness would definitely be prosecuted if he did not testify,and that if he did testify he would be obliged to rely on the good judgment and conscience of the government as to whether he would be prosecuted.yet the testifying witness did not disclose this at trial.the witness testified as follows 
were you ever arrested in this case or charged with anything in connection with these money orders that you testified to 
not at that particular time.
to this date,have you been charged with any crime 
not that i know of,unless they are still going to prosecute 
the government later argued to the jury that the testifying witness received no promises that he would not be indicted.the court in giglio found a fourteenth amendment violation and granted the petitioner a new trial,finding,the heart of the matter is that one assistant united states first one who dealt with the testifying witness now states that he promised the witness that he would not be prosecuted if he cooperated with the government.
in napue,the court reversed a petitioner conviction where an attorney had promised the key testifying witness consideration in exchange for his testimony,and the witness lied about this promise before the jury the witness,when the assistant state attorney asked,did anybody give you a reward or promise you a reward for testifying replied,there ai nobody promised me anything.the witness testified that he was sentenced to one hundred and years and that he hoped to have that sentence reduced.even though the witness also testified that one attorney talked to him a while ago and said he was going to do what he could to reduce the sentence the court found that this testimony did not sufficiently apprise the jury as to the witness deal with the assistant state attorney.although the court referred to the deal as a promise,the court focused on the extent to which the testimony misled the jury,not whether the promise was indeed a promise,and emphasized that the witness believed that he might receive a promise prior to trial the court found,
had the jury been apprised of the true facts it might well have concluded that the key witness had fabricated testimony in order to curry the favor of the very representative of the state who was prosecuting the case in which the witness was testifying,for the witness might have believed that such a representative was in a position to implement as he ultimately attempted to do any promise of consideration 
giglio and napue set a clear precedent,establishing that where a key witness has received consideration or potential favors in exchange for testimony and lies about those favors,the trial is not fair.although giglio and napue use the term promise in referring to deals,they establish that the crux of a fourteenth amendment violation is deception.a promise is unnecessary.where,as here,the witness credibility was an important issue in the case evidence of any understanding or agreement as to a future prosecution would be relevant to his credibility and the jury was entitled to know of it.as the court held in united states bagley,a case that informed the district court decision,
defense counsel asked the prosecutor to disclose any inducements that had been made to witnesses,and the prosecutor failed to disclose that the possibility of a reward had been held out to the witnesses if the information they supplied led to the accomplishment of the objective sought to be obtained to the satisfaction of the government.this possibility of a reward gave the witnesses a direct,personal stake in respondent conviction.the fact that the stake was not guaranteed through a promise or binding contract,but was expressly contingent on the government satisfaction with the end result,served only to strengthen any incentive to testify falsely in order to secure a conviction 
the supreme court emphasized in giglio that this court made clear that deliberate deception of a court and jurors by the presentation of known false evidence is incompatible with rudimentary demands of justice and that the same result obtains when the state,although not soliciting false evidence,allows it to go uncorrected when it appears.tassin presented evidence of an understanding or agreement between georgina tassin and the state,evidence that showed more than a mere hope or expectation of a lenient sentence,and that the state failed to correct georgina testimony that no agreement existed.the district court pointed to multiple pieces of supporting evidence we highlight a few.
georgina attorney testified after trial that he believed,prior to trial,that georgina would get a sentence if she testified consistently with her prior statements inculpating robert and he relayed this belief to her,although emphasizing that nothing was guaranteed.her attorney recalled meetings with the judge where the possibility of a sentence was discussed.according to the attorney affidavit,the judge stated that he typically gave defendants in georgina position a fifteen to but that he might shorten that sentence to ten years if she testified consistently.georgina relayed her belief in this deal in her letter to her friend shorty,stating,i am looking at years and the judge said that i would have to do years out of that.yet at trial,georgina testified that she might receive years in prison and that she did know whether her testimony would have any bearing on her sentence.most importantly,the district attorney capitalized on this misrepresentation in his closing argument,stating,she faces up to years in jail for armed robbery so she has no reason to lie to anybody you call five to years a deal the state not only allowed deceptive testimony to go uncorrected it also capitalized on its key witness testimony to argue that there were no pending agreements affecting her credibility.
in light of the supreme court holdings in giglio,napue,and bagley,the district court did not err in concluding that the trial court decision,in holding that a fourteenth amendment violation required tassin to show that the state had made a promise to his wife in exchange for her testimony and covered up this promise,was contrary to clearly established f
