gene edward howland,texas prisoner,was convicted by a jury of two counts of aggravated sexual assault and two counts of indecency with a child by contact on december,and sentenced to a combined fifty years in prison.subsequently,the district court dismissed his federal habeas petition with respect to the first sexual assault count as under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,but granted howland a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether equitable tolling should have applied as to the second count because his state petition was never received by the state court.howland further requested that this court expand the certificate of appealability to include the issue of whether the prison mailbox rule should apply to his state habeas filings in light of warner glass.this court liberally construed howland argument as one for statutory tolling and granted an expanded certificate on the issues of whether the prison mailbox rule applies to texas state habeas filings,even if they are never received by the state court,and if so,whether howland petition is rendered timely due to statutory tolling.we answer both in the negative and affirm the judgment of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
a jury convicted howland on december,of two counts of aggravated sexual assault,with each count carrying a sentence of twenty years in prison,and two counts of indecency with a child by contact,with each count carrying a five year prison sentence.howland convictions were affirmed on direct appeal by the houston court of appeals district on march,and affirmed by the court of criminal appeals on march.on october,the supreme court denied certiorari and subsequently denied rehearing on may.
on august,howland delivered a state habeas application,which he says challenged all four counts,to the prison authorities to be sent via certified mail.after months passed without word,howland sent a letter to the state court on october,inquiring into the status of his petition.on march,he sent another letter accompanying a motion to amend his state habeas application,which he still could not confirm was received by the state court.notably,he did not submit a copy of the original application.on may,howland wrote a third letter seeking confirmation that the court received his august application.finally,on may,he received a letter from the state court clerk stating that there was no record of any writ application filed in august.
while attempting to discover the status of his august application,howland filed separate state habeas petitions challenging each of the two counts of indecency with a child and the second aggravated sexual assault charge,on april,april,and january,respectively.each was denied without written order he did not file another application challenging his first sexual assault count,which is at issue in this case.
on may,howland resubmitted his original state habeas application,but it was rejected and returned to him because it was not submitted on the proper form.on may,howland filed a motion to invoke the mailbox rule and implored the state court to consider his application,which it still had not received in the proper form.finally,on january,howland addressed an amended application on the proper form to the state court and sent it certified mail,stamped january.in its motion for summary judgment in the district court,the state offered an affidavit from the deputy court clerk stating that this petition was never received or filed by the state court either.
subsequently,howland filed the federal habeas petition at issue in this case,which was signed and dated june,challenging his convictions on all four counts.the state moved to dismiss the petition as time barred.the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of the indecency counts and the second sexual assault count,but credited howland assertion that he had filed a state petition for the first sexual assault count on august,and therefore recommended against dismissal of the claim for that count.the district court accepted the magistrate recommendations.both parties moved for summary judgment on the claim relating to the first sexual assault count.the district court granted summary judgment for the state based on the court clerk affidavit that no state habeas petition was ever received to toll the statute of limitations under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,d,and thus,the federal petition was dismissed as and unexhausted.the district court determined that equitable tolling did not apply because howland had not diligently pursued his rights under state law,and because there was no evidence that state officials had interfered with his right to file a timely state petition.
howland filed a timely notice of appeal.the district court granted a certificate of appealability on the equitable tolling issue,which this court expanded to include the issue of whether the prison mailbox rule should apply to his state habeas application in light of the texas supreme court decision in warner.
ii.standard of review 
the decision of a district court to deny a habeas application on procedural grounds is reviewed de novo.larry dretke,cir.however,we review a district court decision to deny equitable tolling for abuse of discretion,id.at,and its factual findings for clear error,alexander cockrell,cir.
iii.discussion 
as a preliminary matter,aedpa provides in relevant part 
a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.the limitation period shall run from the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.
d a.the supreme court denied howland petition for certiorari on october.it is beyond dispute that a state petitioner criminal conviction is final for purposes of aedpa limitations period,when his petition for certiorari is denied by the supreme court,not when his petition for rehearing is denied or his time to file for rehearing expires.giesberg cockrell,cir.in this case,howland convictions were final and his limitations period began to run on october,not may,as howland asserts.
aedpa further provides that this limitations period is tolled while a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment is pending d emphasis added.thus,howland asks this court to apply the prison mailbox rule and hold that his state petition was properly filed when he submitted it to prison officials on august.in the alternative,he asks us to hold that equity operates to toll his limitations period because his original state petition was lost in the mail.we decline howland invitations.
statutory tolling 
under aedpa,the time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.d emphasis added.it is well settled that a properly filed state application for collateral review is one submitted according to the state procedural requirements.causey cain,cir quoting lookingbill cockrell,cir alteration in causey see also artuz bennett,d holding an application for state relief is properly filed for aedpa purposes when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings emphasis in original larry,at.howland asks this court to apply the prison mailbox rule to determine when his state habeas petition was properly filed according to texas law,thus tolling the aedpa limitations period.
when it applies,the prison mailbox rule provides that an incarcerated pro se petitioner papers are considered filed when they are deposited in the prison mail system.in coleman johnson,we declined to apply the prison mailbox rule to texas state habeas petitions governed by article of the texas code of criminal procedure,cir.
later,in causey cain,we held that the prison mailbox rule did apply to toll the aedpa statute of limitations for louisiana state habeas petitions because louisiana has ado
