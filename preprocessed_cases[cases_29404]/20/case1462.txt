ernest eady appeals the judgment of the district court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.eady was convicted of second degree murder in tennessee state court.he argues that he was entitled to a writ of habeas corpus because there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction and because his counsel had provided ineffective assistance on direct appeal.both his claims are based on the fact that,subsequent to his conviction,tennessee law regarding the scienter required for second degree murder was clarified.prior to his conviction,tennessee state law allowed a person to be convicted for second degree murder if that person was aware of the nature of his conduct or if that person was aware that his conduct was reasonably certain to cause death.eady jury was instructed consistent with this definition.it is now clear that,to be convicted of second degree murder under tennessee law,a person must be aware that the nature of his conduct is reasonably certain to result in death.eady asserts that there was insufficient evidence to prove this scienter,and that,on direct appeal,his appellate counsel should have argued for a new trial on the basis that his trial jury had been improperly instructed.the tennessee court of criminal appeals ruled against eady on both issues on state review.the district court similarly found eady arguments unpersuasive,and accordingly denied eady petition.upon review,we conclude that the district court was correct,and we accordingly affirm the district court judgment and deny eady petition.
background 
i.eady state trial 
ernest eady was convicted of second degree murder for the killing of robert fletcher.on november,the night of the killing,eady was drinking in a club owned by james cannon prior to that night,eady had on occasion been kicked out of the club because he had a habit of just pouring drinks on the floor and saying,this is for my dead homey,when eady would be kicked out,he would verbally abuse and threaten james cannon,although he would not become physically violent and he would always come back and apologize later when he calmed down 
at am that night,eady again poured his drink on the floor and was acting loud and boisterous.james cannon,therefore,asked eady to leave.eady started at james cannon,and his friends held him back.as eady friends took him out of the club,eady went by the tables and chairs,and he picked them up and threw them on the floor.he also threatened james cannon,saying things like,i am going to get you.at the point eady left the club,there were about people still inside.
james cannon followed eady and his friends outside to ensure that he did in fact leave.james cannon witnessed eady friends take him away.he then reentered the club.
about minutes after eady left the club,roughly around am,he returned and signaled at the door.mark cannon,the proprietor son who was working the door that night,saw eady through the peephole.his father told him not to open the door for eady.mark cannon refused eady entrance,but a patron wanted to leave the club and mark cannon had to open the door.when mark cannon opened the door,eady started to climb the steps to enter the club,and mark cannon told him that he was not permitted to enter.
mark cannon then observed that eady was holding a gun in his hand.it appeared to be a black,millimeter.another patron also observed eady at the door holding a gun.
mark cannon partially closed the door,but it remained open about a foot and mark cannon talked with eady,who was standing about six feet from the door.eady wanted to enter the club,and he asked mark cannon several times,where is he at as he looked inside the club from the steps.at this point there were anywhere from to forty people inside the club and the parking lot was full of cars.mark cannon asked eady to t ake the gun back to the car,and told eady that,it is not worth it.
mark cannon then tried to pull the door shut but eady was pulling on the outside knob.eady then released the knob and mark cannon heard him cock the gun.mark cannon then successfully closed the door.
witnesses estimated that it was anywhere from a few to forty seconds and up to a few minutes after the door was shut that four shots were fired at the front of the club.the front of the building was brick,had a steel door,and had two windows covered with particle board.two shots were fired at the steel door.two shots were then fired at the building.one of those shots hit the brick building and the other penetrated the particle board covering the window and struck and killed robert fletcher,who was standing in the back of the club.
cathey siler,who was sitting in her car across the street from the club while the shots were being fired,saw a black man wearing all black clothing shooting at the building.she saw the man fire two shots at the door,and then back up to a car that was waiting for him while firing two more shots,one of which was fired just before he entered the car.
marlon fletcher ran outside of the club to see if he could see eady outside a minute or two after the shooting ended.while he did not see eady,he did see eady vehicle,a beige buick,about five or ten yards down the street being driven away from the club.marlon fletcher recognized eady vehicle because he had known it since eady had purchased it.
after the police assessed the scene,they went to eady apartment to interview him.when asked where he had been that night,eady responded,i have been out of the apartment all night.i have been right here in the apartment.he said,i c a me in at,pm,and i have sat right here on the couch watching tv ever since.
approximately eleven months after the shooting,eady had a conversation with the sister of the victim who had been in the club that night.after fletcher told him how her brother killing made her feel,eady went down to his knees,and he was crying.
eady also had several conversations with marlon fletcher,the cousin of the victim.marlon fletcher recalled their interaction as follows 
well,a couple of times i had seen eady he would say nothing to me.one time i had seen had seen him,and he was talking like,i did mean to do that to your cousin.i love like a family.and i was like,yeah,you know what i am saying,i was giving you a place to stay when you had nowhere to stay,and he was just telling me how know what i am saying,he did that he cared about us,and that he did mean to do that 
i mean,first couple of times i seen him,he did say nothing to me but then,after a while,he had seen me a couple of times,and he said he did mean to do that,and you know,that he loved us like a family eady volunteered this statement,i did ask him.
the jury was provided the following instructions regarding the scienter required to establish second degree murder.
knowingly means that a person acts knowingly with respect to the conduct or to circumstances surrounding the conduct when the person is aware of the nature of the conduct or that the circumstances exist.a person acts knowingly with respect to a result of the person conduct when the person is aware that the conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.a defendant acts knowingly when he or she is aware of the conduct,or is practically certain that the conduct will cause the result,irrespective of his or her desire that the conduct or result will occur.
the requirement of knowingly is also established if it is shown that the defendant acted intentionally.intentionally means that a person acts intentionally with respect to the nature of the conduct or to a result of the conduct when it is the person conscious objective or desire to engage in the conduct or cause the result.
at.under this instruction,the jury convicted eady of second degree murder based on all the evidence.
ii.procedural history 
direct appeal 
eady took several steps to challenge his conviction.first,his trial lawyer,haas,filed a direct appeal on eady behalf.he filed his notice of appeal to the tennessee court of criminal appeals on march,and then filed his brief on september.haas made three primary arguments in his brief,one of which was a argument where he contended that there was insufficient evidence to find that eady knowingly committed murder,as required for second degree murder.he argued that the evidence at most only supported recklessness or negligence.
the tennessee court of criminal appeals filed its opinion rejecting eady arguments on february.it held that the evidence supported a second degree murder conviction because it could have convinced a rational juror that eady had knowingly killed another.state eady,no,wl,at.
haas then filed an application for appeal to the tennessee supreme court on eady behalf.the application was filed on april.the tennessee supreme court denied eady application for appeal on june.
state review 
eady filed a petition for review with the state trial court on august.he made two primary arguments for relief.first,he asserted that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction under the proper definition of the term knowingly as determined by the tennessee supreme court in state ducker.he argued that ducker,a child abuse case,had defined knowingly for second degree murder as requiring proof that the accused acted while aware that death was the reasonably certain result of his conduct.he argued that while one may find from the evidence that he was aware of his conduct,one could not find that he was aware of the likely result.second,he contended that his trial and appellate counsel,haas,was constitutionally ineffective for failing to discover state ducker,which was decided two months before haas filed his brief on eady behalf before the tennessee court of criminal appeals,to realize ducker impact on eady case,and to argue on direct appeal that ducker required that eady receive a new trial because the jury had been improperly instructed regarding the definition of knowingly.
the state opposed eady petition.it argued that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that eady was aware of the likely result of his conduct.it further maintained that eady counsel was not ineffective because ducker was a child abuse case,and that the tennessee supreme court had merely stated in dicta that second degree murder was a offense,as compared to child abuse,which was a offense requiring only that the offender be aware of his actions.additionally,it pointed out that the state criminal appellate court had not settled the issue until april,in state page,and that the appellate court itself had recognized it was settling the issue in that case,see page,at.
at the state trial court hearing on eady petition,haas,eady trial and appellate counsel,testified.at the time of the trial and direct appeal,haas was one member of a law firm and the other member was ill,fighting lung cancer.haas was a general practitioner whose cases consisted of a fair percentage of criminal defense cases,many of which were appealed by haas.haas kept current on the law through the official publications of tennessee state court decisions,as well as through advance sheets of decisions and the tennessee attorney memo tam,which came out on a weekly basis and reported most if not all appellate decisions.haas did not have access to electronic legal research.
regarding his handling of eady appeal,haas testified that he had prepared and researched and filed a brief on eady behalf.at.he further stated that he had researched many cases in preparing eady brief,only some of which he cited,but that he did not recall seeing ducker.at.while haas made a sufficiency argument,he did not argue for a new trial based on the fact that the jury had been instructed on both a and definition of knowingly,rather than just the version.
the state trial court granted eady relief because it determined haas ineffective.even though it found the instruction incorrect and haas ineffective for failing to argue the issue on appeal,the trial court did not fault the district attorney for failing to correct the instruction.at.additionally,the trial court stated that it d id fault haas because this was developing law at that time at.
the state appealed the trial court grant of relief to the tennessee court of criminal appeals.it argued that the trial court decision was incorrect because eady had not been rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.
the tennessee court of criminal appeals agreed with the state and reversed the trial court on march.eady state,no,wl.it found that,based upon the record evidence,haas did not provide ineffective assistance primarily because haas would have been making a relatively novel argument,and it is not incompetent to fail to make such arguments.eady,no,wl,at.
eady filed an application for appeal to the tennessee supreme court on may.the tennessee supreme court denied his application for appeal on october.
federal review 
eady then filed this habeas corpus petition in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee on february.he again asserted that insufficient evidence supported his conviction and that his trial and appellate counsel had provided him constitutionally ineffective assistance.
the district court denied eady petition.it found that the state court determination that sufficient evidence supported eady conviction was not an unreasonable application of the supreme court jackson standard of sufficiency.eady morgan,wl,at.may.it further found that the state court determination that haas did not provide eady constitutionally ineffective assistance during the trial or on direct appeal was not an unreasonable application of the supreme court strickland standard of incompetence.eady,wl,at.
defendant argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.eady again argues that he is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus because insufficient evidence supports his conviction and because his appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance on direct appeal.we conduct de novo review of the district court denial of eady petition,which was based on a determination that the state court did not unreasonably apply settled supreme court precedent when it concluded that sufficient evidence supported eady conviction and that haas,eady appellate counsel,did not provide ineffective assistance on direct appeal.see joseph coyle,cir lott coyle,cir.
because this case involves a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from a state conviction,our review is constrained by previous state court determinations,as required by.under that statute,we can disagree with a state court legal determination only when it was a decision that was contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a decision will certainly be contrary to the supreme court clearly established precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases.williams taylor,d.a decision will also be contrary to the supreme court clearly established precedent if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from the supreme court precedent.id.at.
we can also disagree with a state court legal determination when it was a decision that involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a decision that correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case certainly would qualify as a decision involv ing an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.williams,at.alterations in original.it is important to remember that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.id.at.emphases in original.
we are also constrained in our determination of the facts from the record after a state court has ruled on the facts of the case.we may only disagree with a state court determination of the facts when the petitioner proves by clear and convincing evidence that the state court findings were unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d,e.because the state court decisions were not unreasonable,we deny eady petition for a writ of habeas corpus 
sufficient evidence 
eady argues that his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence.he argues that the evidence did not support a finding that he was the shooter.additionally,he argues that the evidence did not support a finding that he knowingly killed robert fletcher.
jackson virginia established the test for challenges based on sufficiency of the evidence.it held that a reviewing court task is 
to determine whether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt t he relevant question is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.this familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in testimony,to weigh the evidence,and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.
d emphasis in original.
the tennessee court of criminal appeals on direct appeal was the last state court to review eady sufficiency challenge.it held that sufficient evidence supported eady conviction.specifically,it pointed to the following evidence as sufficient to convince a reasonable trier of fact that eady was the shooter and that he had knowingly murdered another 
the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the state reveals that the defendant was asked to leave the lodge after pouring a drink onto the floor.the defendant was uncooperative and threatened james can n on.the defendant left the lodge but returned later with a gun.mark ca n non,alicia fletcher,and marlon fletcher said that they saw the defendant outside the lodge.further,mark can n on and marlon fletcher saw that the defendant had a gun,and the gun looked like a millimeter.additionally,cathey siler stated that she saw a black male shoot several shorts into the front of the lodge,including one shot from the street before he got into a car.alicia fletcher said that the shots were fired within seconds after mark can n on closed and locked the lodge door.a hole caused by a bullet was found in the wooden sign that covered a window on the front of the building.the path of travel from the victim body to the hole was consistent with the location in the street where a millimeter shell casing was found.also,marlon fletcher said that he saw the defendant car leaving the scene about one to two minutes after the shots were fired.finally,the proof showed that the defendant said to marlon fletcher,i did mean to do that to your cousin.from this evidence,a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant shot the victim.
the evidence further reveals that the defendant had patronized the lodge several times before this incident.the front of the lodge was brick with two steel doors and two windows which were covered by particle board.officer waggoner said that the distance from the bullet hole in the window to the victim body was feet,eight inches and that the length of the lodge was about forty feet.photographs of the inside and outside of the lodge were introduced into evidence and viewed by the jury.when the defendant first arrived at the lodge,the parking lot was almost full of cars,and there were about to forty people inside the lodge.when the defendant returned with the gun,the parking lot was full of cars.roberta stevens testified that the lodge was fairly crowded that night,and cathey siler said that the lodge was crowded.also,officer waggoner photographed the inside of the lodge when eight people were present,and he said that the lodge would have been crowded if to forty people were inside.this photograph was introduced into evidence.from this evidence,the jury could have reasonably inferred that the defendant was aware that the windows were covered by particle board and that the lodge was crowded.a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware that his conduct was reasonably certain to cause death.
state eady,no,wl,at.
we can not say that the decision of tennessee court of criminal appeals was an unreasonable application of jackson.see d.the evidence is all circumstantial,but we can not say it is so deficient that no rational trier of fact would find eady guilty of second degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt.
eady,however,disagrees with district the court conclusion for two primary reasons.first,he alleges that an incorrect jury instruction was used that permitted the jury to find him guilty of second degree murder if he was aware of his conduct,rather than requiring the jury to find that he was aware that his conduct was reasonably certain to result in death.while this is true,the tennessee court of criminal appeals determined that eady could have been found guilty under a proper jury instruction.it held that,based on the evidence in the second paragraph quoted above,a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware that his conduct was reasonably certain to cause death.because this conclusion was reasonable,any argument eady has about the jury instructions must be made as a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel,which is assessed in the next section.
eady makes a second argument in an attempt to undermine the state court conclusion.he argues that there was no proof that he intended to kill the victim,robert fletcher,and that the state admitted that fact in its closing argument.see at eady shot robert fletcher that night.he may not have meant to shoot robert.he meant to shoot cannon,but he missed cannon and hit robert,the man who he considered a brother.
this argument also fails.second degree murder does not require that the accused be aware that his conduct was reasonably certain to cause the death of a particular person.see state ely.eady,therefore,only had to be aware that his conduct was reasonably certain to cause someone death.the state court concluded that the evidence proved that he was,and this conclusion was not an unreasonable application of jackson.
ii.ineffective assistance of counsel 
eady also challenges the assistance provided by his counsel on direct appeal.a criminal defendant is entitled to effective assistance of counsel on a direct appeal of his conviction.evitts lucey,d.the seminal case that established the test for effectiveness was strickland washington,d.when a defendant claim s that counsel assistance was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction,he must first show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.strickland,at.described otherwise,the defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,which means proving that counsel was not a reasonably competent attorney and the advice was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.id.at.quoting mcmann richardson,d.
competence,then,involves a process.first,prior to making a decision or providing advice,an attorney must conduct a thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options.id.at.after such investigation,the attorney then must make a reasonable decision based upon that investigation.id.at.a particular investigation may not require much.for instance,the attorney may investigate his or her own mind for previous knowledge about pretrial preparations.the decision not to investigate past his or her own previous knowledge,however,may be held to be an unreasonable decision in certain circumstances.if the attorney has not before handled a serious criminal trial,deciding to rely solely on his or her own previous knowledge is probably unreasonable.in such circumstances,his or her own lack of knowledge would demonstrate that no reasonably competent attorney would cease investigating based on such skimpy knowledge.see wiggins smith,d describing how an attorney decision to not investigate further is unreasonable when,based on the investigation up to the point of decision,the
