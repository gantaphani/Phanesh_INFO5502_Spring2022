this is a case in which the district court granted a conditional writ of habeas corpus after the petitioner had already been released from incarceration,but no party challenges that order.instead,the commonwealth of kentucky challenges the district court subsequent order rendering the conditional writ absolute in response to the appellee motion to enforce,on the grounds that the commonwealth had failed to comply with the district court conditions.by the express terms of this order,the district court nullified the criminal conviction so that she would not suffer any collateral consequences as a result of her felony conviction.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
the facts of this case are not in dispute.on january,carrie gentry met brian pettit at ginger and pickles,a bar in mccracken county,kentucky.both were drinking,though gentry claims that she was much more sober than her new friend.gentry agreed to drive pettit,in his ford mustang,to her apartment.upon arriving at her home,however,pettit wished to continue listening to some new music that he had recently purchased,so gentry agreed to keep driving so as not to wake her daughter who was asleep in the apartment.while driving,gentry failed to negotiate a curve.the car crossed the center line,hit a bridge abutment,and flipped in the air.both pettit and gentry were ejected from the vehicle.pettit died at the scene.
gentry was indicted by a grand jury for driving under the influence and manslaughter in the second degree.during trial,the commonwealth introduced,over gentry objections,the testimony of five expert employees testifying as to gentry blood alcohol level and as to physical evidence in the car that pointed to her as having been the television.gentry was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison.gentry appeals were denied at all levels,including the united states supreme court.gentry kentucky,d denying cert.
gentry filed the instant habeas petition on january.while her petition remained pending,she was released from prison in july.the district court denied her habeas petition on march,holding that although the commonwealth had violated gentry sixth amendment confrontation clause rights by employing the system without good cause,the error had been harmless.gentry then filed a motion to alter or amend judgment,and the district court subsequently changed its mind,holding that its prior harmless error analysis had been inadequate.the court conditionally granted a writ of habeas corpus if the commonwealth does not retry gentry within ninety days of the entry of this judgment should appeal not be taken,or within ninety days of any final opinion on appeal that affirms this revisited decision should an appeal be taken by the respondent.the order was entered on the docket on may.kentucky filed an appeal,but then dropped it voluntarily on july.
on january,gentry filed a motion asking the district court to enforce its may judgment by voiding the commonwealth conviction so that she would not face any collateral consequences as a result of having been convicted of a felony.the district court granted this motion on july,converting the conditional grant of habeas into an absolute grant,and nullifying the conviction.the commonwealth thereafter filed a timely appeal from that order.
we review a district court disposition of a habeas petition de novo,and its findings of fact for clear error.rickman bell,cir.questions of law or mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo.ruimveld birkett,cir.as this appeal is essentially predicated on a technical legal the district court possessed jurisdiction over the motion to enforce and the authority to nullify the commonwealth must apply de novo review.
the commonwealth first argues that gentry january motion to enforce should be construed as a motion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure and that such a motion would have been untimely as it was filed eight months after entry of judgment.the state predicates this argument on its assertion that gentry was asking for relief that she had not been previously from collateral consequences of her felony that such relief was extrinsic to the conditional writ.as such relief was ostensibly not granted by the district court may order,the state thus suggests that gentry was essentially asking the court to alter or amend its judgment pursuant to civil rule.
the commonwealth is wrong.in her january motion,gentry clearly asked the district court to enforce its may judgment,and she did not challenge or seek to amend that order.the district court issued its may order conditionally granting the writ if the commonwealth does not retry gentry within ninety days of the entry of this judgment should not appeal be taken,or within ninety days of any final opinion on appeal that affirms this revisited decision should an appeal be taken by the respondent.the commonwealth unquestionably failed to grant gentry a new trial,and therefore it failed to abide by the condition that the district court had established.as there was no need to release gentry from incarceration,the only action required was to expunge gentry record of her unconstitutional felony conviction.the commonwealth took no such action.gentry therefore filed her january motion asking for the essential relief contemplated by the conditional order,for the court may order implicitly expected that the commonwealth would vacate the prior judgment pursuant to seeking a new trial,and thus the commonwealth failure to seek a new trial effectively circumvented the district court purpose.the motion was thus not filed pursuant to civil rule,and it was not untimely.
the commonwealth next argues that the district court did not retain jurisdiction to hear this matter.again,the commonwealth is incorrect.in the first place,the sole distinction between a conditional and an absolute grant of the writ of habeas corpus is that the former lies latent unless and until the state fails to perform the established condition,at which time the writ springs to life.see smith lucas,cir mcquillion duncan,d.district courts rightly favor conditional grants,which provide states with an opportunity to cure their constitutional errors,out of a proper concern for comity among the sovereigns.c ourts may delay the release of a successful habeas petitioner in order to provide the state an opportunity to correct the constitutional violation found by the court.hilton braunskill,d.absolute grants are therefore generally limited to situations where the nature of the error is simply incurable,such as a conviction under an unconstitutional statute.see,staley jones,d,rev on other grounds,cir.conditional grants of writs of habeas corpus are final orders,phifer warden,united states,terre haute,cir,exactly like absolute grants,and they ordinarily and ideally operate automatically,that is,without the need for the district court to act further.
nevertheless,district courts retain jurisdiction to execute a lawful judgment when it becomes necessary.if the state complies with its order,the petitioner will not be released if the state fails to comply with its order,release will occur.ordinarily,the only task that remains for the district court is the execution of judgment.ibid.a federal district court retains jurisdiction to determine whether a party has complied with the terms of a conditional order in a habeas case.a state failure to timely cure the error identified by a federal district court in its conditional habeas order justifies the release of the petitioner.satterlee wolfenbarger,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,internal citations omitted vacating petitioner conviction,aff in part,cir.see also renico,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.march,denying writ even though the state failed to comply with the precise terms of the district court conditions because the state had substantially complied with the conditions.on the other hand,when a state meets the terms of the habeas court condition,thereby avoiding the writ actual issuance,the habeas court does not retain any further jurisdiction over the matter.pitchess davis,d per curiam noting n either rule b,nor the two read together,permit a federal habeas court to maintain a continuing supervision over a retrial conducted pursuant to a conditional writ granted by the habeas court.
as gentry had been released from prison prior to the district court order,the commonwealth obviously had no duty under the district court order to take any action with respect to her person.however,gentry status as a convicted felon apparently remained in force,as the commonwealth did not nullify her conviction,and thus her january motion reasonably asked the court to enforce its order by making the conditional writ absolute.therefore,we find that the district court retained jurisdiction to enforce its conditional grant of a writ of habeas corpus.
next,the commonwealth argues that gentry january motion was moot because the essential object of the conditional habeas of the person of the already been met,claiming 
the condition for granting the writ occurred and gentry,who had already completed service of her sentence,was entitled to be released from custody.the district court judgment did not void or otherwise vacate the state court judgment of conviction nor did it place any other duty or condition on the commonwealth.
appellant br.at.thus,the commonwealth argues,once the condition occurred and gentry was released from custody there ceased to be a case in sic controversy.ibid.this simply misstates the law respecting habeas relief,for it muddies the clear distinction between a habeas petition challenging a conviction,and one challenging the particularities of sentencing.
article iii,section of the united states constitution authorizes the federal judiciary only to hear cases or controversies,and therefore federal courts may not exercise jurisdiction when the controversy has been mooted,that is to say,when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.los angeles county davis,d quoting powell mccormack,d.see also stewart blackwell,cir.although the supreme court had seemed to limit habeas relief to the body of the petitioner in fay noia,d,a stance that was in line with the writ historical function of releasing prisoners from incarceration,the court subsequently expanded the writ scope in carafas lavallee,d,stating that the petitioner challenge was not mooted by his release from incarceration prior to his hearing because,in consequence of his conviction,he can not engage in certain businesses he can not serve as an official of a labor union for a specified period of time he can not vote in any election held in new york state he can not serve as a juror.ibid.therefore,o n account of these collateral consequences,the case is not moot.id.at.the court reached a similar decision a few weeks later in sibron new york,d,in which the petitioner had been released prior to argument in the state intermediate appellate court.therefore the supreme court has found that the appropriate remedy for a writ of habeas corpus issued pursuant to an unlawful criminal conviction includes relief not only from the conviction direct consequences incarceration,but also from its collateral consequences.id.at.
we have followed this precedent,as we must.in abela martin,cir,we held,in part,that a petitioner release from custody and the subsequent conclusion of his parole term,after the filing of his habeas petition challenging his conviction,do not render moot his appeal from the district court denial of the petition because of the continuing collateral consequences to a wrongful criminal conviction.ibid.citing spencer kemna,d.similarly,in brewer dahlberg,cir,we held that a petitioner challenge to his parole status,rather than a challenge to a parole revocation and consequent incarceration for parole violation,meant that his case was not rendered moot simply because he was no longer imprisoned for his parole revocation.in green arn,cir,we concluded that a habeas petition was not mooted by the petitioner release from prison prior to the court determination,for the petitioner could still face significant collateral consequences flow ing from a criminal conviction.see also stotts perini,ohio misc,cir petitioner action is not mooted by his release from custody,because disabilities may still result from the conviction which he is attacking.
the commonwealth mistakenly relies on a line of decisions that addresses habeas petitions attacking the sentence rather than the conviction.habeas petitions challenging the conditions of confinement are almost necessarily moot,for courts normally can not offer any habeas redress in such circumstances.as the spencer court noted 
once the convict sentence has expired,however,some concrete and continuing injury other than the incarceration or collateral consequence of the exist if the suit is to be maintained.in recent decades,we have been willing to presume that a wrongful criminal conviction has continuing collateral consequences or,what is effectively the same,to count collateral consequences that are remote and unlikely to occur.
spencer kemna,at.citations omitted.the court in lane williams,d,found moot the habeas petitions of defendants who had pled guilty to a felony pursuant to a plea agreement.the petitioners in that case challenged their incarceration for parole violation after they had served their sentences,and they alleged that they had been unaware that their plea bargains had included a term of parole.the district court granted them specific performance of their plea agreement by declaring void the mandatory parole terms.the supreme court then held that their petition was moot because they had been released during the petition pendency,and because their petition attacked only their sentences.id.at.see also parker ellis,d.in diaz kinkela,cir,the petitioner,while serving a prison sentence for a matter unrelated to his later petition,was convicted by the parole board for felonious assault and possessing a dangerous weapon while in detention,and his term of incarceration was increased by days under ohio bad acts statute.the petitioner challenged that bad acts conviction and his additional sentence,but,before the district court could hear his case,he was released from prison,and ohio supreme court found the bad acts statute to be unconstitutional.id.at.the district court thereafter denied his petition,and we affirmed,because the challenged conviction had already been nullified,and the court found moot his sole surviving challenge to the additional days of imprisonment because he had long since been released from prison.id.at.
with respect to injury,an essential element of a live controversy,the law does not require a habeas petitioner to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she may face collateral consequences of her unconstitutional felony conviction,for the disabilities consequent to a felony conviction are legion,and patently obvious in many cases.indeed,as we have already noted,the supreme court has acknowledged that it has allowed federal courts to presume the existence of collateral consequences in recent decades.spencer,at.moreover,in the case before us,the petitioner has pointed to kentucky statutes that,on their face and as a matter of law,strip her,as a felon,of certain rights and privileges,including,inter alia,the right to vote and certain driving privileges.see.const.stripping felons of the right to vote.const.restricting felons from holding public office.ann.e disallowing felons from serving on juries.ann.disallowing felons from possessing firearms.ann.revoking driver license pending alcohol treatment program.ann.making felons eligible for persistent felony offender charges.there are also collateral consequences of a felony conviction under federal law of which we take judicial notice.see,g disallowing felons from possessing firearms.therefore,to the extent that she was required to make a minimal showing of possible collateral consequences of her unconstitutional criminal conviction,gentry has done so.
the instant petitioner raised a live and viable challenge to her felony conviction.abela,spencer,and the entire line of decisions dating back to carafas,thus control this case.as such,the law obligates us to hold that ge
