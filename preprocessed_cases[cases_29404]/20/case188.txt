these require us to explore poorly understood terrain the modern configuration and use of the ancient writ of error coram nobis.this archeological dig entails a determination of when and under what circumstances that writ may be used by a criminal defendant as a vehicle for securing relief.
the context is as follows.the petitioner,alfred trenkler,is a prison inmate,currently serving a federal sentence.he confronted the district court with a claim that more than ten years earlier it had illegally sentenced him to life imprisonment.persuaded by this claim,the district court granted a writ of error coram nobis,vacated the original sentence,and proceeded to resentence the petitioner to a term of years.the government protests this deployment of the writ,contending that the district court lacked jurisdiction to issue it.the petitioner,maintaining that even the substituted sentence exceeded the maximum available under the statutes of conviction.
after first grappling with a series of threshold challenges to our appellate jurisdiction,we conclude that the district court had no authority to issue a writ of error coram nobis.consequently,we reverse the order granting the writ and direct the district court to reinstate the original sentence 
background 
we rehearse here only those facts that are needed to place these into perspective.we urge the reader who hungers for more exegetic detail to consult our earlier opinions describing the various way stations that dot the trail of the petitioner case.see,trenkler united states trenkler iii,cir affirming denial of relief under united states trenkler trenkler ii,wl cir,affirming denial of rule motion united states trenkler trenkler i,cir affirming conviction and sentence on direct review see also trenkler pugh trenkler iv.cir upholding denial of relief under.
on november,a jury convicted the petitioner of conspiracy,and the illegal receipt and use of explosives,id.d,i.the charges arose out of the petitioner role in a bombing that caused the death of one boston police officer and the maiming of another.see trenkler i,at.the district court sentenced the petitioner to months imprisonment on the conspiracy count and life imprisonment on each of the two explosives counts.all of the sentences were to run concurrently.
on the date that the indictment was handed up,both sections d and i provided in pertinent part that 
if death results to any person,including any public safety officer performing duties as a direct or proximate result of conduct prohibited by this subsection,the defendant shall also be subject to imprisonment for any term of years,or to the death penalty or to life imprisonment as provided in section of this title.
section provided in turn that when any of the proscribed acts resulted in the death of any person,the death penalty or life imprisonment would be available as a punishment if the jury shall in its discretion so direct.notwithstanding this language,no special jury finding was either requested or obtained in the petitioner case.indeed,the anomaly went unremarked.
following the imposition of sentence,the petitioner appealed.his appeal challenged a number of evidentiary rulings.see trenkler i,at.we rejected all but one of these challenges,found that the successful challenge embodied a harmless error,and affirmed the judgment below.id.
the next ten years witnessed a kaleidoscopic array of proceedings.on december,the petitioner moved for a new trial or in the alternative an evidentiary hearing on the ground of newly discovered evidence.agreeing that the proffered evidence was not newly discovered,we affirmed the district court denial of the motion.trenkler ii,wl,at.the district court and this court subsequently rejected as an application,brought under,that alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.see trenkler iii,at.the petitioner other efforts met a similar fate.see,trenkler iv.at.
on august,the petitioner sought a writ of mandamus in this court,claiming for the first time that d and i required specific jury authorization as a condition precedent to the imposition of a life sentence.we summarily rejected his foray,noting that it amounted to a second or successive section petition and,as such,ran afoul of the gatekeeping provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.
undeterred by this setback,the petitioner wrote to the original trial judge,making essentially the same argument.the district court appointed counsel and,on november,appointed counsel moved for the issuance of a writ of error coram nobis or in the alternative a writ of audita querela although the petitioner used the docket number of the original criminal case,the district court treated the filing as constituting a new civil action and assigned a new docket number to it.the court reasoned that coram nobis,like its habeas corpus counterpart,is civil in nature.
the court ordered the government to respond by january.that date came and went without any word from the government.acting sua sponte,the court extended the time for filing an opposition to february.it simultaneously warned that,should no opposition be filed within the extended period,it would decide the matter without the government participation.that deadline,too,expired without any action by the government.
on february,the district court granted a writ of error coram nobis.trenkler united states trenkler v,wl,at.the court asserted jurisdiction under the all writs act,and expressed the view that the writ was available in criminal proceedings to correct fundamental errors,as long as other remedies were unavailable.trenkler v,wl,at.it then explained why it thought that the petitioner claim warranted such extraordinary relief.
to begin,the court concluded that the express language of the statutes of conviction required a jury directive as a condition precedent to the imposition of a life sentence.id.at.it noted that the petitioner life sentence had been imposed in the absence of such a directive and was,therefore,illegal.id.this bevue warranted coram nobis relief because it was fundamental to the validity of the judgment,id.at,and coram nobis represented the only procedural mechanism that remained available to correct the sentence,id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court conceded that the time had expired for filing a section petition,see f,but suggested that the petitioner could not be faulted for failing to seek relief earlier since all court,the government,and the petitioner previous been caught by this sentencing limitation.see trenkler v,wl,at.
when all was said and done,the court vacated the petitioner two concurrent life sentences and set the criminal case down for resentencing on april.the day after the court order issued,the government moved for leave to file an opposition to the coram nobis petition,blaming its failure to respond in a timely manner on institutional inadvertence.the district court granted the government request.the government not only filed an opposition but also moved for reconsideration of the coram nobis order.see.e.in subsequent filings,it asserted among other things that the district court lacked jurisdiction to issue the writ because the petitioner request was merely a camouflaged section petition and,as such,was subject to aedpa limitations on second and successive habeas petitions.it also claimed that coram nobis relief was inappropriate because the petitioner was still in custody,because he had failed to establish a fundamental error in the criminal proceedings,and because he had failed to prove any good cause for not raising the alleged sentencing error at an earlier time.
on april,the district court,ruling from the bench,dismissed the government objections and reaffirmed the appropriateness of coram nobis relief.when the district court proceeded to the criminal case,the petitioner argued that the doctrine of apprendi new jersey,d,limited the length of an incarcerative sentence on the affected counts to ten years.the court rejected that argument and imposed concurrent sentences of years immurement on the two affected counts crediting the petitioner with time served to that point.
on april,the court entered an amended judgment in the criminal case,memorializing the new sentence.three days later,the court entered a final judgment in the separate coram nobis proceeding,memorializing the grant of the writ and the annulment of the original sentence.on april,the government appealed from the final judgment in the coram nobis proceeding and,the next day,appealed from the amended final judgment in the criminal case.on april,the petitioner filed notices of appeal in both the civil and criminal cases although these appeals were consolidated for briefing and argument in this court,we need look no further than the in the coram nobis proceeding.see supra note.
ii.analysis 
the focal point of our analysis is the government assertion that the district court lacked authority to issue a writ of error coram nobis.there is,however,a logically antecedent issue the petitioner suggestion that we have no jurisdiction to review the order granting coram nobis relief.we start there.
appellate jurisdiction.
the judgment in the coram nobis proceeding,on its face,seems final and appealable.it leaves nothing to be done but the execution of the judgment itself.catlin united states.united states metro.dist.comm n,cir.the petitioner demurs.in this regard,his most loudly bruited claim is that a grant of coram nobis constitutes an unreviewable act of judicial discretion.
the petitioner sole support for this proposition is fragmentary language from an obscure supreme court opinion,pickett heirs legerwood,pet.that case,which dates back to the early nineteenth century,involved a trial court issuance of what amounted to a writ of error coram nobis in an action for trespass and ejectment.the justices concluded that this interlocutory order could not be reviewed by the supreme court.id.at explaining that the remedy was not one of those remedies over which the court was given supervising power by law.
ordinarily,an inferior federal court is bound by the holdings of the supreme court.mccoy.inst.of,cir.here,however,it is doubtful that pickett heirs has any precedential force beyond its specific facts.the court there explicitly admonished that it was not called upon to decide whether the case before it was a case proper for the application of the coram nobis remedy.at.that very question lies at the heart of the instant matter,as the government contends that,in the circumstances of this case,aedpa gatekeeping provisions foreclose any resort to coram nobis.we therefore do not regard pickett heirs as contradicting the general proposition that coram nobis orders are appealable.
this conclusion is reinforced by modern appellate practice.a canvass of the decisional law reveals that,in the more recent cases,coram nobis orders routinely have been reviewed by federal appellate courts.see,united states sawyer,cir united states keane,cir.the supreme court itself has asserted appellate jurisdiction in a case like this one,that is,a case questioning the trial court power to issue a writ of error coram nobis.see united states morgan.and,finally,the federal rules of appellate procedure contemplate that coram nobis orders may be appealed as a matter of course.see fed.a c an appeal from an order granting or denying an application for a writ of error coram nobis is an appeal in a civil case for purposes of rule a.that rule has the force of law.see local union custom air,cir.
history furnishes a simple means for reconciling whatever conflict a jaundiced eye might perceive between the curious language in pickett heirs and modern appellate practice.coram nobis,in its present incarnation,bears little resemblance to the writ as it existed in the early nineteenth century.we briefly trace its evolution.
the writ of error coram nobis originated in england as an instrument used by trial courts to correct their own errors.see carlisle united states,d united states mayer.see also lafave et,criminal procedure c,at ed.for the most part,its use was confined to civil cases.see,lafave et,supra c,at lester orfield,the writ of error coram nobis in civil practice.but,in time the tectonic plates shifted and the utility of the writ expanded.it eventually grew beyond the correction of mistakes of fact and became flexible enough to reach fundamental legal errors.see morgan,at.mayer,at.see also wright,king klein,federal practice procedure,at ed.
as the writ of error coram nobis morphed to encompass more than exclusively factual mistakes,it also began to gain a foothold in the criminal docket.see sawyer,at.this transmogrification occurred in a leisurely fashion the writ was not readily deployed in state criminal cases until well after the supreme court decided pickett heirs.see abraham freedman,the writ of error coram nobis,temp,placing in the late nineteenth century the first criminal case of consequence in which the writ was successfully employed.the writ migration to criminal cases in the federal courts was even slower as late as,the supreme court pointedly left open the question of the writ availability in criminal cases.see mayer,at.not until was the legitimacy of the writ use in criminal cases confirmed by the court.see morgan,at.
we now have come full circle in the modern federal system,use of the writ of error coram nobis is confined to criminal cases.see id.at.see also.e abolishing the writ in civil cases.to complete this transformation,in criminal cases the writ has been seen more and more as a means to challenge errors.see,sawyer,at united states tucor int l,cir united states rankin,d.
viewed against this historical backdrop,whatever the pickett heirs court meant when it stated that it lacked supervising power over a grant of coram nobis relief,that statement is now an anachronism.nearly two hundred years of doctrinal development have sapped it of any contemporary vitality.
the petitioner has a fallback position.he asseverates that even if the grant or denial of a writ of error coram nobis is deemed reviewable,the government lacks statutory authority to appeal such an order.this asseveration has a certain superficial allure.after all,the government can mount an appeal in a criminal case only in accordance with some express statutory authorization.united states sanges.united states watson,cir united states horn,cir see wright,miller cooper,federal practice procedure,at ed.
close perscrutation discloses that the petitioner asseveration rests on a flimsy foundation the dubious proposition that a writ of error coram nobis is part of the warp and woof of a criminal proceeding,subject to this traditional limitation on government appeals.to support that proposition,he a snippet in which the morgan court characterized the writ of error coram nobis as a step in the criminal case and not,like habeas corpus where relief is sought in a separate case and record,the beginning of a separate civil proceeding.at.in our view,morgan footnote can not bear the heavy weight that the petitioner piles upon it.
as an initial matter,the import of the footnote is tenebrous the very next line of the footnote asserts that coram nobis is of the same general character as proceedings under.id.section proceedings,like classic petitions for habeas corpus,are generally treated as civil in nature.see heflin united states,d rogers united states,cir.
in all events,the reach of morgan footnote is more circumscribed than the petitioner suggests.as judge friendly observed when facing a similarly ambitious construction of the morgan footnote,the quoted language does not purport to dictate that coram nobis petitions must be treated as strictly criminal for purposes of appeal or otherwise.united states keogh,cir.rather,the morgan court was confronted with,and resolved,a much narrower problem whether the writ could be deployed to correct errors in criminal cases notwithstanding the promulgation of federal rule of civil procedure b which abolished coram nobis in suits of a civil nature.see morgan,at.judge friendly found no reason to think that,in affirmatively answering this narrow question,the morgan court intended to determine that coram nobis orders should be treated as criminal for all purposes.keogh,at.
like judge friendly,we decline to read the quoted snippet as extending beyond the question that the morgan court was endeavoring to answer.in taking this commonsense approach to morgan footnote,we join several other courts that have followed judge friendly lead.see,united states craig,cir united states cooper,cir united states balistrieri,cir see also fed.a c advisory committee notes.
of course,this leaves an unanswered question should coram nobis be treated as civil or criminal for purposes of appeal the answer to that question can not be gleaned by grasping at convenient labels.while the modern writ of error coram nobis is used in criminal cases,its character necessarily reflects the vestiges of its origins in civil litigation.accordingly,many courts have treated coram nobis as civil for a variety of purposes,such as the availability of discovery,see,balistrieri,at,and the temporal limits for filing notices of appeal,see,keogh,at.given the lessons of history,we are convinced that coram nobis proceedings are best seen as and.see craig,at mercado united states,cir.on this view,the denomination of the nature of a given petition calls for a functional analysis rather than for doctrinal rigidity.
we see no reason here to apply the more restrictive rules governing criminal appeals to the government appeal in a coram nobis proceeding even though that proceeding is ancillary to a criminal case.the traditional restrictions on the government right to appeal stem primarily from double jeopardy concerns.see kepner united states.such concerns are far less weighty when dealing with collateral challenges to criminal convictions.see wright,miller cooper,supra,at there is less need to restrict government appeal opportunities in proceedings that come after the formal prosecution.consequently,we hold that coram nobis proceedings are appealable as civil matters.thus the government,like any other party,may appeal the grant or denial of the writ as a final order under.see wright,miller cooper,supra,at positing by analogy to habeas corpus that the government should be allowed to appeal final disposition of coram nobis proceedings see also fed.a c.
the petitioner has one last arrow in his jurisdictional quiver.he contends that even if we find appellate jurisdiction in theory,the government appeal here is.once again,this contention derives from the morgan court cryptic characterization of coram nobis as a step in the criminal case.at.on that premise,the petitioner concludes that the government was subject to the filing deadline applicable to government appeals in criminal cases,fed.b b that the period ran from february,when the district court announced its decision to grant the writ and that,therefore,the government notice of appeal,filed in,was late.
this plaint is as insubstantial as a house built upon the shifting sands.the short answer to it is that the federal rules of appellate procedure explicitly provide that a n appeal from an order granting or denying an application for a writ of error coram nobis is an appeal in a civil case and,thus,is subject to a filing period.fed.a c see also fed.a b.this language was added to the appellate rules in to resolve a conflict in the courts of appeals regarding the time limits that applied to appeals from coram nobis orders.see fed.advisory committee notes.the amended rule controls here.accordingly,the government notice of appeal was timely even if,as the petitioner contends,the appeal period ran from february,
aedpa preclusion.
having confirmed the existence of appellate jurisdiction,we turn to the substance of the government appeal.distilled to its essence,the argument here is that the petition was a wolf in sheep clothing an unapproved second or successive section petition masquerading as a petition for a writ of error coram nobis.relatedly,the government insists that coram nobis is unavailable to a prisoner in federal custody.if these arguments are,the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petition.
the petitioner initial rejoinder is in the nature of a preemptive strike.he says that because the government failed to respond to his petition in a timeous fashion,it has waived or forfeited these arguments.this strike misfires for two reasons.
first,each of the government arguments goes to the district court jurisdiction.this is important because parties can not confer jurisdiction on a district court by sloth or acquiescence.see united states cotton,d puerto rico,cir horn,at.
second,these arguments were raised,albeit belatedly,in the district court.that court chose not to treat them as waived but,rather,seemingly rejected the government motion for reconsideration on the merits thus effectively rejecting the preclusion argument contained therein.the court made no comment about the timeliness vel non of the government proffer.where a trial court chooses to overlook the belated nature of a filing and adjudicate the tardy claim or defense on the merits,that claim or defense may be deemed preserved for purposes of appellate review.see santiago,cir.
this brings us to the framework for collateral review.the writ of habeas corpus historically has served as the principal vehicle for testing the legality of executive detentions.attempting to address practical problems that had arisen in the administration of the federal courts habeas corpus jurisdiction,united states hayman,congress enacted as a substitute for the traditional habeas remedy with respect to federal prisoners.see act of june,stat.this virtual habeas statute supplies a remedy that bears a strong family resemblance to the traditional writ of habeas corpus.the statute was intended to provide a federal prisoner with an exclusive means of challenging the validity of his conviction or sentence,save only in those few instances in which the statutory remedy proved inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.e.in this context,inadequate or ineffective requires an ex ante appraisal.taylor gilkey,cir collecting cases.
in,congress enacted aedpa.that statute imposed significant new constraints on proceedings under section some of these constraints were temporal for example,aedpa established a statute of limitations for filing a section petition.f.some of these constraints were numerical for example,aedpa required a federal prisoner who sought to prosecute a second or successive section petition to obtain,in the form of a certificate,from the court of appeals.id.h.by the terms of the statute,such a certificate will be made available only if the prisoner can show that the proposed second or successive petition is based either on newly discovered evidence or a new rule of constitutional law.id.we have interpreted this provision as stripping the district court of jurisdiction over a second or successive habeas petition unless and until the court of appeals has decreed that it may go forward.pratt united states,cir.
although section,as amended,provides a comprehensive remedial scheme for relief,that scheme perpetuates the savings clause contained in section e.moreover,the supreme court has made it pellucid that section does not preempt the entire array of writs authorized under the all writs act.see morgan,at.still,each attempted use of an extraordinary writ in connection with relief must be judged on its own merits.the strictures of section can not be sidestepped by the simple expedient of resorting to some more exotic writ.put bluntly,the all writs act is not a jujube.at most,it constitutes a residual source of authority to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by statute.bureau of corr.marshals,d.
we think it follows that when a section addresses a particular class of claims or issues,it is that statute,not the all writs act,that takes precedence.see id.the armamentarium of writs,including the writ of error coram nobis,is thus available only to fill whatever interstices exist in the remedial scheme made available to federal prisoners by way of section.see united states ayala.
this approach makes it essential for courts to plot,and then to patrol,the boundaries between section and the universe of old writs.otherwise,artful pleaders will tiptoe around those boundaries and frustrate congre
