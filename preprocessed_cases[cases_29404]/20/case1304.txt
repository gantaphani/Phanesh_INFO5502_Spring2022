janie cockrell,director of the texas department of criminal justice,institutional division the director,appeals the district court grant of the writ of habeas corpus to the petitioner,alberto valdez valdez.we hold that a full and fair hearing is not a prerequisite to the application of deferential scheme.therefore,we vacate and remand to the district court for an assessment of valdez claims applying the standards set forth in d and e.with respect to the director appeal of the district court evidentiary rulings,we affirm in part and vacate in part.
a texas jury found valdez guilty of the capital murder of police sergeant bock in may following the sentencing phase,the jury answered the two special issue questions in the affirmative,finding that the act had been deliberate and that valdez posed a future danger to society the court then imposed a sentence of death.valdez conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.see valdez state,en banc,cert.denied,valdez texas,d mem,d.
valdez filed a state habeas petition,raising legal issues.the state habeas court held a hearing in november of.at this hearing,valdez presented evidence of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim valdez theory was that if his trial counsel had investigated his background,they would have found significant evidence that valdez was mentally retarded,suffered abuse as a child at the hands of his father,and had behaved as a model prisoner during his previous periods of incarceration.valdez argued that had the jury heard such evidence there was a reasonable probability that the jury would have answered one of the special questions differently,sparing his life.after the presentation of witnesses,the hearing recessed to allow both parties to secure additional witnesses if necessary.
on a motion by the parties to close the proceeding,the state habeas court held a final hearing on the proposed findings.during that hearing,counsel for valdez and the state presented lengthy arguments as to those findings.one month later,the state habeas court issued findings of fact and law denying valdez relief.
the state habeas court held that valdez trial counsel was not deficient and that any deficiency did not prejudice valdez.the habeas court found that the trial counsel lack of investigation into valdez background was reasonable.school records,admitted into evidence during the hearing,indicated that valdez had a full scale of and had been classified as educable mentally retarded.the court found that the fact that valdez had dropped out of school did not put his counsel on notice to inquire into these school records because it found that it was common for hispanic males in the corpus christi,nueces county,texas area to drop out of school.with regard to a conviction in hockley county,trial counsel had received the penitentiary packet containing the conviction and judgment but had not requested the underlying pleadings.these pleadings contained a letter from his attorney in that case requesting a psychiatric evaluation of valdez,and the resulting evaluation,which would have also shown that valdez had a full scale of and was determined to be of borderline intelligence.the state habeas court concluded that the failure to request these pleadings did not fall beyond the professional standard of conduct for defense attorneys.moreover,the state habeas court found that the defendant had knowledge of this psychological testing and had not made it known to his attorneys.
as for the presentation of witnesses regarding valdez childhood background and other humanizing elements,the court also rejected the claim that counsel had been deficient.the habeas court found that valdez drug use,childhood abuse and hardship,creativity,artistic talent,kindliness towards family was known and available to the applicant at the time of trial.ex parte valdez,at dist,nueces county,unpublished.furthermore,the court found that evidence of kindness and family assistance was presented at the punishment phase by the testimony of applicant brother daniel valdez,mary jane barrientes,julie saldana,and maria saldana.id.in light of these facts,the habeas court concluded that the additional witness testimony offered during the habeas hearing on these matters would have been cumulative and the failure to present this evidence was a decision of trial strategy which was sound and reasonable as judged at the time of the trial.id.at.more generally,the state habeas court found that trial counsel exercised reasonable and sound judgment in deciding which individuals to present as punishment witnesses.id.at.finally,without specific findings of historical fact,the state habeas court concluded that trial counsel failure to present the mitigating evidence offered in the habeas hearing had not prejudiced valdez.the state habeas court reached no conclusion as to whether valdez was mentally retarded,noting that it rejected valdez eighth amendment claim without deciding the issue of valdez mental retardation.id.at.
based on these findings and conclusions,the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed the denial of habeas relief in a order.see ex parte valdez,application,unpublished order.the district court of nueces county set valdez execution for january.the united states district court for the eastern district of texas granted valdez a stay of execution and appointed counsel.
valdez then filed the instant petition in the united states district court for the southern district of texas and requested an evidentiary hearing.the district court granted valdez an evidentiary hearing with regard to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.it did so because it determined that valdez had not received a full and fair hearing before the state habeas court.because valdez had not received such a hearing,the district court concluded that,under townsend sain,d,an evidentiary hearing was mandatory 
the district court determined that the state habeas court denied valdez a full and fair hearing because the state habeas court lost the exhibits admitted into evidence during the hearing,and,as a result,excluded those exhibits from its resolution of valdez case.these lost exhibits included the results of intelligence tests conducted on valdez at age thirteen by the corpus christi school district the results of intelligence tests conducted on valdez at age eighteen by the big spring state hospital,and the accompanying psychiatric evaluation issued by the hospital and the fee applications submitted by carl lewis and david gutierrez,his trial counsel.the district court also found that it appear ed that other crucial evidence was excluded from proceedings,namely,the trial transcript,as the state habeas judge informed the parties at the hearing on the proposed findings that he had never read the record of the trial and that he did not intend to as he did not have the time.see order for evidentiary hr g,unpublished at.quoting state habeas hr g on proposed findings tr.at.consequently,according to the district court,the state habeas judge denied valdez petition without seeing evidence which might have been favorable to valdez,which the judge did not rule must be excluded,and which the judge even indicated had to be reviewed.valdez johnson,d.
the court found that the exclusion of exhibits also resulted in a failure to develop the state factual record,which valdez had not caused.hence,the district court concluded that e did not bar an evidentiary hearing moreover,as discussed above,townsend required an evidentiary hearing.alternatively,the district court found it had the discretion to order an evidentiary hearing under rule of the rules governing cases 
after the evidentiary hearing the district court granted habeas relief concluding that valdez attorneys were ineffective in their preparation for and presentation at sentencing.in reaching this conclusion,the district court reviewed valdez ineffective assistance of counsel claim de novo.the district court found that the deferential framework set forth at d and e largely d id not apply because it had held an evidentiary hearing to remedy the state denial of a full and fair hearing.valdez,d at.therefore,it applied the presumption of correctness only to the state habeas court specific findings of historical fact,namely it is common in the corpus christi,nueces county texas area for hispanic males to drop out of school t he fact that the applicant had dropped out of school did not put carl lewis on notice of any potential mental problem,if any and carl lewis failure to request the entire court jacket regarding the applicant burglary charge in hockley county did not fall below the professional standard of conduct for defense attorneys.see id.at quoting ex parte valdez,at dist,nueces county,march.the district court then applied a preponderance of the evidence standard to the remainder of the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing and assessed valdez ineffective assistance claim,a question of mixed law and fact,de novo.
the director appeals the district court grant of habeas relief on the grounds that the district court erred in finding that the state court denied valdez a full and fair hearing even if valdez was denied a full and fair hearing,such a hearing is not a prerequisite to the operation of the deference required under even under de novo review,valdez received effective assistance of counsel and the district court exceeded its remedial powers by directing the state to resentence valdez or to impose a sentence of less than death.additionally,the director appeals the district court exclusion of evidence offered by the director at the evidentiary hearing.
in reviewing a grant of the writ of habeas corpus,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.we review de novo the district court disposition of pure issues of law and mixed issues of law and fact.see barrientes johnson,cir bledsue johnson,cir.
the director disputes the district court finding that the state habeas court denied him a full and fair hearing,challenging both the legal conclusion and the conclusion factual underpinning.we need not address that dispute because we find that even if the state habeas court denied valdez such a hearing,a full and fair hearing is not a prerequisite to the operation of aedpa deferential scheme 
aedpa limits the power of federal courts to grant writs of habeas corpus to those instances in which the state court adjudication on the merits resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.under aedpa,clearly established federal law refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.terry williams taylor,d.we review questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact under the contrary to and unreasonable application prong of d.see clark johnson,cir nobles johnson,cir.
section d deference operates when the state court has adjudicated the petitioner claim on the merits.see d.an adjudication on the merits occurs when the state court resolves the case on substantive grounds,rather than procedural grounds.see mercadel cain,cir holding that whether an adjudication on the merits has occurred is whether the state court disposed of the case on substantive or procedural grounds fisher texas,cir finding that where a state habeas court decided the habeas applicant claim on procedural grounds,there had not been an adjudication on the merits.
in terry williams,at.at,the supreme court found that a state court adjudication falls under the unreasonable application prong when it unreasonably applies the law of th e supreme court to the facts of a prisoner case.the court held that the test for whether a state court has unreasonably applied clearly established federal law is an objective one,which it framed as 
stated simply,a federal habeas court making the unreasonable application inquiry should ask whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.the federal habeas court should not transform the inquiry into a subjective one by resting its determination instead on the simple fact that at least one of the nation jurists has applied the relevant federal law in the same manner the state court did in the habeas petitioner case.
id.at.at.thus,it is not enough that a single reasonable jurist may agree with the application 
while the court did not fully elucidate the meaning of unreasonable,it carefully distinguished an unreasonable application from an erroneous application of federal law.according to the supreme court,a state court erroneous or incorrect application per se is insufficient to allow issuance of the writ.id.at.at.the court stated 
under d unreasonable application clause,then,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.at.
thus,a state court application may be incorrect in our independent judgment and,yet,reasonable.see neal puckett,cir.in gardner johnson,cir,we explored the level of deference to be accorded a state court decision under this standard and found that we must reverse when we conclude that the state court decision applies the correct legal rule to a given set of facts in a manner that is so patently incorrect as to be unreasonable.
finally,aedpa requires us to presume state court findings of fact to be correct unless the petitioner rebuts that presumption by clear and convincing evidence.see e.
the district court found that the aedpa standards of review largely did not apply because it held an evidentiary hearing in order to consider evidence improperly excluded from consideration by the state habeas court.see valdez,d at.the district court applied a presumption of correctness only to the specific findings of fact made by the state habeas court,namely it is common for hispanic males in the corpus christi,nueces county,texas area to drop out of school the fact that valdez dropped out of school did not put trial counsel on notice of any potential mental problem and trial counsel failure to request the entire court jacket for the hockley county charge did not fall below standard of conduct for defense attorneys.id.at.it declined to review the state habeas court conclusions of mixed law and fact under d unreasonable application prong.additionally,it did not apply e presumption of correctness to those findings of fact implicit in the habeas court mixed law and fact conclusions thus,the district court selectively applied the presumption of correctness,and did not apply d standards 
the director asserts that while the district court had the discretion to hold an evidentiary hearing,the district court finding of the denial of a full and fair hearing and holding of a plenary hearing does not permit the district court to avoid the application of deference to the state court adjudication on the merits in response,valdez contends that a determination that a petitioner has received a full and fair hearing before the state court is a prerequisite to a finding that the state court reached an adjudication on the merits,and,thus,a prerequisite to the application of d deference as well as the presumption of correctness under e.we disagree with valdez contention and conclude that a full and fair hearing is not a prerequisite to the application of aedpa deferential framework.
prior to the aedpa amendments,d provided in relevant part 
a determination made by a state court evidenced by a written finding or other reliable and written indicia,shall be presumed to be correct,unless the applicant shall establish or it shall otherwise appear,or the respondent shall admit 
that the factfinding procedure employed by the state court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing 
that the applicant did not receive a full,fair,and adequate hearing in the state court proceeding.
d repealed.once a petitioner established one of the situations set forth under d,such as the denial of a full and fair hearing,the presumption no longer operated instead,the district court reviewed the claim de novo and reached its own independent factual determinations.see d repealed providing where one of the situations in d was not shown the burden shall rest upon the applicant to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the factual determination by the state court was erroneous salazar johnson,cir a federal court is to accord a presumption of correctness to findings of state court proceedings unless particular statutory exceptions to d are implicated.quoting williams collins,cir.thus,this presumption merely erect ed a starting place or presumption,that was to be examined in light of the state court record.moore johnson,cir.
apart from simply establishing a starting place,the presumption of correctness was of limited application and it was only source of deference to state court adjudications.the presumption applied only to findings of fact.see crane johnson,cir mason balcom,cir.it did not apply to mixed questions of law and fact nor did it apply to pure questions of law.see thompson keohane,d holding that questions with a uniquely legal dimension were outside d presumption of correctness.under the now repealed version of,we reviewed such questions de novo,granting no deference to state court adjudications.see,muniz johnson,cir reviewing questions of law de novo lee,at finding that the district court was under no constraint to defer to the state court conclusions as to mixed questions of law and fact.
in,congress enacted aedpa,stat,amending.these amendments jettisoned all references to a full and fair hearing from the presumption of correctness accorded state court findings of fact,along with the other situations which previously swept aside the presumption.the presumption of correctness erected in its place at e,now simply provides that unless the petitioner can rebut the findings of fact through clear and convincing evidence,those findings of fact are presumed to be correct to reintroduce a full and fair hearing requirement that would displace the application of e presumption would have the untenable result of rendering the amendments enacted by congress a nullity.see,am.red cross,d a change in statutory language is to be read,if possible,to have some effect.
furthermore,as discussed above,aedpa put into place a deferential scheme,under which we must defer to a state court adjudication on the merits.see d in the prefatory paragraph to d and d,the statute provides that an application for a writ of habeas corpus shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.the word shall is mandatory in meaning.see,in re armstrong,cir city of dallas,fcc,cir.thus,we lack discretion as to the operation of this section.see lopez davis,d escondido mut.water la jolla band of mission indians,d.the use of any makes clear that this section applies to all cases adjudicated on their merits in state court.the term adjudication on the merits,like its predecessor resolution on the merits,refers solely to whether the state court reached a conclusion as to the substantive matter of a claim,as opposed to disposing of the matter for procedural reasons.see neal puckett,cir mercadel,at cir.it does not speak to the quality of the process.see green johnson,cir rejecting contention that the resolution on the merits prerequisite is a proxy for the quality of the legal process resolving a dispute murphy johnson,cir applying green to adjudication on the merits.this mandatory and language combined with the meaning of adjudication on the merits leaves no room for judicial imposition of a full and fair hearing prerequisite.
moreover,casting aside aedpa standards of review in the fashion urged by valdez has another untenable result.valdez asks us to inject a full and fair hearing as a prerequisite to the new deferential scheme applied to conclusions of law and mixed law and fact,which congress put in place of our de novo review.in asking us to read the statute in this manner,valdez would have us ignore the fact that congress has excised this prerequisite from presumption of correctness,and apply it to a deferential scheme which did not exist prior to aedpa.the plain meaning of the text simply will not bear such a reading.therefore,we hold that a full and fair hearing is not a precondition to according e presumption of correctness to state habeas court findings of fact nor to applying d standards of review 
in response,valdez attempts to undercut this statutory interpretation with three contentions.first,valdez contends that this reading of the statute renders an evidentiary hearing in cases like his a useless exercise.second,valdez asserts that this holding overrules our circuit precedent.third,he urges us to adopt the approach taken by the tenth circuit.
first,valdez asserts that our view of the statute renders impotent an evidentiary hearing held where the petitioner received an adjudication on the merits after a state hearing that was less than full and fair.we disagree.where a district court elects,in instances not barred by e,to hold an evidentiary hearing,the hearing may assist the district court in ascertaining whether the state court reached an unreasonable determination under either d or d.an evidentiary hearing is not an exercise in futility just because d and e require deference.
second,valdez maintains that we have elsewhere held that a full and fair hearing is a prerequisite to a determination that a state court has adjudicated a habeas applicant petition on the merits.in support of this contention,valdez directs us to morris cain,cir singleton johnson,cir and hughes johnson,cir.valdez is correct that we stated in morris that a full and fair adjudication of a petitioner claims in state court is a prerequisite for the application of aedpa standards of review.see at.additionally,we used similar language in corwin johnson,cir in this circuit,provided the state court conducted a full and fair adjudication of the petitioner claims,pure questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed under d.
to the extent that these references to a full and fair adjudication refer to a full and fair state court hearing,they were dicta.neither in morris nor in corwin were we confronted with a claim that the petitioner had been denied a full and fair hearing.see morris,at in this appeal,the petitioner argues that the state court unreasonable instruction led to his conviction under a standard contrary to settled federal law corwin,at corwin argues that all state court determinations of federal constitutional issues in habeas proceedings should be subject to de novo review by the federal courts.in nobles johnson,cir,on which morris relies for the full and fair adjudication proposition,we evinced concern that the state court had not adequately adjudicated the petitioner claim.while we stated our concern,we resolved the petitioner claim on other grounds and did not delve further into the possible import of the way in which the state habeas court adjudicated the petitioner claim 
apart from being dicta,these references also appear to conflate the adjudication on the merits requirement with a full and fair hearing requirement,referring to the adjudication on the merits as a full and fair adjudication on the merits.morris,at corwin,at.where we have conducted an examination of whether an adjudication on the merits occurred,we have looked at whether the state court reached the merits of the petitioner claim rather than deciding it on procedural grounds.see murphy,at finding that there was an adjudication on the merits because the state court reached the merits of the petitioner claim fisher,at concluding a state court denial of relief on waiver grounds constituted a procedural,rather than a substantive,resolution of the case,and as such was not an adjudication on the merits.in short,we find that morris and corwin give us no guidance as to whether a full and fair hearing is a precondition to the operation of the aedpa standards of review.
furthermore,valdez reliance on hughes is misplaced.in hughes,we did not address the applicability of the aedpa standards where a full and fair hearing had been denied.instead,we addressed solely the question of whether hughes was entitled to an evidentiary hearing.see at.thus,hughes offers valdez no support.
valdez reliance on singleton is likewise misplaced.in singleton,the trial court granted the petitioner habeas relief in part and,in so doing,issued findings of fact.the texas court of criminal appeals reversed and denied singleton relief without issuing an opinion.see at.concluding that there were no findings of fact to which the presumption of correctness could attach,we remanded the case to the district court for a de novo evidentiary hearing.see id.at.while we found that singleton was entitled to a full and fair evidentiary hearing,we did not pass upon the question as to whether the absence of such a hearing precluded the operation of d.id.more importantly,we rejected singleton assertion that in the absence of any factual findings,the texas court of criminal appeals had not reached an adjudication on the merits,rendering d inoperative.see id.at.in doing so,we implied that d applied to such a summary disposition,even where the petitioner was entitled to an evidentiary hearing.therefore,as with morris and hughes,we find that singleton offers valdez no support.
third,valdez urges us to adopt the approach of the tenth circuit.in miller champion,cir,the state habeas court denied the petitioner relief on the merits of his claim without an evidentiary hearing.see id.at.our sister circuit found that in the absence of a state hearing the petitioner was entitled to a federal evidentiary hearing.see id.more importantly,the tenth circuit concluded that the district court should not afford aedpa deference to the state court mixed law and fact conclusions.see id.at.for this conclusion,the court rested solely on nguyen reynolds,cir.see miller,at.the nguyen court,however,did not apply aedpa to the petitioner claims because he had filed before the act effective date,rendering aedpa standards inapplicable.see nguyen,at.thus,in reaching its conclusion,the tenth circuit did not ground its decision on a reading of the statute,but in reliance on a case applying.because of the rather tenuous footing of the tenth circuit decision,we decline to adopt its approach.
instead,our interpretation is in step with the fourth circuit view of aedpa deference.in an en banc decision,the fourth circuit recently rejected its prior decision in cardwell greene,which had adopted an approach akin to miller.see bell jarvis.in cardwell,like miller,the state court summarily denied the petitioner request for relief without an evidentiary hearing.see cardwell,at.the fourth circuit found that the failure to develop the claim occurred through no fault of the petitioner,and,thus,e did not bar an evidentiary hearing.see id.at.while the summary disposition qualified as an adjudication on the merits,see id.at,the court concluded that the absence of an articulated rationale rendered the difference between de novo review and reasonableness review insignificant.id.at,quoting cardwell netherland.the fourth circuit rejected cardwell treatment of aedpa standards of review to the extent that cardwell requires federal habeas courts to conduct a de novo or effectively de novo review of a summary state court decision,or to grant habeas relief based upon an independent determination that the state court has violated the constitutional rights of the petitioner.bell,at.in reaching this conclusion,the fourth circuit relied on the supreme court recent elucidation of the aedpa standards in terry williams.the court concluded that,in terry williams,the supreme court has made it clear that de novo,independent,or plenary review of state court adjudications is no longer appropriate,that there are indeed important distinctions between the reasonableness review called for by the aedpa and the de novo review.bell,at 
admittedly,the focus of the bell court was the summary nature of the state court disposition,not that the state court denied bell an evidentiary hearing.nevertheless,the absence of a hearing is precisely a situation under our law where we would have found that the state court denied the petitioner a full and fair hearing,potentially making a federal evidentiary hearing mandatory.see,austin mckaskle,cir finding the denial of a full and fair hearing where no state evidentiary hearing was held.likewise,the fourth circuit,would have found this to be the denial of a full and fair hearing.see,bacon lee,cir applying law and finding that in the absence of hearing,the petitioner had not received a full and fair hearing.in spite of what would have been the denial of a full and fair hearing,the fourth circuit found that the aedpa standards applied,implying that there is no full and fair hearing requirement under aedpa.moreover,the fourth circuit reasoning is sweeping,finding that aedpa standards of review apply whenever there has been an adjudication on the merits.
in sum,we conclude the district court erred in determining that,where there had been a denial of a full and fair hearing,aedpa deferential framework,as set out in d and e,did not apply to a state court adjudication on the merits.
valdez contends the aedpa standards of review still should not apply because the state did not produce the missing exhibits in accordance with f in making this argument,valdez does not assert that the absence of any particular exhibit rendered impossible the district court review of the state habeas court determination of a specific factual issue instead,valdez contention is a blanket one that the aedpa standards of review should not operate because the state could not produce the exhibits we find valdez f argument unavailing.
first,in reviewing a claim under this section,we look to whether this inability to produce the exhibits resulted from some deleterious or improper conduct.baker estelle,cir rejecting petitioner argument that his sufficiency of the evidence claim should be resolved in his favor because the state was unable to produce a trial transcript where there had been no deleterious or improper conduct by the state the absence or loss of the pertinent portions of the record alone is insufficient to support a finding of a deleterious or improper conduct.see id.valdez has not alleged that the state court loss of the exhibits during the six year period between the evidentiary hearing and the close of that hearing upon the motion of the parties occurred because of the state court misconduct.nor does the record disclose any such misconduct.in discussing the misplacement of the exhibits,this exchange occurred 
the court okay.i have gone through the four files and i did not find the exhibits.if i ca find them,you have copies.
levinger we can resubmit.
the court i am going to have somebody look into,see if we have the actual exhibits.there was another court reporter that i had.i do know if she placed them somewhere else,but if i do find them,i am going to ask you to submit copies,if you will.
state habeas hr g on proposed findings at.given the delay between the evidentiary hearing and the hearing on proposed findings in this case,and the absence of any assertion of misconduct,we can not say that the failure to locate the exhibits was an egregious breach of the court duty.walker maggio,finding that the state inability to locate the transcript after eight years was not an egregious breach of duty and applying the presumption of correctness.
second,where there is another means of adducing the requisite information for the purposes of the district court review,the standards remain applicable.see id.at holding that the presumption of correctness still applied where the state court had held an evidentiary hearing as a means of reproducing the evidence and record produced from this hearing allowed the habeas court to review the claim pruitt hutto,cir holding that while the state record was ordinarily indispensable to federal review,the state was not required to do the impossible and produce the transcript,where the district court had adequate information before it to assess the petitioner claim see also rideau whitley,cir finding that the state could not establish prejudice warranting dismissal of habeas claim where exhibits were lost because oral testimony in the state hearing adequately described the exhibits for the purposes of federal review.our inquiry,therefore,focuses on whether the federal district court had the necessary materials with which to review the state court proceedings.
the district court had before it the following exhibits the corpus christi school records the affidavit of cohorn and the big spring hospital psychiatric evaluation the hockley county conviction packet and underlying pleadings the big spring hospital psychiatric evaluation proved up by the records keeper lewis fee application gutierrez fee application price curriculum vitae the american bar association guidelines for the appointment and performance of counsel in death penalty cases,february.thus,the district court had before it what were exhibits,and in the state habeas proceeding these exhibits form the basis for valdez central he is mildly mentally retarded and that had his counsel performed some investigation they would have learned about his limited before the district court those exhibits essential to its review of the state court decision.
the exhibits that the federal district court lacked were the letters written and sent by valdez to family members while he was incarcerated,exhibits,and at the state habeas hearing handkerchiefs with artwork added by valdez and which he sent to his family members,while he was incarcerated,exhibits and at the state habeas hearing the records from the nueces county jail from valdez incarceration there during his trial,including his request slips to use the library,exhibit at the state habeas hearing.see supra note.while the federal district court was without these exhibits,the state habeas record below contained sufficient descriptions of the remaining missing exhibits to inform the district court of their probative value.see supra note.finding neither misconduct by the state court nor that the district court lacked the necessary evidence with which to reach a disposition of valdez claims,we conclude that the state inability to produce the missing exhibits did not permit the district court to review valdez claims de novo.
because we find that the district court erred in its failure to apply deferential framework,we decline to address the merits of valdez claims for habeas relief.instead,we vacate the district court grant of the writ of habeas corpus and remand to the district court for assessment of valdez claims under standards set forth above.furthermore,because we vacate the grant of the writ,we need not reach the director contentions regarding the proper scope of the writ.
finally,the director contends that the district court abused its discretion by limiting the director introduction of evidence to that which the state presented in the state habeas proceeding.specifically,the director points to the exclusion of a report by deborah mayer detailing valdez extensive and violent juvenile history an affidavit by cohorn intelligence test scores from valdez incarceration in the texas youth commission results of a mental status examination by otero evidence that valdez passed an eighth grade equivalency test in and a ged test report showing that valdez passed four out of the test five sections.
we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.see united states merida,cir.a trial judge sitting without a jury is entitled to greater latitude in the admission or exclusion of evidence.gabriel city of plano,cir quoting pacific trans.chabert,cir.an erroneous evidentiary ruling merits the reversal of judgment only where the challenged ruling affects a substantial right of a party.id.quoting johnson ford motor,cir see caparotta entergy,cir.
first,the district court excluded the report of deborah mayer,a probation counselor,because the director did not show that it was available in or in at the state habeas hearing.moreover,the district court found that the report contained hearsay.we find that the district court properly excluded the report as it was rife with hearsay.see.nor did the district court err in precluding the director from using the report as a prior inconsistent statement as the report did not attribute the statements to any specific individuals.additionally,contrary to the director contention that he was not allowed to question witnesses regarding the report,the district court allowed the director to question witnesses regarding their awareness of the document.the district court merely precluded the director from reading aloud hearsay statements contained within the report and asking if the statements surprised the witness.
second,the district court excluded the affidavit of cohorn because it contradicted the live testimony of randall price offered at the hearing.the district court concluded that an affidavit was an inappropriate vehicle for adducing controverted evidence,and exercised its discretion under to exclude the affidavit the district court also noted the availability of cohorn as a live witness.the director asserts that it sought to use this affidavit to clarify cohorn prior affidavit,which was introduced into evidence at both the state habeas hearing and the federal evidentiary hearing.the director maintains that this prior affidavit resulted in the mistaken implication that valdez was diagnosed as mildly retarded in competence testing by cohorn.
on an application for a writ of habeas corpus,the district court has the discretion to receive evidence via affidavits.see loper ellis,cir.the introduction of affidavits into evidence is subject to the right of the opponent to the affiants by written interrogatories.loper,at.the director attempted to introduce this new affidavit at the federal hearing without affording valdez time to propound interrogatories in response.the director did so when cohorn was available to testify as a live witness.the district court instructed the director that it would accept cohorn live testimony,but the director declined to present him at the hearing.in light of cohorn availability and the lack of notice given to valdez,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit cohorn affidavit.
the district court found that the state failure to produce or offer into evidence the remaining pieces of evidence noted above at trial or at the state habeas hearing established a presumption that the documents would not have been available at trial.the district court excluded these four exhibits as irrelevant because the director failed to offer evidence to rebut that presumption.we find that the district court abused its discretion in doing so.
evidence is relevant so long as it tends to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of an action more probable that it would be without the evidence.the results of the wechsler adult intelligence scale test administered while valdez was incarcerated with the texas youth commission show that he had a verbal of,a performance of,and a full scale of,which are scores above the classification of mental retardation.during that same period of incarceration,rafael otero examined valdez and concluded that valdez was not mentally deficient.in,valdez passed an eighth grade equivalency test and four out of five sections of the ged.these results also tend to undercut valdez assertion that he is mentally retarded.thus,these test results and the report by otero tend to contravene valdez contention that he is mentally retarded,which bears on whether his trial counsel performance prejudiced him.
assuming arguendo that the relevance of these four records is contingent on establishing that they were available at trial,the presumption on which the district court based its ruling fails.the district court assumed that had the records been available to the state,the state would have presented the records at the state habeas hearing.based on this assumption,the district court concluded that the records were not available at the time of trial,absent a showing to the contrary by the director.while this inference is not illogical,it is nevertheless belied by the fact that these four documents existed prior to valdez trial and habeas hearing.the director authenticated these records via offers of affidavits by the records custodians,which substantiates their dates of creation.therefore,the district court abused its discretion in excluding the texas youth commission intelligence test,otero report,the eighth grade equivalency exam,and valdez results on the ged.the exclusion of this evidence undermined the director ability to contest valdez contention that he was prejudiced by his counsel performance.thus,we find that the exclusion of these records affected the director substantial rights because we can not be certain that the error had a slight effect on the disposition of the case.tanner westbrook,cir.on remand,the district court must admit these records and consider them in reaching its disposition of valdez claims.
in sum,we hold that a full and fair hearing is not a prerequisite to the application of deferential scheme.therefore,we vacate and remand to the district court for an assessment of valdez claims applying the standards set forth in d and e.with respect to the district court evidentiary rulings,we affirm in part and vacate in part.
director cockrell asserts that the plenary hearing held by the district court in response to its finding that the state habeas court denied valdez a full and fair hearing did not excuse the application of aedpa deference to the state court adjudication on the merits.under this view,which the majority opinion embraces,the absence of a full and fair hearing in state court would entitle a petitioner to an evidentiary hearing before the federal district court,but the district court would nevertheless be required,pursuant to the aedpa,to extend deference to the suspect determinations of the state court.in his brief,valdez responds as follows 
i t would make little sense to require a federal district court to conduct its own evidentiary hearing because of material deficiencies in the state court proceeding,yet at the same time require the district court to disregard the fully developed evidence presented in its own court and instead defer to the decision of the state court made on an incomplete record 
the simple and compelling logic underlying this response finds ample support in fifth circuit and supreme court precedent,as well as in the writings of leading habeas corpus scholars.therefore,i respectfully dissent.
i.the state court denied valdez a full and fair hearing 
concluding that he had not received a full and fair hearing at the state habeas level,the federal district court granted valdez an evidentiary hearing on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the district court based its conclusion on both a finding that the state habeas court lost,and therefore did not consider,certain exhibits admitted into evidence during the hearing and the state habeas court failure to read the trial transcript.one need only examine the latter ground to determine that the state court did indeed deny valdez a full and fair hearing.
in dobbs zant the supreme court emphasized the importance of reviewing capital sentences on a complete record.accordingly,this court has recognized that meaningful federal habeas review requires a trial transcript and familiarity with the trial and sentencing proceedings is no less indispensable to the state habeas court in reaching its resolution on the merits.in the present case,the state habeas judge did not preside over valdez criminal trial.consequently,he lacked the advantage of a personal recollection of the trial proceedings nevertheless,at a hearing on valdez petition,the state habeas judge stated i have never read the record of the trial and i do intend to.i do have the time.although the director contends that it was never shown that the judge did not read the record during the period between the hearing and the issuance of the order denying valdez habeas petition,the director offers no evidence that he did.thus,the district court was reasonable in its conclusion that the state habeas judge did not read the trial transcript.
the director asserts that even if the state habeas court did not read the trial transcript,this failure did not deny valdez a full and fair hearing because valdez counsel sufficiently informed the court of the trial proceedings by directing the court attention to relevant portions of the record and quoting it at length in the habeas petition.but discrete references to the record made at various stages of the state habeas proceeding do not provide a complete picture of what took place at trial.in flanagan henderson we found that a federal district court erred in denying habeas relief without holding an evidentiary hearing where there was no trial transcript to provide the factual basis necessary for the resolution of the petitioner due process and ineffective assistance of counsel claims the state record contained only pleadings,minute entries by the state district court clerk,various orders entered by the state trial judge and a series of abbreviated excerpts from the court reporter notes which relate to the bills of exception assigned during pre and post trial proceedings and during the trial itself.addressing the adequacy of this record,we stated 
it well may be that the entire record transcript of the state trial is still available and that it alone will afford a fact finding procedure which is adequate to afford a full and fair hearing.however,no such transcript is now a part of the record in this cause and no fair appraisal of the reliability of the resolutions of those fact issues which have been developed by the petition can be made from the bits and pieces of the trial transcript which formed the record examined by the court below.such a record is inadequate 
if a record tailored from fragments of material generated by the state trial court is insufficient for us to decide an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,it is likewise inadequate for a state habeas court lacking knowledge of the trial proceedings.the conclusion is therefore inescapable that the state habeas judge decision not to read the trial transcript denied valdez a full and fair hearing.
ii.a full and fair hearing is a prerequisite to aedpa deference 
the district court found that the aedpa standards of review largely do not apply since this court has held an evidentiary hearing in order to consider evidence improperly excluded from consideration by the state habeas court.thus,the district court addressed the ultimate conclusion regarding ineffective assistance of counsel without the presumption that the state court conclusion was correct.in support of the court finding,valdez asserts that law governs the consequences that arise when a federal evidentiary hearing is mandatory because the state court failed to conduct a full and fair hearing.this case therefore requires an understanding of law.
in the case of brown allen the supreme court decided when a federal habeas corpus court is to hold its own hearing on a constitutional claim.roughly speaking,the court concluded that if there were unusual circumstances or a vital flaw in the state court process,a federal hearing was required but even in the absence of a defect,the district court remained free,in the exercise of its discretion,to take testimony as to the facts 
because the brown opinion did not define unusual circumstances or vital flaw,and because the lower federal courts were reaching inconsistent results,the supreme court sought to clarify matters in the case of townsend sain the court unanimously held that whenever a habeas applicant alleges facts that,if proved,would entitle him to relief,the federal court may receive evidence and try the facts anew.the court was likewise unanimous in stating that independent factfinding is mandatory if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court,either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding.a majority of the court proceeded to list six circumstances in which a federal evidentiary hearing was mandatory.these were 
the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state hearing the state factual determination is not fairly supported by the record as a whole the procedure employed by the state court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing there is a substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence the material facts were not adequately developed at the hearing or for any reason it appears that the state trier of fact did not afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact hearing 
the court also repeated in townsend that the district court has the discretion to conduct a hearing in any case,even when none of the above criteria is met 
in,congress enacted the former d,which provided 
in any proceeding instituted in a federal court by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court,a determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue,made by a state court of competent jurisdiction in a proceeding to which the applicant for the writ and the state or an officer or agent thereof were parties,evidenced by a written finding,written opinion,or other reliable and adequate written indicia,shall be presumed to be correct,unless the applicant shall establish or it shall otherwise appear,or the respondent shall admit 
that the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state court hearing 
that the factfinding procedure employed by the state court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing 
that the material facts were not adequately developed at the state court hearing 
that the state court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter or over the person of the applicant in the state court proceeding 
that the applicant was an indigent and the state court,in deprivation of his constitutional right,failed to appoint counsel to represent him in the state court proceeding 
that the applicant did not receive a full,fair,and adequate hearing in the state court proceeding or 
that the applicant was otherwise denied due process of law in the state court proceeding 
or unless that part of the record of the state court proceeding in which the determination of such factual issue was made,pertinent to a determination of the sufficiency of the evidence to support such factual determination,is produced as provided for hereinafter,and the federal court on a consideration of such part of the record as a whole concludes that such factual determination is not fairly supported by the record 
and in an evidentiary hearing in the proceeding in the federal court,when due proof of such factual determination has been made,unless the existence of one or more of the circumstances respectively set forth in paragraphs to,inclusive,is shown by the applicant,otherwise appears,or is admitted by the respondent,or unless the court concludes pursuant to the provisions of paragraph numbered that the record in the state court proceeding,considered as a whole,does not fairly support such factual determination,the burden shall rest upon the applicant to establish by convincing evidence that the factual determination by the state court was erroneous 
the tests for procedural regularity and substantive accuracy established by former d bore an obvious resemblance to the townsend guidelines.however,as observed by professor yackle 
the precise fit between the former d and townsend was never perfectly clear.the prevailing view was that the former d neither displaced nor codified townsend holding on the threshold question of whether a court must conduct a hearing.rather,the former d assumed that a federal hearing was to be held and addressed only the bearing previous state court findings should have in that federal proceeding.the key to that interpretation lay in the text of the former d itself,which provided that the presumption in favor of state findings would apply in a federal habeas proceeding and that the applicant could rebut that presumption in an evidentiary hearing in the federal proceeding by adducing convincing evidence that the state finding was erroneous 
thus,under the prevailing view,the statute did not come into play if a federal hearing was mandatory under townsend the parties were simply left in their traditional positions,the petitioner had to establish a prima facie case for relief,thereby forcing the respondent to come forward with rebutting evidence however,if townsend did not require an evidentiary hearing,but the federal habeas court granted one in its discretion,and the petitioner could not demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the state court proceeding failed one of the eight statutory standards,then d provided that the state factual findings were presumed to be the petitioner showed by convincing evidence that the state determinations were erroneous 
the foregoing authorities clearly demonstrate that prior to the aedpa,the denial of a full and fair hearing defeated the presumption of correctness the supreme court decision in townsend dictated this defeat because two of the six criteria listed by the court hinged upon the full and fair hearing requirement.when the requirement was not met,the federal habeas court had to afford the petitioner an evidentiary hearing.at the federal hearing,the presumption of correctness did not apply.although this point eludes the majority,the inapplicability of the presumption was obvious,for if townsend indicates sufficient unreliability in the state conclusions so that a new hearing is required,it is reasonable to refuse to give weight to the former conclusions in the new hearing.
b.the effect of state factual findings 
the aedpa repealed former d and replaced it with two new provisions dealing with state court factfindings and factfinding procedures,d and e 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
e in a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.the applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.
professor yackle interprets the amendments in the following manner 
under the former d,the presumption of accuracy owed to state findings was contingent on written evidence of the state court conclusions,sound process in state court,and fair support in the evidentiary record.indeed,the former d set out its list of procedural and substantive standards as the means by which the federal habeas courts could determine whether state findings were entitled to the presumption.read literally,the new e preserves the presumption in favor of state court findings,but eliminates both the former requirement that findings must be in writing and any federal standards for the process and the evidentiary record in state court.bluntly stated,it appears that the federal habeas courts must accept state court findings at face questions asked.
a change of that kind would be dramatic and not something that anyone would lightly read into the new law.one can imagine that,in some circumstances at least,serious constitutional questions would be raised by a rule that requires a federal court to accept a factual finding made in state court,with no written statement of the finding on which to focus and with no ability to assess the process out of which that finding emerged and the evidence on which it was based.
moreover,e must be reconciled with the new version of d,which has it that a federal habeas court may award relief on the merits if a state court based its decision against a petitioner on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.under that new provision,a federal court can scarcely be indifferent to the process by which a state court reached a factual finding or the evidentiary support that finding enjoys.
i read e to drop the specific procedural and substantive standards contained in the former d.but i do not read it to dispense with a federal court rudimentary responsibility to ensure that it is deciding a constitutional claim based on factual findings that were forged in a procedurally adequate way and were anchored in a sufficient evidentiary record.in this sense,e departs from prior law,but only to substitute general notions of procedural regularity and substantive accuracy for detailed statutory standards 
the majority points out that the aedpa jettisoned all references to a full and fair hearing.so,in its view,t o reintroduce a full and fair hearing requirement that would displace the application of e presumption of correctness would have the untenable result of rendering the amendments enacted by congress a nullity.while the deletion of language by congress is often controlling in the enterprise of statutory construction,aedpa can not reasonably be interpreted in such a manner.consider the following observations from the late professor wright 
the old statute former d applied to a determination after a hearing on the merits of a factual issue,made by a state court of competent jurisdiction in a proceeding to which the applicant for the writ and the state or an officer or agent thereof were parties,evidenced by a written finding,written opinion,or other reliable and adequate written indicia.the new statute e applies to a determination of a factual issue made by a state court.thus,at least on its face the new statute does not require that the determination be after a hearing on the merits of the factual issue,it does not require that the applicant for the writ and the state or an officer or agent have been parties,and it does not require that the determination be evidenced by written indicia.indeed the new statute does not even require that the state court that made the determination have been a court of competent jurisdiction.presumably the courts will continue to insist on that and it is likely that some of the other elements that were in the old statute but not in the new one will be read back into it by the courts 
thus,under the method of construction advanced in the majority opinion,this court could not require sound process,or even competent jurisdiction,in the state court that issued factual findings.moreover,e,unlike its predecessor,does not state that the petitioner burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness arises in a federal evidentiary hearing under the majority construction,this omission means that e does not presuppose that a federal evidentiary hearing is to be held on the basis of townsend,but rather that e speaks to whether a hearing will be conducted in the first instance.but the fifth circuit has rejected an interpretation along these lines.in clark johnson a habeas petitioner complained that the state habeas court did not afford him a full and fair hearing,and thus the federal district court erred in denying him discovery and an evidentiary hearing.after finding that the petition was governed by the aedpa,the court stated that o ur jurisprudence is instructive in evaluating whether the district court denial of discovery and an evidentiary hearing was an abuse of discretion.after surveying the jurisprudence,the court continued to find an abuse of discretion which would entitle clark to discovery and an evidentiary hearing to prove his contentions,we would necessarily have to find that the state did not provide him with a full and fair hearing the court ultimately concluded that the state proceedings did provide clark with a full and fair hearing the court analysis of clark claim is significant,however,because it indicates that a state court denial of a full and fair hearing continues to mandate,a federal evidentiary hearing pursuant to townsend.even the majority acknowledges the continuing validity of the full and fair hearing requirement in this context 
despite this acknowledgment,the majority finds that singleton johnson offers valdez no support.there,the state habeas court granted the petitioner relief in part and issued findings of fact.the texas court of criminal appeals reversed and denied singleton relief without issuing an opinion.concluding that there were no findings to which the presumption of correctness could apply,we held that the petitioner was entitled to a full and fair evidentiary hearing on the factual issue in dispute the case was therefore remanded for a de novo evidentiary hearing.the majority states that we did not pass upon the question as to whether the absence of a full and fair hearing precluded the operation of d.the majority then asserts that in determining that the texas court of criminal appeals reached an adjudication on the merits,this court implied that d applied to such a summary disposition,even where the petitioner was entitled to an evidentiary hearing.but singleton does not permit this implication.a hearing de novo is a new hearing of a matter,conducted as if the original hearing had not taken place.where such a hearing is ordered,there is no room for deference to the previous court findings.fifth circuit precedent therefore suggests that the aedpa did not disturb prior law concerning the circumstances in which a federal evidentiary hearing is mandatory.because townsend still governs that question,the denial of a full and fair hearing must render inoperative the statutory presumption of correctness,just as it did prior to the amendments 
another weakness in the majority opinion treatment of the presumption of correctness is its failure to apply d.although the courts have not made it clear how d invitation to decide whether the state fact determinations were reasonable fit s with the presumption that the state fact determinations are correct,leading scholars contend that reading d and e in pari materia yields results similar to those reached when d explicitly provided that the denial of a full and fair hearing defeated the presumption of correctness in the present case,the state habeas judge did not read the trial transcript,thus depriving valdez of a full and fair hearing.in light of this failure,it is disingenuous to conclude that the state court rendered a decision that was based on a reasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented,and is therefore entitled to deference.instead,a faithful application of d supports the approach taken by the federal district court.
in sum,there is a complete absence of support for the majority holding that a federal court must apply the presumption of correctness when the state court failure to provide a habeas petitioner with a full and fair hearing necessitates a federal evidentiary hearing.in his brief,valdez argues that the aedpa simply does not address the issue of when a federal evidentiary hearing is required,or the consequence of conducting such a hearing,when the state courts have failed to provide a full and fair hearing.scholarly commentary on the aedpa and this court jurisprudence overwhelmingly support this argument.
c.the of law and mixed questions of law and fact 
d provides 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
subsection d governs review of questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact when the state court has adjudicated the petitioner claim on the merits.an adjudication on the merits occurs when the state court resolves the case on substantive grounds,rather than procedural grounds the majority asserts that the mandatory language of d combined with the meaning of adjudication on the merits leaves no room for judicial imposition of a full and fair hearing prerequisite.however,in morris cain this court stated a full and fair adjudication of a petitioner claims in state court is a prerequisite for application of aedpa review provisions.moreover,in corwin johnson we declared in this circuit,provided the state court conducted a full and fair adjudication of the petitioner claims,pure questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed under d.
addressing this clear precedent,the majority opinion states that t o the extent that these references to a full and fair adjudication refer to a full and fair state court hearing,they were dicta.neither in morris nor in corwin were we confronted with a claim that the petitioner had been denied a full and fair hearing.the majority further asserts that a part from being dicta,these references also appear to conflate the adjudication on the merits requirement with a full and fair hearing requirement,referring to the adjudication on the merits as a full and fair adjudication on the merits.this assertion is questionable,however,in light of the discrete meaning of adjudication on the merits and the statement made earlier in the majority opinion that the phrase does not speak to the quality of the process.the better view is that the full and fair hearing and adjudication on the merits requirements retain independent significance this view is supported by the supreme court unanimous opinion in michael williams taylor there,the court addressed a habeas petitioner entitlement to an evidentiary hearing under e 
for state courts to have their rightful opportunity to adjudicate federal rights,the prisoner must be diligent in developing the record and presenting,if possible,all claims of constitutional error.if the prisoner fails to do so,himself or herself contributing to the absence of a full and fair adjudication in state court,e prohibits an evidentiary hearing to develop the relevant claims in federal court,unless the statute other stringent requirements are met yet comity is not served by saying a prisoner has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim where he was unable to develop his claim in state court despite diligent effort.in that circumstance,an evidentiary hearing is not barred by e 
the court use of the phrase full and fair evinces its concern for the quality of the state court process.indeed,the court refused to attribute to congress a purpose or design to bar evidentiary hearings for diligent prisoners with meritorious claims just because the prosecution conduct went undetected in state court.
in explaining its statutory interpretation,the majority complains that valdez would have the court apply the full and fair hearing requirement to a deferential scheme as to conclusions of law and mixed questions of law and fact that did not exist prior to the aedpa,thereby rendering null the amendments enacted by congress.but valdez merely asserts that the aedpa does not address the precise issue presently before the court.moreover,his argument suggests that the amendments should be interpreted in a manner that comports with traditional notions of constitutional due process.it is a cardinal principle that if it is fairly possible to construe an act of congress to avoid a constitutional question,then the statute should be interpreted in that way the majority holds that the aedpa prohibits a federal court from examining the process by which the state court arrived at its decision.this holding raises serious constitutional questions.as stated by professor yackle in the preclusion context,the supreme court has said that federal courts need not respect state judgments unless litigants had a full and fair opportunity to litigate their claims in state court and has made it clear that,at a minimum,the measure of that opportunity is due process in the constitutional sense.these teachings apply with equal force to the present case.furthermore,in his concurring opinion in terry williams taylor justice stevens found 
a construction of aedpa that would require the federal courts to cede th e authority to interpret federal law to the courts of the states would be inconsistent with the practice that federal judges have traditionally followed in discharging their duties under article iii of the constitution.if congress had intended to require such an important change in the exercise of our jurisdiction,we believe it would have spoken with much greater clarity than is found in the text of aedpa 
this uncertainty as to congressional intent places the majority advancement of deference without regard to whether due process was afforded in the state court on shaky ground.a more solid interpretation of the aedpa would be one that observes ordinary constitutional due process standards.
d.the aedpa,deference,and other circuits 
in miller champion the tenth circuit recognized that 
although f ederal courts entertaining habeas petitions must give a presumption of correctness to state courts factual findings,t his presumption of correctness does not apply if the habeas petitioner did not receive a full,fair,and adequate hearing in the state court proceeding on the matter sought to be raised in the habeas petition 
whereas the district court cited miller in support of its decision,the majority declines to adopt its approach and declares that miller rests on tenuous footing because the tenth circuit relied on its jurisprudence this conclusion,however,ignores the reality that every circuit,including this one,has continued to apply cases in appropriate circumstances the court in miller clearly held,that the failure of a state court to conduct a full and fair evidentiary hearing precluded aedpa deference to the state court mixed law and fact conclusions 
casting aside the tenth circuit decision,the majority relies instead on the fourth circuit view of aedpa deference.the majority opinion discusses the fourth circuit en banc decision in bell jarvis in bell,the petitioner was convicted of multiple counts of sexual misconduct.while direct appeal and state review were denied summarily by the north carolina state courts,the federal habeas courts evaluated the petitioner constitutional claims with a much closer degree of scrutiny.the district court denied habeas relief.on appeal,a divided panel of the fourth circuit reversed the district court ruling and granted habeas relief.but on rehearing en banc,the full fourth circuit affirmed the district court denial of relief.
in the course of its ruling,the en banc court had occasion to reconsider,with guidance from terry williams,the application of d to state court summary affirmances.it interpreted terry williams to mean that the only question remaining after aedpa was whether the state court adjudication of the claims before it was a reasonable one in light of the controlling supreme court law.finding that terry williams left it no choice but to overrule an earlier line of cases that allowed federal habeas courts to independently ascertain whether constitutional rights were violated when the state courts had not articulated their reasoning,the majority concluded that,under aedpa,federal courts are no longer permitted to review de novo state court decisions on the merits.it also concluded that whether or not there was,in fact,a constitutional violation is not an essential part of the inquiry under d.for a number of reasons,the majority invocation of bell is cause for concern.
first,bell analytical method is flawed.when terry williams is read along with weeks angelone decided just before terry williams and ramdass angelone decided soon after terry williams,it becomes clear that federal courts should adjudicate habeas corpus claims by first performing the court traditional function of analyzing the merits of the federal constitutional claim and only then assessing whether d precludes habeas relief even though the court has found a constitutional violation the fourth circuit never determined whether a constitutional violation occurred.instead,it contented itself with the general finding that the state court result was not unreasonable,even though the state court had denied relief summarily without identifying a federal rule of decision.
second,the bell court simply did not consider whether the state court denied the petitioner a full and fair hearing.although the majority states that bell implies that there is no full and fair hearing requirement under the aedpa,the fourth circuit kept its focus on the summary nature of the state court disposition.
finally,the majority generally advocates the sweeping view of aedpa deference championed by the fourth circuit but in terry williams,justice stevens issued a reminder that the word deference does not appear in the text of the statute itself.furthermore,in van tran lindsey the ninth circuit recognized that in terry williams 
t he court rejected the interpretation,adopted in various forms by the fourth,fifth,seventh,and eleventh circuits,that defines reasonableness on the basis of whether reasonable jurists could disagree about the result reached by the state court.instead,the court adopted an objectively unreasonable standard,employing the language used in decisions by the third and eighth circuits.we think it significant that the third and eighth circuits adopted that test,rather than the tests developed by other circuits,because they determined that the other circuits tests were too deferential.the supreme court thus chose to adopt the interpretation of aedpa that espoused the more robust habeas review 
in gardner johnson we noted the insightful observation made in van tran and agreed that the rejection of the reasonable jurists standard as too deferential to state courts clearly implies that the supreme court in terry williams preferred a more stringent habeas review of state court decisions.consequently,the majority desire for broad,sweeping,and unchecked deference to state court adjudications finds no support in the precedents of either the fifth circuit or the supreme court.
bell provides no basis for overturing the district court ruling,particularly since the district court relied on the tenth circuit approach in miller,which is both analytically sound and relevant to the present case.
iii.conclusion 
my greatest disappointment with the majority opinion concerns my colleagues apparent belief that silence in the text of the aedpa signifies affirmative repudiation by congress of the body of habeas corpus law,including general notions of procedural regularity and substantive accuracy.although the majority approach may constitute sound statutory construction in appropriate instances,in the present case it ignores the delicate balance struck by the supreme court among competing concerns of federalism,due process,article iii jurisdiction,faithfulness to congressional enactments,and the importance of the great writ to our legal tradition townsend sain has life remaining and,in the present case,it supports the district court determination that,where there had been a denial of a full and fair hearing before the state habeas court,the aedpa review provisions,as set forth in d and e,did not apply.thus,for the foregoing reasons,i respectfully dissent.
for a recitation of the facts surrounding the crime and the testimony at trial,see valdez state,en banc.
the special issues submitted to the jury were was the conduct of the defendant,alberto valdez,that caused the death of the deceased,joseph bock,committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result is there a probability that the defendant,alberto valdez,would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society see.ann.b vernon.
valdez also presented testimony regarding his juror misconduct claim.he alleged that one juror visited the crime scene during the trial.the state habeas court found this claim to be without merit.likewise,the federal district court found this to be without merit.this claim is not before us on appeal.
in townsend,the supreme court held that where a petitioner shows the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact,which if resolved in his favor would grant him relief,and he has been denied a full and fair hearing in the state proceedings,a federal evidentiary hearing is mandatory.see at.at,overruled in part by keeney,d holding that where the petitioner has failed to develop a claim in state court proceedings,he must establish cause and prejudice in order to receive a federal evidentiary hearing.
e provides if the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings,the court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows that a the claim relies on i a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable,or ii a factual predicate that could not have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence and b the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error,no reasonable would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
the district court reached its decision prior to the supreme court decision in michael williams taylor,d in which the supreme court confirmed that e did not bar evidentiary hearings when the failure to develop the record did not result from the prisoner neglect or lack of due supreme court handed down two decisions that we cite in this opinion in which the petitioner has the last name williams.we distinguish between those two decisions by including the petitioners first names in our citation of these cases.
rule a of the rules governing cases provides if the petition is not dismissed at a previous stage in the proceeding,the judge,after the answer and the transcript and record of state court proceedings are filed,shall,upon a review of those proceedings and of the expanded record,if any,determine whether an evidentiary hearing is required.if it appears that an evidentiary hearing is not required,the judge shall make such disposition of the petition as justice shall require.
the federal evidentiary hearing was,in many respects,a reprise of the state hearing.with the exception of george parker,a psychologist called by the state,and trial counsel david gutierrez,all of the witnesses that testified had testified in the state habeas hearing.
valdez filed his federal habeas petition on january,well after the effective date of aedpa.see,stat.accordingly,apart from the contention that a full and fair hearing bars the application of the aedpa standards,there is no dispute that aedpa applies to valdez application.
in drinkard johnson,cir,we found the state court application of federal law to be reasonable under a subjective test.in terry williams,the supreme court rejected drinkard subjective test.see terry williams,at.at see also moore johnson,cir acknowledging the supreme court rejection of the drinkard standard.
the presumption of correctness not only applies to explicit findings of fact,but it also applies to those unarticulated findings which are necessary to the state court conclusions of mixed law and fact.see,marshall lonberger,d applying presumption of correctness to implicit finding against the defendant credibility,where that finding was necessarily part of the court rejection of the defendant claim lavallee delle rose,d same see also goodwin johnson,cir findings of fact can be implied from explicit conclusions of law.
the district court in its decision appears to have treated both the habeas court findings of historical fact and its conclusions of mixed law and fact as falling under e presumption of correctness.despite this appearance,we assume that this is not what the district court meant,as the presumption of correctness applies only to findings of historical fact.see e a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.instead,a state habeas court conclusions of law and mixed law and fact are examined under d.see clark johnson,cir.
in her opening brief,the director asserted that barred the district court from holding an evidentiary hearing.subsequent to the filing of that brief,the supreme court issued its decision in michael williams,d holding that e operated only to bar a district court from granting an evidentiary hearing where a petitioner,through his own fault,failed to develop a claim before the state court and met neither of the exceptions.in light of this decision,the director has abandoned this position in her reply brief.instead,she pursues the argument that even with the discretion to grant an evidentiary hearing,the district court could not cast aside the deference to be accorded state court determinations of law and fact.
the dissent argues that former d did not apply altogether where the petitioner was denied a full and fair hearing in state court.see dissenting op.at arguing that under the prevailing view,d did not apply where a full and fair hearing was denied,and a federal evidentiary hearing would have been required under townsend.we disagree with this reading of d.to begin,nothing in the statute suggested that its application was limited in this way.moreover,the dissent reading of d would render superfluous d and,which both required a full and fair hearing before the presumption of correctness would apply.
section e replaced the eight specific exceptions to the presumption of correctness with one standard in a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court proceedings,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.the applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence e.
d provides in full an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
the dissent would have us depart from the plain language of the statute out of concern that the new aedpa framework may abandon some of the procedural safeguards required by the former d.see dissenting op.at.we can not,however,second guess the intent of congress in this manner.moreover,aedpa continues to provide protection in cases where the state court process is in question.for example,as noted below,where a district court elects to hold an evidentiary hearing in light of a state habeas court failure to allow an applicant to develop the factual basis of his claim,the hearing may assist the district court in ascertaining whether the state court reached a reasonable determination under d.the dissent also contends that too literal of a reading of aedpa provisions is inconsistent with our prior case law interpreting e.specifically,the dissent reads our construction of aedpa provisions to necessitate a finding that e alone governs a district court discretion in deciding whether to conduct an evidentiary hearing.the dissent argues that this is contrary to fifth circuit precedent,which has found case law instructive when reviewing a district court refusal of a federal evidentiary hearing.see dissenting op.at.our construction of aedpa provisions here,however,is not inconsistent with those cases.the cases cited by the dissent involved situations where e did not apply because a prerequisite to that provision was not satisfied.in such cases,the district court discretion to hold a hearing was not limited by e.see e if the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings emphasis added michael williams,at.construing conditional language to mean that e does not prohibit a federal evidentiary hearing where the failure to develop the factual basis was attributable to no fault of the petitioner clark,at section e appl ies only where the failure to develop the factual basis is directly attributable to a decision or omission of the petitioner.finally,the dissent suggests that a full and fair hearing prerequisite to aedpa deference can be interpreted from the statute by reading d and e in pari materia where a state habeas court denies a petitioner a full and fair hearing,it seems disingenuous to conclude that the state court rendered a decision that was based on a reasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented,and is therefore entitled deference.dissenting op.at.we disagree with the dissent argument on this point for two reasons.first,congress omission of language of a full and fair hearing is clear.second,there is an easier way to harmonize d and e.whereas d sets out a general standard by which the district court evaluates a state court specific findings of fact,e states what an applicant will have to show for the district court to reject a state court determination of factual issues.for example,a district court may find by clear and convincing evidence that the state court erred with respect to a particular finding of fact,thus rebutting the presumption of correctness with respect to that fact.see e.it is then a separate question whether the state court determination of facts was unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.see d.thus,it is possible that,while the state court erred with respect to one factual finding under e,its determination of facts resulting in its decision in the case was reasonable under d.
the dissent also notes that a recent supreme court opinion similarly used language of a full and fair adjudication.michael williams,at.michael williams,however,like morris and corwin,is inapposite in this case.in michael williams,the court addressed the applicability of the e bar to an evidentiary hearing,and not the applicability of aedpa deference.
the dissent questions our present reliance on bell on the ground that it reasoning is contrary to the direction given by the supreme court in three recent cases to courts applying aedpa.specifically,the dissent states that the bell court departed from the requirement stated in weeks angelone,d,terry williams taylor,d,and ramdass angelone,d,that federal courts adjudicate habeas corpus claims by first performing the court traditional function of analyzing the merits of the federal constitutional claim and only then assessing whether d new defense to relief precludes the granting of the writ in a case in which a court has found a constitutional violation.dissenting opinion at.because we do not read the above supreme court cases to require the inquiry suggested by the dissent,we continue to find the reasoning in bell instructive.
f provides if the applicant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence adduced in such state court proceeding to support the state court determination of a factual issue made therein,the applicant,if able,shall produce that part of the record pertinent to a determination of the sufficiency of the evidence to support such determination.if the applicant,because of indigency or other reason is unable to produce such part of the record,then the state shall produce such part of the record and the federal court shall direct the state to do so by order directed to an appropriate state official.if the state can not provide such pertinent part of the record,then the court shall determine under the record,then the existing facts and circumstances what weight shall be given to the state court factual determination.
we note that it is not clear that f impacts the d standards of review.on its face,the section appears to apply only to the presumption of correctness to be accorded state court factual findings.we decline to determine f applicability to these standards because it is unnecessary to our assessment of valdez f argument.
although baker is,the aedpa amendments made no alteration to this section.instead,aedpa merely redesignated the section from e to f,its present location in the code.see aedpa.thus,our cases concerning this section remain applicable.
