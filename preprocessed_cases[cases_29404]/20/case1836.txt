jesse watson,a state inmate in the danville correctional center,is serving an aggregate sentence for multiple counts of attempted murder,aggravated battery with a firearm and reckless conduct.the district court denied watson habeas corpus petition,finding that he was not denied effective assistance of counsel during his criminal trial or his direct appeal.we affirm.
jesse and pearl watson married in and divorced in.on the morning of july,watson argued with pearl at the developmental disabilities center in kankakee,illinois where they both worked that same day at about in the evening,watson defied a restraining order by visiting pearl at her home.he entered the house uninvited and found pearl in the living room together with her new boyfriend clifford nelson,her two daughters from a previous relationship,her daughters boyfriends and her grandson.after watson was unable to persuade pearl to talk with him in private,he announced that it was party time,drew a gun and opened fire on the gathering.first,he shot pearl,who had been holding her grandson antonio on her lap at the time.pearl managed to throw antonio to the ground before the bullet struck her in the stomach and lodged in her spine.next,watson turned his attention to pearl boyfriend nelson,firing on him repeatedly as he attempted to flee and hitting him in both legs and an arm.watson then opened fire on pearl daughter dormiletha,shooting her in the arm and also hitting her boyfriend terrence lindsey in the arm as lindsey attempted to pull dormiletha from the path of the gunfire.finally,watson walked over to pearl side,held his gun to her head and repeatedly pulled the trigger.by then,however,the gun was empty.
watson was charged with four counts of attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm.he rejected the state plea offer and a jury convicted him of three counts of attempted murder and three counts of aggravated battery with a on the shooting of pearl,dormiletha and one count of reckless conduct,based on the shooting of lindsey.the trial court sentenced watson to an aggregate sentence of years imprisonment years for the battery and attempted murder of pearl,years for the battery and attempted murder of dormiletha and years for the battery and attempted murder of nelson 
after his conviction and sentence became final,watson commenced a state court collateral challenge,alleging that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in three ways first,he argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to render proper advice concerning the criminal sentence he was facing if he were found guilty at trial second,he argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the fact that he was charged with attempted murder,but the jury instructions did not define murder and third,he argued that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to make an issue of trial counsel failure to challenge the jury instructions on direct appeal.
the history of the proceedings in state court is somewhat tortured and need not be recounted in detail here.what is significant is that the state trial court denied watson petition on the merits in,and the appellate court of illinois affirmed over one judge dissent the appellate court found that watson was not prejudiced by his trial counsel advice relating to the state plea offer,noting that watson had testified only that he would have considered pleading guilty if he had been properly advised of his maximum possible sentence.the appellate court also appeared to reject watson claims based on the jury instructions that were given at his trial.
the district court denied watson subsequent federal habeas petition,but granted a certificate of appealability because it took it to be a closer call whether watson lawyers gave ineffective assistance by failing to challenge the jury instructions.
we review the decision of the last state court to address watson arguments.see williams bartow,cir.our review is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.the aedpa was intended to prevent federal habeas retrials and to ensure that state court convictions are given effect to the extent possible under the law.bell cone,d.under the aedpa,a federal court may grant habeas relief only if the state court adjudication of a habeas petitioner constitutional claims was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.d williams taylor,d.a state court decision rests on an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it lies well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.jackson frank,cir see also williams,at.
again,watson claims that he is entitled to habeas relief because the assistance of counsel he received at trial and on direct appeal was constitutionally defective.the sixth amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to effective assistance of counsel.see hill lockhart,d strickland washington,d the sixth amendment recognizes the right to the assistance of counsel because it envisions counsel playing a role that is critical to the ability of the adversarial system to produce just results.an accused is entitled to be assisted by an attorney,whether retained or appointed,who plays the role necessary to ensure that the trial is fair.to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim,a petitioner must prove both that his counsel performance was objectively unreasonable and that he suffered prejudice as a result.see strickland,at.mcdowell kingston,cir.we may address these issues in whichever order is most expedient.as the supreme court explained,i f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice,which we expect will often be so,that course should be followed.strickland,at.
watson argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to convey the information he needed to properly evaluate the state plea offer,and both trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to make an issue of the fact that he was charged with attempted murder,but the jury instructions that were given at trial did not define murder.
the appellate court of illinois rejected watson argument that he was denied effective assistance when his attorney gave him inaccurate advice in connection with the state plea offer because it found that watson could not show that he was prejudiced by counsel advice.we do not think that this finding was unreasonable.
when a defendant considers the government offer of a plea agreement,a reasonably competent counsel will attempt to learn all of the facts of the case and to make an estimate of a likely sentence.united states barnes,cir citing hill,at.in the present case,the information watson attorney conveyed in connection with the state plea offer was not altogether accurate.watson was charged with multiple counts of attempted murder and aggravated battery.these are class x felonies under illinois law,the highest class of felony.see.comp.stat.c,b.accordingly,watson faced possible mandatory consecutive sentences if found guilty of multiple crimes,and his maximum possible sentence was years imprisonment.see.comp.stat.a,a,c.it is undisputed that watson trial counsel did not advise him of this.instead,watson was told that his maximum possible sentence was years imprisonment.
the appellate court of illinois found that it was objectively unreasonable for counsel to underestimate the possible sentence his client was facing,and we agree.see osagiede united states,cir all lawyers that represent criminal defendants are expected to know the laws applicable to their client defense.be that as it may,deficient advice relating to a defendant possible criminal sentence will violate the defendant sixth amendment rights only if this advice was prejudicial.to show that he was prejudiced during plea bargaining,watson must show that his counsel advice was a decisive factor in his decision to reject the state plea offer.barnes,at emphasis added.
the appellate court found that counsel advice was not the cause of watson decision to
