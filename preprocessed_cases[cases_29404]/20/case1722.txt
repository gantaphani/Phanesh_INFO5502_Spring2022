andrew jackson,the warden of a michigan state correctional institution,appeals a federal district court conditional grant of habeas corpus to prisoner dashawn lyons on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel.lyons is currently serving a life sentence without parole after pleading guilty to first degree murder.
in,lyons was sixteen years old and had received an education to the seventh grade.on advice of counsel,who believed it likely the trial court would impose a juvenile sentence,lyons pled guilty in michigan state court to first degree murder.the trial court did sentence lyons as a juvenile.the prosecution appealed,the michigan court of appeals reversed,and lyons received the only available adult sentence under michigan law life in prison without possibility of parole.lyons trial counsel did not consider or advise lyons that the prosecutor could appeal the imposition of a juvenile sentence.
lyons petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus,and the federal district court concluded that the failure of lyons counsel to inform him of the prosecutor right to appeal,particularly in light of lyons youth at the time of the plea,constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.the court further concluded that a contrary determination on the facts and the law by the michigan court of appeals constituted an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court in williams taylor,d hill lockhart,d and strickland washington,d.accordingly,the court granted lyons petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel the warden appeals.after a careful review of the record,we affirm the district court.
background 
on november,lyons shot and killed douglas thomas.the state of michigan charged lyons with first degree murder and possession of a firearm during commission of a felony.
lyons trial in the recorder court for the city of detroit was scheduled to begin on march.the assigned judge had another jury trial that day,so lyons trial was postponed to the next day and transferred to the docket of judge roberson,chief judge of the recorder court.the next day,march,lyons pled guilty to first degree murder before chief judge roberson on the advice of his defense counsel,laurence burgess.
at the plea hearing that day,burgess informed the court that he recognized it was unusual to offer a plea to first degree murder,but he had discussed the matter with lyons and lyons father who was present in the courtroom.burgess stated his conviction that he would be able to convince the court to sentence lyons as a juvenile and explained that on the basis of that lyons wanted to offer a guilty plea.
the court questioned lyons as to whether he understood the two greatly disparate sentencing possibilities available to the court in his case.lyons affirmed his understanding that if the court decided to treat him as an adult,the court had no option but to sentence him to life in prison without parole but if the court treated him as a juvenile,he would be committed to the state juvenile authority for a period not to exceed his birthday lyons also stated that he was not being coerced into his plea,had not been promised anything in return for his plea,and was aware of the various trial rights he was foregoing by pleading guilty.
the court then questioned lyons briefly as to the factual basis of the crime.lyons stated that he knew the victim and went to the victim house.lyons was carrying a revolver at the time.lyons stated i went to take his wallet.there was a struggle and i got scared and shot him.the court specifically asked lyons if he had tried to rob the victim and lyons admitted he had.
on november,after a sentencing hearing conducted over a number of months,chief judge roberson concluded that it was appropriate to sentence lyons as a juvenile.the court ordered that lyons be confined to a maximum security state juvenile facility until age.
the prosecutor appealed the juvenile sentence disposition the state court of appeals reversed and remanded for sentencing as an adult,mandatory life imprisonment without parole on the first degree murder charge.on appeal,the michigan supreme court ordered a stay of further trial court proceedings,then vacated the court of appeals opinion on the ground of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel and remanded to the court of appeals for rebriefing.the court of appeals again reversed and remanded for imposition of the adult sentence.the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal.
at his resentencing before chief judge roberson on january,lyons orally moved to withdraw his guilty plea.pursuant to recent michigan supreme court orders in similar cases,chief judge roberson immediately imposed the adult sentence of life without parole and deferred consideration of the motion until an evidentiary hearing could be scheduled lyons later filed a written motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
on april,the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on lyons motion to withdraw his plea.lyons trial counsel,burgess,testified.burgess stated that he did almost entirely trial work and handled very few appellate cases.burgess explained that he had prepared for the march,trial before the originally assigned judge.but upon learning that his client case had been transferred to chief judge roberson,burgess changed tack and recommended to lyons that he plead guilty.although burgess believed that he could argue an imperfect claim on lyons behalf at trial,which might result in lyons being convicted of a lesser offense,burgess knowledge of chief judge roberson sentencing policies and general philosophy for handling juveniles convinced him that he could get a fair hearing from judge roberson and persuade him to sentence lyons as a juvenile.accordingly,burgess took the unusual step of advising lyons to plead guilty to first degree murder.
burgess acknowledged that prior to march,he and lyons had discuss ed the trial more than anything else and their main discussion regarding lyons guilty plea took place only in the few hours after the case had been reassigned to chief judge roberson.burgess realized that the lyons was relying heavily on his advice,nonetheless he strongly recommended the plea.burgess also discussed the situation with lyons father and advised him that it was in lyons best interest to plead guilty 
burgess testified that,in formulating his advice to lyons,he did not consider the prosecutor right to appeal a trial court sentencing decision.
q in formulating your advice to lyons did you take into account the fact that the prosecution had a right to appeal judge roberson decision 
burgess no,did consider that at all and i certainly did discuss it with him.but it really did enter my mind.
q you did take that into consideration in formulating your own opinion as to the best choice for him 
burgess no.it not something that i would even think about.my reasoning was that judge roberson would be fair.i thought i could convince him that this young man should be sentenced as a juvenile.i never in my wildest dreams thought the court of appeals or a supreme court would reverse a judge on a discretion such as this 
q if you had taken that into consideration,are you able to say whether it would have made a difference in your advice 
burgess i ca really tell you whether or not i would have gone ahead and still advised him of this but at least he should have been aware of it and in that case i was remiss,i guess.but it not something i even thought about.i can tell you.
lyons testified at the evidentiary hearing as well.he stated that when burgess advised him to plead guilty,he initially wanted to fight the charges and go to trial.however,he eventually acceded to the plea,relying on the advice and information burgess provided to him.lyons then testified about burgess failure to inform him of the prosecutor right to appeal and the impact such information would have had on his decision to plead guilty.
q did you and burgess discuss the fact that the prosecutor had a right to appeal the case and if judge roberson sentenced you as a juvenile another court could decide to reverse that and say,no,you have to be sentenced as an adult 
lyons no,we did not.
q if burgess advised you there was a second hurdle to get past,a second risk regarding a juvenile versus the adult sentence,would you have plead guilty to first degree murder 
lyons likely i would have chosen to go to trial.
lyons testified that he first learned about the prosecutor appeal when a relative read in a newspaper that lyons juvenile sentence had been overturned by the court of appeals he did not recall whether he considered withdrawing his plea when the state supreme court vacated the decision of the court of appeals and remanded for rebriefing.
as to the factual basis for his earlier plea,lyons testified that he did not go to the victim,thomas,residence with the intent to kill him,but rather to see about some money thomas owed him.lyons tried to get the money by reaching for the wallet in thomas pocket.a gun was on the floor.thomas grabbed the gun first and the two of them struggled over it.lyons got the gun and shot thomas.lyons denied trying to rob thomas of his wallet 
the trial court determined that lyons guilty plea had not been voluntary,knowing and intelligent due to ineffectiveness of trial counsel.the court granted lyons motion to withdraw his guilty plea.the michigan court of appeals granted leave to the prosecutor to appeal that order.
in a consolidated decision addressing lyons case along with two other similarly situated appellants,the appeals court reversed the trial court people haynes after remand.the court determined that the record showed lyons was aware,at the time he pled guilty,that he might be sentenced as an adult to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without possibility of parole.despite this knowledge,lyons pled guilty and did not move to withdraw his plea until after the conclusion of the appeal regarding his sentence.therefore,the court concluded,lyons understood the consequences of his plea,and the plea was knowingly,understandingly,and voluntarily made.haynes after remand,at.the michigan supreme court denied lyons leave to appeal.
in august,lyons petitioned the federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus.the court conditionally granted the writ,ordering lyons release unless he was given a trial.the district court concluded that as a result of ineffective assistance of trial counsel lyons had not pled guilty voluntarily or knowingly the warden appealed to this court.
ii.discussion 
habeas corpus review 
provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa codified at d govern our review of the state court decisions in this habeas corpus case.
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.
the federal district court considered lyons petition for habeas corpus under the unreasonable application prong of this statute.neither party argues that the federal district court should have inquired whether the michigan court of appeals decision was contrary to clearly established federal law.we proceed,therefore,under the unreasonable application prong of d.
in williams taylor,d,the supreme court elucidated the terms of d.first,the court explained that clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court refers to the court holdings,as opposed to dicta,at the time of the relevant state court decision.id.at.second,the court explained that a state court decision unreasonably applies supreme court precedent by either identifying the correct governing legal rule from supreme court precedent but unreasonably applying it to the facts or unreasonably extending a legal principle from supreme court precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refusing to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.id.at.finally,the court declared that the application of law must be objectively unreasonable,id.at,and not merely incorrect or erroneous id.at.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
in hill lockhart,d and strickland washington,d,the supreme court set out the law applicable to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim such as that made by lyons.both hill and strickland were clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court at the time of the final michigan court of appeals decision in.see williams,at.referring to strickland as clearly established precedent at the time of a virginia state court decision.
under strickland,a defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show both deficient performance by counsel and prejudice to the defendant resulting from that deficient performance.at.to be deficient,counsel performance must fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.hill,at.in hill,which applied strickland to the guilty plea context,the court explained that a defendant shows prejudice by demonstrating a reasonable probability that,but for counsel errors,the defendant would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.id.at.
although the michigan court of appeals did not mention either hill or strickland by name,it did apply the law of those cases thus,we must examine whether that court applied hill and strickland unreasonably.
we emphasize that hill and strickland state the relevant law in this case.relying on a string of circuit court cases,the warden argues that defense counsel failure to inform lyons of the prosecution right to appeal the imposition of a juvenile sentence does not comprise ineffective assistance because the prosecutor right of appeal represents a collateral,as opposed to a direct,consequence of the plea.we reject this argument on two grounds.
first,the warden reliance on circuit court cases is improper.the aedpa prohibits use of lower court decisions in determining whether the state court decision is contrary to,or is an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.williams,at.defining clearly established law as determined by the supreme court to mean holdings of supreme court decisions harris,at holding district court erred in rely ing on authority other than that of the supreme court of the united states in its analysis under d.
second,the warden argument is incompatible with supreme court case law.the court does not use a consequence categorization scheme to decide ineffective assistance of counsel claims.indeed,in hill,the supreme court reviewed an eighth circuit decision holding that parole eligibility was not a direct consequence of a guilty plea.see hill lockhart,cir.the court noted this holding,but eschewed any such characterization in favor of directly applying strickland to the plea context.hill,at.as the court stated in williams the strickland test provides sufficient guidance for resolving virtually all claims.at.
the federal district court concluded that the michigan court of appeals decision was an unreasonable application of hill and strickland.we review de novo a district court legal conclusions in a habeas corpus proceeding.miller francis,cir.where,as here,the district court factual findings are based on a transcript from the state court proceedings and the district court makes no credibility determination,we also review those findings de novo.id.we must determine whether it is an unreasonable application of hill and strickland to hold either that lyons trial counsel provided him with objectively reasonable assistance or that even if lyons had been reasonably advised,he still would have pled guilty.
performance of counsel 
the proper measure of attorney performance is whether counsel assistance was reasonable under prevailing professional norms and considering all the circumstances.strickland,at.we make a examination of the evidence,williams,at,and indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.strickland,at.
the professional norms that guide us rest upon defense counsel fundamental duties to bring to bear such skill and knowledge as will render the trial a reliable adversarial testing process and to consult with the defendant on important decisions and to keep the defendant informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution.id.at.
the federal district court articulated the circumstances relevant to the performance inquiry in this case 
t rial counsel performance was deficient within the meaning of the strickland standard where he failed to advise petitioner that the prosecutor could appeal a juvenile sentence to a michigan appellate court with the very real possibility that a higher court would order petitioner resentenced as an adult.because of petitioner young age,petitioner was particularly reliant on his attorney advice to plead guilty to the offenses in this case.in light of counsel extraordinary advice to petitioner that he plead guilty to an offense which carried a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole,counsel had a duty both to consider and to advise petitioner of the prosecutor right to appeal any sentence to the michigan appellate courts,with the possibility that petitioner juvenile sentence would be overturned on appeal and he would then have to serve a nonparolable life sentence.
lyons jackson,slip op.at.
lyons trial counsel,burgess,brought to bear on this case his knowledge of chief judge roberson sentencing practices.without any doubt,in this regard lyons initially benefitted from counsel knowledge.furthermore,burgess adequately informed lyons regarding the risks as they related to chief judge roberson sentencing determination.lyons understood that if he pled guilty chief judge roberson could opt to impose either a severe adult sentence of life imprisonment or a lenient juvenile sentence.
however,burgess acted incompetently in failing to consider the likelihood that the prosecutor would exercise his right to appeal the district court imposition of a juvenile sentence.any juvenile sentence imposed on lyons would be less than five years in a juvenile facility.given such a lenient sentence for first degree murder,it was unreasonable for burgess not to have considered that the prosecutor could appeal and the juvenile sentence could be reversed.yet burgess did not factor this scenario into his advice to lyons that pleading guilty was in lyons best interest 
thus,lyons did not know that the prosecutor could appeal and that the juvenile sentence could be reversed,and,if so,lyons would serve a life sentence without possibility of parole.lyons was left unaware that,even if burgess assessment on his chances of receiving a juvenile sentence from chief judge roberson were correct,this was not a play in chief judge roberson courtroom.
burgess should have considered these possibilities,informed lyons about them,and incorporated them into his risk assessment when he advised lyons about pleading guilty.he failed to do so.rather,he advised lyons to plead guilty based solely upon his assessment of the relative risks in going to trial versus pleading guilty before chief judge roberson.as a result,burgess misinformed lyons regarding the likelihood he would receive an adult sentence.lyons was not fully apprised of the risks he faced.
the duty of defense counsel to consult is paramount when a client has to decide whether or not to waive a constitutional right,such as the right to trial.because the decision whether or not to plead guilty ultimately rests with the client,see jones barnes,d the accused has the ultimate authority to make certain fundamental decisions regarding the case,as to whether to plead guilty,waive a jury,testify in his or her own behalf,or take an appeal wainwright sykes,d burger,concurring o nly such basic decisions as whether to plead guilty,waive a jury,or testify in one own behalf are ultimately for the accused to make,counsel must ensure that the client decision is as informed as possible.failing even to consider,let alone notify the client of,a factor that could negate the entire benefit of the guilty plea is not within the range of professional norms 
lyons age and his heavy reliance on burgess,a reliance of which burgess was aware,enhanced burgess duty to make certain that lyons understood all the risks associated with his guilty plea.lyons was sixteen years old and had a seventh grade education.his father knew nothing about the applicable law.burgess acknowledges that he was placed in the role where he was both lyons lawyer and like a parent advising him.this case epitomizes the criminal defendant need for what the supreme court has called the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceeding against him.powell alabama.
we conclude that lyons trial counsel was incompetent.it is an objectively unreasonable application of hill and strickland for the michigan court of appeals to hold otherwise.
to determine whether lyons was prejudiced by his counsel deficient performance,we ask whether there is a reasonable probability that,had he been advised of the prosecutor right of appeal,he would not have pled guilty.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome it is less than a preponderance of the evidence.strickland,at.
the warden argues that lyons could not have been prejudiced by any deficiency on the part of his trial counsel because lyons acknowledged at the plea hearing in march that he could receive an adult sentence of life imprisonment without parole according to the warden,the fact that lyons might not have been told that the prosecution could appeal the juvenile sentence he was never assured of receiving in the first place should be of no consequence.
the warden maintains that if a defendant is aware of the maximum possible sentence he can not be prejudiced by his counsel failure to inform him of the prosecutor right to appeal.we decline to adopt the warden argument.an awareness of the sentencing range available to the trial judge is not the same as an informed understanding that a sentencing judge decision is subject to reversal.the rule suggested by the warden would preclude courts from finding prejudice in any situation where the defendant knew the range of penalties to which he was subject.
furthermore,the circumstances of this case illustrate the failings of the warden argument.lyons pled guilty in hopes of avoiding life imprisonment without parole.a reduced likelihood of being sentenced as an adult was the sole benefit of lyons guilty plea before chief judge roberson.in reality,the risk of being sentenced as an adult came in two parts being sentenced as an adult by chief judge roberson and having received a juvenile sentence from chief judge roberson,being subject to a successful appeal by the prosecutor.lyons,however,was informed by his attorney,burgess,of only the first risk.burgess failure to assess all the risks and inform his client left lyons to make the most important decision of his life without essential information.presented with all the risks,lyons might well have decided to plead not guilty and to take his chances at trial.
indeed,lyons puts forth evidence that he would have pled not guilty.at the evidentiary hearing on his plea withdrawal motion,lyons testified that he would not have pled guilty had he known of the prosecutor right to appeal.this testimony,though,may be enough by itself to satisfy the prejudice prong under the circumstances here.see magana hofbauer,cir noting that,unlike the seventh and second circuits,this circuit has not explicitly adopted a requirement that in order to establish prejudice a defendant must come forward with objective evidence in addition to his claim that he would have changed his mind about pleading guilty.we need not decide this issue here because other evidence supports lyons claim of prejudice.
at the march plea hearing,burgess told the court that lyons wished to offer a plea of guilty on the basis of burgess belief that he could convince chief judge roberson to sentence lyons as a juvenile.later,at the evidentiary hearing on lyons motion to withdraw his guilty plea,burgess acknowledged the possibility that,had he considered the possibility that the prosecutor would appeal a juvenile sentence,he might not have recommended that lyons plead guilty.both lyons and his counsel testified that lyons relied heavily on the attorney advice thus,evidence that burgess might have changed his recommendation indicates that lyons would have been more likely to demand a trial rather than plead guilty.
lyons testified at the plea withdrawal hearing that,when first presented with burgess advice that he plead guilty,lyons initially wanted to fight and put the government to its burden of proof.burgess corroborated lyons belief that he had defenses to the first degree murder charge.in fact,burgess and lyons had been concentrating almost exclusively on trial preparation up until the date of the trial,when the case was transferred to chief judge roberson.given this background,had burgess advised lyons of all the risks he was facing,lyons might have pled not guilty.
to meet the prejudice requirement under strickland and hill,lyons need only show a reasonable probability that he would have pled not guilty had burgess performance been objectively reasonable.we conclude that lyons and burgess testimony,along with reasonable inferences from the facts and circumstances of this case,are sufficient to demonstrate not only a reasonable probability that lyons would have decided to plead not guilty but also that a contrary conclusion is objectively unreasonable.
iii.conclusion 
we conclude that lyons received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.we further conclude that a decision to the contrary on the facts of this case is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.we therefore affirm the federal district court conditional grant of habeas corpus.
i fully concur with the lead opinion conclusion that lyons counsel was constitutionally ineffective because of the lawyer failure to inform lyons that the state could appeal the decision of the trial judge to sentence him as a juvenile.my reason for writing separately is to explain,in what i regard as an extremely close case,why i find the dissenting opinion less persuasive than the lead opinion.
like the lead opinion,i believe that the michigan court of appeals determination that lyons counsel performed competently was an unreasonable application of strickland washington,d.the dissent,in contrast,finds counsel performance to be constitutionally competent,a conclusion with which i disagree for several reasons.
first,in reaching the conclusion that lyons counsel provided competent representation,the dissent does not address the failure of counsel to inform lyons that the state could appeal the trial judge sentencing decision.the dissent instead focuses solely on whether counsel strategy was reasonable in light of his knowledge of the trial judge sentencing tendencies,thereby overlooking the very omission that in my opinion rendered the performance of lyons counsel deficient.
second,because lyons counsel never considered the possibility of the state appealing the trial judge sentencing decision,his advising lyons to plead guilty to murder can not be considered a reasonable strategic decision to which deference should be accorded.strickland,at.explaining that strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.as the lead opinion notes,a reasonable attorney would have considered the possibility of an appeal before advising lyons to plead guilty under the circumstances of the present case.
finally,i believe that the dissent consideration of the strength of the state case against lyons in assessing whether counsel provided competent representation,including the suggestion that his only available defense was a hope for jury nullification,focuses on the wrong issue.lyons,in my opinion,was entitled to be advised of the possibility of an appeal before deciding whether to plead guilty,because without that knowledge his decision was not based upon all of the relevant facts.although the supreme court has held that the sixth amendment does not require a correct assessment of the risks and benefits of pleading guilty as opposed to proceeding to trial,it recognizes that counsel must at least be aware of such risks,especially where the lack of awareness directly impacts the reasoning behind whatever advice is provided.see mcmann richardson,d questions like these relating to the risks of trial can not be answered with certitude yet a decision to plead guilty must necessarily rest upon counsel answers,uncertain as they may be.united states hanley,cir recognizing that a reversal for ineffective assistance would be in order if the defendant had pled guilty solely in reliance upon his counsel erroneous advice that he would be eligible for parole in the time he received for sentence.
i also agree with the lead opinion that if lyons counsel had informed lyons that the state could appeal the trial judge sentencing decision,a reasonable probability exists that lyons would have proceeded to trial rather than plead guilty.in considering strickland prejudice prong,we are not bound by aedpa deferential standard of review,because the michigan court of appeals never reached the issue of prejudice when it determined that counsel performance was not deficient.see gonzales mckune,cir explaining that because the state court considered only two of three requirements necessary to establish a violation of brady maryland,d,a de novo standard of review applied to the third element.i therefore believe that the dissent application of aedpa objectively unreasonable test to the prejudice component of strickland is not appropriate.williams taylor,d clarifying the meaning of an unreasonable application of law under d.
the dissent concludes that lyons effort to withdraw his guilty plea constituted an attempt to get a second bite at the apple,and that lyons entered his guilty plea voluntarily and with full knowledge of the possible sentence that he faced.i respectfully disagree.although lyons did not seek to withdraw his guilty plea during the state appellate process,the record reflects that he was not advised by his attorney that the state had even appealed.his first knowledge of the state appeal was approximately two years later,when a relative read about the michigan court of appeals decision ordering him to be sentenced as an adult.thus,the dissent inference that lyons was gaming the system is unwarranted under these circumstances.
with respect to whether lyons entered his guilty plea knowingly and intelligently,i believe that the dissent underestimates the significance of a possible appeal in any calculation that lyons or his counsel made.lyons might have believed that he had,say,an chance of being sentenced as a juvenile by the particular trial judge before whom he pled guilty.if he had been advised that the state could appeal,however,he might have evaluated the odds of the trial judge determination being sustained on appeal as only.the risk of the trial judge sentencing decision being reversed on appeal would,in this example,reduce the ultimate likelihood of lyons being sentenced as a juvenile from to only.
we are unable,of course,to determine the exact odds that lyons believed he faced prior to pleading guilty,but the above example illustrates the significance of failing to consider the possibility of the state appealing.the fact that lyons was aware of the maximum penalty he faced does not,therefore,negate the significance of the information that neither he nor his counsel considered.perhaps lyons would have pled guilty even if he had known that the trial judge sentencing decision was not the only hurdle that he had to overcome in order to be sentenced as a juvenile.but he was entitled to be advised of all the risks that he faced before choosing to plead guilty and foregoing his right to a jury trial.
because i am not confident that lyons would h
