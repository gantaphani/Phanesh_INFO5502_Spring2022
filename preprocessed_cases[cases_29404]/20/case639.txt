opinion of the court 
eddie wilson appeals from the district court denial of his habeas petition.wilson is currently detained in a federal facility located in west virginia and is serving an aggregate sentence comprised of sentences that were imposed under the and the at the time of filing his petition,wilson was incarcerated in a federal penitentiary in allenwood,pennsylvania.
in his petition,wilson alleged that the united states parole commission commission had violated his constitutional rights under the due process and ex post facto clauses by denying him parole and refusing to set a presumptive release date.we hold that wilson must obtain a certificate of appealability coa to proceed with this appeal,and we deny his request for issuance of such a certificate.accordingly,we will dismiss wilson appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
in,wilson was convicted of murder and armed assault in the superior court of the district of columbia.he was sentenced to a term of years to life imprisonment under the.in,while serving his sentence in a federal facility,wilson was convicted for possession with intent to distribute a schedule iv controlled substance in violation of,for which he received a sentence.he was also found not guilty of a corresponding charge for possession of a knife.in,wilson sentence was aggregated with his sentence in accordance with chatman bey meese,vacated on other grounds,since,wilson has been engaged in litigation challenging the commission determinations concerning his parole 
wilson,acting pro se,filed a petition with the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania on september.he alleged that the commission had violated his due process rights in and by arbitrarily denying him parole and by retaliating for his success in prior litigation to have certain disciplinary enhancements removed,and violated the constitution ex post facto clause by failing to set a date within his guidelines range,as required under the version of the sentencing reform act sra in effect when his sentence was imposed.
while the petition was pending before the district court,on june,the commission again denied wilson parole and scheduled a reconsideration hearing for april.
by memorandum and order dated february,the district court denied the petition,reasoning that the commission had a rational basis for denying wilson parole,the unusual circumstances of his offenses and wilson was not entitled to benefit from the guarantee under the earlier version of the sra because the commission applied regulations,not the current sra,in declining to set a parole date.the district court also denied wilson request for a coa,explaining that a petitioner who is in custody by virtue of a district of columbia judgment is considered a state prisoner needing a coa,and that wilson had not made the threshold showing for issuance of such a certificate.
wilson requested a coa from this court under c.on october,this court referred the request to a merits panel,appointed counsel for wilson,and instructed that,i n addition to the merits of the appeal,counsel for appellant is directed to address the question of whether a coa is required for this appeal,to the extent that the habeas petition challenges a parole decision regarding a federal sentence.
as a jurisdictional prerequisite to appealing from a denial of a habeas petition,a state prisoner must first seek and obtain a coa from a circuit justice or judge.miller el cockrell,d see also morris horn,cir a habeas petitioner seeking to appeal must obtain a coa in order for the court of appeals to have jurisdiction.citations omitted.congress established the coa requirement as t he primary means of separating meritorious from frivolous appeals that would delay the states ability to impose sentences.barefoot estelle,d.the coa requirement is codified at,which provides in relevant part 
unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability,an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from 
a the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court or 
b the final order in a proceeding under section for correcting erroneous sentences.
id.c.the question here is whether wilson detention pursuant to his aggregated sentence hereafter mixed sentence arises out of process issued by a state court.
it is settled law that a court of the district of columbia is a state court for purposes of section c,and thus a prisoner arrested or convicted pursuant to process or judgment of the courts of the district must obtain a coa.madley parole comm n.as the d.circuit observed in madley,
the federal seat of government is constitutionally different from the states,but congress has created a trial and appellate court system of general jurisdiction for the district separate from the united states courts of which we are a part and intended to serve the district in much the same manner as the court systems of the various states and other large municipal entities.
id.at.in several opinions,this court has repeatedly endorsed madley holding that a prisoner incarcerated for violations is considered a state prisoner who must obtain a coa.see,robinson reilly,app x,cir graves holt,app x,cir keitt parole comm n,app x,cir.we again hold,in light of madley,that prisoners serving offenses must obtain a coa to appeal denial of their habeas petitions 
the more complex question and one for which we have not found direct precedent is whether a petitioner such as wilson,whose sentence was aggregated with his sentence,is still considered to be subject to detention that arises out of process issued by a state court for the purposes of c a coa requirement.we conclude that the aggregation of wilson sentence with his sentence,which wilson received while serving his sentence,does not alter our analysis under c.
in coady vaughn,cir,we held that a state prisoner objecting to a decision by the parole board must obtain a coa because he was challenging his continued detention,which resulted initially from a state court judgment.even though the parole board decision was neither process nor issued by a state court,we looked to the underlying basis for the prisoner initial detention to determine whether a coa was necessary.id.
other courts of appeals that have considered the same issue have similarly construed c a coa requirement as pivoting on whether the initial basis for the detention complained was a state court judgment or process,even when the prisoner is only challenging a decision of the prison board.medberry crosby,cir madley,at greene.dep t of,cir montez mckinna,cir see also hayward marshall,cir en banc,abrogated on other grounds by swarthout cooke,d.but see walker,cir concluding coa was not required because prisoner administrative detention was not something that arises from process issued by the state court.
although coady and cases of its ilk interpreted the language of c a in a slightly different context specifically,in determining whether administrative decisions arose out of process issued by a state court their approach informs the inquiry here.in determining whether a coa is required under c a,a court must ask whether the prisoner detention originated from a state court conviction sentence,even when the prisoner is objecting to a subsequent disciplinary or decision that is distinct from the judgment of conviction.
in view of coady construction of c a,we hold that wilson was required to obtain a coa before this court could entertain his habeas petition.the reason for wilson initial detention was the judgment of conviction issued by a court,which,as discussed above,is considered process issued by a state court pursuant to c a.wilson committed,and was sentenced for,his violation while imprisoned for his offenses meaning that,for the purposes of our analysis,his federal offense and sentence arose out of his sentence similarly,the commission refusals to grant wilson parole and to set a parole release viewed as decisions related to just wilson sentence or to both his and determinations incident to wilson continuing detention for his original offense,and thus,aris e out of proce
