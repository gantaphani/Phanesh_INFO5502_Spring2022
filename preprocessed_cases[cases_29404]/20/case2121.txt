at trial,the government attempted to show that bruce and woodworth followed a similar pattern in robbing four evansville,indiana,banks between october and february.according to the government view,shortly before each robbery,woodworth purchased an older vehicle and affixed to it a stolen license plate.these vehicles then were used to flee the victimized banks,but quickly were abandoned for other transportation.the prosecution also suggested that common characteristics other than the cars linked the robberies the perpetrators carried rifles or shotguns,wore similar clothing such as trench coats or ski masks,and chose late thursday or friday afternoon for each holdup.the government developed itstheory at trial by presenting the following circumstances surrounding each holdup.
for the first robbery,woodworth purchased a black lincoln continental.the following day,october,a friday,he and bruce,disguised in halloween masks and long trench coats and wielding assault rifles,entered an old national bank branch at and robbed the tellers of.the two men then returned to the lincoln,drove it a short distance,and abandoned it for another car.affixed to the abandoned lincoln was a stolen indiana license plate.
for the second robbery,woodworth purchased a dodge van.one week later,on september,a friday,at,woodworth and bruce,using the van,robbed two federal savings employees of as they were attempting to fill an atm machine.woodworth was armed with a shotgun during the holdup.bruce and woodworth drove a short distance from the crime scene and then left the van,bearing a stolen kentucky license plate,for other transportation.

the fourth robbery started out in a similar fashion.on february,woodworth purchased an old blue van and bolted to it a stolen indiana license plate.the following day a thursday at,bruce and he drove the van to another old national bank branch.donning disguises one of the men was also wearing a trench coat and armed again with an assault rifle,they made off with.this time,however,their second vehicle broke down.desperate for transportation,they paid in cash for a blue pickup truck from an henderson,kentucky,police officer.the officer became suspicious when he noticed that the men were carrying shopping bags full of clothes,and one bag had a minnesota license plate sticking out on top.the officer contacted the evansville police,and,less than an hour later,police found bruce and woodworth parking the pickup in a storage facility.the two men had cash from the bank,assault rifles,loaded handguns and ammunition,and a bag with disguises worn during the robbery earlier that day.police later discovered more ammunition,police scanners,and six shotgun shells in a henderson,kentucky,motel room in which the two men had been staying.
bruce and woodworth were charged with four counts of armed bank robbery,a d one count of conspiracy to commit armed bank robbery,a d and four counts of using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,c.each was also individually charged with one count of possession of a firearm by a felon,g.an attorney was appointed defense counsel for bruce.
defense counsel obtained a severance of the counts relating to the fourth robbery from all of the other counts.following a trial on the counts relating to the fourth robbery,defense counsel obtained another severance that separated the counts pertaining to the first three robberies from the counts.the counts subsequently were dismissed by the government.
in july,bruce and woodworth went to trial on the charges relating to the february,robbery.the prosecution presented three days of testimony.defense counsel presented no witnesses and chose only to certain prosecution witnesses.the jury found both men guilty of armed robbery and of the use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.
the court then scheduled a second trial for february,on the remaining counts.on february,at bruce request,his defense counsel moved for a continuance on the ground that bruce had identified potential exculpatory witnesses,and counsel needed time to locate them and to arrange for their appearances.the district court denied that motion on february,but stated that i f a witness should materialize defendant bruce will have the opportunity to move this court to suspend proceedings until the jury can hear the alibi testimony.trial court tc at.
the following morning,immediately before trial was scheduled to begin,bruce sought permission to address the court.at his defense counsel urging,bruce told the court that counsel had ignored his requests to investigate certain alibi witnesses.bruce stated that his defense counsel had visited him the previous week and got real belligerent with me over a letter that i wrote him and explained to him that i needed my witnesses here in court.tc,at.the court asked bruce some general questions about witnesses he wished to call and then announced that it would not entertain any delays to the start of the second trial.
in this second trial,the government presented its case largely through eyewitness identification of bruce as one of the two masked perpetrators of the robberies.in bruce defense,his defense counsel called only one alibi witness,william turberville.turberville testified that bruce dated his daughter,betty thompson,from december until his arrest.turberville said he was with bruce at the michigan state fair on september,and he believed that he was working with bruce at a michigan motel on september,the date of the second robbery.the jury was apparently not persuaded by turberville testimony it returned a verdict against bruce and woodworth on all remaining counts.bruce received stiff sentences for those total of months imprisonment.
nearly two years later,bruce filed a pro se motion under to set aside his convictions based on ineffective assistance of defense counsel.he requested an evidentiary hearing.bruce alleged that his trial defense counsel,who also had served as counsel on direct appeal,was ineffective for failing to investigate the proposed testimony of his alibi witnesses.the district court ordered bruce to supplement his motion with additional facts supporting his claim.in response,bruce proffered the affidavits of betty thompson and edward barton a former,who claimed to have been with bruce on the days that two of the bank robberies occurred.according to bruce,these witnesses were very crucial to this case because they would have given credible testimony of his whereabouts,and no jury would convict the defendant while hearing testimony of witnesses who were with the defendant on the dates in question.post conviction pc at.in her affidavit,thompson asserted that bruce could not have committed a bank robbery in indiana on september,because he was with her at the michigan state fair that day.she further stated that she contacted
