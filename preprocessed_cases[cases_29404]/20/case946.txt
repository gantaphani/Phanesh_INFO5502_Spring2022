richard thomas stitt filed this habeas action pursuant to after exhausting all direct appeals of his convictions of and capital sentence for drug,firearms,and capital murder offenses.the district court rejected stitt claims pertaining to his guilt,but vacated stitt capital sentence after finding that stitt counsel provided constitutionally ineffective representation during the sentencing phase of stitt trial.the government appealed the district court judgment vacating stitt sentence,and we granted stitt a certificate of appealability on his claim that his lawyer was constitutionally ineffective during the guilt phase of stitt trial.we heard argument in this case and thereafter published an opinion affirming the judgment of the district court in all respects and remanding the case for resentencing.see united states stitt,cir.
prior to the issuance of the mandate in this case,we discovered supreme court precedent indicating that we lacked jurisdiction over this appeal.see andrews united states,d.because we have an obligation to inquire into jurisdictional issues sua sponte,see,ridpath bd.of governors marshall,cir,we withheld the issuance of the mandate and directed the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing the jurisdictional question.after consideration of those briefs and the relevant legal authorities,we now conclude that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal.accordingly,we recall our earlier opinion,vacate our judgment,and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
section provides that,if the district court finds that the petitioner is entitled to relief,the court shall vacate and set the judgment aside and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.the statute also provides that a n appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion as from a final judgment on application for a writ of habeas corpus.id.
in andrews,the petitioners challenged the constitutionality of their sentences under.see andrews,at.the district court granted them relief,vacated their sentences,and ordered that they be resentenced.the government appealed,and the district court stayed petitioners resentencing.id.the court of appeals reversed and remanded,but the supreme court set aside the judgment of the court of appeals,holding that the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction.see id.at.the supreme court explained that provides a list of possible remedies that include discharging the prisoner,resentencing him,granting a new trial,or correcting the sentence.see id.at.quoting.the court reasoned that the district court judgment did not become final until it granted the appropriate remedy where,as here,what was appropriately asked and appropriately granted was the resentencing of the petitioners,it is obvious that there could be no final disposition of the proceedings until the petitioners were resentenced.id.at.
the court explained that t he basic reason for the rule against piecemeal interlocutory appeals in the federal system is particularly apparent in the cases before us.until the petitioners are resentenced,it is impossible to know whether the government will be able to show any colorable claim of prejudicial error.id.at.subsequent cases interpreting andrews squarely hold that a district court judgment vacating a sentence does not become thus is not the court has resentenced the defendant.see,united states martin,cir.
in arguing that we should treat the district court judgment as final,the government cites united states gordon.cir,and united states allen,cir.but in those cases the judgment of the district court vacated the convictions and ordered a new trial.gordon,at allen,at.even if we were inclined to follow those cases,a question we need not decide here,they certainly do not govern the appealability of the order at issue here,which,like that in andrews,at,vacated a sentence and returned the case to the trial court for resentencing.in such cases,andrews mandates that there is no final judgment until the prisoners a re resentenced.id.at.
we recognize that,should it decide to reconsider this issue,the supreme court may adopt the government argument and hold that a district court order vacating a capital sentence is an appealable final order.however,if a supreme court precedent has direct application in a case,we must follow it,leaving to the supreme court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.agostini felton,d.in this case,a supreme court precedent,andrews,holds that an order vacating a sentence does not become final until resentencing occurs andrews is controlling and we must follow it.
accordingly,because stitt has not yet been resentenced,we find that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal.we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remand to the district court for resentencing.
dismissed and remanded 
i fully concur in judge motz opinion.i write separately to elaborate on my view that we lack jurisdiction over stitt appeal.while i agree with the government that our holding may lead to an inefficient allocation of resources,i believe that the text of west supp and the supreme court prior interpretation of this us to conclude that jurisdiction is lacking over an appeal of a district court order that grants a petitioner a future capital resentencing hearing,but does not actually accomplish the resentencing itself.
as judge motz notes,andrews united states,d,held that appellate jurisdiction is lacking over a district court order that contemplates a petitioner will be resentenced at some time in the future but does not actually accomplish the task of resentencing the petitioner.id.at.this holding was based on the supreme court interpretation of what is now paragraphs and of paragraph provides that if the district court determines collateral relief is appropriate,it may remedy the petitioner unlawful conviction or sentence in one of four ways the court shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.paragraph provides that a n appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion id.according to the supreme court,a district court order that contemplates a future sentencing is preliminary to an order actually resentenc ing the petitioner under paragraph,and is therefore not the order entered on the motion under paragraph.andrews,at.accordingly,no appeal can be taken from such an order.id.
here,the district court vacated stitt sentence and entered an order stating that it would schedule a hearing to determine stitt appropriate sentence.the district court,however,did not actually conduct a resentencing hearing,and,to this day,it has not done so.accordingly,under a straightforward application of andrews,the district court order is not appealable.
in seeking to avoid this conclusion,the government contends that andrews is distinguishable on the grounds that the district court here ordered that stitt be given a future capital resentencing hearing.at a capital sentencing hearing,unlike a sentencing hearing,the convicted defendant is entitled to a hearing before a jury on the issue of whether death is the appropriate penalty for his crime.see west see also ring arizona,d.according to the government,allowing appellate review of the district court order granting a future capital resentencing hearing avoids the waste of in particular,all of the procedures that attend the jury would arise if appellate review were postponed until after the capital resentencing hearing has occurred and the appellate court has determined that resentencing was not warranted in the first place.in support of its argument,the government points out that appellate jurisdiction exists over an order granting a petitioner a future new trial on the issue of guilt,see united states gordon,cir united states allen,cir united states dunham concrete,cir,a proceeding at which,of course,the petitioner would also have the right to a jury 
the government logic is seductive.indeed,i surmise that one reason congress provided an order granting a future new trial on the issue of guilt is appeal
