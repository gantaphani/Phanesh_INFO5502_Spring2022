background 
on november,heriberto baldayaque baldayaque pled guilty in united states district court to the charge of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute grams or more of heroin,in violation of.at the time he committed this offense,baldayaque,a citizen of the dominican republic,was in the united states illegally.on february,baldayaque was sentenced principally to a term of months imprisonment,a sentence which represented the very bottom of the applicable sentencing guidelines range at sentencing,the court stated 
t his is a very difficult sentence to impose.it is harsh,but the facts require it.if the government should at some time choose to deport baldayaque at a point prior to the expiration of his sentence,the court would have no objection and would not deem that to be an inappropriate action to take with regard to baldayaque.
baldayaque appealed to the second circuit,and on february,his conviction and sentence were affirmed.baldayaque did not seek review in the supreme court.
the following facts were established at an evidentiary hearing held by the district court on the habeas petition.the witnesses accounts differ as to the precise chronology of the events described.however,the variations among their accounts as to the timeline do not affect the outcome of this appeal.
within a matter of days after we affirmed his conviction and sentence,baldayaque asked his wife,christina rivera rivera,to hire an attorney to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on his behalf.baldayaque described the motion he wanted filed as a.rivera and baldayaque each spoke only spanish at that time,so rivera sought assistance in finding an attorney from reverend brixeida marquez marquez,who spoke both english and spanish.marquez and rivera chose attorney burton weinstein weinstein and together went to weinstein office to retain him on baldayaque behalf in february.
marquez and rivera testified that on this first visit to weinstein they asked weinstein to file a even though neither woman knew what a was.marquez testified that weinstein did not seem to know what a was.weinstein asked the women to get baldayaque sentencing transcript and other papers for him,and stated that he would look into the case.weinstein testified that he did not recall being asked to file a section petition.weinstein also testified that his notes of the meeting indicated that the women requested he file a motion for commutation of sentence based on baldayaque willingness to consent to immediate deportation.
rivera and marquez delivered the sentencing documents to weinstein office,apparently sometime in early march.at some point after that,weinstein told rivera and marquez that his normal fee was,but that he would accept a payment of to take the case because marquez was a reverend.rivera and marquez raised the money from friends and neighbors and by selling homemade food and delivered the money to weinstein.
on march,rivera and marquez met with weinstein again prior to this meeting,weinstein had reviewed baldayaque sentencing transcript,but he had not done any legal research.at the meeting,weinstein told rivera and marquez it was too late to file a.in fact,at the time of this meeting,baldayaque still had nearly fourteen months remaining within which he could file a timely petition.weinstein also told them not to worry,because he had good news for them the dominican republic had said it would accept baldayaque if he were deported,and weinstein thought they could get baldayaque deported early because he was very sick 
weinstein met with marquez and rivera on two or three occasions.he never spoke directly with baldayaque.after they paid the,rivera and marquez did not see weinstein again however,marquez called weinstein about once a month.weinstein assured her that he was just waiting for a court date and that he was taking care of everything.
on november,weinstein filed a motion for modification of baldayaque sentence to permit him to be deported immediately.the motion cited no authority.
on january,baldayaque sent a letter to the clerk of court inquiring whether weinstein was still representing me.the clerk responded to baldayaque on february,informing him that weinstein was still his attorney of record,and that his motion was still pending.a copy of the clerk letter was sent to weinstein and to the assistant united states attorney handling the case.weinstein did not attempt to contact baldayaque after receiving a copy of the letter.
weinstein motion was denied by the district court on june.the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction to order the relief requested,immediate deportation,and that the motion was untimely even if cognizable under.c.on june,weinstein sent a letter to baldayaque informing him that the motion had been denied,and that he saw no basis for an appeal.however,this letter was returned to weinstein as undeliverable,and baldayaque never received it.weinstein spoke to marquez on the phone,informing her that the motion had been denied and telling her there is nothing we can do now.by then,the limitations period for filing a section petition had expired.weinstein took no further action on behalf of baldayaque.
on february,eighteen months after the motion filed by weinstein had been denied,baldayaque filed a pro se motion pursuant to rule,requesting modification of his sentence.the district court denied the motion on august,and in its order informed baldayaque of the requirements for filing a section petition.believing that this meant he still had a right to file a habeas petition,baldayaque filed a section petition pro se in november.the district court denied the petition as untimely,and issued a certificate of appealability on the question of equitable tolling.see baldayaque united states,jba,wl,at.this appeal followed.
discussion 
the district court had federal question jurisdiction because baldayaque filed his petition pursuant to.appellate jurisdiction is appropriate because the district court entered a final order denying the petition and issued a certificate of appealability on the issue of equitable tolling.the appeal was timely filed.
i.the district court ruling 
we review a district court denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus de novo and its factual findings for clear error.ponnapula spitzer,cir internal citations omitted.
the district court dismissed baldayaque petition because it was untimely under the limitations period imposed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa.baldayaque time for seeking direct review of his conviction and sentence in the supreme court expired on may.accordingly,he had until may,to file a petition pursuant to.see clay united states,d a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court affirmation of the conviction.green united states,cir congress imposed a period of limitation on section motions,which runs,in this case,from the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.baldayaque filed his pro se petition on november,more than months late.
however,the court believed that the facts of baldayaque case suggested that the limitations period might be equitably tolled,rendering the petition timely.see green,at holding that equitable tolling is available for petitions filed pursuant to.the court appointed counsel for baldayaque to address the question of equitable tolling,and conducted an evidentiary hearing at which rivera,marquez,baldayaque and weinstein testified.
equitable relief such as tolling may be awarded in the court discretion only upon consideration of all the facts and circumstances.vitarroz borden,cir.
to equitably toll the limitations period,a petitioner must show that extraordinary circumstances prevented him from filing his petition on time,and he must have acted with reasonable diligence throughout the period he seeks to toll.to show that extraordinary circumstances prevented him from filing his petition on time,petitioner must demonstrate a causal relationship between the extraordinary circumstances on which the claim for equitable tolling rests and the lateness of his filing,a demonstration that can not be made if the petitioner,acting with reasonable diligence,could have filed on time notwithstanding the extraordinary circumstances.hence,if the person seeking equitable tolling has not exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to file after the extraordinary circumstances began,the link of causation between the extraordinary circumstances and the failure to file is broken,and the extraordinary circumstances therefore did not prevent timely filing.
hizbullahankhamon walker,cir,cert.denied,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
the district court found that extraordinary circumstances,specifically,weinstein conduct,prevented baldayaque from filing his motion within the appropriate time period.see baldayaque,wl,at.however,the district court found that second circuit precedent precluded it from applying equitable tolling where the extraordinary circumstances present were a result of malfeasance by the petitioner attorney.see id.at.the district court concluded 
because baldayaque did everything that could have been expected of him and because he went to extraordinary ends to have a motion filed on his behalf,the court would,but for the smaldone line of cases,equitably toll the limitations period in accordance with smith mcginnis,cir.however,smaldone is controlling,and baldayaque motion must be denied as untimely.
we must accept the district court finding of fact that baldayaque did everything that could have been expected of him and went to extraordinary ends to have a motion filed on his behalf unless clearly erroneous.the district court finding that our ruling in smaldone precluded the application of equitable tolling in this case is a matter of law that we review de novo.
ii.smaldone 
in smaldone,the court reviewed the district court dismissal of a habeas petition on timeliness grounds.see smaldone,at.the petitioner was convicted in state court,and after his conviction was affirmed on appeal,he sought collateral relief in state court.while his state court petition was pending,the petitioner filed a federal habeas petition,which was dismissed without prejudice because,as his state court petition had not yet been acted on,the petitioner had not exhausted his state remedies.the petitioner attorney believed that when a petitioner was pursuing state remedies,the limitations period of aedpa was reset and began running anew after the state court issued its decision.the petitioner accordingly filed his renewed federal petition,through counsel,within one year of the denial of relief in the state courts.unfortunately,the attorney was wrong the rule is not that the period is reset by the filing of a state petition,but that the time is tolled during the pendency of the state petition.the federal petition which the attorney eventually filed was untimely under this rule.we held that the petitioner attorney error did not justify the application of equitable tolling.see id.at.
equitable tolling is only appropriate in rare and exceptional circumstances.to merit application of equitable tolling,the petitioner must demonstrate that he acted with reasonable diligence during the period he wishes to have tolled,but that despite his efforts,extraordinary circumstances beyond his control prevented successful filing during that time.
this circuit,like her sisters,has found attorney error inadequate to create the extraordinary circumstances equitable tolling requires.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted collecting cases.the district court interpreted this language to bar the application of equitable tolling to any case in which the cause of the petition being untimely was the malfeasance of the petitioner attorney.see baldayaque,wl,at.we do not believe that smaldone holding is so.
smaldone relied on the court holding in geraci senkowski,cir,that a mistake by counsel as to the calculation of time remaining to file a petition did not constitute extraordinary or unusual circumstances that would justify equitable tolling of the aedpa limitation period.while it is true that the attorney errors present in smaldone and geraci did not constitute extraordinary circumstances sufficient to support equitable tolling,smaldone does not dictate that the actions of a petitioner attorney could never constitute extraordinary circumstances.see chapman choicecare long island term disability plan,cir t he kind of attorney errors at issue in cases where equitable tolling was denied differ materially from the error at issue in the instant case.it is not inconsistent to say that attorney error normally will not constitute the extraordinary circumstances required to toll the aedpa limitations period while acknowledging that at some point,an attorney behavior may be so outrageous or so incompetent as to render it extraordinary.
weinstein actions in this case are distinguishable from the attorney conduct in smaldone and geraci.the attorneys in smaldone and geraci made simple mistakes about the rules applied to the deadlines for filing of habeas petitions.such mistakes are ordinary.weinstein actions,taken together,were extraordinary.
in spite of being specifically directed by his client representatives to file a,weinstein failed to file such a petition at all.by refusing to do what was requested by his client on such a fundamental matter,weinstein violated a basic duty of an attorney to his client.see in re agent orange prod.liab,cir as a matter of professional responsibility,an attorney owes a duty of loyalty to his client.this duty encompasses an obligation to defer to the client wishes on major litigation decisions.
weinstein did no legal research on baldayaque case.weinstein failed to comply with rule of the connecticut rules of professional conduct,which requires a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client,which requires the legal knowledge,skill,thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.emphasis added.had weinstein made a cursory review of the law,he would have discovered that it was not too late to file a section petition when he met with rivera and marquez in in fact,he would have discovered that he had until may to file such a petition within the limitations period.
weinstein never spoke to or met baldayaque.when his letter to baldayaque was returned,weinstein made no effort to locate baldayaque.weinstein failed to keep his client reasonably informed about the status of the case and failed to explain the matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit baldayaque to make informed decisions regarding the representation,as required by connecticut rule of professional conduct.
weinstein actions were far enough outside the range of behavior that reasonably could be expected by a client that they may be considered extraordinary.in valverde stinson,cir,we held that the confiscation of the petitioner legal papers by a corrections officer shortly before the section filing deadline was extraordinary as a matter of law.that was so even though the usual problems inherent in being incarcerated do not justify equitable tolling.likewise,while the normal errors made by attorneys may not justify equitable tolling,extreme situations such as the one presented here require a different result.accordingly,we hold that an attorney conduct,if it is sufficiently egregious,may constitute the sort of extraordinary circumstances that would justify the application of equitable tolling to the limitations period of aedpa.
iii.reasonable diligence and causation 
the presence of extraordinary circumstances is not enough,however,to justify the application of equitable tolling.a petitioner must also show that he acted with reasonable d
