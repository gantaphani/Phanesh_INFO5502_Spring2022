andrew moss appeals from a decision of the united states district court for the southern district of new york crotty,denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought pursuant to.during the state trial testimony of the undercover officers involved in moss arrest,the state trial court closed the courtroom to the general public to protect the safety of the officers.moss appealed his conviction,arguing that the closure of the courtroom during the testimony of one of the officers violated his sixth amendment right to a public trial.the new york court of appeals affirmed his conviction.see people echevarria.
in this appeal,moss asserts that the new york court of appeals decision is contrary to,or involves an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court in waller georgia,and presley georgia,per curiam.in particular,moss contends that the new york court of appeals incorrectly held that a reviewing court may infer from the record that a trial court fulfilled its obligation to consider alternatives to closure,and that the new york court of appeals unreasonably concluded that the government had established an overriding interest justifying closure.the district court denied the petition and,applying the deferential standard of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,pub,stat,we affirm its judgment.limited as we are by aedpa deferential standard,on the record before us,we can not conclude that the new york court of appeals decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established law or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.
background 
andrew moss was arrested in july for selling crack cocaine to an undercover officer known as uc near west street and broadway in manhattan.he was charged in new york state supreme court with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree,in violation of penal law.
before moss trial,the government requested that the court limit access to the courtroom during the testimony of uc and another undercover officer identified as uc the trial court held a hearing,at which both undercover officers testified,to consider the request.following the officers testimony,the trial court indicated that it had tentatively determined,subject to hearing further from counsel,to keep the general public out when these two undercovers testify.joint app.at.moss counsel objected to the closure and suggested,as an alternative,that an officer be stationed at the courtroom door to screen individuals wishing to enter.the trial court did not expressly assess this proposed alternative.instead,the trial court ruled that,in light of its concerns for the undercover officers safety,it would close the courtroom to the public during their testimony,with the exception of moss mother and any other family members who did not live in the area of the arrest.if any family members who lived in the area of the arrest wished to observe trial during the testimony of the undercover officers,the trial court determined that it would face those decisions when they arise.joint app.at.
the case proceeded to trial and moss was convicted.moss appealed his conviction contending,inter alia,that the trial court closure of the courtroom violated his sixth amendment rights.the new york supreme court,appellate division unanimously affirmed.see people moss,dep t.the new york court of appeals then granted review in moss case,together with the cases of two other defendants raising similar sixth amendment challenges.it then found no reversible error in the closures in each case,while reversing the conviction of one of the other two defendants on unrelated,jury instruction grounds.see echevarria,at.

discussion 
we review a district court decision denying a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo.dixon miller,cir.aedpa instructs that an application for a writ of habeas corpus shall not be granted where a state court adjudicated the claim on the merits,unless that adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.to conclude that a state court decision involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,the petitioner must show that the state court applied the law in a manner that was objectively unreasonable.davis ayala,quoting mitchell esparza,per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.a state court determination that a claim lacks merit is not objectively unreasonable if fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court decision.harrington richter,quoting yarborough alvarado.
the sixth amendment,by way of the fourteenth amendment,guarantees a state criminal defendant the right to a speedy and public trial.const.amend.vi.however,the right to a public trial is not absolute and may give way in certain cases to other rights or interests.waller georgia.in those rare instances,the balance of interests must be struck with special care.id.to aid courts in this balancing act of determining whether a courtroom closure is justified,the supreme court articulated the following test in waller the party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced if the courtroom is not closed,the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest,the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding,and the trial court must make findings adequate to support the closure.id.at.in presley georgia,per curiam,the supreme court clarified that under the third prong of waller,trial courts are required to consider alternatives to closure even when they are not offered by the parties.at.moreover,the court instructed that t rial courts are obligated to take every reasonable measure to accommodate public attendance at criminal trials.id.at.
moss appeal focuses on waller first and third prongs the government overriding interest,and the trial court consideration of alternatives to closure.we conclude with respect to both issues that the new york court of appeals decision was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.
with respect to waller first prong,the new york court of appeals correctly articulated the standard for determining whether an overriding interest exists that justifies closure.see echevarria,at.it recognized that,while t he safety of law enforcement officers unquestionably may constitute an overriding interest,id.at quoting people ramos,the party moving for closure still must demonstrate a substantial probability that the identified interest will be prejudiced by an open courtroom,id.quoting.superior court.in finding that the government had met its burden,the new york court of appeals noted that uc continued to work in the area of the arrest,had received numerous threats in the past,had encountered suspects in the courthouse,and had taken steps to protect his identity when entering courthouses.see id.at.it held that,t aken together,the record amply supports the trial court determination that a specific link existed between the officer safety and his testimony.id.at.in light of the record before us,we can not conclude that the new york court of appeals unreasonably applied the law in reaching that conclusion.see rodriguez miller,cir.affirming denial of habeas petition where t he undercover officer had been threatened before and int
