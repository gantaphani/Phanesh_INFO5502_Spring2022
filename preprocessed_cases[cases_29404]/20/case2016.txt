the immigration and naturalization service agency initiated removal proceedings against carlos gonzalez in august of as a result of his conviction in the circuit court of cook county,illinois,for possession of a controlled substance,cocaine.it also placed gonzalez in physical civil immigration custody under the authority of c of the immigration and nationality act ina,c.after an immigration judge ij denied gonzalez request for bond,citing c mandatory detention requirement,gonzalez filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.see.his petition alleged that he was entitled to immediate release because c mandatory detention requirement was unconstitutional as applied to him.the district court agreed and issued the writ the government timely appealed.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we must reverse the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
gonzalez is a native and citizen of el salvador.he entered the united states in and became a lawful permanent resident of this country in.in november of,gonzalez was found guilty of possession of a controlled substance,cocaine,in violation of illinois law,see ilcs c,and was sentenced to two years of probation.accordingly,the agency placed gonzalez in removal proceedings in august of.it charged him with removability as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony,see a a iii and as an alien convicted of a state law relating to a controlled substance,see a b i the agency also placed him in physical civil immigration custody pending his removal proceedings under the authority of c 
on october,an ij held a redetermination hearing,referred to by gonzalez counsel as the equivalent of a joseph hearing.the ij determined that gonzalez was subject to mandatory detention pending removal proceedings under c because he was removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and of a state drug offense.therefore,bond was not available to gonzalez.
gonzalez did not appeal the ij decision to the board of immigration appeals bia,but,on october,he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.he sought an order compelling the agency to conduct an individualized bond determination.his petition alleged that he was not deportable under c b because he was not convicted of either an aggravated felony,see a a iii,or a state law relating to a controlled substance,see a b i.his contention that he was not convicted for immigration purposes was based on illinois law,which provides that probationary dispositions,such as the one gonzalez received,are not conviction s.ilcs g mandating that a probationary disposition is not a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime.he maintained that c mandatory detention requirement violated his right to due process under the fifth and fourteenth amendments because he raised a argument that he would not in fact be deported.
district court proceedings 
as a threshold matter,the district court held that gonzalez was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies by appealing to the bia the ij determination that he was ineligible for bond.the court determined that his case was excepted from the exhaustion requirement because the ins authorities are of course bound to conform to section c,so that any attempt by gonzalez to challenge his detention before them would be an exercise in total futility.at.
as to the merits,the district court first noted that under illinois law probationary dispositions are not conviction s.ilcs g.because both removability grounds charged against gonzalez required a convict ion,see a a iii a b i,the court held there was a serious substantive legal question regarding his deportability.at.that being the case,it concluded that gonzalez right to due process under the fifth and fourteenth amendments would be violated if he were subject to mandatory detention under c.
discussion 
we believe it first would be helpful to set out a brief overview of the procedures at issue in this case.section c requires the attorney general to take into custody and mandatorily detain certain aliens.see c the attorney general shall take into custody any alien who.included in this list are aliens who are deportable because they have been convicted of an aggravated felony,a a iii,or convicted of violating a state law relating to a controlled substance,a b i.c b.after the agency takes an alien into custody and orders him mandatorily detained under c,a joseph hearing before an ij is immediately provided if the alien claims he is not covered by c.demore kim,d see also d d explaining that an ij may redetermine the initial custody and bond determination of the district director any time before a final deportation order h ii providing that an alien may seek a determination by an immigration judge that the alien is not properly included within c.at the hearing,the detainee may avoid mandatory detention by demonstrating that he is not an alien,was not convicted of the predicate crime,or that the ins is otherwise substantially unlikely to establish that he is in fact subject to mandatory detention.kim.at citations omitted see also in re joseph,bia lexis,at bia noting that a joseph hearing provides an alien the opportunity to offer evidence and legal authority on the question whether the service has properly included him within a category that is subject to mandatory detention.thus,the ij must necessarily look forward to what is likely to be shown during the hearing on the underlying removal case.id.at.
the ij ultimate decision may be based upon any information that is available to the ij or that is presented to him or her by the alien or the service.d.if the ij determines the alien does fall within c,then he is without authority to conduct an individualized bond determination.see h i e.however,if the ij determines the alien does not fall within c,then he may consider the question of bond.see in re joseph,bia,bia lexis,at a determination in favor of an alien on this issue does not lead to automatic release.it simply allows an ij to consider the question of bond.the ij ruling then may be appealed to the bia for review under the same governing principles.see d d explaining that an alien may appeal to the bia an ij custody and bond determinations.
with this structure in mind,we turn to gonzalez petition.gonzalez challenges c mandatory detention as applied to detainees,such as him,who raise what his counsel characterized as a argument that they will not in fact be deported.before reaching that contention,however,we must address two threshold matters.first,we must ensure that we have subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate gonzalez claim.next,we must consider whether gonzalez is required to exhaust his administrative remedies by appealing to the bia before bringing his claim via a writ of habeas corpus to federal court.
subject matter jurisdiction 
although both parties agree that e does not deprive this court of jurisdiction,we have an independent duty to verify our subject matter jurisdiction before proceeding.see steel citizens for a better env t,d.section e states the attorney general discretionary judgment regarding the application of this section shall not be subject to review.no court may set aside any action or decision by the attorney general under this section regarding the detention or release of any alien or the grant,revocation,or denial of bond or parole.arguably,gonzalez is contesting a discretionary judgment or decision by the attorney general to detain him under c,and therefore,under e,no court may set aside that decision.
that very argument,however,was rejected by this court in parra perryman,cir,and more recently,by the supreme court in demore kim,d.in both kim and parra,aliens who were mandatorily detained under c challenged that section as unconstitutional.the supreme court in kim,consistent with this court earlier decision in parra,held that it was not deprived of jurisdiction by e to consider a challenge such as this one because the petitioner was not simply challenging a discretionary judgment by the attorney general or a decision that the attorney general has made regarding his detention or release.rather,the petitioner challenges the statutory framework that permits his detention without bail.id.at citing parra,at section e likewise deals with challenges to operational decisions,rather than to the legislation establishing the framework for those decisions.
the supreme court relied on two rules of statutory construction w here congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to do so must be clear,kim.at quoting webster doe,d,and where a provision precluding review is claimed to bar habeas review,the court has required a particularly clear statement that such is congress intent,id.citing ins cyr,d.with these principles as guidance,the supreme court concluded section e contains no explicit provision barring habeas review,and we think that its clear text does not bar respondent constitutional challenge to the legislation authorizing his detention without bail.id.
gonzalez,like the petitioners in kim and parra,is not challenging operational decisions of the attorney general,parra,at,but the statutory framework that permits his detention without bail,kim.at.gonzalez is different in one respect from the petitioners in kim and parra he did not concede his deportability.one might argue that this case is therefore different because here a discretionary decision or even just a decision is necessary to determine whether gonzalez is deportable and thus within c ambit.this decision,as the argument might proceed,is not subject to review under e.
that distinction,however,is illusory.the attorney general necessarily must make a decision that all detainees are deportable or inadmissible in order to detain them under c,even if they concede their deportability.as noted above,the supreme court and this circuit have not been persuaded such a decision is within e ban on review.furthermore,such a distinction ignores the supreme court blanket holding in kim that congress language in e was simply not clear enough to overcome the presumption that it was not depriving the federal courts of jurisdiction over constitutional questions,a presumption which is even stronger in the habeas context.see kim.at.in sum,therefore,we conclude that kim and parra control this case for purposes of the e analysis.accordingly,we hold that we have subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate gonzalez habeas claim.
exhaustion of administrative remedies 
gonzalez did not appeal to the bia the ij october,decision that he fell within c.the only question,therefore,is whether he was required to take such a step before filing a habeas petition.the district court determined that he was not because he was excepted from the exhaustion requirement.we review that determination de novo.see united states castor,cir reviewing de novo a district court determination regarding exhaustion in the context of a habeas petition brought under c.
the exhaustion requirement can be statutorily created or judicially created exhaustion.the difference is key.most agency organic acts do not address exhaustion.when they do,however,courts are not free simply to apply the common law exhaustion doctrine with its pragmatic,judicially defined exceptions.courts must,of course,apply the terms of the statute.ii kenneth davis et,administrative law treatise,at ed beharry ashcroft,cir noting the distinction between statutorily and judicially imposed exhaustion is pivotal because statutory exhaustion requirements are mandatory,while the judicial exhaustion doctrine is discretionary and includes a number of exceptions glisson united states forest,cir t o the extent that exhaustion is a doctrine of federal common law rather than the inflexible command of a statute,it is to be applied with due regard for its underlying purpose and for considerations that may in particular cases counsel for a waiver.therefore,were we reviewing gonzalez request that he be excepted from exhaustion on the basis of futility in the context of a statutorily mandated exhaustion requirement,our lone question would be whether congress intended such an exception.see booth churner,d instructing that courts should not read futility or other exceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements where congress has provided otherwise united states,cir considering a request that the exhaustion requirement of d be excused because appeal to the bia would be futile and noting recent supreme court cases construing the contemporaneous exhaustion requirements of the prison litigation reform act suggest strongly that futility excuses will not go far.
however,exhaustion of administrative remedies is not statutorily mandated in gonzalez case.the ina mandates exhaustion in order to challenge final order s of removal.d.however,this provision does not cover challenges to preliminary custody or bond determinations,which are quite distinct from final order s of removal.see gornicka ins,cir i t is clear bond hearings are separate and apart from deportations hearings a bond determination is not a final order of deportation and does not effect sic the deportation proceeding.also,congress requires exhaustion for certain types of habeas petitions,but not for those petitions,such as gonzalez,brought under.see james walsh,cir section b requires state prisoners to exhaust all available state court remedies before filing a section petition,whereas section contains no such exhaustion requirement.
w here congress has not clearly required exhaustion,sound judicial discretion governs.mccarthy madigan,d in exercising that discretion,we must balance the individual and institutional interests involved,taking into account the nature of the claim presented and the characteristics of the particular administrative procedure provided.id.at.we start with the general rule that parties exhaust prescribed administrative remedies before seeking relief from the federal courts.id.at.see also sanchez miller,cir accord.this rule,however,is not absolute.we have held that individual interests demand that exhaustion be excused when 
requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies causes prejudice,due to unreasonable delay or an indefinite timeframe for administrative action the agency lacks the ability or competence to resolve the issue or grant the relief requested appealing through the administrative process would be futile because the agency is biased or has predetermined the issue or where substantial constitutional questions are raised.

gonzalez does not suggest that an unreasonable delay would have resulted from an appeal to the bia.rather,consistent with the district court,he relies on a combination of the latter three exceptions.specifically,he argues that an appeal to the bia would have been futile,and thus unnecessary,because the bia is without jurisdiction to decide constitutional questions,such as the due process question he presented to the district court.in relying on the futility exception,gonzalez faces a heavy burden because futility only exists if there is no reasonable prospect that gonzalez could obtain any relief by pursuing an appeal to the bia.health equity res.urbana,sullivan,cir.although we ultimately agree that futility high standard is met in this case,we can not accept gonzalez suggested broad rationale for this holding.
gonzalez challenge is ultimately a constitutional one,and an exception to the exhaustion requirement has been carved out for constitutional challenges to agency procedures because the bia has no jurisdiction to adjudicate constitutional issues.see rashtabadi ins,cir.although his ultimate challenge is constitutional,the premise of his constitutional argument is statutory.gonzalez argues that,because he has raised a argument that he is not in fact deportable under the statute,to mandatorily detain him under c would violate his rights to due process under the law.his predicate statutory argument regarding his deportability is that he was not convicted for purposes of a a iii a b i,and therefore,he was not legally deportable under those sections or eligible for mandatory detention under c b.
