when we heard argument,two matters were consolidated before us ishak petition for review of the board of immigration appeals bia denial of his motion to reconsider its decision refusing him asylum and ordering his removal and ishak appeal from the district court dismissal,for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,of the habeas corpus petition he had brought to contest his deportation.
before we had decided,the real id act of,stat.real id act,went into effect.this gave new and dispositive support to the district court holding that it lacked jurisdiction over ishak habeas claims.it also,however,transferred these same claims to our court,in the form of a new,petition for review.because of the relevance of the real id act,we invited the parties to submit supplemental briefing containing their views on its effects here.we now affirm the district court dismissal of the habeas corpus petition for lack of jurisdiction,and we dismiss on the merits both ishak original petition for review and the new petition for review established by operation of the real id act relative to ishak habeas claims in the district court.
background 
ishak,a native and citizen of egypt,entered the united states on june,as a tourist.he overstayed his visa and applied for asylum on july,claiming that he suffered past persecution on account of his religion,coptic orthodox christianity,his membership in a particular social group,and his political opinion.ishak also applied for withholding of removal,voluntary departure,and relief under the convention against torture.
an asylum officer of the immigration and naturalization service ins conducted an interview of ishak and determined that he was ineligible for asylum.the asylum officer outlined her assessment in a memorandum in which she recommended referral to an immigration judge ij.the ins denied ishak asylum application and referred the case to the immigration court for further proceedings.
on february,the ij held a hearing at which ishak testified.the ij rendered an oral decision,denying ishak applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture,and granting voluntary departure in lieu of removal.in his oral decision,the ij reviewed various parts of the record,including the asylum officer assessment memorandum,which he recited verbatim.the ij further stated that he had observed the demeanor of ishak during the time he had testified and found his testimony to be less than candid,his answers to be rambling,his answers not responsive to the questions asked,and his testimony not credible concerning the reasons for his leaving egypt and not wanting to return to egypt.
ishak filed a timely appeal with the bia.he argued that he had provided sufficient evidence to establish his eligibility for asylum.in the alternative,he contended that he had been denied a fair hearing because of the lack of competent translation,the inability to the asylum officer after the ij reliance on her findings,and the ij antagonistic questioning on.
on august,the bia dismissed the appeal.the bia found that the ij adverse credibility finding was supported by the record.specifically,the bia noted that it agree d with the ij characterization that ishak provided unresponsive answers and was evasive when the ij asked questions to clarify implausibilities and inconsistencies in his testimony.the bia also found that ishak testimony regarding his arrest and false accusation was too implausible and had too many unresolved inconsistencies to establish his eligibility for asylum.moreover,as to ishak claim that he had no opportunity to the asylum officer after the ij had relied on her findings,the bia found that the ij had merely agreed with the asylum officer credibility finding,but had made his own credibility finding based on his own observations at the merits hearing.
ishak did not file with this court a petition for direct review of the bia decision disposing of his appeal.see a,b.on september,ishak instead filed a timely motion with the bia to reconsider its august,decision dismissing his appeal.ishak repeated the arguments he had made in his appeal,and asserted that the bia had made errors of fact and law in conflict with this court june decision of el moraghy ashcroft,cir,issued after he had filed his appeal but before the bia entered its own decision dismissing the appeal.ishak claimed that,in light of el moraghy,the ij had misused the country condition reports as a test for corroboration.see id.at.
on december,the bia rejected ishak motion to reconsider.the bia stated that it had considered the same arguments made by ishak in the motion to reconsider before rendering an initial decision in his case.the bia decline d to revisit those arguments and denied the motion.
on december,ishak filed with this court a timely petition for direct review of the bia denial of reconsideration.see b.in his petition for review,ishak requested a stay of removal,which this court denied.
on january,while the above petition for review of the bia denial of reconsideration was pending in this court,ishak filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts a petition for writ of habeas corpus,pursuant to,alleging that the immigration authorities had denied him the right to a fair and impartial hearing.he contended that the ij had misused the country condition reports and had failed to make independent findings,as required by el moraghy,and that the ij questioning on was indicative of the unfair hearing he received.the united states filed a return to the habeas petition,arguing that the district court lacked habeas jurisdiction.according to the government,determinations of the kind ishak sought to have reviewed in the district court could only be reviewed by the court of appeals in a statutory petition for review.as ishak had failed to pursue that avenue when open to him,the district court lacked jurisdiction to deal with the issues that could have been but were not presented via the review petition mechanism.
on january,the district court dismissed ishak habeas petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.ishak timely appealed to this court from the dismissal order.by order dated january,this court granted ishak emergency motion for stay of removal.we then consolidated ishak petition for review of the bia denial of the motion to reconsider and his appeal from the district court dismissal of the habeas petition.
the above matters were briefed and argued to us.before we could render a decision,however,the president signed into law the real id act,stat.this legislation largely mooted the parties original arguments concerning whether the district court had habeas jurisdiction to resolve the due process claims ishak put to that court.the real id act provides unequivocally that a petition for direct review in the court of appeals shall be the exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal,and that cases pending in the district court on the date of enactment challenging a final deportation order shall be transferred,in the form of petitions for review,to the courts of appeals.real id act,stat.at.cases so transferred are not subject to the filing deadline in section b of the immigration and nationality act ina.id.c,stat.at see infra.
because of the real id act relevance,we invited and received supplemental briefing from the parties on its impact upon their contentions.with the benefit of this additional briefing,we now address,in their altered form,the issues before us.
jurisdiction of the district courta.under prior law 
prior to enactment of the real id act,the courts of appeals were divided over whether the district courts possessed habeas jurisdiction to consider constitutional challenges to deportation orders that aliens could but did not raise by means of direct petitions for review filed in the courts of appeals our circuit had left open whether,in a case like ishak,habeas review was an alternative to a petition for review in the court of appeals.see seale ins,cir.
in its original argument made to us prior to enactment of the real id act,the government contended that,under law,ishak lacked the right to challenge his deportation by habeas corpus.it argued that the provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat,stripped the district court of jurisdiction over habeas petitions brought by aliens.ishak replied that,to the contrary,the supreme court decision in ins cyr,d,addressing the deportation of criminal aliens,should be broadly read to provide that,notwithstanding aedpa and iirira,district courts retained habeas jurisdiction over aliens objections to a deportation order.id.at.those arguments are no longer germane,however,given enactment of the real id act which,in the plainest of language,deprives the district courts of jurisdiction in removal cases 
impact of the real id act 
shortly after briefing and oral argument in this case,the real id act took effect.see,stat.the real id act amended section of the ina,to place review of all final removal orders,for both criminal and aliens,in the courts of appeals.see a,amended by real id act,stat.at.by channeling review to the courts of appeals,congress sought to streamline what it saw as bifurcated and piecemeal review of orders of removal.see conf,at.
section a b of the real id act created new ina a,which expressly bars habeas review,pursuant to,of final orders of removal 
exclusive means of any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,including section of title,united states code,or any other habeas corpus provision,and sections and of such title,a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of this act,except as provided in subsection e.for purposes of this act,in every provision that limits or eliminates judicial review or jurisdiction to review,the terms judicial review and jurisdiction to review include habeas corpus review pursuant to section of title,united states code,or any other habeas corpus provision,sections and of such title,and review pursuant to any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory.
a,amended by real id act a b,stat.at.
section a b of the real id act also created new ina a,which provides 
notwithstanding any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,including section of title,united states code,or any other habeas corpus provision a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means of judicial review of any cause or claim under the united nations convention against torture and other forms of cruel,inhuman,or degrading treatment or punishment 
a,amended by real id act a b,stat.at.
the real id act also amended ina b,which now provides 
judicial review of all questions of law and fact,including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions,arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the united states under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section.except as otherwise provided in this section,no court shall have jurisdiction,by habeas corpus under section of title,united states code,or any other habeas corpus provision,by section or of such title,or by any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,to review such an order or such questions of law or fact.
b,amended by real id act a,stat.at emphasis added 
the real id act provided that the amendments shall take effect on may,the date of the enactment of the real id act,and shall apply to cases in which the final order of removal was issued before,on,or after may.real id act b,stat.at.the plain language of these amendments,in effect,strips the district court of habeas jurisdiction over final orders of removal,including orders issued prior to enactment of the real id act.as ishak final order of removal was issued before may,the provisions enacted by the real id act apply to this case.it is thus academic whether,in the prior legal landscape,the district court erred or did not err in concluding that it lacked habeas jurisdiction.regardless whether the district court had habeas jurisdiction under the law existing when it ordered the dismissal of ishak habeas petition,congress now has definitively eliminated any provision for jurisdiction.we accordingly affirm the district court judgment dismissing ishak habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction.
transfer of habeas proceeding in the district court to the court of appeals as a petition for review 
section c of the real id act provides that,if a habeas petition challenging a final order of removal is pending in a district court on the date of the enactment of the real id act,then the district court shall transfer the case to the court of appeals for the circuit in which a petition for review could have been properly filed under ina b,stat.at.the court of appeals is to treat the transferred district court case as if it had been filed pursuant to a petition for review under such section,except that subsection b of such section shall not apply.id.ina b,to which the above provision refers,provides that a petition for review must be filed not later than days after the date of the final order of removal.b.
here,ishak did not file within the time period a petition for review of the bia order dismissing his appeal.instead,he filed with the bia a motion to reconsider.he concedes that the motion to reconsider did not toll the deadline.see ven ashcroft,cir.thereafter,he separately petitioned the district court for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that the immigration proceedings resulting in his deportation were constitutionally infirm.
both parties agree in their supplemental filings that,under the terms of the real id act,we must now treat ishak habeas case and the instant appeal from the district court dismissal of ishak habeas petition,as if the habeas case had been filed pursuant to a timely petition for direct review of the bia order affirming ishak deportation.this is so even though the period for filing a petition for review has long since expired.see real id act c,stat.at.
to be sure,the transfer provision in the real id act applies to a habeas petition challenging a removal order that is pending in a district court on the date of enactment of the act.id.here,on the date of enactment,the appeal from the district court dismissal order was pending in our court the habeas petition itself had been dismissed in the district court.nonetheless,we think the habeas case was still pending in the district court within the meaning of the real id act.until our court acted on the appeal,the case necessarily remained alive in the lower court although dormant.see alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice procedure at ed.supp discussing the district court power and residual jurisdiction in cases pending on appeal kusay united states,cir noting that the district court retains jurisdiction over those aspects of the case not involved in the appeal.
it is apparent from congress clear intent to place all review of removal orders in the courts of appeals,see conf,at,that habeas appeals from a district court that are pending in this court on the effective date of the real id act must be converted,along with the underlying district court case,to petitions for review see bonhometre gonzales,cir.the government as well as the petitioner agrees with this interpretation.
merits of claims now before us 
we accordingly now have before us two petitions for review.the first is the petition for review timely filed in this court by ishak to review the bia denial of his motion to reconsider its prior upholding of the ins removal order.the second is the converted habeas case originally brought in the district court,challenging the constitutionality of the removal proceedings.while the actual issues in both petitions are remarkably similar,we shall consider them separately so as to avoid confusion because of the difference in review standards and timing.
petition for review based upon denial of motion to rec
