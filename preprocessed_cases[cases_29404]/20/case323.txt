ramon ramos appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gleeson,denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.charged with rape,sodomy,and burglary in state court,ramos elected to forego counsel and to absent himself from the proceedings in protest.shortly thereafter,the trial judge introduced ramos standby counsel to the jury as his mischaracterization that the court attempted to correct by reintroducing him as a legal advisor.ramos argues that this violated his sixth amendment right to.we affirm because the state proceeding did not result in a decision that was contrary to,or involve an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.and the supreme court case on which ramos relies,mckaskle wiggins,fairly read,does not support his position because standby counsel extremely limited participation was simply not substantial or frequent enough to have seriously undermined ramos appearance before the jury in the status of one representing himself.the judgment is affirmed.
background 
in july,a young woman reported to police that she had been raped.a sexual assault kit was used to collect evidence at the local hospital in queens.the case went cold for some time.in march,ramos was arrested for burglary,also in queens.although police suspected his involvement in the rape,the victim was unable to identify him in multiple photo arrays and lineups,and the case went cold again.
that changed in october,when state officials procured a dna sample from ramos,who was then serving time for a robbery conviction.in july,ramos dna was matched to the semen from the victim sexual assault kit.ramos was indicted for the rape in may.
ramos first trial in new york supreme court ended in a mistrial when the prosecutor took ill.during those truncated court proceedings in,ramos evinced a desire to represent and eventually absent himself.ramos advised the court that he would appear pro se,except for certain challenges to dna evidence,which he wanted his standby counsel,john scarpa,to make.however,during the sandoval hearing ramos expressed disgust with the court and the proceedings,and a distrust of lawyers based in part on his perception that unchallenged police perjury had led to a prior conviction.he refused counsel and refused to stay 
i will not sit here and have this court convict me for wrongs done by the police i do not wish to attend this trial i am a minority and i can not afford a seems the system would like to take advantage but after being convicted here and serving to life based on the fact that the court protected a police officer from having perjured himself,i am not going to go through it and i respectfully refuse to attend any further of my trial and conviction.let it go on without me i want to make it clear that i do not wish an attorney for me.what i feel is happening,there is corruption going on in the system,corruption going on.
ramos racette,cv,wl,at,quoting the trial transcript.the court then instructed scarpa to act as counsel in ramos absence,explaining,w e ca have an empty defense chair and table,so it a good thing that you are advisory counsel because now you are back in the box f rom this point on,you are the attorney for the defendant.id.at.however,the trial prosecutor missed three consecutive days with illness before the jury was sworn in,and the court declared a mistrial.
the retrial was held over five days from january to.on the first day,ramos indicated that he was unhappy with the new legal advisor assigned to his case,russell rothberg.although ramos had not objected to scarpa replacement when it occurred,he now insisted that he wanted scarpa back.the court informed him that rothberg has been on the case for the past month and you,frankly,do have a say in the matter.id.at.ramos made clear that he would protest the trial if rothberg were involved,and the court allowed ramos to leave the courtroom.
after ramos went to his cell,rothberg asked the court to clarify his role judge,just so the record is absolutely clear,i know that the court has made the inquiry of the defendant who has voluntarily absented himself from the courtroom,so again my status now changes from legal advisor to counsel for the defendant id.at.the court confirmed that f or the purposes of the trial,and for the jury edification,obviously you have to be referred to as the defendant attorney,yes,or you are representing the defendant.id.the jury was brought into the courtroom,and the court introduced rothberg to the jury as the attorney for the defendant.id.
the prosecutor returned from the lunch break worried,and suggested to the court that a defendant had a constitutional right both to appear pro se and to absent himself from trial without representation.the prosecutor advised that the court could not force ramos to have rothberg represent him merely because he wanted to go pro se and absent himself.id.at.
after this exchange,the court ordered ramos returned to court.ramos confirmed,again,that he wished to appear pro se without any representation from rothberg.he declared that he wanted to take his chances with appeal,and voluntarily returned to his cell.id.
the prosecutor asked the court to clarify for the jury that ramos was actually representing himself,but the request strangely was denied.instead,the court obliquely informed the jury that rothberg has been appointed by the court to be available to serve as a legal advisor to ramos.id.jury selection continued.
before each day of trial,ramos was asked whether he would like to participate in the proceedings.each day,ramos elected to remain in the holding cell.after the prosecution rested,the court charged the jury,including an instruction to draw no inference from the defendant absence.on january,the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.
ramos appealed through the state court system,arguing that his right to had been abrogated.the second department denied the appeal contrary to the defendant contention,he was not denied his right to when the court appointed a new attorney to act as standby counsel.people ramos,dep t.the new york court of appeals granted ramos leave to appeal,people ramos,but subsequently affirmed the second department order without taking up the sixth amendment issue.people ramos.reargument and reconsideration were denied.people ramos.
on march,ramos petitioned pro se for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gleeson,presenting six claims for relief.ramos,wl,at.the court denied the petition.id.at.ramos appeals from that judgment.the only question now before us is whether his sixth amendment right to was violated in the state trial.
discussion 
we review the denial of a habeas petition de novo.sweet bennett,cir.an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim either resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
a state court determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court decision.harrington richter,quoting yarborough alvarado.this standard protects against intrusion of federal habeas review upon both the states sovereign power to punish offenders and their attempts to honor constitutional rights.id.at internal quotations omitted see id.at if this standard is difficult to meet,that is because it was meant to be.
ramos primary argument on appeal is that his sixth amendment right to was violated when the trial court initially disregarded his request to appear pro se,assigned counsel during voir dire,and introduced
