on appeal,the prosecution argues that the district court failed to apply the deferential framework of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa for reviewing state court decisions,which requires a district court on habeas review to determine whether those state court decisions are contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d.appellant br.at.instead,the prosecution asserts,the district court erroneously decided that the state courts decisions were simply wrong.however,the prosecution argues,the state courts decisions were not wrong or even unreasonable in light of aeid failure to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his attorney mistaken advice about sentences.id.at.rather,aeid merely asserted that he would have accepted the prosecution plea offer of a year prison sentence,despite the fact that this sentence has been exposed as an illegal one.the prosecution argues that aeid has failed to show prejudice,since he has never claimed or shown that the prosecutor would have offered a different,legal plea as to years of the prosecutor had been aware of the effect of the revised sentencing statute,and that aeid would have accepted such a plea.
in addition,the prosecution argues that,under aedpa,the district court should not have conducted an evidentiary hearing where aeid failed to develop the factual basis of his claim in state court proceedings.appellant br.at quoting e.
for the reasons set forth below,we hold that,applying the standard of review established by aedpa to aeid application for a writ of habeas corpus,the state courts decisions rejecting aeid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel were not an objectively unreasonable application of the teachings of the supreme court in strickland,at,where aeid failed to demonstrate or even allege that the prosecutor would have offered a different,legal plea as to years of the prosecutor had been aware of the effect of the new state sentencing statute and that aeid would have accepted such a plea.
the following facts are drawn primarily from the district court opinion,aeid bennett,d,and are supplemented as necessary by facts set forth in the record and in the parties briefs.
on november,aeid was indicted by a grand jury on four counts charging him with sodomy in the first degree two counts,attempted rape in the first degree,and menacing in the second degree for his conduct on october.prior to trial,the prosecution and defense counsel conducted plea negotiations.the prosecutor would not permit aeid to plead guilty to an offense less serious than sodomy,but was willing to compromise on aeid sentence.
defense counsel informed aeid that,if convicted,aeid faced a maximum term of imprisonment of to years.that is,aeid would be eligible for parole in years.this information was based on the fact that,under new york law at that time,the charge of sodomy,a class b felony,carried a maximum term of incarceration of years,see penal law a mckinney and on counsel belief that,under new york law at that time,an individual convicted of such a crime must serve a minimum of of the maximum years before becoming eligible for parole.when counsel informed aeid of his possible term of imprisonment if convicted,counsel was unaware of a new state sentencing statute that became effective on october.under that new law,the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment to be served by an individual convicted of a violent felony was the maximum sentence imposed.penal law mckinney see also ante note.in aeid case,if sentenced to the maximum term of years,he would be required to serve a minimum of years before becoming eligible for parole release.
throughout plea negotiations,the prosecutor and the trial court were also unaware of the change in the law and,like defense counsel,believed that,if aeid were convicted at trial,he would face a maximum sentence of to years for sodomy.accordingly,the prosecutor offered aeid a plea of years of imprisonment with a mandatory minimum of was only of the maximum sentence that would be imposed,rather than of the maximum sentence as legally mandated by the new sentencing statute in effect at that time.similarly,the trial court,on the record,told aeid that he could face a sentence of to years if convicted at trial.
against his counsel advice,aeid rejected the plea.following a jury trial,he was convicted on march,on all charges.by the time of sentencing,the trial court had learned that the new sentencing statute had taken effect on october.accordingly,on april,aeid was sentenced to a total indeterminate term of imprisonment of years with a statutorily mandated minimum of years of the maximum sentence imposed for the conviction of sodomy in the first degree,each charge to run concurrently a concurrent year term of imprisonment for rape in the first degree and a term of imprisonment for menacing in the second degree.
following multiple unsuccessful appeals in the state courts,aeid applied for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the northern district of new york on december,challenging pursuant to the constitutionality of his state court convictions and his subsequent incarceration.although aeid made several claims in his application for a writ of habeas corpus,only his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations was granted by the district court,following an evidentiary hearing on august,before magistrate judge david homer and a september,and order from the magistrate judge.
a.the state courts decisions rejecting aeid claim were not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law
