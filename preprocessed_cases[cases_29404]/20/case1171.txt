in a prior opinion,this panel granted petitioner michael dewayne johnson,a texas inmate sentenced to death for the murder of jeffrey michael wetterman,a certificate of appealability coa on two issues of law whether johnson alleged prosecutorial misconduct claims meet the due diligence requirement of b b i and if so,whether johnson prosecutorial misconduct claims merit relief.johnson dretke,cir.
in his successive habeas petition,johnson claims that david vest,an accomplice and witness at his trial,confessed to the capital murder crime for which johnson was sentenced to death.both johnson and vest were charged,separately,with aggravated robbery by indictments that charged each man with shooting wetterman.vest signed under oath a factual stipulation,in which vest averred that he shot wetterman,and submitted the stipulation to the court when he pleaded guilty to the aggravated robbery count as charged.although vest factual stipulation was submitted to the court,it was not read aloud at the plea hearing.subsequently,vest testified at johnson trial that johnson shot wetterman.johnson argues that his sentence and conviction were obtained in violation of the constitution because the prosecution failed to disclose vest factual stipulation to johnson counsel,in violation of brady maryland,d,and because the prosecution knowingly presented false testimony to the jury in the form of vest testimony,contradicting his factual stipulation,that johnson shot wetterman,in violation of giglio united states,d.the district court found that johnson did not meet the successive petition requirements,and in the alternative,if he did,that his claims did not merit relief.
because we conclude that johnson can not meet the requirements of b,we are constrained to affirm the district court dismissal of johnson successive habeas petition,even on a troubling record of the state inconsistent pretrial and trial strategy with respect to the two.
factual and procedural background 
the following summary of the material facts demonstrated at trial is taken from the opinion and order of the texas court of criminal appeals tcca,affirming johnson conviction and sentence on direct appeal.see johnson state.david vest testified for the state after pleading guilty to the aggravated robbery charge alleging that he shot wetterman and after receiving an sentence in return for his testimony.
according to vest,around september,a friend,michael barry,showed vest a stolen suburban and a gun barry had found in the stolen vehicle.the following day,vest visited johnson house while barry was also there and saw the same gun at johnson house.later that day,september,vest drove around with friends,including barry,in a stolen cadillac,and eventually vest dropped off all of the passengers and then picked up johnson.vest and johnson returned to johnson house,where by this time barry was asleep johnson went inside the house and returned with the gun tucked in his waistband.the two began driving again and headed for the texas coast.when the stolen car gas tank approached empty,the two decided to steal gasoline from a gasoline station.the two men switched positions in the car,and johnson drove to several gasoline stations the pair ultimately stopped at the third,a lorena fastime convenience store and gas station.vest began pumping gasoline,and as he was doing so,the clerk,jeff wetterman,came out of the store and began talking to him.johnson then got out of the car and walked to the rear of the car.vest asked johnson whether johnson had the weapon,and johnson lifted his shirt revealing the gun in his waistband.vest muttered shit under his breath,and as he returned the gasoline nozzle to the pump,he heard a shot and saw wetterman fall.johnson and vest got back in the car and sped away.on their way home,johnson sold the gun to a truck driver,and the next day,vest saw an account of the murder and told his mother what happened,slip op.at.
in addition to vest testimony recounted above,other evidence was presented by the state.a witness at the scene,wetterman,testified that wetterman left the store to help a customer.the witness heard a shot,and when she looked out to the pumps,she saw wetterman on the ground and a man standing by the passenger door of what she later identified as a cadillac.larry reynolds testified that he was at vest house after the incident when vest and johnson arrived there.reynolds testified that johnson told him that johnson and vest had tried to steal gasoline and that johnson had shot the victim in the face after he thought he heard vest say shoot.barry testified that he had stolen both the suburban and the cadillac and left the gun at johnson house,but that he awoke in johnson house to find the gun missing.when barry asked johnson about it,barry testified that johnson replied he had shot someone and was forced to dispose of the gun.a witness,paul muniti,also testified that johnson said johnson had shot someone while he and vest were stealing gasoline,slip op.at 
in presenting an alibi defense,johnson offered the testimony of several witnesses.his mother testified that johnson had been at his aunt farm on the weekend of the incident,and another witness testified to having seen johnson at the farm that weekend and having been with johnson on the night of september,slip op.at.
johnson was convicted in may of capital murder and sentenced to death.see.penal code ann.a.the texas court of criminal appeals tcca affirmed the conviction and sentence,and the supreme court denied certiorari.johnson filed his first state application for habeas relief on october,and the state trial court held a hearing before recommending denial of relief.on march,the tcca denied johnson application based on the trial court findings.on september,johnson filed his first application for federal habeas relief in the western district of texas.that request was denied,as was his request for a coa,and the supreme court denied his request for certiorari on march.
approximately one week before his scheduled execution,johnson filed a second state habeas application on february.there,johnson asserted the same claims of prosecutorial misconduct he presents now in federal court as well as the same ineffective assistance of counsel claim upon which this panel denied coa.the tcca determined that johnson application was an abuse of the writ under article of the texas code of criminal procedure and dismissed his application on february.
johnson requested leave from this court to file a successive federal petition.a majority of this panel granted his motion to file a successive writ on february,authorizing the district court to consider a successive habeas corpus application and granting a stay of execution.under aedpa,the district court was required to dismiss johnson motion without reaching the merits if it found the claim did not meet the standards for a successive petition.see b.the district court so dismissed johnson application,but then notwithstanding that dismissal,proceeded to deny habeas relief on the merits of johnson claims as well.johnson moved for a coa from that denial,claiming he meets the requirements of b b for successive petitions johnson argues he is entitled to habeas relief because his conviction and sentence were obtained in violation of the constitution.
this panel granted a limited coa as quoted above.the parties submitted supplemental briefing,and oral argument was heard on september.
david vest was originally indicted separately from johnson but with a nearly identical indictment.vest indictment charged him with two counts of first degree felony aggravated robbery,see.penal code ann.a,and noticed that during the commission of that felony,a deadly weapon was used and exhibited.paragraph two of vest indictment,the count charged under a,read,
david noel vest in the county of mclennan,state of texas on or about the day of september,did then and there,while in the course of committing theft of property and with intent to obtain and maintain control of the property,namely gasoline,intentionally and knowingly cause bodily injury to jeffrey michael wetterman,by shooting him with a handgun,and did use and exhibit a deadly weapon,namely said firearm.
johnson concedes that he knew of vest indictment,and the record reflects that johnson counsel was present in the courtroom at the time of vest guilty plea to paragraph two of the indictment.
with respect to vest guilty plea,johnson argues that he could not have discovered the following facts,exercising due diligence,in time to include the prosecutorial misconduct claims now presented and based upon these facts in his initial habeas petition.
vest factual stipulation,which was signed by vest under oath and submitted to the court in support of his plea,read 
i stipulate that i did then and there,while in the course of committing a theft of property and with intent to obtain and maintain control of the property,namely gasoline,intentionally and knowingly cause bodily injury to jeffery michael wetterman,by shooting him with a handgun,and did use and exhibit a deadly weapon,namely said firearm.
thus,the factual stipulation tracked verbatim the language of paragraph two of the indictment,the sole count to which vest pleaded guilty.vest sworn stipulation was offered in support of his plea to paragraph two of the indictment.at the plea hearing,vest waived a reading of the indictment 
at vest plea,held on february,crawford long,the assistant district attorney who also prosecuted johnson,and jack hurley,counsel for vest,made appearances before the court.vest identified himself to the court,averring that he was charged in the relevant case number with the offense of aggravated robbery.vest indicated his understanding that the state elected to proceed only on paragraph of th e indictment.the court began to request that long read the allegations,but counsel for vest waived the reading of the indictment.vest immediately pleaded guilty to the allegations of aggravated robbery,as alleged in paragraph of the indictment.
the court later asked about the existence of a plea bargain between the state and vest.long answered that in exchange for a plea of guilty on the aggravated robbery charge,vest would testify truthfully and honestly in the trial of johnson.long tendered the plea agreement,signed by vest,to the court which indicated its review of the agreement and then permitted the withdrawal of the agreement out of the record.the court then accepted vest guilty plea but declined to find him guilty,instead ordering a presentence investigation.the hearing concluded.
johnson argues that he could not have discovered vest factual stipulation supporting his plea in the exercise of due diligence because the prosecution violated its brady duty to disclose the stipulation.johnson argues the prosecution failure to provide the stipulation is equivalent to an affirmative concealment that,as a matter of law,should satisfy the due diligence requirement of b b i.
ii.discussion 
johnson successive petition is subject to the congressional requirements of the and effective death penalty act aedpa.see johnson,at.the state raises two procedural bars under aedpa to the success of johnson petition untimeliness and procedural default.the state also argues that the petition does not satisfy b b.however,on this record the factual predicate of johnson substantive claims also bears upon the analysis of the issues of timeliness,procedural default,and due diligence under b b i.accordingly,we first address the intersection of the brady duty of prosecutorial disclosure and a successive petitioner duty to demonstrate that due diligence would not have previously revealed the factual predicate of claims presented in a successive petition.
johnson has not demonstrated due diligence.
in relevant part,aedpa requires that johnson successive petition be dismissed unless the factual predicate for the claim s not presented in a prior application could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence.b b i.the parties implicitly agree that johnson could not meet the due diligence requirement in the absence of his brady claim because johnson only basis for satisfaction of b b i due diligence requirement is that the prosecution failure to disclose material and favorable evidence,vest stipulation is as a matter of law equivalent to active suppression.according to johnson,due diligence would not produce the discovery of a factual predicate that the prosecution was required to disclose.
johnson primary argument is that aedpa due diligence requirement should not be binding upon this court because in his view the courts exist for the purpose of insuring that the states respect the supreme law of the land and in obtaining his conviction and sentence,texas failed to do so.in essence,johnson argues that the constitutional due process guarantee protected by brady is eviscerated by aedpa if a petitioner is required to be duly diligent in searching for evidence that should have been disclosed to him by the prosecution under brady.johnson also argues that he meets the due diligence requirement as a matter of law because vest stipulation was located in a separate case file from his own and that,under the open file policy of the prosecution at the time of the trial,the prosecution failure to place vest stipulation in the open file constitutes active suppression.johnson asks this court to collapse aedpa due diligence requirement into the brady duty such that due diligence is met under b b i whenever a brady claim has merit.
the state responds that due diligence must be demonstrated under b b i before a court may reach the ultimate merits of a brady claim.the state argues that even assuming the brady claim has merit,johnson can not and has not shown that vest stipulation could not have been discovered in the exercise of due diligence prior to the filing of his first habeas petition,because vest stipulation was part of the public record,in vest file,and available to anyone who sought it,including johnson johnson counsel knew of vest indictment and was present when vest pleaded guilty to paragraph two of the indictment,and the stipulation tracked identically the language in vest indictment and johnson has never explained how he ultimately discovered the stipulation,suggesting that the manner of its discovery was available to johnson at the time he filed his initial petition.
to determine whether due diligence is satisfied by johnson by his failure to explain what actions were upon his reliance on brady disclosure,we begin with the plain language of aedpa.see moore cain,cir quoting withrow roell,cir.aedpa permits the filing of a successive petition when either the applicant shows that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law,b a emphasis added,or when the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence and the petitioner establishes prejudice in the absence of successive review,b b emphasis added.this distinction in congressional language between the two paths by which a successive petition may be raised informs the question presented here.while congress requires a petitioner to bear the burden of showing that his claim relies upon a new rule of constitutional law,the language it chose with respect to a claim based upon new evidence or a new factual predicate is cast in the passive voice.as such,the plain text of b b suggests that due diligence is measured against an objective standard,as opposed to the subjective diligence of the particular petitioner of record.the burden to make such a showing,of course,remains the petitioner.see also moore dretke,cir.
thus,the plain language of the statute requires that we determine not whether johnson has shown that vest stipulation could not have been discovered previously through johnson exercise of due diligence but instead whether vest stipulation could have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence.see b b i.this is not necessarily a distinction without a difference,especially in the instant case where johnson argues that with respect to brady material,due diligence is objectively satisfied not by reference to johnson action or inaction,but instead by reference to the state action or inaction.were we to accept johns
