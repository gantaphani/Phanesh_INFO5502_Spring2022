this is a death penalty case from ohio,tried by a jury,in which the district court issued the writ of habeas corpus as to the sentencing phase of the case.the principal problem in the case arises from the fact that the indictment did not charge the aggravating circumstance that made the crime capital,nor did the trial court instruct the jury on the subject,nor did the jury return a verdict finding one or more of the aggravating circumstances that permit a sentence of death.we first look at the ohio death penalty statutes before explaining the facts and previous rulings of state and federal courts.it is clear from this review that the ohio courts did not follow ohio death penalty statutes created to comply with supreme court cases narrowing the class of offenders eligible for the death penalty under the eighth amendment.
under of ohio law,entitled imposing sentence for a capital offense,an indictment in a capital case charging aggravated murder must state the aggravating circumstances that make the defendant eligible for the death penalty 
a if the indictment or count in the indictment charging aggravated murder does not contain one or more specifications of aggravating circumstances listed in division a of of the revised code,then,following a verdict of guilty of the charge of aggravated murder,the trial court shall impose a sentence of life imprisonment emphasis added.
the indictment did not contain such a charge.the next section of the ohio code,entitled criteria for imposing death,repeats this requirement,which is followed by a list of nine aggravating circumstances that allow the imposition of the death penalty 
a imposition of the death penalty for aggravated murder is precluded unless one or more of the following is specified in the indictment or count in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.emphasis added.
under subsection b of,if the defendant is to be tried for a capital offense in ohio,the jury 
verdict shall separately state whether the offender is guilty or not guilty of each specification of an aggravating circumstance.the jury shall be instructed on its duties in this regard.the instruction to the jury shall include an instruction that a specification shall be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in order to support a guilty verdict on the specification emphasis added.
no instruction was given,and the jury did not return a verdict finding any aggravating circumstance.in the present case,the aggravating circumstance not found by the jury but later supplied by ohio judges is found in a the offense of murder was committed while the offender was committing robbery and was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder emphasis added.
these death penalty provisions of the ohio code were adopted in in direct response to a series of cases in the supreme court of the united states interpreting the eighth amendment.as more fully discussed below,these cases require states to narrow or restrict the class of murderers who are subject to capital punishment.a state may do so by adopting by statute a set of aggravating circumstances,as ohio has done.chief justice rehnquist opinion in lowenfield phelps,d,concisely summarizes the requirements of the eighth amendment in this respect 
to pass constitutional muster,a capital sentencing scheme must genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to others found guilty of murder.zant stephens,d.under the capital sentencing laws of most states,the jury is required during the sentencing phase to find at least one aggravating circumstance before it may impose death.by doing so,the jury narrows the class of persons eligible for the death penalty according to an objective legislative definition.zant,supra,at.s tatutory aggravating circumstances play a constitutionally necessary function at the stage of legislative definition they circumscribe the class of persons eligible for the death penalty.citations omitted.
excusing the trial judge failure to comply with the statutory provisions referred to above,the state courts,on their own initiative,after the jury trial and verdict,found the petitioner esparza guilty of the aggravating circumstance that made him eligible for the death penalty,being the principal offender in committing an aggravated murder while committing a robbery.the jury itself was never informed of the aggravating circumstances required,nor did it find that such a circumstance existed.the primary question is whether the state violated the eighth amendment,as well as state law,when it failed to either charge esparza in the indictment with the aggravated circumstance for which the death penalty was imposed or instruct the jury on the aggravating circumstance and have the jury reach a verdict on the existence of the aggravating circumstance.we conclude that the district court was correct in issuing the writ on this basis.
the case was tried on the theory that esparza was the only participant in the crime.the state proof showed that on the evening of february,a masked man entered the island variety carryout in toledo,ohio,and approached the two store employees,melanie gershultz and james barailloux.pointing a small black handgun at them,he ordered gershultz to open the cash register.while she was doing this,barailloux fled the store through a rear door,entering the attached home of the store owner.while he was alerting the owner of the robbery,he heard a shot.he returned to the store and found gershultz lying on the floor,shot once in the neck,and the cash register open and missing approximately.gershultz died shortly thereafter.
at trial a year later,both esparza sister and a fellow inmate testified that he confessed to the killing and the sole witness to the robbery,james barailloux,testified that the masked robber was short and husky,as was esparza,and that he was wearing a dark blue jacket similar to the jacket esparza sister said esparza wore that night.the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts late in the day on thursday,may.a mitigation hearing was held on tuesday,may,during which esparza put on four witnesses who testified briefly in his behalf.he also gave to the jury his juvenile court file and a presentencing report prepared by the state,both of which contained information unfavorable to esparza.the next day,the jury sentenced esparza to death,and the trial court accepted the sentence.
after esparza trial,his appeals and his state proceedings,a substantial volume of exculpatory evidence was revealed that was not turned over by prosecutors at trial.this evidence tended to prove that joe jasso was a participant in the crime and that esparza did not act alone.
no information concerning jasso was provided to the defense before trial.in information discovered as a result of a discovery request enforced by the district court below,esparza learned that two individuals,charles hall and stephen billings,both separately reported to the toledo police department that they had seen a caucasian male and a hispanic male in the island variety carryout the night of the homicide.hall and billings both reported that the caucasian man was driving a monte carlo.hall reported that he saw the monte carlo circle the island variety carryout twelve times.information implicating jasso was also discovered as a result of district release of tips collected by crimestoppers,a privately funded program that works in conjunction with local law enforcement to gather information regarding unsolved crimes.two days after the homicide,an unidentified caller stated that he had overheard joe jasso talking about the murder.the caller hung up before any additional information was obtained.
prior to trial,the government eyewitness,island variety carryout store clerk james barailloux,provided a series of inconsistent descriptions of the assailant to the toledo police department.just days after the robbery and homicide occurred,barailloux provided two slightly different descriptions of the assailant,both generally describing a white male in his,around tall and weighing around pounds.he did not mention a ski mask.esparza was years old at the time of the incident,tall,hispanic,and in body type.two months after the robbery,barailloux described the perpetrator as either caucasian or hispanic and husky.he provided no description of the assailant clothing during that interview.barailloux description continued to change over time,and at trial he described the perpetrator as a large man with a large neck wearing a green ski mask with gold stripes and a puffy blue jacket.none of the inconsistent descriptions were disclosed to the defense counsel before trial.
on direct appeal from the verdict of death,the ohio supreme court found no reversible error in the trial,with two of the seven justices dissenting.state esparza,ohio.in state proceedings,the ohio court of appeals,in general,conclusory language,found no eighth amendment error in either the failure of the trial judge to require that the aggravating circumstance be charged in the indictment or the failure to require that the aggravating circumstance be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt after being instructed on its duties in this regard.state esparza,no,wl ohio app.dist.july,the ohio supreme court dismissed the appeal without opinion.state esparza,ohio.
the district court disagreed.it concluded that the procedure followed by the state in sentencing esparza to death violated the line of supreme court cases following furman georgia,d,establishing new eighth amendment standards for the states to follow in death cases.the court based its ruling on the failure of the ohio courts to follow their own statutory rules designed to render ohio death penalty scheme constitutional under these eighth amendment cases 
here,the trial judge,led down this path by the defective indictment,charged the jury as to one sentenced esparza as if he had been convicted of an entirely separate murder as the supreme court said in sullivan louisiana,d,to hypothesize a guilty verdict that was never in fact matter how inescapable the finding to support that verdict might violate the jury trial guarantee.
this determination by an appellate court of what the jury would have done if the capital specifications question had been presented to it is particularly troubling in light of the capital scheme at issue here.as discussed later in this opinion,the ohio supreme court,this court,and the sixth circuit have all relied upon the existence of the capital specifications set forth in ohio a to conclude that the ohio capital scheme has sufficiently narrowed the class of persons subject to the death penalty to render that scheme constitutional under zant stephens,d.
thus,the ohio supreme court has emphasized that a defendant may not be subject to the death penalty for a mere violation of ohio b before the death penalty can be imposed,the state must additionally prove that the offender was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder or,if the offender was not the principal offender,that the aggravated murder was committed with prior calculation and design.state jenkins,ohio,cert.denied,d emphasis added.see also state barnes,ohio,cert.denied,d the trial court had to find that the defendant committed murder while committing or attempting to commit a specified felony and,further,that the defendant was the principal offender or that the murder was premeditated.and,federal courts,as this one does here,have relied upon this interpretation of ohio capital scheme,by the highest court in the state,as support for the conclusion that ohio capital scheme does narrow the class of persons to whom the death penalty can be applied,and does not use the precise same factors both to convict for aggravated murder and to subject one so convicted to the death penalty.see,scott mitchell,cir.
where the existence of the specifications under ohio a and of the state obligation to prove those specifications as additional factors,are critical to the constitutionality of the capital scheme,a failure to charge those factors or submit them to the jury surely must be structural.because the state failed to indict esparza for the offense of capital murder,and failed to instruct the jury to find all elements of the offense of capital murder,and because that error is not susceptible to a review for harmless error,esparza is correct that imposition of the death penalty upon him would be unconstitutional.
esparza anderson,at,footnotes omitted.
the question before us is whether this analysis of the eighth amendment requirements in capital cases is erroneous.
ii.analysis 
justice scalia concisely pointed out in his dissenting opinion in united states,d,a fundamental principle of modern death penalty jurisprudence 
neither the cases cited,nor any other case,permits a judge to determine the existence of a factor which makes a crime a capital offense the person who is charged with actions that expose him to the death penalty has an absolute entitlement to jury trial on all the elements of the charge.
emphasis added.although stated in dissent,it seems clear that a majority,and perhaps all,of the members of the supreme court agree with justice scalia on this point.the author of the court opinion in,justice breyer,expressed the same view in his concurring opinion in ring arizona,d,when he observed that jury sentencing in capital cases is mandated by the eighth amendment.id.at.in ring,a majority of the members of the court reached the same conclusion on the basis of the jury trial guarantee in the sixth amendment.
the same essential point was made by chief justice rehnquist in the portion of his opinion for the court in lowenfield,quoted above.fundamental principles from both the due process clause and the eighth amendment,as the district court held in its opinion quoted above,apply to the facts of this case because the jury never found the statutorily required aggravating circumstance,which,in justice scalia words supplies the factor which makes the crime a capital offense.this error is unquestionably a violation of the eighth amendment.
justice scalia point is reinforced by the language of the court earlier per curiam opinion in presnell georgia,d,a capital case,similar to the instant case in which the georgia supreme court supplied the aggravator element of the capital offense,on which the jury was silent 
in cole arkansas,petitioners were convicted at trial of one offense but their convictions were affirmed by the supreme court of arkansas on the basis of evidence in the record indicating that they had committed another offense on which the jury had not been instructed.in reversing the convictions,justice black wrote for a unanimous court 
it is as much a violation of due process to send an accused to prison following conviction of a charge on which he was never tried as it would be to convict him upon a charge that was never made to conform to due process of law,petitioners were entitled to have the validity of their convictions appraised on consideration of the case as it was tried and as the issues were determined in the trial court.id.at.
these fundamental principles of procedural fairness apply with no less force at the penalty phase of a trial in a capital case than they do in the phrase of any criminal trial.gardner florida,d.
we also agree with the district judge that the error can not be overcome by employing harmless error.none of the seminal supreme court eighth amendment cases requiring the narrowing of the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty permits the offender to be executed because the error was deemed harmless.furman georgia,d woodson north carolina,d automatic or mandatory death penalty does not comply with the holding in furman that the vesting of standardless sentencing power in the jury violated the eighth amendment godfrey georgia,d the standardless and unchanneled imposition of death sentences in the uncontrolled discretion of a basically uninstructed jury in this case was in no way cured by the affirmance of those sentences by the georgia supreme court.the death penalty for all such offenders has been set aside,not reviewed for harmless error.and in the presnell georgia case,supra.the supreme court did not send the case back for harmless error review.
a state may not adopt a valid statute and then decline to carry it out.to allow a state to construct a constitutionally valid death penalty statute that establishes a fact to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt but permits judges to ignore the statute in order to impose the death penalty is the same as dispensing with the reasonable doubt requirement deemed not subject to harmless error analysis in sullivan louisiana,d the sixth amendment requires more than appellate speculation about a hypothetical jury action,or else directed verdicts for the state would be sustainable on appeal.it is not the same as dispensing with the minor element of materiality in a federal white collar tax case found subject to harmless error analysis in neder united states,d.there is no suggestion in the chief justice opinion in neder that harmless error would protect a directed verdict for the state on a crucial finding under the eighth amendment in a capital case.in neder,justice stevens specifically points out in his concurring opinion that such harmless error would not apply to capital cases where there is a special danger that elected judges may listen to the voice of voters rather than witnesses.at.
we find no federal appellate case that allows the judge,in violation of a state statute creating aggravating factors to be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,to direct a verdict on the crucial aggravating factor that permits the death sentence.review in such cases should apply only when the jury has actually performed its function under the eighth amendment.the jury in this case never made a judgment at all on the only possible aggravating constitutionally indispensable requirement without which the death penalty can not be imposed.the state argument that the error here can be excused as harmless would lead to the conclusion that any,or all,elements required by a state capital sentencing system may be supplied by judges rather than the jury.neither the eighth amendment nor ohio own statutes adopted in order to comply with it permit such a gross deviation from the principle of jury sentencing according to expressly stated,clear statutory standards.
in this case,even if harmless error analysis were appropriate,we are faced with the problem that suppressed evidence discovered for the first time in the district court in this proceeding raises a question about whether esparza acted alone.there is new evidence by two witnesses,suppressed by the prosecution at trial,that there were possibly two participants in the crime,joe jasso and esparza.the basis on which ohio judges directed a verdict on the principal offender there was only one participant in the now to be called into question.thus the basis for the state harmless error argument in the state courts has been undermined by the new evidence.
iii.other issues 
because we grant the writ as to his sentence of death on eighth amendment grounds,we need not reach the alternate grounds on which esparza asks us to vacate the death sentence that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at sentencing,that his rights were violated when he was denied a continuance to prepare for the sentencing phase,and that his rights were violated through cumulative error in the sentencing phase.
esparza also advances three grounds on which he asks us to grant a general writ invalidating his convictions for aggravated murder and aggravated robbery.he claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial that his rights were violated when the state did not provide him with all available relevant,material,and exculpatory evidence and that his rights were violated when the trial judge refused to recuse himself after conducting a witness certification hearing concerning threats allegedly made against a potential witness by esparza brother.we address these in turn.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
esparza first claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial.though he advances this as two separate grounds,arguing that ineffective assistance occurred both when his counsel failed to read the faulty indictment and when he did not conduct a thorough pretrial investigation or object to alleged prosecutorial misconduct,the claims are of a piece.to evaluate such claims,we apply the test laid out in strickland washington,d.we may only reverse a state court ruling if it is contrary to or involves an unreasonable application of federal law.see d.
esparza claim that his counsel was ineffective when he failed to read the indictment is based on a fair point any competent counsel should read an indictment.to succeed under strickland,however,esparza must also show he was prejudiced by the failure to object to the indictment.had his counsel objected,there is little doubt that the prosecution would have amended the indictment to include the required language.it may have been counsel strategy to leave the error in place.thus,the decision of the ohio courts to deny relief on this basis is reasonable,and so affirmed.
esparza also claims ineffective assistance occurred when his counsel did not object to closing statements by the prosecution.in the questionable statements,the prosecution stated that the victim was shot while reaching for an alarm,and that scientific evidence showed the shooting was not accidental,although no evidence in the record supports these claims.although these statements are somewhat misleading,they do not warrant issuance of the writ.counsel is free to argue reasonable inferences from the evidence,so long as evidence on the record is not misstated.see united states young,d.esparza also claims that the prosecutor played upon the jury passions and prejudices in asking for a conviction.esparza trial counsel could well have concluded that the prosecution comments were not objectionable.even assuming arguendo that they were objectionable,and that the trial counsel should have objected,esparza does not prove the comments prejudiced him.in rejecting this claim,the ohio court concluded that esparza failed to establish that the outcome of his trial would have been different had his trial counsel not committed the alleged errors.esparza,wl,at.this is a reasonable conclusion to be drawn after applying strickland.
esparza claim that his counsel was ineffective when he failed to conduct a proper pretrial investigation fails for similar reasons.although his counsel relied chiefly on the investigation of a private investigator,and neglected to interview some witnesses listed as potential government witnesses,esparza is unable to explain how interviewing these individuals,or conducting a more thorough investigation,would have produced a different result at trial.his sister testimony would still have been presented against him,likely leading to another conviction.thus,the ohio courts acted reasonably in concluding that the alleged errors did not prejudice esparza defense.on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial,relief is not warranted.
brady claim 
esparza also asks this court to issue the general writ based on the fact that the state withheld material exculpatory evidence from him at trial.as discussed above,the suppressed evidence tended to impeach a witness description of the individual who robbed island variety and shot melanie gershultz,show that more than one individual committed the crime,and show that police also had other suspects in the crime before charging esparza with the killing.taken together,the evidence throws into doubt whether esparza was the principal offender in this crime and thus merits a death sentence under ohio law.
the question here,however,is whether the evidence also throws into doubt esparza conviction for aggravated robbery and aggravated murder.under brady maryland,a state must disclose all material exculpatory evidence to a defendant before trial,d.to assert a successful brady claim,a petitioner must show that evidence favorable to the petitioner was suppressed by the government and therefore the defendant was prejudiced.see strickler greene,d.a defendant is prejudiced when there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.united states bagley,d.our task here is to determine whether,when the defendant was deprived of the suppressed evidence,he still received a fair trial,understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.strickler,at.quoting kyles whitley,d.
after considering the evidence,we conclude that esparza trial was not fatally flawed at the guilt phase of the case,although obviously the suppressed evidence should have been produced.the suppressed evidence tended to show that one witness statement that the in the store resembled esparza may have been wrong,and that another individual may have been involved in the crime.even after this,however,there remains other significant evidence against esparza,in particular the testimony of two individuals to whom esparza admitted shooting melanie gershultz.we note in particular that none of the suppressed evidence tends to show that esparza was uninvolved in the robbery and shooting it merely shows that he may not have been the principal offender and may not have acted alone.thus,his request for a general writ based on a brady error is denied.
certification hearing 
finally,esparza claims his rights were violated when the trial judge failed to recuse himself after conducting a pretrial hearing pursuant to ohio.b,c,under which the court may allow the state to withhold personal information about a prosecution witness when the prosecuting attorney certifies to the court that to do so may subject the witness or others to physical or substantial economic harm or coercion.id.the witness in question here was catherine stegg,gregory esparza girlfriend and mother of his child,who feared that esparza brothers would harm her if they knew her whereabouts.in support of its certification request,the state provided information about esparza violent past.after the hearing,the judge granted the motion,allowing the state to exclude stegg personal information from discovery provided to esparza.
the ohio supreme court has held that it is error for a judge to preside at such a hearing and then preside at the subsequent trial,as the prejudicial information often revealed at such hearings could tend to prejudice a judge against a defendant.see state gillard,ohio,overruled on other grounds,state mcguire,ohio.in such instances,however,harmless error analysis is appropriate.id.at.evaluating this claim on review,the ohio court of appeals concluded that the error was harmless,noting in particular that the evidence that the judge heard at the hearing,appellant history of violent behavior,was also admitted at the penalty phase of the trial below.state esparza,no,wl,at ohio app.dist.may.rather than contending that the error was harmful,esparza claims that such errors are structural and demand reversal in every instance.we disagree.the nature of the criminal justice system often requires judges to consider evidence and then dismiss it from their minds.see,withrow larkin,d.thus,harmless error analysis is called for here,and we find the ohio court conclusion that the error did esparza no harm is a reasonable application of federal law.
accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
the majority holds that the ohio courts did not follow ohio death penalty statutes created to comply with supreme court cases narrowing the class of offenders eligible for the death penalty under the eighth amendment,op.at,and that this failing can not be overcome by employing harmless error.op.at.i agree that the state failed to properly indict esparza for the offense of capital murder and failed to instruct the jury to find all elements of the offense of capital murder.however,i do not agree with the majority that this error can not be subject to a harmless error analysis.
although the majority basically sidelines it,see op.at,this case is governed by the antiterrrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.codified as amended at supp aedpa,which provides in relevant part 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
in williams taylor,d,the supreme court explained the meaning of contrary to and unreasonable application in the statute.a state court legal decision is contrary to clearly established federal law under d if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.id.at.an unreasonable application occurs when the state court identifies the correct legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.under this standard,a state court decision is not unreasonable simply because the federal court concludes that the state court decision is erroneous or incorrect.id.at.rather,the federal court must determine that the state court decision is an objectively unreasonable application of federal law.id.at.
the williams court emphasized that clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.id.at.
under the aedpa,we are therefore reviewing the relevant state court decision.esparza did not raise an eighth amendment claim on direct appeal in the state courts.he did not raise the issue until state proceedings,and then he raised it as part of his sixth amendment ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim.as the ohio court of appeals stated 
appellant has now filed the present motion for delayed reconsideration in which he asserts that his original appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the following assignments of error in the original appeal of his conviction and sentence to this court 
assignment of error 
appellant esparza death sentence is void and violates the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.
state esparza,no.l,wl,at ohio.july,unpublished per curiam,cause dismissed,ohio.the ohio court of appeals evaluated the assignment of error under the strickland standard see id.at setting forth strickland test for ineffective assistance of counsel claims.as to this issue,the ohio court of appeals concluded 
under his first assignment of error,esparza contends that his death sentence is void in that the state failed to allege and the jury failed to find all of the elements of a capital specification.in particular,appellant asserts that the indictment failed to allege a death penalty specification because it did not allege that he was either the principal offender or that he committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design.appellant further asserts that the jury instructions at the guilty phase of his trial below were similarly defective.
on his original appeals before this court and the supreme court of ohio,appellant asserted that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence.upon review,both this court and the supreme court determined that the verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.in so finding,both courts necessarily determined that after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes proven beyond a reasonable doubt.see state jenks,ohio.additionally,this court,in its decision of may,reviewing appellant appeal,addressed the merits of this assignment of error and found it not.as such,we find that there are no substantive grounds for relief under this assignment of error.
id.at.in other words,it appears that the ohio court concluded that there was no prejudice under strickland.that is,appellate counsel failure to raise the eighth amendment claim did not result in prejudice because of the overwhelming evidence against esparza 
as the district court suggested,it appears that the state court engaged in a harmless error analysis our task under the aedpa then is to determine whether application of harmless error analysis to an eighth amendment violation was an unreasonable application of,or contrary to,supreme court precedent,as of the time of the relevant state court decisions.
since the landmark case of chapman california,d,in which the supreme court held that some federal constitutional errors can be deemed harmless,the supreme court has found only a few constitutional errors that are so fundamental as to be automatically reversible and not subject to the harmless error analysis.arizona fulminante,d see also neder united states,d stating that we have recognized a limited class of fundamental constitutional errors that defy analysis by harmless error standards quoting fulminante,at.such structural errors include the giving of an erroneous reasonable doubt instruction,see sullivan louisiana,d,the appointment of an interested party attorney as a prosecutor for contempt charges,young united states ex rel.vuitton et fils,d,the excusing of a juror for cause in a capital case who was not irrevocably committed to vote against the death penalty regardless of the facts and circumstances of the case,gray mississippi,d,the unlawful exclusion of members of the defendant race from a grand jury,vasquez hillery,d,the denial of the right to a public trial,waller georgia,d,the abridgment of right to,mckaskle wiggins,d the complete denial of right to counsel at trial,gideon wainwright,d and trial before a biased judge,tumey ohio.
in each of these cases,the error affected the framework of the trial so that it was impossible to determine whether the result was correct.that is,e ach of these constitutional deprivations is a similar structural defect affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds,rather than simply an error in the trial process itself.fulminante,at.put another way,these errors deprive defendants of basic protections without which a criminal trial can not reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.neder,at,d quoting rose clark,d alteration in original.
the supreme court has ruled that constitutional errors subject to harmless error review include 
clemons mississippi,d unconstitutionally overbroad jury instructions at the sentencing stage of a capital case satterwhite texas,d admission of evidence at the sentencing stage of capital case in violation of the sixth amendment counsel clause carella california,d jury instruction containing an erroneous conclusive presumption pope illinois,d jury instruction misstating an element of the offense rose clark,d jury instruction containing an erroneous rebuttable presumption crane kentucky,d erroneous exclusion of defendant testimony regarding the circumstances of his confession delaware van arsdall,d restriction on a defendant right to a witness for bias in violation of the sixth amendment confrontation clause rushen spain,and,d denial of defendant right to be present at trial united states hasting,d improper comment on defendant silence at trial,in violation of the fifth amendment self incrimination clause hopper evans,d statute improperly forbidding trial court giving a jury instruction on a lesser included offense in a capital case in violation of the due process clause kentucky whorton,d failure to instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence moore illinois,d admission of identification evidence in violation of the sixth amendment counsel clause milton wainwright,d confession obtained in violation of massiah united states,d chambers maroney,d admission of evidence obtained in violation of the fourth amendment coleman alabama,d denial of counsel at preliminary hearing in violation of the sixth amendment confrontation clause.
fulminante,at.some citations omitted.in fulminante,the supreme court explained that 
the common thread connecting these cases is that each involved trial error error which occurred during the presentation of the case to the jury,and which may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
id.at.the harmless error rule thus promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.satterwhite texas,d quoting rose clark,at.
although the supreme court has repeatedly indicated that death is different,see woodson north carolina,d d eath is qualitatively different from a sentence of imprisonment,however,long.death,in its finality,differs more from life imprisonment than a year prison term differs from one of only a year or two.see also david mccord,is death different for purposes of harmless error analysis should it be an assessment of united states and louisiana supreme court case law,the court has never held that every constitutional error in a death penalty case is structural.id.at.in fact,the supreme court has employed the structural defect trial error dichotomy in capital cases.see,sullivan,at.fulminante,at.holding that admission of the defendant coerced confession in a capital case was subject to harmless error analysis and was not harmless error satterwhite,at.approving harmless error analysis of admission in capital sentencing proceeding of psychiatric testimony obtained in violation of the sixth amendment clemons,d holding that the constitution does not prevent a state appellate court from upholding a death sentence that is based in part on an invalid aggravating circumstance either by reweighing the evidence or by harmless error review remanding for clarification from mississippi supreme court.
the majority proclaims that n one of the seminal supreme court eighth amendment cases requiring the narrowing of the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty permits the offender to be executed because the error was deemed harmless.op.at citing furman georgia,d per curiam woodson north carolina,d godfrey georgia,d.in none of those cases,however,did the supreme court explicitly analyze the appropriateness of the harmless error test in eighth amendment cases.thus,it is disingenuous for the majority to hold that because the death penalty for all such offenders was set aside in those cases and not reviewed for harmless error,the supreme court has affirmatively ruled that the errors in those cases were indeed structural and not subject to harmless error review.ring arizona,d holding that statute allowing trial judge to determine presence or absence of aggravating factors required under state law for imposition of death penalty violated sixth amendment right to a jury trial in capital prosecutions and stating that the court did not reach the state assertion that any error was harmless because the court ordinarily leaves it to lower courts to pass on the harmlessness of the error in the first instance.
in furman georgia,d per curiam,the supreme court held that the penalty of death may not be imposed under a sentencing scheme that creates a substantial risk that the punishment will be inflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.furman made clear that a state may impose the death penalty only if its laws are shaped to narrow the class of offenders eligible for the death penalty.gregg georgia,d,reaffirmed the holding of furman,stating that where discretion is afforded a sentencing body on a matter so grave as the determination of whether a human life should be taken or spared,that discretion must be suitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action.id.at.in other words,a capital sentencing scheme must provide a meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which the penalty is imposed from the many cases in which it
