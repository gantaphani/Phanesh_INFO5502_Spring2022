petitioner james washington appeals the district court order denying his habeas petition.a michigan jury found washington guilty of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.he was sentenced to life in prison.on direct appeal,the michigan court of appeals affirmed his convictions.although washington moved for and was denied an evidentiary hearing,the state appellate court denied his and claims b ecause defendant failed to move for an evidentiary hearing and because the record,as it stood,did not support his claims.the federal district court denied his habeas petition.the district court did not consider washington requests for an evidentiary hearing.
washington now brings four challenges that the district court certified for appeal.he argues that he was denied his constitutional right to confront a testifying witness with impeaching evidence that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because counsel did not inform him that a confession barred by miranda could be used to impeach his testimony that he could not participate in his defense when defense counsel refused washington request for copies of witness and police statements and that his trial was rendered fundamentally unfair when the trial court excluded certain evidence.for the following reasons,we affirm.
testimony and evidence at trial 
three witnesses testified that they saw washington shoot and kill james kinville on july,when kinville brought washington a radio to repay a debt.one witness also testified that washington told him that washington had killed kinville.washington testified at trial that he did not kill kinville.washington main contention on appeal is that he was unable to present evidence that one of the three eye witnesses,robert corcoran,was the murderer.
two of the eye witnesses,james gidron and corey barkley,both of whom were thirteen at the time of the murder,spent the night at washington apartment and testified to the following.they woke up in the early morning of june,and washington asked the boys whether they wanted to see someone get shot.they went outside.a man later identified as robert corcoran was standing outside.he left and returned a few minutes later with kinville.after washington,corcoran,and kinville talked for a moment,washington pulled a gun from his waist and pointed it at kinville.washington fired the gun,but the gun misfired twice.the third shot,however,caused kinville to fall.washington then walked up to the fallen kinville and shot him twice in the head.washington told gidron that he shot kinville because kinville owed washington.washington told corcoran to take care of the body.corcoran took the body by the legs and placed it in the bushes.
the third eye witness,robert corcoran,testified that he purchased cocaine from washington twice that night.on one of the occasions when corcoran was at washington residence,washington pointed two guns at corcoran and dwayne lapere heads.he told them that their friend todd needed to repay his debt or that washington would shoot them.after washington put his gun down,corcoran and lapere returned to steven smith house,where corcoran and lapere were staying.kinville,who was at smith house,asked for something to sell.lapere gave him a radio.they placed the radio into a gray plastic bag.kinville asked corcoran to accompany him across the street,and they met washington at his driveway.
corcoran continued by testifying that washington asked kinville and corcoran to go behind a nearby gate,and they did.after the gun misfired,washington shot kinville,and kinville fell to the ground.washington then placed the gun on kinville head and shot the gun once.washington ordered corcoran to move the body,and corcoran did so.washington then told corcoran to hand over his id,and washington told corcoran that he knew where corcoran lived.
corcoran then testified that he returned to smith residence and told smith that washington had killed kinville.smith then went to speak with washington.smith later returned to his house to collect some blankets,and he took them to washington residence.corcoran testified that a car backed up near the fence at washington residence.after smith and the driver of the car returned from the backyard,corcoran saw from across the street the trunk sink as if something was dropped inside.corcoran ended his testimony by stating that he contacted the saginaw police department that day.
the state called officer donald zinz without the jury present.zinz testified that,when he spoke with corcoran over the telephone,corcoran repeated his questions to a woman.the woman,in turn,gave corcoran answers to zinz questions,and corcoran repeated those answers back to zinz.corcoran,when recalled to the witness stand by the defense,denied having a woman answer zinz questions.the defense was permitted to read into evidence zinz prior testimony to the contrary.the defense also called officer tony eno of the rose city police department and attempted to have eno testify that corcoran had a reputation for not being truthful.
smith corroborated the three eye witnesses testimony.smith testified that washington told him that washington capped kinville.smith also testified that he helped dispose of the body.smith testified that he took the police to kinville body in a remote area of gladwin county.
there was also physical evidence against washington.the police searched washington residence pursuant to a valid search warrant,and they discovered,among other things,a pair of shorts,a gray shopping bag,and a pair of tennis shoes.forensic scientist kyle hoskins testified that she found human blood on all of these items.
washington testimony was substantially different from that of the other witnesses.he testified that he did not shoot kinville and that he did not know who did.he admitted to selling drugs to corcoran and smith.he testified that he took corcoran id as collateral for a debt.washington testified that he arose early in the morning to clean his front yard and that his neighbor was also outside.he testified that the first that he learned of kinville death was when neighbor dennis guchen,who testified earlier at trial,pointed out the body to him that was lying in the yard as the two were making casual conversation about sports and the weather.he testified that he looked across the street and saw corcoran looking crazy.washington told guchen that corcoran probably killed kinville.washington then talked with smith,who said that he would take care of it.washington went back to bed because he did not want anything to do with the dead body.
despite washington testimony,in january,a michigan jury found washington guilty of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.for the murder conviction,he received life imprisonment without the opportunity for parole for the firearm conviction,he received two years of imprisonment.
events concerning specific challenges in washington habeas petition 
there were three events at trial that assume a prominent role in washington habeas petition 
first,washington argues that the trial court improperly excluded evidence that witness corcoran the witness who moved the body was biased.the defense sought to demonstrate that corcoran was biased because charges against him were dismissed in a neighboring county.the charges were for being a felon in possession of a firearm,making a false report of a felony to the police,and being in possession of a firearm while under the influence of liquor.the defense argued that it was suspicious that the charges were all dismissed by an assistant prosecutor who was a retired saginaw city police officer.the trial court held that an inquiry concerning these charges would be legitimate.the judge said that defense counsel could explore the matter outside of the jury presence to determine whether there was a relationship between washington trial and corcoran dismissed charges.defense counsel asked the trial court for permission to telephone the prosecutor in the other county that had dismissed the charges against corcoran.the trial court agreed to defense counsel request.
the state called corcoran to the stand outside the jury presence.corcoran testified that he was not told why the charges were dismissed and that he told the county prosecutor that he was testifying in a murder case in saginaw county.corcoran testified that the prosecutor told corcoran that the charges were dropped because the charges were fluffed up.
the court then took a recess.when the court returned from recess,the court stated,
it appears from telephone calls to an assistant prosecutor in ogemaw county as well as defense counsel that at of this time,with the information available to both the prosecutor and the defense,that there was no between the testimony corcoran is going to give in this case and the dismissal of the charges.
however,since it is information has been very recent,i going to afford defense counsel a full opportunity to explore any avenues,and therefore,i will not allow the impeachment,if any,of corcoran today explore the,if any.
but i will allow the defense counsel ample opportunity so that he can continue any discussions he may have with the prosecutor in ogemaw county,defense counsel,and any other person.and we leave corcoran under subpoena subject to recall by either the prosecutor or the defense.
washington counsel first stated that he was agreeable to the court handling of the matter,and then he stated,
i think probably the record should reflect also that we took a break,i telephoned theunick,who is the assistant prosecutor in ogemaw county,and talked to him.
i then talked to jon macdonald,an attorney from ogemaw county,regarding the case for corcoran.and that the prosecutor in washington case spoke with macdonald by phone and also the court spoke to macdonald by phone.that was all done in chambers 
second,washington challenges his trial counsel failure to tell him that statements made without a miranda warning are admissible as impeaching evidence.the trial court excluded statements washington made in police custody because the police did not give washington miranda warnings.the state relied on the inadmissible statements,however,to impeach various parts of washington testimony.first,the state used the prior statements to challenge the amount of debt that corcoran owed washington.second,the state also used these statements to reveal that washington had lied to the police when he said that no one from up north was at his house.third,the state also noted that washington never mentioned to the police that he found a body in his yard.
finally,washington challenges the trial court decision not to admit into evidence a statement corcoran made to unidentified others in an unrelated case that if they talked to the police about an unrelated matter,they would wind up in the trunk and never be found.counsel stated that he wanted to use the evidence to demonstrate that corcoran had possibly murdered kinville.the trial court held that the alleged statement was hearsay on hearsay and irrelevant because it concerned another case that never went to trial.
appellate and habeas review 
washington brought six issues to the michigan court of appeals on direct appeal 
his inability to impeach corcoran with evidence of his dismissed charges in another county 
his counsel failure to inform him that his prior statements to the police could be used to impeach him even though those statements,taken without miranda warnings,could not be used as substantive evidence 
his inability to participate in his own defense because defense counsel did not provide him with requested copies of witness statements and police reports 
his ability to offer into evidence corcoran statement threatening another to pay or else end up in a trunk of a car 
irregularities in replacing an ill juror and 
prosecutorial misconduct.
before the state court decided his appeal,washington filed a motion to remand so that the trial court could hold an evidentiary hearing.see.in that motion,he sought an evidentiary hearing to develop the facts concerning,among other claims,his claim and his claim that he was not able to participate in his own defense.he attached an affidavit in which he declared that he had not received from his trial counsel documents that he requested and that he would have altered the questions posed on direct examination if he had known that his testimony could have been impeached by his otherwise inadmissible statements to the police.the appellate court denied his motion for remand.see.
the michigan court of appeals affirmed his conviction in may.see people washington,wl.may,per curiam.the court of appeals held the following 
that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of corcoran dismissed charges for impeachment purposes 
that washington failed to move for an evidentiary hearing concerning his claim and that the record,as it stood,did not support this claim 
that washington also failed to move for an evidentiary hearing concerning his claim and that the record,as it stood,did not support this claim 
that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of corcoran earlier statement concerning putting another in a trunk 
that washington intentionally relinquished his right to challenge the replacement of the ill juror and 
that washington failed to make a timely objection to prosecutorial misconduct and that no miscarriage of justice occurred.
see id.at.the supreme court of michigan denied his motion for leave to appeal in december.see people washington,table.
washington then filed his habeas petition with the federal district court in october.he brought the same six claims that he brought on direct appeal.the district court held that the and prosecutorial misconduct claims were procedurally defaulted.the district court held that the michigan court of appeals had not acted contrary to,or unreasonably applied,federal law in handling the other claims.the district court also held that the exclusion of corcoran statements for impeachment and substantive purposes was harmless even if there was constitutional error.the district court did not discuss how the michigan court of appeals first denied washington motion for an evidentiary hearing and then stated that washington had not requested an evidentiary hearing.the district court and the state appellate court treated washington claim that he was not permitted to participate in his defense as an claim,not a claim concerning a defendant right to.
the district court subsequently granted a certificate of appealability on washington claims concerning the four issues raised here.see washington renico,no,wl,at.the district court refused to certify washington and prosecutorial misconduct claims.see id.this court refused to extend the certificate of appealability in september.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,governs review of washington petition,filed in october,because washington filed it after the statute effective date of april.see woodford garceau,d.the district court may grant washington petition only if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
applying aedpa highly deferential standard,we affirm.first,the michigan court of appeals did not unreasonably apply federal law in deciding that the trial court exclusion of impeaching evidence did not violate washington right to confront witnesses.second,even though the michigan court of appeals reasoning concerning washington and claims was based on a clearly erroneous determination that washington had not moved for remand,washington was properly denied an evidentiary hearing on both of these claims.he has not alleged sufficient grounds entitling him to relief.finally,the michigan court of appeals did not unreasonably apply federal law in deciding that the trial court exclusion of substantive evidence did not violate washington right to due process.
confrontation claim 
the michigan court of appeals decision affirming the exclusion of impeachment evidence was not an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent for three reasons.washington argues that the dismissal of corcoran charges in another jurisdiction weeks before trial could indicate,despite the statements of all of the lawyers involved,that corcoran agreed to testify in washington case only if the prosecutors in the other jurisdiction would dismiss his charges.but,first,the trial court did not infringe upon washington constitutional right to confront witnesses against him when excluding the proffered impeachment evidence because the evidence was cumulative and only marginally relevant.second,even if the evidence were relevant and not cumulative,the admission of the proffered evidence would not have significantly altered the jury impression of corcoran credibility because washington was able to impeach corcoran in several other,effective ways.and finally,even if it were unreasonable to deny counsel the opportunity to pursue the line of at issue,the error did not affect the jury verdict 
first,the trial court decision to exclude inquiry into corcoran dismissed charges in another county was a reasonable limit on.in delaware van arsdall,the supreme court held that the exposure of a witness motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of,d quoting davis alaska,d,but trial judges retain wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on such based on concerns about,among other things,prejudice,confusion of the issues,or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant,id.at.the michigan court of appeals held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence because washington had not demonstrated a sufficient causal connection between the charges that were dismissed in another county by a prosecutor not involved in the case and washington trial.to support an inference that some form of immunity or agreement existed,which would in turn support another permissible inference that corcoran was biased,washington would have had to demonstrate that corcoran,the prosecutor in washington case,and the attorneys in the other county were all lying about the nonexistence of any quid pro quo.without making such a demonstration,the evidence was only marginally relevant,see id.at,because the mere fact alone that corcoran charges had been dismissed would only make it slightly more,if at all,probable that he would have reason to slant his testimony.the state courts did not act unreasonably in determining that the impeaching evidence was of limited relevance.
moreover,the evidence of bias would have been merely cumulative considering that washington impeached corcoran in several other ways.washington counsel impeached corcoran by delving into his extensive criminal record,relying on corcoran prior inconsistent statements in a preliminary hearing and in a police interview,noting his use of drugs,and pointing to other felonies,for which corcoran had not been charged,that corcoran had committed.the defense also rather unsuccessfully attempted to establish that corcoran had a reputation for not being truthful.the court also permitted the defense to read officer zinz testimony that corcoran had a woman on corcoran end of the telephone answer the questions that officer zinz posed to corcoran.finally,the jury learned that corcoran was involved in the murder by moving the body.the defense,therefore,had extensively impeached corcoran and demonstrated that corcoran,as a witness to the murder,had reason to blame another individual.the trial court did not act unreasonably in limiting marginally relevant evidence in light of the many ways in which the defense impeached corcoran.
the cumulative nature of the impeaching evidence supports the second reason that the state court decision is not unreasonable admission of the impeachment evidence would not have given the jury a significantly different impression of corcoran credibility.the supreme court in van arsdall stated that,even if the trial court abuses its discretion in excluding the evidence,there is a constitutional violation only if a reasonable jury might have received a significantly different impression of the witness credibility had defense counsel been permitted to pursue the proposed line of.id.at.because washington impeached corcoran testimony in several ways,the jury would not have had a significantly different impression of corcoran credibility.
a comparison between the facts of van arsdall and this case reveals that there was no constitutional violation in this case.in van arsdall,the witness that the defendant sought to impeach had a drunkenness charge dropped after he agreed to speak with the prosecutor about van arsdall case.van arsdall,at.the supreme court held that the trial court violated van arsdall right to confront witnesses against him by not permitting the defense to mention the dropped charges and the witness promise to speak to prosecutors regarding the murder allegedly committed by van arsdall.id.at.assuming,without deciding,that there are no material differences between the lines of questioning in van arsdall and this case,washington still has not been able to demonstrate that the jurors in his case would have had a significantly different impression of corcoran credibility had washington been able to discuss corcoran charges that were dismissed in another county.the defense in van arsdall was not able to impeach the witness in any way,and thus there was prejudice.id.at.in contrast and as previously mentioned,defense counsel in this case had extensively impeached corcoran testimony.washington does not explain why the excluded impeaching evidence would have had a significant impact on the jury impression of corcoran credibility 
finally,even if it were unreasonable for the state trial court to determine that washington right to confront witnesses against him was not violated,this error did not have a substantial and injurious effect on the jury verdict.in brecht abrahamson,the supreme court held that,if this court determines on collateral review that the defendant confrontation right was violated,this court must ask whether the error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict,d quoting kotteakos united states.in washington case,corcoran testimony was important but corroborated on material points by two other witnesses who stated that washington was the shooter,and smith testified that washington admitted to being the shooter.finally,the prosecution case was strengthened by washington unbelievable testimony that he knew nothing of the dead body in his yard until a neighbor pointed it out and that he went to bed right after learning of it.thus,any constitutional error here does not warrant habeas relief.
for these reasons,the michigan court of appeals reasonably held that the trial court did not violate washington right to confront witnesses against him.
claim for counsel failure to warn washington that his excluded confession could be used for impeachment purposes 
although the state court and district court opinions concerning washington claim did not fairly consider washington requests for an evidentiary hearing,washington is not entitled to habeas relief on this claim.the determinative issue in this case is whether evidence may exist that would entitle washington to release,such that the district court should have granted him an evidentiary hearing.washington,however,has failed to demonstrate that he would be entitled to release because he has not shown that the jury would have returned a different verdict if his counsel had not erred.because washington can not make his required showing,we do not remand for an evidentiary hearing 
washington can not demonstrate that his alleged grounds,if proven,warrant his release because he can not show that his counsel alleged to inform him that statements made without a required miranda warning could be used for impeachment despite their inadmissibility as substantive him.whether washington has alleged grounds sufficient for his release depends upon whether washington can demonstrate that he received ineffective assistance of counsel under the test provided in strickland washington,d.under strickland,a defendant right to effective assistance of counsel is violated where counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and where there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.mcfarland,at internal quotation marks and citations to strickland,at,omitted.our de novo review of these claims convinces us that,even if washington is able after an evidentiary hearing to demonstrate that his counsel representation fell below a reasonable level washington has not demonstrated that there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have returned a different verdict in the absence of defense counsel error.
washington can demonstrate no prejudice because only one of the three statements used to impeach him was material,and those statements material or otherwise could not have affected the jury verdict in the face of washington implausible testimony.first,only one of the statements used to impeach washington referred to kinville,when the state pointed out that washington never mentioned to the police finding a body in his yard.the other statements dealt with collateral matters the amount of a debt and whether people from the north were at his house.the jury almost certainly would not have attached much significance to these two discrepancies.
second,washington story was so implausible that the impeachment concerning the prior statements could not have made a significant difference to the jury.washington testified that he did not learn of the dead body until he was cleaning his yard at five in the morning.he said he talked with smith,who said he would take care of it,and he went back to bed.he did not call the police.although he stated that he did not go up right by the body which he also said was not bleeding,despite at least two gun shots,washington shorts and shoes had blood on them.washington never attempted to explain why he had blood on his shoes or shorts.in other words,even if the evidence did not squarely indicate that washington was the shooter,it demonstrated that he was almost certainly at the scene when the murder occurred and knew what happened,which contradicted his version of events.because it is highly unlikely that the three impeaching incidents challenged in this habeas petition had a substantial impact on the jury verdict considering all of the evidence presented at trial,washington can not demonstrate that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.
washington was therefore properly denied an evidentiary hearing on this matter.
washington participation in his defense 
washington is also not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claim that he was not permitted to assist in his defense because he has not alleged sufficient grounds for release.as with washington claim,he moved for,and was denied,an evidentiary hearing to determine whether his counsel refused to provide him upon his request with police reports and witness statements.the question again is whether the district court,which did not address the state court denial of his request,abused its discretion in denying him an evidentiary hearing.as with washington claim concerning the impeaching statements,the issue here is whether washington has alleged sufficient grounds entitling him to relief.washington is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing because he is unable to demonstrate prejudice from his counsel alleged error to provide him documents.
even assuming that the evidence reveals that washington trial counsel acted unreasonably in refusing to show him requested documents,washington has failed to demonstrate any prejudice.to receive an evidentiary hearing,bald assertions and conclusory allegations do not provide sufficient ground to warrant requiring an evidentiary hearing,stanford parker,cir.washington argues that he can not demonstrate prejudice because he has not received an evidentiary hearing to determine what prejudice exists.this court has already held that washington reasoning is circular and would entitle every habeas defendant to an evidentiary hearing on any issue.bowling,at.although washington averred in his affidavit that he still had not reviewed the documents he requested,he offers no reason why his current counsel could not show him those documents and permit him to identify which inquiries,if any,he would have pursued or which statements,if any,he could have used to his benefit.because washington has not demonstrated any prejudice from his counsel alleged refusal to permit washington to review documents,he was properly denied an evidentiary hearing on his claim.
to avoid our consideration of prejudice,washington frames his claim as one concerning his ability to provide.this contention is without merit.washington argues that the supreme court recognized his right to participate in his defense in faretta california,d,the case in which the supreme court recognized that defendants have a constitutional right to represent themselves.he relies on language in faretta that mentions the assistance of counsel in the context of determining that the right to put on a defense is the right of the defendant.see washington br.at.it appears that his argument is that the greater right to represent one self necessarily includes the lesser right to participate in one own defense by demanding that his counsel comply with his requests.the better supreme court case for washington claim,however,is strickland because the supreme court expressly discussed,albeit in dicta,counsel duty to assist clients 
representation of a criminal defendant entails certain basic duties.counsel function is to assist the defendant from counsel function as assistant to the defendant derive the overarching duty to advocate the defendant cause and the more particular duties to consult with the defendant on important decisions and to keep the defendant informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution.
at.strickland language is more on point,and,thus,washington claim sounds in ineffective assistance of counsel,not.
treating washington claim as one concerning ineffective assistance of counsel also makes practical sense because strickland requires washington to demonstrate prejudice.washington relies on the right of,rather than ineffective assistance of counsel,because denial of the faretta right is a structural error for which washington need not show any prejudice.see mckaskle wiggins,d.ineffective assistance of counsel,in contrast,requires that the defendant demonstrate that his counsel error was prejudicial.see strickland,at.requiring defendants to demonstrate prejudice makes sense for participation claims because,unlike claims,the participation errors come in various degrees and will usually not be on the record.the right to is either respected or denied,mckaskle,at,and a waiver of counsel can occur only if made knowingly and voluntarily on the record,see faretta,at.in contrast,the right to participate may be marginally infringed or irrelevant to the merits of the case,and the error will almost never appear in the record these considerations support treating a claim as an claim and thus determining whether defense counsel error prejudiced the defendant.
because washington has not demonstrated prejudice as to his claim,washington was properly denied an evidentiary hearing on this claim.
the michigan court of appeals did not unreasonably apply federal law in determining that the exclusion of evidence that corcoran stated that two people would end up in a trunk if they told the police about a different criminal matter did not violate washington right to present his defense.washington relies primarily upon chambers mississippi,d,in which the supreme court held that the defendant combined inability to impeach his own witness and to present trustworthy statements that his witness had admitted to the murder at issue violated the due process clause by rendering the defendant trial fundamentally unfair.the state courts determination that the exclusion of corcoran statement did not render washington trial fundamentall
