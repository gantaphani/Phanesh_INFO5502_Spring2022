donnie johnson,a prisoner on death row in tennessee,appeals from the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the sole issue on appeal concerns the performance of defense counsel during the sentencing phase of the trial,which petitioner contends amounted to constitutionally ineffective assistance.the district court declined to issue the writ on this ground because it concluded that counsel satisfied the sixth amendment standards governing the right to effective representation as defined by strickland washington,d.we now affirm that judgment.
because the scope of this appeal is limited,the underlying facts that gave rise to petitioner prosecution,while tragic,are not germane to our discussion.they are set forth at some length in the opinion of the supreme court of tennessee affirming petitioner conviction and sentence on direct appeal.state johnson,cert.denied,d.suffice it to say that petitioner brutally murdered his wife,connie johnson,on december,at the camping equipment center where he worked.with the help of a,he then disposed of her body and rather ineffectively set about covering up his crime.
during his trial,petitioner was represented by retained counsel jeff crow and clark washington.washington background was primarily in civil practice.crow testified in state proceedings that he had conducted five or six criminal trials before this one but could not remember whether the one murder trial he had had been a case.the sentencing phase of the trial took place over october and.the jury found both the aggravating circumstances presented to it johnson had previously been convicted of one or more felonies that involved the use of threat or violence the murder was especially heinous,atrocious,and cruel in that it involved torture or depravity of the mind.although he did not testify during the guilt phase of his trial,petitioner elected to take the stand during his sentencing hearing.he denied that he killed his wife and attempted to shift the blame to his,who was on work release from prison at the time of the murder.johnson,at.he conceded,however,that he assisted in the disposal of his wife corpse.
defense counsel called only one other witness in mitigation,robert lee,a minister who had counseled johnson and his family while he was in jail.the minister testified that johnson had told him that his faith in god was what was sustaining him through this ordeal.he also expressed to me that he knew that ultimately one day he would have to give an accounting of his life to god.
as mentioned,the jury returned a sentence of death.after exhausting his direct appeals,petitioner initiated a action in the criminal court of shelby county,tennessee,alleging for the first time that he received ineffective assistance during the sentencing phase of his trial because his attorneys failed adequately to investigate or otherwise develop mitigating evidence.the court held an evidentiary hearing,which included the testimony of petitioner,certain of his family members,trial counsel,and experts on the topic of proper practices in preparing for sentencing proceedings in a capital case.
ruby johnson,petitioner mother,testified that she spoke with attorney washington once about her son case and that he talked very little about it to me.she met attorney crow only on the day of trial.according to johnson,she was not asked about her son background or marriage even though he and his wife had lived next door to her since their marriage.she did not know of any problems between her son and his wife.rather,she believed him to be a hard worker who cared for his family and raised children.despite this information,she was not asked to testify.
james johnson,petitioner father,contended that petitioner was one of the most devoted person s to his family that i have ever seen,and that he was a good son,a hard worker,and a good family man.johnson went on to assert that trial counsel asked him very little about his son boyhood and schooling.concerning the fact that he did not testify at trial,petitioner father indicated that he had been willing to do so but had been advised by counsel that it would be unwise.petitioner brother,james johnson,continued with this theme,stating that trial counsel did not ask him about his brother background other than an earlier arrest in ohio.had he testified,james johnson would have asserted that he had spent a significant amount of time with petitioner and his family and that there was never an altercation of any kind that i remember other than fun and laughter.like his father,james johnson stated that he was available to testify on behalf of his brother,but trial counsel said it would be advisable not to.
petitioner sister,shirley ward,testified that trial counsel never contacted her.she stated that petitioner was a good family man who did not have any problems at home.on cross examination,she admitted that she knew nothing of petitioner alleged or admitted extramarital relationships.
mary ward,petitioner other sister,testified that she told trial counsel that she was available to testify at trial but was never contacted by counsel.she,too,indicated that she had been with the deceased numerous times and they had a very happy marriage.on cross examination she stated,all i know is that donnie loved connie,and he would not have killed her.and they had a happy marriage.she did not know anything about the alleged problems in petitioner marriage.
in addition to these five family members,three other potential character witnesses testified at the hearing.a childhood friend,barry gray,stated that he had known petitioner to be a good friend,hard worker,and a caring family man.james ingram,petitioner jailer pending trial,mentioned that petitioner had caused no trouble while incarcerated and had a clean disciplinary record.and,finally,david force,petitioner employer,asserted that petitioner had been a good employee.
the hearing contained contradictory testimony concerning the extent to which trial counsel contacted family members,evaluated their potential testimony,and considered asking them to testify during the sentencing phase of the proceedings.while the family members recall some fleeting contact,they uniformly contend that they were discouraged from testifying.their position,however,is somewhat at odds with the memory of trial counsel.jeff crow,lead trial counsel,testified that family members indicated to him that they did not want to take the stand.according to him,as i remember,we talked to the family.we talked to the minister.we talked to johnson.and we decided after doing all that to handle the sentencing hearing in the manner in which it was done.petitioner,clark washington,corroborated crow testimony that family members were reluctant to appear at trial.all of them wanted to help don johnson,washington testified,but they were concerned or afraid or not wanting to really come in under the spotlight in a courtroom and take a witness chair.
the record suggests that crow and washington were diligent in preparing for the guilt phase of the trial but gave scant attention to the sentencing phase until the verdict was returned.in fact,crow testified that his main preparation for sentencing was to review the tennessee code on procedure while the guilt portion of the trial was under way.
on august,the tennessee trial court issued an order denying relief.the court accepted trial counsel testimony that family members could not or would not get involved in testifying.any testimony from them that petitioner was a good worker and had a good marriage would have opened the door to rebuttal evidence of strains in his marriage,the court concluded.the court indicated that family members testimony would not have been enough to overcome the jury apparent rejection of petitioner direct testimony and the devastating cross examination that followed.citing strickland,supra,the court found nothing in the evidentiary hearing to suggest that there was any failure of counsel to meet the standards of competence required in criminal cases or that any action or inaction on their part prejudiced the case of their client.
petitioner appealed to the tennessee court of criminal appeals,which affirmed the trial court judgment.johnson state,wl.june.the court reasoned as follows 
at the hearing,members of the appellant family testified they wished to testify at the convicting trial but were not called to do so.
these witnesses testified they would have told the jury the appellant was a hard worker who loved his family.the major flaw in this was the fact the appellant was convicted of murdering his wife.
we conclude this evidence would not have benefitted the appellant,and the failure of the trial lawyer to call these witnesses during the penalty phase of the trial gives no right to a new trial.
wl at.citation omitted.the supreme court of tennessee declined to review this decision.thereafter,petitioner initiated another,ultimately unsuccessful challenge that is not relevant to the sole issue before us.
after exhausting his avenues of redress,petitioner filed the instant habeas corpus petition on november,raising twenty grounds for relief.the district court denied the petition.johnson bell.however,the district court issued a certificate of appealability pursuant to c on the sole issue of whether petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing phase of his trial due to the failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence.
we review de novo the legal conclusions of a district court in a habeas proceeding.mitzel tate,cir.because johnson filed his habeas petition on november,after the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa became effective,this court review of state court conclusions is governed by aedpa.id.under aedpa provisions,we may not grant a writ of habeas corpus for any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the adjudication 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in a state court proceeding.
d.in addition,the findings of fact made by a state court are presumed to be correct and can be contravened only if the habeas petitioner can show by clear and convincing evidence that the state court factual findings were erroneous.e.
in williams taylor,d,the court interpreted d as requiring a distinction between decisions that are contrary to and those that involve an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent.id.at.a state court decision is contrary to supreme court precedent if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law,or if the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at a result opposite to ours.id.a state court decision is also contrary to supreme court precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in that precedent.id.
a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from the supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case.id.at.
with these precepts in mind,we turn to the legal issue before us.at this point,the test used to determine whether a criminal defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel is extremely familiar,even if the precise manner of its application continues to occupy the court.compare wiggins smith,d,and williams taylor,supra,with bell cone,d.as the court put it nearly twenty years ago 
first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.unless a defendant makes both showings,it can not be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.
strickland washington,d see also mason mitchell,cir greer mitchell,cir.
in assessing counsel performance,we inquire whether counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,as measured by prevailing professional norms.rickman bell,cir quoting strickland,at.this objective reasonableness standard encompasses strategic litigation choices that simply fail to bear fruit.see strickland,at.to establish prejudice,moreover,a defendant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.
in evaluating petitioner claim,we are mindful of the supreme court opinion in bell cone,supra,which reversed a grant of the writ by this court.see cone bell,cir.in cone,we observed that counsel presentation during the sentencing phase was a complete abdication of the attorney role.during the guilt phase,counsel had presented evidence of his client social history and mental state in an attempt to raise a defense of insanity.in the sentencing phase,however,counsel presented no mitigating evidence at all,made no final argument,and did not even ask the jury to spare his client life.cone,at.the supreme court reversed and,in doing so,reminded us that a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance because it is all too easy to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable in the harsh light of hindsight.cone.at citing strickland see also mason,at boggs,dissenting characterizing cone as making abundantly clear the extremely high standard that must be met for counsel representation in the penalty phase to be considered constitutionally inadequate but see wiggins smith.at.at scope of investigation into client misery as a youth fell short of the professional standards then prevailing because counsel knew of unfortunate childhood and there was nothing to suggest that further investigation would have been either counterproductive or fruitless williams taylor,at.holding that failure to investigate petitioner background,which was horrific,resulted in ineffective assistance as defined by strickland.
we note that the present case contains elements similar to those of previous cases in which this court has been sufficiently troubled by allegations of ineffective assistance that we either granted the writ or remanded for an evidentiary hearing.among other factors,this court has found it telling that trial counsel did not begin preparing for the mitigation phase of the trial until after conviction.greer,at see also williams,at.finding it significant that counsel began preparation for mitigation only a week before trial.despite greer and other sixth circuit cases that have reached a similar result,see,mason,at remanding for evidentiary hearing concerning failure to develop mitigating evidence of petitioner troubled childhood coleman mitchell,cir ineffective assistance during mitigation for failure to investigate or present evidence of troubled background skaggs parker,cir austin bell,cir glenn tate,cir,we are to reconcile cone with a conclusion that counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance by not vigorously interviewing family members and pressing them to testify during the sentencing phase of the trial.while counsel in wiggins had sufficient information about their client horrific childhood to render their failure to pursue further investigation professionally unreasonable,there is nothing to suggest that counsel in the instant case ignored known leads that might have helped them to prepare their case in mitigation.as the court has reminded us,strickland does not require counsel to investigate every conceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely the effort would be to assist the defendant at sentenci
