floyd richardson was convicted by an illinois state court jury for the armed robbery of twin foods and liquors and the murder of store clerk george vrabel.in,he was sentenced to death for these crimes since that time,he unsuccessfully worked his way through the appeal and review process in illinois.he then filed a habeas corpus petition in federal district court and an evidentiary hearing was held in august.the district court granted richardson petition for a writ of habeas corpus,finding that his conviction was tainted by intentional deception on the part of the prosecution.we,however,find that richardson did not meet his burden of proving prejudice and,therefore,we reverse the decision of the district court and vacate the grant of the writ.
twin foods and liquors is a convenience store located in chicago.on april,at about,the store was robbed and a clerk,george vrabel,was fatally shot.in the early morning of april,a tavern one mile away was also robbed and its owner was shot and wounded.ballistics evidence linked the two crimes.
richardson was arrested on may,as a suspect in an unrelated robbery.at that time,detectives reopened the investigation into vrabel murder.detectives john solecki and joseph digiacomo put together a photo lineup which included richardson photo and showed it to witnesses of the two robberies.several of the witnesses identified richardson,and he was charged with murder.
testimony at trial 
ballistics evidence proved that the same gun was used in both the twin foods robbery and the tavern robbery.ernest warner,a chicago police department firearms examiner,testified that he had examined bullets that were recovered from the twin foods location and from the tavern.he explained that in order to determine whether two different bullets were fired from the same gun,he uses class characteristics common to all guns produced by the same manufacturer and individual characteristics unique to each gun.he concluded that the same gun fired the bullets recovered from the sites of both robberies.the murder weapon,however,was never recovered.
witnesses of the twin foods robbery 
shirley bowden was working as a cashier at twin foods and liquors the night of the robbery.at about,she noticed a man standing near the liquor department who was huddled up in his coat even though it was not especially cold that night.the man walked to the liquor department and passed within four feet of bowden.a few minutes later,bowden heard a gunshot and the warning,stay down mother fucker.this is a stickup.stay down.bowden looked toward the liquor department and saw the man she had noticed earlier reaching over the counter and taking money from the register.after she heard a second shot,the robber ran through the store and out the front door,passing bowden as he did so.bowden ducked behind the counter when she saw him coming toward her but stood up after he exited to verify which direction he was running.bowden called the police and then went to the liquor department to find vrabel lying on the floor and bleeding.
at trial,bowden identified floyd richardson as the man whom she saw commit the robbery and murder.she also testified that she had seen richardson in the neighborhood prior to april.she had not viewed a lineup or photo array before trial.
bonnie williams was also working at twin foods on the night of the robbery.williams testified that she ducked behind a counter when told that a robbery was occurring.when she heard the first shot,she stood up and looked toward the liquor department in time to see a man reaching behind the counter and taking money out of the register.the man ran out of the store past williams and bowden.williams was able to see his whole face when it was just a few feet away.
williams identified richardson in open court and testified that she had selected his photograph from both black and white and color photo arrays that police officers had shown her in.she said she had seen richardson once before the robbery,but that she did not know him personally.
witnesses of the tavern robbery 
thomas fitzpatrick testified about the april robbery which took place at his tavern about one mile from twin foods.at approximately,he was standing at the cash register of his tavern when a man entered waving a gun.the man said this is a stickup and jumped over the bar.fitzpatrick tried to run away from the man and was shot in the back.he stated that he crawled to a hallway and lay on the floor face up.the assailant approached and stood over fitzpatrick and demanded to know where the rest of the money was located.when fitzpatrick said there was no more money,the robber left the store.fitzpatrick testified that there was a fluorescent light right above him as he spoke to the robber and that you could see very well.he also claimed that he was fully conscious during the encounter,even though he had been shot.
in may,fitzpatrick tentatively identified richardson as the gunman after viewing both black and white and color photographs.he viewed a lineup on october,and again identified richardson as the man who shot him.at trial,he testified,i just positive when i identified him in the lineup that that was the man that came after me and shot me.he further testified,when i saw floyd richardson in the lineup,i knew it was him,positively.there was no doubt in my mind.fitzpatrick also identified richardson in court.
ray slagle was a patron in fitzpatrick tavern on the night of the robbery.when he heard shots,he stepped behind a partition and watched everything that happened from a distance of about ten feet.he saw a man reaching into the cash register.slagle looked around the partition three or four times to observe the robber actions.slagle threw a chair at the robber as he ran toward the exit.like fitzpatrick,slagle testified that the tavern was well lit.
slagle also testified that he picked richardson photograph out of a police photo array and later identified him in a lineup.he identified richardson as the robber at trial.
defense witnesses 
the defense called detective john solecki,who testified that he had interviewed witnesses to the vrabel shooting and then sent a flash message from the scene describing the suspect as having a full,trimmed beard.he did not identify who had given him that description.
after examining solecki,richardson attorney advised the trial judge that it was possible that he intended to call another witness.the judge then called a short recess.when trial resumed,the following colloquy took place between lazzaro,one of the assistant state attorneys prosecuting the case,and babb,one of the assistant public defenders representing richardson 
lazzaro your honor,i just want to raise,on the record,that which has occurred in the last or minutes or so.listed in a supplemental answer to discovery,which we gave to counsel,was a name of a floyd butler that actually is lloyd butler.it a typographical error and his real name is,in fact,a leonard butler.he just goes by the name of lloyd.i have informed counsel as to certain statements that butler will give in rebuttal,if myron moses is called.
he would deny telling butler that shortly,within a matter of hours after the incident,that the person coming out the door was,in fact,floyd richardson,and i informed counsel that is the rebuttal testimony that i expect as to butler.i have informed him that butler is,in fact,employed by the rosemont police department and they can contact him there,if they have any questions.
i just want the record to show i,in fact,giving them that information if,in fact,myron moses is called as a witness.is that correct,counsel 
babb except,we do intend to put him on to deny anything.we intend to put him on for the purpose of saying he knew floyd richardson and that was not floyd richardson that came out of there with a gun.
the court at which point,the cross examination 
lazzaro would be as to what he spoke to butler,and i want the record to reflect that is the information that has been given to me by butler.
babb and also,to be fair,moses has been confronted with that,in our presence,and he denies that he said that to butler,who is a brother of his girlfriend.
lazzaro this is in the nature of further discovery.the believability,the voracity sic is for the jury.
the court it for somebody other than those of us who are in the room.
babb we are simply not going to put him on today.we want to talk to butler.
the court what do you want me to do as far as this jury is concerned 
babb send them home.
trial tr.at.the trial judge then recessed the trial for the rest of the day.
the next day,the defense called richardson mother.she testified that richardson never had a full beard,only a mustache and a goatee.the defense then rested.the record does not reflect any further discussion about myron moses or leonard butler.
sentencing 
the jury found richardson guilty of murder and armed robbery.richardson waived his right to a jury at sentencing.in aggravation,the prosecution offered evidence of two previous armed robbery convictions and convictions for felony theft,possession of a controlled substance,and unlawful use of a weapon.richardson had been arrested in seven other instances,though the charges were dismissed,and had struck a correctional officer while incarcerated.the prosecution also offered evidence relating to the may,attempted robbery which led to richardson arrest.
as mitigation testimony,richardson mother and common law wife were called.his mother explained that richardson had helped to take care of his brothers and sisters after his father died.his wife testified that richardson loved her and that he tried to make a better life for her and their two children.richardson took the stand and denied shooting either vrabel or fitzpatrick.
the trial judge sentenced richardson to death and the conviction and sentence were affirmed by the illinois supreme court on direct appeal in.people richardson,richardson i.the united states supreme court denied certiorari in march.richardson illinois,d richardson ii.
proceedings 
in january,richardson filed a petition for relief under the illinois hearing act.comp.stat.richardson argued that his trial counsel were ineffective because they did not object to the dismissal of prospective jurors who were black,they did not call myron moses to testify,and they did not present significant mitigation evidence at the sentencing hearing.richardson also found fault with his appellate counsel.finally,he argued that the prosecution had violated batson kentucky,d,by removing jurors solely on the basis of race.the petition was dismissed in.richardson appealed to the illinois supreme court and the lower court ruling was affirmed.people richardson,richardson iii.the united states supreme court again denied certiorari.richardson illinois,d richardson iv.
federal habeas corpus petition 
richardson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in february.he argued that his due process rights were violated in several different ways.most relevant to this appeal,he alleged that assistant state attorney lazzaro committed prosecutorial misconduct when he falsely informed richardson counsel that leonard butler would impeach the testimony of myron moses.richardson supported this claim with several affidavits.moses stated that he knew richardson,that he had seen the twin foods robber flee the store,and that the robber was not richardson.butler stated that he had never gone by the names lloyd or floyd,moses had not told him that richardson was the man moses saw running from the store,and butler had never told the prosecutors or the police that moses had said any such thing.richardson stated that he told his counsel that they should call moses in spite of the potential impeaching testimony,but that they had explained to richardson that it would look bad if a police officer testified in rebuttal.richardson then agreed that moses should not be called.richardson trial counsel submitted affidavits stating that they did not remember why they had not called moses to testify,whether they had spoken to moses,or whether they had interviewed butler.
the state argues that richardson prosecutorial misconduct claim was procedurally defaulted because it was not raised in state court.however,over an objection from the state,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the claims of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel.citing thomas mccaughtry,cir,the court agreed that the prosecutorial misconduct claim had not been raised in state court but held that the procedural default could be excused if richardson could show cause and prejudice for his failure to raise the claim.
the district court found that richardson did show cause and prejudice because the prosecutor misrepresentation impeded richardson ability to raise the claim in state court.the state acknowledges that the district court credibility and demeanor evidence is difficult to challenge therefore,the cause determination is not contested.instead the state argues that richardson did not meet his burden of proving prejudice.for the reasons set forth below,we agree that richardson was not prejudiced by the prosecutor statement.
ii.analysis 
richardson habeas petition is governed by as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.in a habeas appeal,this court reviews the district court findings of fact for clear error.legal conclusions and mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo.see,foster schomig,cir warren richland county circuit court,cir.
the purpose of the aedpa is to advance the doctrines of comity,finality,and federalism.see williams taylor,d.it is an attempt to limit the scope of federal intrusion into state criminal adjudications and to safeguard the states interest in the integrity of their criminal and collateral proceedings.id.at.
evidentiary hearing 
section e controls whether richardson should have received an evidentiary hearing on his claim in the district court.the statute reads as follows 
if the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings,the court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows that 
a the claim relies on 
i a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable or 
ii a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence and 
b the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
e.it is undisputed that richardson did not fully develop the factual basis of his prosecutorial misconduct claim in state court.however,u nder the opening clause of e,a failure to develop the factual basis of a claim is not established unless there is a lack of diligence,or some greater fault,attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner counsel.williams,at.emphasis added.
the district court found that there was no lack of diligence on the part of richardson counsel rather,their further inquiry regarding the myron butler matter was effectively thwarted by their reasonable reliance on the veracity of the prosecutor misrepresentations at trial.richardson briley,c,wl,at,richardson v.we have stated that a petitioner should not be penalized for presenting an issue to us that he was unable to present to the state courts because of the state misconduct.crivens roth,cir.if the failure to develop the factual basis of the prosecutorial misconduct claim should not be attributed to richardson,he does not have to meet the strict standards for the granting of an evidentiary hearing found in e a and b.see davis lambert,cir.however,if that section does not apply,it is then necessary to evaluate the request for an evidentiary hearing under standards.id.at quoting matheney anderson,cir.under standards,a federal evidentiary hearing is required if a habeas petitioner alleges facts which,if proved,would entitle him to relief and the state reasons beyond the control of the considered the claim in a full and fair hearing.matheney,at.see also davis,at hampton leibach,cir.
the district court did not consider richardson request for an evidentiar
