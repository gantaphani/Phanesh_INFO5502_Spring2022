john wesley jones appeals from the dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to.although the district court denied jones habeas relief,it granted a certificate of appealability on his claim that the state trial court had unconstitutionally excluded evidence of remorse at his sentencing hearing.in addition,we granted a certificate of appealability on jones claim that his trial counsel labored under an actual conflict of interest that affected his representation of jones.finding no basis for habeas relief,we now affirm the dismissal of jones habeas petition.
in late july and august of,jones was tried in north carolina state court for the murder of his adult son,charles little john meadows.the parties do not dispute the underlying facts.
on september,meadows was walking along a rural route in jones county,north carolina,with joyce hill,nancy hill,and nancy hill child.at an intersection,they met queen jones,who was in her car with her children,marissa jones and thomas jones her mother,rena jones and her sister,christine jones.queen jones was looking for joyce hill to ask if she would babysit marissa and thomas.as meadows and the hills approached,marissa,thomas,and christine began to exit the car.
just then,jones approached in his car.he passed through the intersection,turned his car around,and stopped on the side of the road.jones got out of the car and pulled a shotgun from the back seat.meadows,christine,marissa,and thomas then clambered into the back seat of queen jones car rena and queen jones remained in the front seats.jones approached the car,loading his gun.when he reached the side of the car on which meadows was sitting,he cocked the gun and fired through the car door.he then reloaded the gun,walked back to his car,and drove away.the shot hit meadows in the chest,killing him some of the buckshot injured marissa jones.
louis foy represented jones in both the guilt and the penalty phases of the trial.foy concurrently represented prosecution witness joyce hill in an unrelated domestic relations matter.at trial,hill testified that after jones shot meadows,he walked away like he shot a dog,and foy did not extensively her.foy had not obtained a written waiver of any conflict of interest from jones.indeed,foy is not certain that he told jones of the concurrent representation.
upon consideration of all of the testimony,the jury convicted jones of murder,assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury,and discharging a firearm into occupied property.
in the penalty phase of the trial,the prosecution presented evidence of two aggravating factors jones had previously been convicted of three felonies involving violence or the threat of violence,and in the commission of meadows murder,he had knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person meadows and marissa jones by means of a weapon normally hazardous to the lives of more than one person.
jones called eighteen witnesses to present evidence of mitigating circumstances.his initial witness was jasper jones,the grandfather of marissa jones.during jasper jones testimony,the following exchange occurred 
defense counsel do you have an opinion as to whether john is sorry for what he did 
jasper jones that what he told me.
prosecutor objection.
the court that motion to strike is allowed.objection is sustained.ladies and gentlemen of the jury,disregard the witnesses sic last statement.
defense counsel no further questions.
forensic psychiatrist billy royal,appearing as a defense witness,read to the jury a letter written by jones to his wife.the state objected on hearsay grounds.the court instructed the jury that it could consider the contents of the letter only as an explanation of the basis for royal opinion and not as substantive evidence.royal then read jones letter i have always loved you very special as i have done little john,but as life itself can be a mistake,i just made a great one.i know what little john brother meant to you.jones did not attempt to introduce further evidence of remorse.
in his closing argument,the prosecutor referred to jones alleged lack of remorse,arguing that jones neither cried nor attempted to help meadows after the shooting.the prosecutor emphasized that the jury could not consider the letter from jones that royal read into the record as substantive evidence.and he reminded the jury that,although in his allocution jones may get up and tell you how sorry he is or how it has affected his name and himself and how i did not mean to do it,those statements would not be evidence.
at the close of the evidence,the court instructed the jury as to aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the jury deliberated for four hours without reaching a verdict before retiring for the day.the following day,after asking the court how many years constituted a life sentence and being told it could not consider such a matter,the jury informed the court that it could not reach a unanimous decision.the court then gave the jury an allen charge.see allen united states.
that afternoon,the jury returned a unanimous recommendation that jones be sentenced to death.the jury found both of the aggravating factors urged by the prosecution it also found that seven of the eighteen factors presented by the defense had mitigating value.in response to the provision,under which the jury could have considered evidence of jones remorse because remorse was not one of the seventeen specific mitigating factors,the jury indicated that no other circumstances arose from the evidence that one or more jurors deemed to have mitigating value.the court accepted the recommendation,and sentenced jones to death.
jones appealed,asserting in relevant part that the trial court erred at the sentencing hearing by excluding jasper jones testimony that jones had expressed remorse about the murder.the supreme court of north carolina,relying inter alia on eddings oklahoma,d,and lockett ohio,d,held that the exclusion was error.see state jones.however,the court found that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt i n light of the facts and the circumstances of the case as a whole,including the fact that another witness had read to the jury the letter from jones to his wife suggesting remorse and regret.id.at.
after the supreme court of the united states denied jones petition for certiorari,jones north carolina,d,and his subsequent petition for rehearing,jones north carolina,d,jones filed a motion for appropriate relief mar in state court.in the mar he asserted,among other things,ineffective assistance of counsel because foy failed to effectively prosecution witness joyce hill,whom foy was concurrently representing in an unrelated divorce action.
in support of his motion,jones attached an affidavit from foy,stating in relevant part 
during the time leading up to jones trial,i felt that my representation of hill would be to jones advantage in that it gave me the opportunity to discuss with hill the events which she had witnessed.i thought this would enable me to be better prepared to cross examine hill and bring out evidence favorable to jones.i was shocked when hill,on direct examination,testified that jones walked away from the shooting looking as if he had just shot a dog.this was so unexpected,based on my conversations with hill that i was completely taken aback.i became leery of anything that hill might have to say.this affected the scope of my cross examination of hill.
the mar court denied the motion and refused to order an evidentiary hearing on any of his claims.regarding foy asserted conflict of interest,the court found that jones had failed to produce any information favorable to him within the knowledge of hill which should have been elicited by foy in,and that jones had failed to show that foy represented an interest which actually conflicted with that of jones.
on june,jones filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.he argued that,as the state supreme court found,the trial court erred in preventing jasper jones from testifying about jones remorse,but that the state supreme court ruling that the error was harmless constituted an unreasonable application of chapman california,d.jones also asserted that his trial counsel had an actual conflict of interest that hindered his performance,and that the mar court adjudication of this claim was an unreasonable application of cuyler sullivan,d,and strickland washington,d.
the district court dismissed the petition and denied the request for an evidentiary hearing.the district court concluded,contrary to the supreme court of north carolina,that the state trial court had not erred in excluding jasper jones statement.the district court also found jones conflict of interest claim unavailing because jones had failed to demonstrate an actual conflict.analyzing the claim as one of ineffective assistance of counsel under strickland,the court found that jones had failed to establish prejudice due to the ineffective assistance.the district court refused jones request for an evidentiary hearing on this claim.
however,the district court granted a certificate of appealability on jones claim that the state court improperly excluded evidence of remorse.this court granted a certificate of appealability on jones conflict of interest claim.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa tightly circumscribes our review of both of these claims.that statute provides that 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
with these facts and aedpa stringent standard of review in mind,we consider jones contentions.
first,jones argues that the state trial court committed constitutional error in excluding evidence of remorse from his sentencing hearing and that this error was not harmless.
we agree with the supreme court of north carolina that the state trial court erred in excluding jasper jones testimony.lockett,eddings,and skipper south carolina,d,require this conclusion.
in lockett,the trial judge sentenced the defendant to death under a statute that provided for imposition of the death penalty unless the sentencer found,by a preponderance of the evidence,the existence of at least one of three enumerated mitigating factors.lockett,at.lockett argued her sentence was unconstitutional because the state statute prohibited the sentencer from considering other relevant mitigating factors.id.at.the supreme court agreed,holding that,in capital cases,the eighth and fourteenth amendments require that the sentencer not be precluded from considering,as a mitigating factor,any aspect of a defendant character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.id.at.
in eddings,the supreme court reaffirmed and extended this rule.the trial judge had refused to consider mitigating evidence of a convicted murderer unhappy and violent upbringing.the court held,just as the state may not by statute preclude the sentencer from considering any mitigating factor,neither may the sentencer refuse to consider,as a matter of law,any relevant mitigating evidence.eddings,at.indeed,the court likened the situation to one,similar to that at hand,in which the trial judge had instructed a jury to disregard the mitigating evidence proffered on the defendant behalf,emphasizing that the sentencer may not give relevant mitigating evidence no weight by excluding it from consideration.id.at.
more recently,in skipper,the trial court permitted the defendant to introduce evidence at his capital sentencing hearing of mitigating factors,such as his difficult upbringing,but excluded as irrelevant evidence of the defendant good behavior during the months he was in jail awaiting trial.skipper,at.determining that the evidence of good behavior was,indeed,relevant,the supreme court held that the exclusion impeded the sentencing jury ability to carry out its task of considering all relevant facets of the character and record of the individual offender,and required reversal of the death sentence.id.at.
the central requirement of lockett and its ensuing line of cases is that a state may not cut off in an absolute manner the presentation of mitigating evidence,either by statute or judicial instruction,or by limiting the inquiries to which it is relevant so severely that the evidence could never be part of the sentencing decision at all.johnson texas,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.nor may a court apply hearsay rules mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice at a capital sentencing.green georgia,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the state trial court failed to follow this central requirement in the case at hand.when jasper jones attempted to testify that,before trial,jones had expressed remorse for his actions,the trial court sustained the state hearsay objection.at oral argument before us,the state conceded that in doing so,the trial court excluded relevant,admissible mitigating evidence.
that concession is.the supreme court recently reasserted that,when considering mitigating evidence in capital cases,a court must define relevance in the most expansive terms evidence is relevant if the sentencer could reasonably find that it warrants a sentence less than death.tennard dretke,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in excluding jasper jones testimony,the trial court precluded the jury from considering relevant,admissible evidence of jones remorse in contravention of the central requirement of lockett and its progeny.accordingly,we must determine whether the error entitles jones to habeas relief.
the supreme court of north carolina believed this error to be harmless because the jury had the benefit of other evidence of jones remorse,that is,jones letter to his wife,which royal read to the jury.jones,at.however,the state trial court specifically instructed the jury that it could not consider the letter as substantive evidence.the law assumes that,except in extraordinary circumstances,jurors follow a court instructions.see,richardson marsh,d.thus,we must conclude that in excluding jasper jones testimony,the trial court excluded the only substantive evidence of remorse.accordingly,the rationale for the state court harmlessness ruling fails.
we can not disturb the state harmlessness ruling,however,unless the conclusion that the error was opposed to the rationale for that an unreasonable application of chapman.we must decide whether it was unreasonable for the state supreme court to determine that the state had prove d beyond a reasonable doubt that the exclusion of the evidence did not contribute to the sentencing recommendation.chapman,at.put another way,we must decide whether the state court unreasonably determined that the sentencing recommendation actually rendered in this trial was surely unattributable to the error.sullivan louisiana,d emphasis omitted.
in this case,we think that the state supreme court did rule unreasonably that the exclusion of the evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.by erroneously excluding jasper jones evidence of remorse,the trial court removed from the jury consideration all evidence of remorse,an important mitigating factor.see atkins virginia,d noting that one reason for a categorical rule making mentally retarded offenders ineligible for the death penalty is that their demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their crimes riggins nevada,d in a capital sentencing proceeding,assessments of character and remorse may carry great weight and,perhaps,be determinative of whether the offender lives or dies.kennedy,concurring.
furthermore,the state emphasized the lack of remorse in its closing argument.and the jury found the question of whether to impose the death penalty so close that it had difficulty reaching its recommendation at one point,the jury foreman informed the judge that the jurors were beating their head s against the wall,and the jury required an allen charge before it reached its recommendation.given the actual conduct of the sentencing proceeding,including the utter elimination of potentially important remorse evidence from the capital sentencing hearing,it was unreasonable for the state court to determine that the jury recommendation of the death sentence was surely unattributable to the exclusion of the remorse evidence.sullivan,at.
having found that the supreme court of north carolina unreasonably applied chapman,we review jones claim de novo.rose lee,cir aleman sternes,cir medina hornung,cir holding that even if the state court decision was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,habeas relief may still be denied absent a showing of prejudice saiz burnett,cir same as mentioned earlier,we agree that the trial court erred in excluding jones sole evidence of remorse.however,we can not grant jones a writ of habeas corpus unless the error was harmless,and,on collateral review,we must apply a more stringent harmless error standard than the chapman standard.see fullwood lee,cir.the supreme court applied this heightened standard,derived from kotteakos united states,to federal habeas cases in brecht abrahamson,d,and clarified it in mcaninch,d.under this standard,the habeas petitioner will be entitled to relief only if a habeas court is in grave doubt about whether a trial error of federal law had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the proper inquiry is not merely whether there was enough to support the result,apart from the phase affected by the error.it is rather,even so,whether the error itself had substantial influence.if so,or if one is left in grave doubt,the conviction can not stand.kotteakos,at.
this is a more demanding standard than that set forth in chapman,and is born of respect for the finality of state court convictions that have survived direct review,and concerns of comity,federalism,and the relitigation of claims on collateral review.see brecht,at.in analyzing whether error is harmless under this standard,we must look to the impact of the thing done wrong in the total setting.kotteakos,at.applying this standard,we can not say that the exclusion of jasper jones testimony that jones expressed remorse had the substantial and injurious effect necessary for a federal court to grant habeas relief.
as outlined above,the sentencing jury unanimously found both of the aggravating factors urged by the state that,in the commission of meadows murder,jones had knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person by means of a weapon normally hazardous to the lives of more than one person,and that he had previously been convicted of a felony involving violence or the threat of violence.the evidence presented at the guilt phase of the trial regarding the facial injuries sustained by marissa jones from the shooting of meadows certainly established the first factor beyond dispute.
moreover,the state presented evidence of three brutal crimes that jones had previously been convicted of committing.johnnie jones testified that in april,he and jones had a fistfight,after which johnnie jones left the scene and went to his brother house.as johnnie jones and his brother were leaving the house,jones shot johnnie jones in the right knee with a twenty gauge shotgun jones then shot johnnie jones in the left knee jones then approached,put the shotgun in johnnie jones face,and pulled the trigger again,but the gun jammed.as a result,johnnie jones lost his left leg and sustained nerve damage to his right,resulting in his inability to perform his job as a truck driver.jeffrey fitzgerald testified that on september,jones and an associate used a gun to rob the convenience store where fitzgerald worked.herman jones testified that on september,jones shot him in the shoulder without provocation.jones pled guilty to all three of these crimes.
jones attempted to counterbalance this substantial aggravating evidence by presenting mitigating evidence from various friends,relatives,colleagues,and a forensic psychiatrist.they testified that jones volunteered in the community,both by participating in a head start program and by using his masonry and automotive repair skills to help others that he was a good worker and had done well in school that he provided for his family that he drank excessively,and when he drank,his personality changed and that he was drunk on the night of the murder.royal testified that jones was an alcoholic with chronic hypertension and that he displayed signs of paranoia that he needed treatment for these conditions and that he was intoxicated,under mental and emotional stress,and unable to conform his conduct to that of a normal person when he killed meadows.
at least one member of the jury credited some of this evidence,and the jury found that jones had established seven of eighteen mitigating circumstances that the murder was committed while jones was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance that he supported his family and his wife could spend her money as she wanted that he worked all of his adult life,except while he was incarcerated that,at the time of the murder,he needed treatment for alcoholism emotional disturbance that he had played a prominent role in assisting with a head start program that he had built fireplaces for four community residents and that he carried firewood during the winter for an acquaintance household.however,the jury also determined that these mitigating factors did not outweigh the aggravating factors counseling them to sentence jones to death.
we can not hold that the omission of jasper jones evidence from this hearing had a substantial and injurious effect on the outcome of the sentencing proceedings.we know only that jasper jones would have testified that jones told him that he was sorry for what he did.defense counsel made no other proffer as to what jasper jones testimony would have been.given the strength of the aggravating from the victims of jones former crimes,jones guilty pleas to those crimes,and testimony that the jury had clearly credited at the guilt phase of the trial showing that jones had put young marissa jones in danger when he shot the gun into the back of the car to kill the relative weakness of the excluded evidence of remorse,we are not in grave doubt that its omission had any substantial effect on the outcome of the sentencing proceedings.
jones remaining habeas claim involves his attorney alleged conflict of interest.jones maintains that his trial counsel,louis foy,operated under an unconstitutional conflict of interest by representing a prosecution witness,joyce hill,in an unrelated matter while he represented jones.jones asserts that,because of this conflict,foy did not vigorously hill during the guilt phase of jones trial,entitling him to habeas relief under cuyler.alternatively,he asserts that he is,at the very least,entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this claim.
under cuyler,prejudice is presumed,and a petitioner is entitled to relief,if he shows that his counsel labored under an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected the representation.at.see also mickens taylor,d strickland,at.to demonstrate an actual conflict,a petitioner must show that his interests diverge d from his attorney with respect to a material factual or legal issue or to a course of action.gilbert moore,cir en banc quoting cuyler,at.marshall,concurring in part and dissenting in part second alteration in original.even if a petitioner establishes an actual conflict,he can not succeed on his claim unless he also can show that the conflict adversely affected the attorney representation,such as when an attorney takes action for one client that is necessarily adverse to another,or when an attorney fails to take action for one client for fear of injuring another.id.
analysis of claims of actual conflicts of interest frequently do not proceed in two distinct steps rather t he two requirements are often intertwined.united states tatum,cir see also mickens,at.stating that an actual conflict of interest means a conflict that affected counsel opposed to a mere theoretical division of loyalties.so it was here.without examining the first and second requirements separately,the mar court simply found that jones had failed to show that foy representation of joyce hill in an unrelated domestic relations matter actually conflicted with that of jones.the court pointed out that there was no evidence that hill had previously said something to foy with which foy could have impeached her and that the existence of such inconsistent statements was unlikely because hill testimony was fully consistent with queen jones testimony we do not believe that in so finding the mar court unreasonably determined the facts,or unreasonably applied or acted contrary to cuyler.
jones does offer persuasive arguments that foy concurrent representation of jones and hill constituted an actual conflict,satisfying the first prong of cuyler.but even if we assume,without deciding,that foy operated under an actual conflict,jones is not entitled to relief because he has failed to show that foy representation of hill affected foy performance during jones trial.
jones maintains that foy affidavit impl ies that hill made statements to foy prior to trial that were inconsistent with her trial testimony that foy did not hill about her inconsistent statements and that foy surprise at hill inconsistent testimony affected the scope of his.brief of petitioner at.however,foy affidavit does not actually state that hill trial testimony was inconsistent with her pretrial comments to foy about the case.rather,it notes only that,based on his prior conversations with hill,foy was completely taken aback by hill trial testimony,which was so unexpected.at most,jones has demonstrated that foy had not previously heard hill say that jones had walked away like he shot a dog or something similar.this simply does not establish,as jones claims,that foy was privy to information with which he could have impeached hill.
jones only other evidence that the dual representation adversely affected foy representation of jones is the length of foy of hill.he points out that foy of hill consists of less than six pages of trial transcript.however,foy conducted the of queen jones,who was also an eyewitness to the shooting and testified to essentially the same facts as hill did,and that consists of less than three pages of trial transcript.thus,to the extent that jones suggests that the length of foy is evidence of his conflict of interest,we are unconvinced.
moreover,foy has stated under oath that he abbreviated his of hill for strategic reasons that,in his estimation,were in jones best interest.he explains that he limited his questioning of hill because her testimony that jones walked away like he shot a dog made foy leery of what hill might say on.this explanation of trial strategy undermines jones claim that it was foy representation of hill that caused him to limit his of her.rather,foy choice to limit his seems to have been motivated by a desire to stanch the flow of testimony by hill that damaged jones and jones has proffered no evidence that foy failed to impeach hill for fear of injuring her interests or foy own interests.
certainly,there is no question that this concurrent representation was exceedingly.but the notion that foy solicitude for hill caused him to limit his is contradicted by foy own affidavit,the only evidence offered by jones in support of his claim.thus,jones has not demonstrated that the mar court denial of his conflict of interest claim constituted an unreasonable determination of the facts or a decision contrary to,or involving an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent.
jones also challenges the district court denial of his request for an evidentiary hearing on his conflict of interest claim.we review the denial for an abuse of discretion.hill ozmint,cir.
to obtain an evidentiary hearing,a habeas petitioner must establish one of six factors outlined by the supreme court in townsend sain,d 
the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state hearing the state factual determination is not fairly supported by the record as a whole the procedure employed by the state court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing there is a substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence the material facts were not adequately developed at the hearing or for any reason it appears that the state trier of fact did not afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact hearing.
fullwood,at.even if one of these criteria is met,a federal habeas court is permitted to hold an evidentiary hearing only if the petitioner alleges additional facts that,if true,would entitle him to relief.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,an evidentiary hearing is an instrument to test the truth of facts already alleged in the habeas petition.see,zettlemoyer fulcomer,cir first,we must determine whether the petitioner has alleged facts that,if proved,would entitle him to relief.if so,we must then decide whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary to establish the truth of those allegations.
while jones allegations follow the general contours of a conflict of interest claim,he has not met his burden of alleging facts that,if true,would demonstrate that foy representation of hill adversely affected foy representation of jones.rather,he provides factual support only for his allegation that foy thought that his representation of hill would benefit jones because it gave foy an opportunity to talk to hill about the case prior to trial and that foy was shocked and surprised by hill trial testimony and therefore constrained his.these facts,if true,establish merely that foy representation of hill gave foy an opportunity to speak with hill about jones case and that these conversations were the basis for foy surprise at hill trial testimony.they do not establish that hill trial testimony was inconsistent with prior statements she had made to foy,with which he could have impeached her.the alleged facts also fail to show that foy representation of and concern for hill were the reason he did not her more rigorously.
indeed,jones admits that the factual allegations of his claim are undeveloped.reply brief at.nonetheless,he does not seek to develop them by deposing foy or conducting other discovery.rather,he contends that the allegations outlined above are sufficient to support a reasonable inference that more specific factual detail concerning hill inconsistent statements to foy exists and could be brought out at an evidentiary hearing.id.at.however,absent factual mere hill had made inconsistent statements to foy with which he could have impeached her,jones is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing because,without such allegations,he has failed to assert facts that,if true,would entitle him to relief 
jones presents only conclusory and speculative allegations as support for his request for an evidentiary hearing.such allegations do not trigger the right to a hearing.for example,in enoch gramley,cir,the petitioner claimed that his attorney prior unrelated representation of proctor,a key prosecution witness,created an actual conflict of interest that affected the representation.enoch charged that his attorney faced divided loyalties in proctor because the attorney had to protect proctor privileged communications and because the attorney had an interest in representing proctor in future matters.id.at.the seventh circuit found that these allegations were no more than conclusions and speculation and did not entitle enoch to an evidentiary hearing.id.at.here,jones has made similarly speculative and vague allegations.he must do more to obtain an evidentiary hearing on a habeas claim in federal court.
thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing.
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is 
john wesley jones is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to pursue his claim that when he was tried and sentenced to death for murder,his lawyer,who was also representing a key prosecution witness,had a conflict of interest that adversely affected his defense.the witness testified that when jones killed his son with a shotgun blast,h e walked away like he shot a dog.this unchallenged statement told the jury that jones was,heartless,and without feeling.it was powerful testimony in a case where the prosecution was seeking the death penalty based in part on the argument that jones showed no remorse.jones lawyer did nothing to impeach this witness his client in an unrelated case,even though there is a reasonable inference that she made statements helpful to jones in her pretrial conversations with the shared lawyer.there is a decent chance,i believe,that jones can he is granted an evidentiary his lawyer pulled his punches in the witness due to the conflict of interest.with such a showing,jones could establish his ineffective assistance of counsel claim and obtain a writ of habeas corpus.because the majority denies jones the evidentiary hearing,and i would grant it,i respectfully dissent from part iv of the court opinion.i otherwise concur.
when john wesley jones was tried for murder in north carolina state court,his lead lawyer,louis foy,was also representing a key prosecution witness,joyce hill,in her unrelated divorce case.foy,who was court appointed,did not inform jones of the conflict.in an affidavit filed in connection with jones motion for appropriate relief mar in state court,foy said that he felt that his representation of hill would be to jones advantage in that it gave foy the opportunity to discuss with hill the events which she had witnessed.this,foy thought,would enable him to be better prepared to cross examine hill and bring out evidence favorable to jones.id.emphasis added.things did not turn out that way.as noted above,hill testified on direct examination that after jones killed the victim,h e walked away like he shot a dog.this testimony shocked foy because it was so unexpected,based on his prior conversations with hill.according to foy,hill damaging and unexpected testimony about jones demeanor made him leery,and he limited the scope of his.he made no attempt to impeach was also his her about her prior statements that might have been favorable to jones.
in his state mar jones alleged ineffective assistance of counsel on the ground that foy had a serious conflict of interest in representing both john wesley jones and hill and then in attempting to hill.the mar court denied jones request for an evidentiary hearing,yet found that jones failed to produce any information favorable to him within the knowledge of hill which should have been elicited on and failed to show that foy was laboring under a conflict of interest.the court then held that jones did not prove ineffective assistance of counsel under the standard in strickland washington,d holding that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is established by showing that counsel performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.the north carolina supreme court denied jones petition for a writ of certiorari.
the mar court reached its decision without applying cuyler sullivan,d,which sets forth the standard for determining ineffective assistance in a conflict of interest situation.as the majority states under cuyler,prejudice is presumed,and a petitioner is entitled to relief,if he shows that his counsel labored under an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected the representation.ante at citing cuyler,at.a lawyer labors under an actual conflict with his client when their interests diverge with respect to a material factual or legal issue or to a course of action.gilbert moore,cir en banc internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
jones has shown that foy had an actual conflict of interest.c ourts have generally adopted a prima facie prophylactic rule which prohibits attorneys from simultaneously representing clients with adverse interests,even in unrelated matters.marc steinberg timothy sharpe,attorney conflicts of interest the need for a coherent framework,notre dame,emphasis added.the model rules of professional conduct reflect this approach and provide that a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest unless,among other things,each affected client gives informed consent,confirmed in writing.model rules of prof l conduct b.foy was obligated to do his best to defend jones against the charge of murder,yet foy needed to remain loyal to and maintain good relations with hill,who was also his client,albeit in another case.this was an intolerable situation because it was against foy interest to conduct a rigorous of hill,and it was against hill interest to have her veracity as a witness discredited.jones,on the other hand,was entitled to a lawyer who could decide how to hill without worrying about whether she would be offended.foy,in short,was actively represent ing conflicting interests.mickens taylor,d quoting cuyler,at.
jones contends that he has also shown that foy conflict adversely affected his of hill.foy admits,in his affidavit,that he believed his relationship with hill would enable him to bring out evidence favorable to jones when he hill before hill testified,he had the opportunity to discuss with her the events which she had witnessed he was shocked and completely taken aback,however,when hill testified on direct that jones walked way from the killing like he shot a dog and t his was so unexpected by foy,based on his prior conversations with hill that it affected the scope of his cross examination.see also.these statements by foy are undisputed.it is also undisputed that foy did not attack hill credibility or attempt to impeach her with her prior statements.according to jones,this demonstrates that hill pretrial conversations with foy were inconsistent with her trial testimony and that this inconsistency affected foy.foy affidavit supports the reasonable inference that he was shocked because hill statements were inconsistent and that foy did not confront her with the inconsistencies because she was also his client.but,as the majority notes,foy has not disclosed the content of his pretrial conversations with hill,and he has not explicitly stated that hill statements were inconsistent.ante at.thus,it is also possible to infer that the content of hill direct testimony,apart from any previous conversations between foy and hill,is what affected foy decision to limit.because the present record could support either of these competing inferences,jones has not established that foy conflict adversely affected his performance.this brings me to the issue of a hearing and my disagreement with the majority.
the mar court failed to apply cuyler and in the process denied jones request for an evidentiary hearing,which would have been necessary for the proper application of cuyler.the district court also denied jones request for a hearing.jones claim is that after hill testified on direct that he had walked away like he shot a dog,foy declined to attack her credibility out of divided loyalty.jones has established that he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this claim.first,he has satisfied townsend sain,d the material facts were not adequately developed at the hearing because the mar court denied jones an evidentiary hearing.second,although the majority disagrees,jones has gone far enough in alleging facts that,if true,would entitle him to relief.fullwood lee,cir citation omitted.
the majority holds that absent factual mere hill made inconsistent statements to foy with which he could have impeached her,jones is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing.ante at.in other words,an evidentiary hearing is not required when some allegations stating the claim are based on inference or inferential facts.this,i respectfully suggest,can not be the rule.see black law dictionary ed defining inferential fact as a fact established by conclusion drawn from other evidence rather than from direct testimony or evidence a fact derived logically from other
