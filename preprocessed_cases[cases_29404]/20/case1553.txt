at issue in this habeas case is the voluntariness of traci mccalvin confession.mccalvin was convicted of murder.during her trial,mccalvin moved to suppress her confession,but the trial court denied the motion as untimely because under michigan law such motions generally must be filed before trial unless special circumstances are present.the district court granted mccalvin a writ of habeas corpus,ruling that there existed cause and prejudice sufficient to excuse her procedural default because she had established that her counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file the motion to suppress before trial.the district court then found mccalvin confession involuntary because,among other things,a detective told mccalvin that,if she were convicted of murder,she would not have contact with her family,including her children.we reverse.
around midnight on february,mccalvin visited the home of lidell smith,her former boyfriend and the father of her son.smith and mccalvin talked in smith driveway for approximately minutes.mccalvin got into her car to leave,however,when markecia branch,smith current girlfriend,walked out of the house.as branch stood on smith lawn,mccalvin car pulled forward and hit her.branch became trapped under the car and died.
police officers escorted mccalvin to the police station around officers informed mccalvin of her miranda rights,and mccalvin signed a waiver form.mccalvin stated that she had no medical problems,was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs,and understood english.mccalvin was years old and had never been in jail before.she was a high school graduate.
between approximately and,detectives palmer and shadwell interrogated mccalvin.the interrogation began with mccalvin giving her version of how branch died.mccalvin told the detectives that branch death was an accident.mccalvin stated that she had only attempted to back her car out of smith driveway.she thought that she put the car into reverse,but instead she accidentally put it into drive.when mccalvin pressed the gas pedal,her car lunged forward and hit branch.after the first minutes of the interrogation,the detectives allowed mccalvin a break.mccalvin drank coffee.
when the interrogation resumed,the detectives had mccalvin repeat her story.during this portion of the interrogation,the detectives permitted mccalvin to take several breaks.mccalvin was able to use the restroom and call her mother.before ending the interrogation,the detectives had mccalvin write down her version of what happened that night.mccalvin story never changed during this stage of the interrogation.
detective helgert then took over the interrogation for approximately the next one and hours.mccalvin declined any food,coffee,or water.for the first thirty to minutes,mccalvin continued to maintain that branch death was an accident.during this time,however,helgert became more confrontational.he told mccalvin that the officers did not believe her.he gave her a hook,a question that aims to get a defendant to admit to a crime while simultaneously shifting the blame away,by asking mccalvin if she had merely tried to scare branch by driving towards her.mccalvin testified at her trial that helgert told her that if she changed her story,the prosecutor might drop the charges.she also testified that helgert told her that she could go home if she changed her story to say that she had intended to only scare branch.helgert never admitted to promising mccalvin anything,see at,but he testified that he told mccalvin that if she went to prison for murder,she would spend the rest of her life in prison and would not have contact with her family,including her children,at 
according to helgert,mccalvin suddenly looked at him and said,i did it.mccalvin stated that she drove her car towards branch to scare her.helgert then reduced mccalvin admissions to written questions and answers.according to helgert,he never threatened mccalvin or told her what to write.he maintained that mccalvin was quite unemotional during the interrogation.before the interrogation ended at approximately,mccalvin had not asked for the interrogation to stop.
mccalvin was charged with murder,and a jury trial began in september.after detective palmer,detective helgert,and mccalvin testified,the defense moved to suppress mccalvin confession on the ground that it was coerced and therefore involuntary.defense counsel explained at the time why he had not made such a motion earlier he had made a calculated decision not to file a motion to suppress before the trial for two reasons.first,he did not want helgert to gather his forces and to respond to the inquiry regarding the voluntariness of the confession in a manner other than he would if confronted by a jury.second,because of the judge conservative nature,he had thought that a motion to suppress would not have been successful.
the trial court denied mccalvin motion to suppress.the court gave four reasons for its denial the court did not want to declare a mistrial defense counsel of helgert was very effective defense counsel spent so much time on the issue of the confession that a curative instruction would have been futile and mccalvin waived the issue by failing to raise it before trial.the jury convicted mccalvin of murder,and the court sentenced her to fifteen to thirty years of imprisonment.
mccalvin appealed her conviction,arguing that the trial court erred in refusing to suppress her confession,and,if her trial counsel was deemed to have waived the right to file a motion to suppress,that waiver amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.the michigan court of appeals nevertheless affirmed her conviction.people mccalvin,wl,at.the court of appeals held that,under michigan law,no special circumstances justified defense counsel delay in bringing the motion to suppress.id.at.the trial court thus did not abuse its discretion in denying mccalvin motion.id.
in the alternative,the michigan court of appeals held that the trial court denial was not plain error because mccalvin had made her statement voluntarily.id.at.the court based this decision on the totality of the circumstances surrounding mccalvin confession,noting that mccalvin signed a miranda waiver mccalvin was of sufficient maturity to understand her rights because she was in her,a high school graduate,not ill or injured,and not under the influence of alcohol or drugs the police did not question mccalvin for an inordinate amount of time mccalvin received several breaks during the interrogations the police offered mccalvin food and drink and helgert testified that mccalvin was unemotional during the interrogation.in addition,the court held that mccalvin interrogation differed from the interrogation deemed coercive in lynumn illinois,d,where police explicitly told the defendant that her children would be taken from her if she did not cooperate.mccalvin,wl,at.unlike in lynumn,helgert admitted only to discussing the consequences of a murder conviction.id.
finally,the michigan court of appeals held that mccalvin trial counsel had not rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.id.at.counsel decision to wait to bring a motion to suppress was not objectively unreasonable because the decision constituted a trial strategy and such a strategy was reasonable as a motion likely would have been denied.id.at.because a motion would have been denied,the court also held that counsel actions did not prejudice mccalvin.id.at.the michigan supreme court denied discretionary review.
in august,mccalvin filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,as amended by the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,raising two grounds for relief.first,mccalvin argued that the michigan court of appeals determination that her confession was voluntary was contrary to clearly established federal law as set forth in lynumn illinois,d,and united states tingle,cir.second,mccalvin argued that the michigan court of appeals determination that her attorney provided effective assistance of counsel was also contrary to federal law.the matter was referred to a magistrate,who filed a report and recommendation,recommending that the district court deny mccalvin petition.
in december,the district court granted mccalvin request for habeas relief on both grounds.mccalvin yukins,d.the court ruled that it could reach the merits of mccalvin coercion claim because,under the test set forth in maupin smith,cir,her procedural default was excused.mccalvin,d at.cause and prejudice sufficient to excuse the procedural default existed because mccalvin counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion to suppress id.at.the court ruled that,under strickland washington,d,it was objectively unreasonable for counsel to wait to file a motion to suppress merely because he did not want to give the prosecutor time to gather his forces and because he thought that a motion would not succeed due to the trial court judge conservative nature.id.at.in addition,mccalvin had demonstrated prejudice because the admission of her confession made the inference of malice more likely and rendered the jury verdict suspect.id.at.
reaching the merits of the coercion claim,the district court ruled that mccalvin confession was involuntary.id.at.the court likened the circumstances surrounding mccalvin confession to those deemed coercive in lynumn illinois and united states tingle 
petitioner was in a more vulnerable position than was the petitioner in lynumn,because she was alone in an unfamiliar surrounding when helgert made the statements regarding visitation.even if petitioner did not appear to helgert to be in distress,as did the petitioner in tingle,helgert statements can not be deemed innocuous.he admitted telling her that,if she were convicted of murder,she would never again have contact with her children most significantly,petitioner had been in custody for approximately eight or nine the while maintaining that decedent death was an she made the confession.the statements definitely played upon petitioner maternal instinct and were coercive.
id.at.footnote omitted.the district court held that,because mccalvin confession was coerced,the decision of the michigan court of appeals affirming the trial court denial of the motion to suppress was unreasonable and contrary to established federal law.id.at.the district court found that these constitutional errors were not harmless,and it therefore granted mccalvin petition for a writ of habeas corpus.id.at.
the state now appeals,arguing that it was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law for the michigan court of appeals to hold that mccalvin trial counsel had rendered effective assistance 
the district court erred in granting mccalvin habeas petition because it was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law for the michigan court of appeals to hold that mccalvin confession was voluntary.upon weighing the totality of the circumstances surrounding mccalvin confession,it was objectively reasonable for the michigan court of appeals to hold that mccalvin will was not overborne.moreover,the interrogation of mccalvin is distinguishable from the interrogation deemed coercive in lynumn illinois,d.because mccalvin due process voluntariness claim fails,her claim also must fail because she could not have suffered prejudice from her counsel failure to make a timely motion to suppress her confession.
mccalvin filed her habeas petition in august thus,her case is governed by d,as amended by the aedpa of.see smith stegall,cir.section d provides,in relevant part,that a petition for a writ of habeas corpus shall be denied by the district court unless the state court decision 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
d.clearly established federal law,refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.williams taylor,d.a decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the court invokes a supreme court case and unreasonably extends its legal principle to a new context where it should not apply or fails to extend it to where it should apply.id.at.a federal habeas court making the unreasonable application inquiry should ask whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively reasonable.id.at.in this case,the district court held that the decision of the michigan court of appeals was unreasonable because it was coercive for detective helgert to tell mccalvin,after she had been in custody for eight to nine hours,that she would not have contact with her family,including her children,if she were convicted of murder 
under the deference to determinations required by aedpa,however,we can not say that the michigan court of appeals unreasonably applied federal law as reflected in supreme court precedents.under clearly established supreme court law,certain interrogation techniques,either in isolation or as applied to the unique characteristics of a particular suspect,are so offensive to a civilized system of justice that they must be condemned under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.miller fenton,d.the question in each of these cases is whether a defendant will was overborne at the time she confessed.reck pate,d.in determining whether a defendant will was overborne,the court looks at the totality of the circumstances surrounding the confession.schneckloth bustamonte,d.factors considered in assessing the totality of the circumstances include the age,education,and intelligence of the defendant whether the defendant has been informed of his miranda rights the length of the questioning the repeated and prolonged nature of the questioning and the use of physical punishment,such as deprivation of food or sleep.id.
based upon the totality of the circumstances in this case,it was objectively reasonable for the michigan court of appeals to hold that mccalvin confession was voluntary.as the court of appeals noted,mccalvin signed a miranda waiver mccalvin was of sufficient maturity to understand her rights because she was in her,a high school graduate,not ill or injured,and not under the influence of alcohol or drugs mccalvin received several breaks during the interrogations the detectives offered mccalvin food and water and helgert testified that mccalvin was unemotional during the interrogation.in addition,mccalvin was permitted to call her mother,never asked for an attorney,and never said anything indicating that she wished for the interview to stop.together,these circumstances support a finding that mccalvin will was not overborne.
although some of the circumstances surrounding mccalvin confession were perhaps coercive,they do not warrant a conclusion that the michigan court of appeals decision was objectively unreasonable.the following factors could provide support for a finding of coercion mccalvin had no experience with jail or interrogation mccalvin was held for eight to nine hours though only interrogated for four the detectives repeated the same questions several times until mccalvin confessed two different teams of detectives were used and helgert stated that mccalvin would not have contact with her children if convicted of murder.yet,even under these circumstances,it was not objectively unreasonable for the michigan court of appeals to hold that mccalvin will was not overborne.a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the decision applied the law incorrectly.woodford visciotti,d per curiam.under the deference required by aedpa,and given the factors supporting a finding that mccalvin confession was voluntary,the decision of the michigan court of appeals was a reasonable application of federal law.
the district court largely grounded its decision on the similarity between this case and lynumn illinois,d,but lynumn is distinguishable.in lynumn,the defendant,who had never been in trouble with the law,was interrogated in her apartment while surrounded by three police officers and a police informant.id.at.the officers told her that state financial aid for her infant children would be cut off,and her children taken from her,if she did not cooperate.id.at.if she did cooperate,the officers promised that the prosecutor would go light on her.id.at.the supreme court held that these circumstances made the defendant confession involuntary.id.at.
the circumstances surrounding the confession in lynumn,however,differ from those surrounding mccalvin confession in a number of ways.first,the defendant in lynumn was interrogated while surrounded by three police officers and a twice convicted felon who had purportedly set her up.id.at.here,mccalvin was never interrogated by more than two officers.second,because lynumn preceded the court decision in miranda arizona,d,the police never read the defendant her constitutional rights.in this case,mccalvin signed a miranda waiver and never asked to see her attorney or for the interrogation to stop.a confession is much more likely to be voluntary when it is given after a person knowingly and voluntarily waives his miranda rights.as the supreme court stated in berkemer mccarty,d,cases in which a defendant can make a colorable argument that a statement was compelled despite the fact that the law enforcement authorities adhered to the dictates of miranda are rare.
most importantly,the officers statements in lynumn are different from helgert statement that mccalvin would not have contact with her family,including her children.the officers in lynumn not only threatened that the defendant would lose contact with her children but also that the aid to the her children would be cut off.at.such a statement is especially sinister because it implicates the children livelihood.in addition,the police in lynumn explicitly promised leniency if the defendant confessed.id.at.helgert never admitted to promising mccalvin anything.helgert testified that he merely informed her of the consequences of a murder conviction.we are not prepared to forbid police from conveying to suspects the seriousness of the crime for which they are being investigated.
this court noted a similar distinction in ledbetter edwards,cir.although only supreme court case law is relevant under aedpa in deciding what federal law is clearly established,lower federal court decisions may be used to the extent we have already reviewed and interpreted the relevant supreme court law.hill hofbauer,cir.in ledbetter,we held that several misrepresentations by police officers,such as a staged victim identification and a fingerprint that the officers falsely claimed to have matched to the defendant,had not overborne the defendant will.at.in doing so,we distinguished the officers conduct from that in lynumn 
in lynumn,the concern was outright fear of adverse consequences,elimination of government benefits,which may be just as real as the physical fear of adverse consequences in outright torture in our case,the only adverse consequences being presented to the defendant were the results of ultimately being convicted of the crime.a defendant who is completely innocent might well confess in the circumstances of spano or lynumn,for fear of the extraneous adverse consequences.by contrast,an innocent defendant in the circumstances in our case would have little incentive to render a false confession.
id.similarly,mccalvin was not made to fear more than the result of being convicted of murder,which included not seeing her children.it was therefore objectively reasonable for the michigan court of appeals to distinguish lynumn and find that this fear did not overcome mccalvin will 
because it was a reasonable application of federal law for the michigan court of appeals to hold that mccalvin confession was voluntary,it was also a reasonable application for it to hold that her trial counsel had not rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.to prevail on an claim,a defendant must demonstrate both deficient performance and prejudice.strickland washington,d.to establish prejudice,a defendant must show a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.mccalvin can not show that her motion to suppress would have succeeded had it been timely filed,and thus she can not satisfy the prejudice requirement of her claim.
this case is difficult,and our decision should not be read as approving the interrogation techniques used.under the deference to legal determinations required by aedpa,however,we can not say that the michigan court of appeals unreasonably applied federal law as reflected in supreme court precedents.for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the judgment of the district court.
i disagree with the majority resolution of this appeal,and i would affirm the district court grant of the writ of habeas corpus.
coercion claim 
the district court granted the writ based upon its conclusions that mccalvin confession was coerced and that the untimeliness of mccalvin suppression motion was excused by the ineffective assistance of mccalvin counsel.the majority opinion addresses only the question of whether mccalvin confession was coerced,and in answering in the negative rejects the coercion claim both as an independent ground for habeas relief and as a basis to satisfy the prejudice prong of mccalvin ineffective assistance of counsel claim.yet the government brief presents only the following issue for our review whether the district court erred in finding that the michigan court of appeals application of federal law was unreasonable and contrary to established sixth amendment law under d where defense counsel tactical decision to delay a motion to suppress petitioner confession was part of a reasoned trial strategy.br.at.the government cites the strickland test for determining ineffective assistance of,deficiency in counsel performance and resulting devotes its brief to arguing that counsel performance was not deficient.br.at.the entirety of the government argument pertaining to the prejudice prong reads as follows 
petitioner is also unable to establish prejudice given the fact that the statements made to the detective were properly admissible.petitioner can not demonstrate that,but for counsel alleged error in not raising the motion to suppress earlier in the proceedings,the outcome of her trial would have been different.this is especially true given the overwhelming evidence of petitioner guilt even absent her statements to the police.
br.at.even in this short paragraph,the only portion that can be characterized accurately as an argument that mccalvin confession was not coerced is the bare assertion that the statements made to the detective were properly admissible.
it is well established that issues not raised by an appellant in its opening brief,or issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner without some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.united states johnson,cir.some of our decisions go so far as to suggest that waived arguments are not reviewable by this court dixon ashcroft,cir robinson jones,cir boyd ford motor,cir while elsewhere we suggest that this court has the option of considering or ignoring the waived arguments as we see fit,priddy edelman,cir.even assuming we have complete discretion to entertain or to ignore the coerced confession argument,i do not believe addressing the issue is appropriate here.
at oral argument this panel sought an explanation from the government as to why the coerced confession issue,to which a substantial portion of the government oral argument was devoted,was absent from the government brief.the government responded that it focused on the district court determination of deficient performance because it believed the court analysis of this issue to be more obviously flawed,but stated that it did not intend to waive the argument that mccalvin confession was not coerced.i do not believe such an explanation can excuse the government failure to brief the issue.the government may not depend upon this court to assume that it is advancing every available argument the petitioner certainly enjoys no such benefit.in cases where a district court has granted relief to a habeas petitioner,it is not this court place,as a neutral adjudicatory b
