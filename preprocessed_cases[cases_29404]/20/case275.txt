a massachusetts superior court jury convicted louis mello of first degree murder and other crimes in connection with a fire in an apartment building which he admits he started to settle a score with leonard starcher,who died in the blaze.mello appeals from the district court denial of his petition for habeas corpus relief under,continuing his challenge to his first degree murder conviction on the ground that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance.because the state court decision affirming his conviction was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,we affirm.
background 
at approximately on july,fire engulfed a apartment building in fall river,massachusetts,killing two of the residents,leonard starcher and edward walsh.the cause of the fire was a molotov cocktail thrown at the porch in front of the building.later that day,louis mello confessed to his participation in starting the fire.
at trial,mello offered the defense that,while he intended to set starcher building on fire,he was too intoxicated to understand that burning the building might result in the death of the people inside it,and therefore he should not have been convicted of first degree murder on a theory of deliberation and premeditation.starcher apartment had been a gathering place for a group of young people,including mello,domingos arruda,and nelson tavares.mello had been paying daily visits to starcher apartment for much of the preceding year,arriving in the late morning and staying until midnight or later.on a typical day,mello would drink about a case of beer at starcher place.the day before the fire,mello had drunk a case of beer there.that evening he inhaled three and a half bags of heroin.after taking the heroin,mello became ill.he testified that he was vomiting and was very sick that night,and that he did know what was going on.mello girlfriend at the time,michelle boudria,who was with mello around on the night of the fire,testified that he appear ed high.
three or four days before the fire,police had searched mello home for drugs,resulting in the arrest of mello,his mother and her boyfriend.mello subsequently said to boudria that whoever ratted on him,his house getting raided,they going to pay for what they did.the night of the fire,arruda told mello that it was starcher who had ratted on him,and suggested that they set fire to starcher apartment building.
although mello lived approximately feet from starcher,he returned home to get his mother car to facilitate a quick getaway after starting the fire.he snuck in and out of his house to get the car keys without awakening his mother.once he had the car,he picked up arruda and tavares and drove around the neighborhood mello recalled the precise sequence of streets in his testimony at trial.mello then parked the car,and arruda went to a gas station and returned with a can of gasoline.arruda poured the gasoline into a glass bottle,and mello inserted a rag to serve as a wick.mello lit the rag,and arruda threw the bottle into the cement underneath the wooden porch at the front of starcher building mello testified that the bottle was directed at the cement part of the porch to ensure that it would explode.
in addition to the porch,mello car caught fire.mello tried to extinguish the car fire with his feet,and he,arruda and tavares got back into the car and drove off.he stopped at a dumpster to discard his blackened sneakers and drove home.he said to arruda and tavares you guys do know me and i do know you.mello then went home and slept.when a police officer arrived at the scene of the fire,all three stories on the west side of the apartment building were engulfed in flames.
the next morning,before he was arrested,mello said to a police officer that he could believe starcher was dead,and told starcher widow that he was sorry about her husband.when he confessed to the police later that day,he stated that,although he had intended to start the fire,he never wanted to kill anybody in the house.after his initial confession to police,mello cried for a little while.at trial,mello attorney asked,did you intend to kill anybody mello replied no,i did.
however,there was evidence tending to show that mello was not in a state of extreme intoxication the night of the fire.mello succeeded in executing the series of steps required to start the fire,and recounted his actions in some detail at trial.when asked about the effect of the heroin on mello,boudria said simply he was kind of tired.although boudria indicated that mello appear ed high,she also said he was not having any trouble walking.the morning after the fire,mello did not appear intoxicated to the police.
mello was found guilty of first degree murder for the death of starcher on a theory of deliberation and premeditation,second degree murder for the death of walsh,arson,and throwing an explosive device.he received sentences of life imprisonment without parole on the first degree murder count,life imprisonment on the second degree murder count,and fifteen to twenty years on the arson count.
mello then moved for a new trial or for a reduction of his first degree murder conviction to second degree murder.mello argued that his defense attorney had been ineffective in failing to investigate the use of expert testimony to support his mens rea defense to first degree murder and in failing to object to certain jury instructions on mens rea.in,the trial court held an evidentiary hearing at which a specialist in addiction medicine testified that mello suffered from cognitive impairment that prevented him from understanding that burning down starcher home in the middle of the night could have fatal consequences for starcher.unimpressed with this theory,the trial court denied mello motion.mello appealed his convictions and the denial of his motions to the supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc.the sjc affirmed mello murder convictions and the denial of his motion 
in mello petitioned the federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,arguing primarily that the ineffectiveness of his counsel deprived him of his sixth amendment right to counsel.in the district court denied the petition.mello filed a timely notice of appeal,and the district court granted a certificate of appealability.
ii.ineffective assistance of counsel 
a.the sixth amendment and the habeas standard 
to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment,mello must establish that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland washington,d see also scarpa dubois,cir.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.
to prevail on his habeas petition,however,mello must demonstrate not just that the strickland standard for ineffective assistance of counsel was met,but also that the sjc adjudication of his constitutional claims resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases,williams taylor,d,or if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a different result,id.at.a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.
the supreme court has made clear that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.id.at.therefore,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.see also hurtado tucker,cir.
b.the sjc opinion 
mello raised both federal and state ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the sjc.in evaluating his arguments,the sjc applied a standard for ineffective assistance of counsel it did not expressly rule on mello federal ineffective assistance claims.however,massachusetts law and our own precedents make clear that the standard the sjc applied is at least as favorable to mello as the federal standard.
the claims reviewed by the sjc 
because of the many claims raised in this case,both before the sjc and here,we find it necessary for purposes of clarity to categorize the claims under consideration 
some of mello claims were advanced before the sjc as grounds for vacating the conviction independent of any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.these claims include mello challenges to the prosecutor closing argument,the jury instructions,and the alleged atmosphere of levity in the courtroom,none of which were objected to at trial by defense counsel.we label these claims of error by counsel.mello does not pursue these independent claims in his habeas petition.
mello advanced other claims before the sjc only under the rubric of ineffective assistance of counsel.this category includes mello claims that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue expert testimony on his mental condition,to investigate his psychiatric history,and to exercise peremptory challenges.these claims we label pure ineffective assistance of counsel because they were argued only as ineffective assistance of counsel claims.
finally,mello advanced certain claims before the sjc both as independent grounds for relief and as a basis for a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel.this category contains mello claims of error by the prosecutor and the trial judge by trial counsel,and refashioned,because of counsel failure to object,as ineffective assistance of counsel claims trial counsel failure to object to the prosecutor closing arguments,to the jury instructions,and to the atmosphere of levity during the trial.these we denote as hybrid claims because they were argued both as independent grounds for relief and as an ineffective assistance of counsel ground for relief.
standards applied by the sjc to the ineffective assistance of counsel claims 
in reviewing mello ineffective assistance of counsel claims,the sjc first cited the standard established in commonwealth saferian,which inquires whether there has been serious incompetency,inefficiency,or inattention of of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible,if that is found,then,typically,whether it has deprived the defendant of an otherwise available,substantial ground of defen s although the sjc did not cite strickland for the ineffective assistance of counsel standard,we have described the saferian standard as functionally identical to the federal standard.scarpa,at see ouber guarino,cir.noting that the saferian standard is roughly equivalent to the strickland standard strickland,at.requiring that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.
the sjc then said that in reviewing a conviction of murder in the first degree,regardless of whether a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has been made,the question for the court is whether,because of an alleged error by defense counsel,the prosecutor,or the judge,or for any other reason,there is a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice unless relief is given.commonwealth johnson,alteration in original see also commonwealth painten,same commonwealth koonce,same commonwealth plant,same.the sjc has explained that the substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard is more favorable to a defendant than is the constitutional standard for determining the ineffectiveness of counsel.commonwealth wright.thus,if the sjc found that the substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard was not met,it must have concluded that the saferian strickland standard for ineffective assistance of counsel was not met as well 
in ruling on mello pure ineffective assistance of counsel claims,the sjc expressly applied the substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard except in the case of the failure to exercise peremptory challenges,where the sjc concluded that counsel had made no error.in deciding mello hybrid ineffective assistance claims,the sjc simply wrote b ecause we have previously disposed of the claims of prejudice arising from the prosecutor closing argument,the judge remarks,and the jury instructions we need not repeat that analysis here.mello,at.the sjc was referring back to its discussion of mello direct challenges to these alleged prosecutorial and judicial errors,where it had rejected mello claims under the same substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard.in other words,the sjc relied on the same substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard in rejecting mello hybrid ineffective assistance claims that it applied in analyzing his pure ineffective assistance claims.
in sum,the sjc rejected mello ineffective assistance of counsel claims under a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard that the sjc says is more favorable to a defendant than the saferian standard,which we have said is the functional equivalent of the strickland standard.we therefore conclude that the sjc applied a standard of ineffective assistance of counsel that is at least as favorable to mello as the federal standard.
c.the district court opinion 
the district court denied mello petition for habeas corpus relief.in so doing,it analyzed mello various ineffective assistance of counsel claims and concluded that the sjc analysis of those claims was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.we review the district court decision de novo.nadeau matesanz,cir.
d.the specific claims 
pure ineffective assistance of counsela.failure to pursue expert testimony on mello mental condition 
mello argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue expert testimony on the combined effect of voluntary intoxication and mello alleged mental deficiencies to bolster his mens rea defense to the first degree murder charge.in support of his motion for a new trial or for a reduction of his first degree murder conviction to second degree murder,mello offered the testimony of milton burglass,a specialist in addiction medicine then affiliated with harvard medical school.burglass had conducted an substance abuse oriented neuropsychiatric examination of mello,interviewed his mother,reviewed mello school,juvenile court,and medical records,and read his trial testimony.burglass stated that mello had a documented history of polysubstance abuse dating to the age of thirteen,and that at the time of the fire he met certain criteria for alcohol and cocaine dependence.he also indicated that mello had a childhood and early adolescent medical history compatible with minimal brain dysfunction or attention deficit disorder,and a childhood and adolescent history of multiform psychiatric disturbances characterized by depression,anxiety,impulsivity,and suicidal ideation and acts.in addition,burglass noted a history of multiple head injuries from falls during early,middle,and late childhood and from beatings by his father.
burglass expressed the opinion that these background factors,in conjunction with mello extensive use of alcohol and drugs during the day and evening before the fire,impair ed substantially and significantly louis mello conscious ability a to have perceived accurately b to have correctly made attributions of cause and effect and c to have appreciated and evaluated the outcome probabilities and consequences of the act of causing a lighted bottle of gasoline to be thrown at the dwelling in which leonard starcher and others were sleeping.although t his cognitive impairment would not have precluded mello understanding the more proximal,or immediate,consequences that might arise from his act the outbreak of fire in the would have compromised his ability to appreciate and evaluate the nature,likelihood,and severity of more distal consequences,such as the fire causing the death of the people inside the building.burglass declared that,w ithin reasonable medical certainty,the clinical evidence does not support the conclusion that louis mello at any time formed the specific intent to kill or injure leonard starcher or anyone else as a result of an act of arson.
mello argued to the sjc that trial counsel was ineffective in failing even to investigate the potential use of an expert such as burglass to support his mens rea defense to first degree murder.taking no position on the question of the adequacy of trial counsel performance,the sjc rejected mello ineffective assistance claim on the ground that it was unpersuaded that counsel decision not to introduce expert testimony was likely to have influenced the jury verdict.mello,at.the sjc explained 
despite his ingestion of alcohol and heroin the night of the killing,there was substantial evidence that mello was capable of possessing,and did,in fact,possess the requisite intent for first degree murder.mello was able to recall with specific detail the events of the crime.he appeared to have no trouble walking,and spoke coherently several hours before the fire.mello testimony revealed that on the night of the fire he had the composure to quietly slip out of his house,drive a car,and construct a molotov cocktail.moreover,mello had the presence of mind to appreciate the need for a quick,and to tell his friends after fleeing the scene,you guys do know me and i do know you.finally,mello admitted that he had set the fire,and that he had been aware that people were in the apartment building while it was being torched.in short,the evidence clearly demonstrated that mello was not so overcome by intoxicants as to be incapable of murder in the first degree.
we agree with mello that a confessed teenaged arsonist denial of any intent to kill was a thin reed on which to structure a defense to murder,and that trial counsel professed reasons for not investigating the use of expert testimony do not withstand scrutiny nevertheless,we can not say that the sjc holding that counsel failure to introduce expert testimony did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice is objectively unreasonable.williams,at.the evidence at trial suggested that mello planned the arson and the getaway with some care the night of the fire.moreover,burglass principal the fire was a proximal consequence of the molotov cocktail that was comprehensible to mello,whereas the death of those inside the building was a distal consequence beyond his dismissive.for example,at the motion hearing,the commonwealth posed this question to burglass so,in the continuum of proximal consequences to distal consequences then,where does the desire or the need or the foreseeing of having a getaway car fit in it was therefore not unreasonable for the sjc to conclude that burglass testimony would not likely have persuaded the jury to return a different verdict.
failure to investigate mello psychiatric history 
the sjc addressed mello claim that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate his psychiatric history in a footnote.mello argues that the sjc applied the wrong standard of review when it found no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice because there was substantial evidence of mello ability to formulate the requisite intent.mello,at.in pointing to the existence of substantial evidence supporting the jury verdict,rather than weighing the evidence supporting the verdict against the mitigating evidence introduced at trial and advanced in the habeas proceeding,the sjc,in mello view,violated the rule set out in strickland that a court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.at.
we conclude that the sjc did evaluate the totality of the evidence as directed by strickland.although the footnote in which the sjc rejected mello claim that trial counsel should have investigated mello psychiatric history does not include a weighing of the totality of the evidence,the footnote is appended to a discussion of trial counsel failure to seek expert assistance on the issue of mello mental condition,in the course of which the sjc described burglass arguments and the unsuccessful intoxication defense mello put on at trial.fairly read,the sjc opinion does take into account the totality of the evidence in rejecting mello arguments.we reject mello invitation to declare the sjc decision contrary to the requirements of strickland simply because the court written opinion did not include an express declaration of what it unmistakably implies,that mello evidence is insufficient to undermine confidence in the jury verdict.see id.at.
failure to exercise peremptory challenges 
mello argues that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to exercise a single peremptory challenge,despite the fact that one juror in this case had a father who was a firefighter,and a second had a daughter who worked in a prison.the commonwealth points out that the trial judge asked these jurors if they could be impartial,and they indicated that they could.although the decision by defense counsel of an accused arsonist to permit the child of a firefighter to sit on the jury seems odd,mello fails to demonstrate any prejudice from the inclusion on the jury of a juror who swore that she could be fair and impartial.nor can we say that it was objectively unreasonable of the sjc to conclude that trial counsel made no error in declining to exercise his peremptory challenges.
mello urges us to adopt a rule that counsel who exercises no peremptory challenges in a murder case and who fails to place his client consent to this waiver on the record is the equivalent of the absence of counsel,requiring no proof of prejudice for reversal.we are aware of no federal precedent,and none has been cited,that stands for the proposition mello urges.we therefore can not say that the sjc decision rejecting such a rule was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.d.
hybrid ineffective assistance of counsel 
prosecutor closing argument 
mello argues that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the prosecutor closing argument,in the course of which the prosecutor urged the jury to do something about the broad societal problems suggested by the unfortunate facts of his case,and to do the duty that you been sworn to uphold,to grant mello a verdict of guilty.the sjc observed that the prosecutor statements urging the jury to do their duty and render a guilty verdict went beyond the bounds of permissible advocacy,but concluded that this did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice,and hence trial counsel failure to object did not constitute ineffective assistance.mello,at.
we are unmoved by the commonwealth suggestion that mello attorney opened the door to the prosecutor improper argument with improper argument of his own.since mello claim is ineffective assistance of counsel,we can not dispatch his argument about trial counsel failure to object to the commonwealth closing argument by pointing to yet another misstep trial counsel made.likewise,the commonwealth contention that the prosecutor closing argument must not have been so prejudicial if mello counsel failed to object plainly misses the point.
the sjc,however,offered reasonable grounds for rejecting mello argument,observing that the prosecutor did not urge the jury to disregard the intoxication evidence,but instead properly argued that,although intoxication is to be considered,the evidence in this case demonstrated that the defendant was not so intoxicated as to be incapable of forming the requisite intent.id.at.the sjc also explained that the jury were instructed on the effects of voluntary intoxication on the defendant
