jerry rogers mcmillan appeals the district court sua sponte dismissal of his petition for habeas relief under west supp.the district court determined,based on the face of the petition,that mcmillan failed to file his claim within the limitation period,see d west supp,and dismissed mcmillan petition.mcmillan,who was represented by counsel in district court,argues that he was entitled to an opportunity to address the timeliness of his petition under hill braxton,cir,which requires a federal habeas court to notify a pro se petitioner that his petition is subject to dismissal under d when the state has not yet filed a responsive pleading or otherwise invoked the limitations bar,see id.at.we hold that hill notification requirement applies to habeas petitioners represented by counsel as well as those proceeding pro se,but we affirm the district court in this case because mcmillan was ultimately afforded sufficient opportunity to be heard on the timeliness of his petition.
in april,mcmillan was convicted in north carolina state court of felonious restraint,sexual assault,and rape.he received sentences of three years,thirty years,and thirty years,respectively,with the sentences running consecutively.on direct appeal,the north carolina court of appeals affirmed his convictions and sentences.on december,the north carolina supreme court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari,ending the direct review process in state court.mcmillan did not seek review in the united states supreme court.
on july,mcmillan filed a motion for appropriate relief mar in north carolina state court,which was denied on september.mcmillan then filed a certiorari petition seeking review of the denial of his mar in the north carolina court of appeals,which denied his petition on april.mcmillan then filed what was styled as a petition for writ of certiorari petition for error coram nobis petition for writ of supersedeas,which the north carolina court of appeals also denied.finally,mcmillan petitioned the north carolina supreme court for a writ of certiorari on the denial of his.the north carolina supreme court denied the petition on november.
on july,mcmillan filed,through his attorney,this federal habeas action pursuant to.before the state filed a responsive pleading or otherwise raised the d limitations period,the district court determined that mcmillan petition failed to satisfy the terms of d,which requires a petitioner to file a petition within one year from the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of time for seeking such review.the district court concluded that direct review of mcmillan conviction concluded on march,when the time expired for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court.see harris hutchinson,cir.according to the district court calculation,the period during which mcmillan was required to file his petition thus expired on march.because mcmillan did not file his mar relief until july,nearly four months after the expiration of the limitation period,the district court concluded that mcmillan efforts to obtain collateral relief in state court did not operate to toll the limitation period under d.having determined from the petition that mcmillan failed to comply with d,the district court dismissed mcmillan claims.
mcmillan then filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing that the application of the limitation period set forth in d was unconstitutional and,alternatively,that the doctrine of equitable tolling should apply to allow him to file his petition.although rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure,the appropriate vehicle for seeking reconsideration of a district court decision,generally affords relief only in narrow circumstances,see hill,at collison international chemical workers union,cir,the district court gave full consideration to each of mcmillan contentions on the merits before ultimately rejecting them.
on appeal,mcmillan sole argument is that under hill braxton the district court failed to provide adequate notice of its intention to dismiss the petition as untimely and to allow him an adequate opportunity to explain why the limitations bar did not or should not apply to mcmillan petition.mcmillan does not challenge the district court disposition of his constitutional challenge to d or his equitable tolling argument.
we turn first to the question of whether the holding in hill braxton extends to habeas petitioners who are represented by counsel.in hill,we held that a pro se habeas petitioner must be given an opportunity to respond before a district court,acting sua sponte,dismisses a petition as untimely 
w hen a federal habeas court,prior to trial,perceives a pro se petition to be untimely and the state has not filed a motion to dismiss based on the limitations period,the court must warn the prisoner that the case is subject to dismissal pursuant to d absent a sufficient explanation,unless it is indisputably clear from the materials presented to the district court that the petition is untimely and can not be salvaged by equitable tolling principles or any of the circumstances enumerated in d.
at.we reasoned first that it is improbable that it would ever be clear from the face of the petition that the petitioner is not entitled to relief since the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense,and a habeas petitioner is not likely to plead detailed facts to refute this defense in the initial petition.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.a pro se petitioner is less able to anticipate affirmative defenses than counsel and,therefore,is unlikely to plead facts refuting the statute of limitations even if facts exist that would support a strong argument against barring the petition as untimely.id.at.hill observed that this problem is compounded when a pro se petitioner is required to use a standard form to file a petition,as the petitioner in hill was required to do,and the form does not direct him to address the timeliness issue or ask him to include facts that might be outside of the record but relevant to timeliness under d.id.second,we observed that any facts supporting the application of equitable tolling or one of the statutory exceptions to the limitations bar listed in d were unlikely to be part of the record before the district court.therefore,we concluded that when a district court,acting sua sponte,dismisses as untimely a petition without notice to or input from the petitioner,the court can not be certain that there are no circumstances that would cause the petition to be timely.id.at.the petitioner may well bring to light facts not apparent to the court that militate against the application of the limitations bar.id.
hill left open the question of whether a habeas petitioner is entitled to a similar opportunity to respond even if he is represented by counsel.in hill,we did not foreclose the possibility that good reason might exist to distinguish,for notice purposes,between pro se and counseled cases,explaining that an opportunity to reply is particularly appropriate for a pro se petitioner,who is less apt to anticipate affirmative defenses than habeas counsel,especially where a pro se petitioner must use a government form that does not prompt the petitioner to plead facts establishing the timeliness of the petition.id.nevertheless,mcmillan contends that the reasoning of hill applies with equal force to habeas petitioners represented by counsel.and,we agree with mcmillan,at least on this issue,that the justification for affording more protection to pro se petitioners does not withstand close scrutiny.
at bottom,the basis for requiring that a petitioner be permitted to reply under these circumstances is that a district court,acting sua sponte based solely on the petition,can not be certain that there are no circumstances that would cause the petition to be timely.id.in our view,this is true whether the petitioner is proceeding pro se or not.
first,a district court that on its own raises the timeliness issue and dismisses the action on the basis of the petition alone is not sure to have a complete picture of the relevant facts unless the petiti
