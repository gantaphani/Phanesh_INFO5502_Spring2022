in,a baltimore city jury convicted richard nicolas of murdering his infant daughter.years later,nicolas sought habeas relief,arguing that the state failed to disclose favorable,material evidence in violation of its obligations under brady maryland,d.the maryland courts considered and rejected his brady claim.nicolas then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court,which the district court granted.given the deference that federal law requires to state court judgments in such cases,we must reverse.
on july,aja nicolas was shot and killed while visiting with her father,richard nicolas.aja lived with her mother.nicolas had picked her up that friday evening with plans to see a movie at a local mall.nicolas bought a ticket for the movie pinocchio,and before the movie he and aja took a photo booth picture together.the movie ended around 
according to nicolas,things went horribly wrong on the drive back to aja mother home.nicolas told police that a car started following closely behind him and driving crazy.when nicolas turned off onto bowley lane,the erratic car followed and bumped his vehicle.nicolas told police that he then stopped and got out to confront the other driver.while nicolas was walking around his vehicle,he heard a gunshot and saw the other car drive off.
seeing aja slumped over in her seat,nicolas assumed she had been shot and ran to a nearby convenience store to call for help.in response,officer fred hannah arrived at the convenience store just minutes later,around.he and nicolas then returned to the car and found aja dead.officer hannah and nicolas removed aja from the car and laid her on her back.she had been shot in the head on the left side of her face.
the state did not believe nicolas story.its theory of the case was that,after obtaining the photo booth picture,nicolas himself shot aja.according to the state,nicolas then left aja laying on her side in the car and went to see the pinocchio showing alone.the state argued that after the movie,nicolas drove to bowley lane,ran to the convenience store,and fabricated the tale of the rogue aggressive driver.
the state presented its largely circumstantial case over a trial.it argued that nicolas never wanted to take responsibility for aja,the product of a stand,and had even asked aja mother to obtain an abortion.nicolas,because he was behind in child support,was having his wages garnished and yet had recently obtained life insurance for aja.in response,nicolas offered evidence that the gerber life insurance policy he purchased was marketed as a way to save for a child future,and that he had become more involved in aja life as she grew older.
additionally,the state emphasized that nicolas was a gun enthusiast who previously owned the type of weapon and ammunition used to kill aja.the state never found the murder weapon,however,nor directly connected any of nicolas guns or ammunition to the murder.
several witnesses testified for the state that nicolas demeanor was very calm on the night of the murder,unlike that one would expect from a father whose toddler had just been murdered.nicolas explanation was that he has a debilitating stutter that requires him to calm himself,or else he is completely unable to speak.the state also highlighted inconsistencies in nicolas story,the gunshot residue a small amount found on nicolas left hand,and the improbability of the shooting occurring the way nicolas claimed.
the state strongest evidence was testimony from the medical examiner on lividity,how the blood settled in aja body.because lividity was fixed on her back and her left side,the medical examiner,dennis chute,opined that aja must have died about two hours before nicolas and officer hannah moved her onto her back.otherwise,the blood would not have had time to settle on her side.nicolas argued that,as the state forensic investigator noted in her report,aja was still warm and rigor mortis had not yet set in when the police arrived.still,nicolas main response to chute expert opinion was simply his own testimony that chute must be wrong because nicolas was there and knew the shooting occurred at around.in closing,the state emphasized that nicolas could not get past the issue of lividity.the jury convicted nicolas in less than three hours.
nicolas appealed,and in the court of special appeals of maryland affirmed his conviction.nicolas then filed a state petition for relief.in,the circuit court for baltimore city denied relief,and the court of special appeals summarily denied leave to appeal that ruling 
nicolas then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the united states district court for the district of maryland.through a maryland public information act request,his appointed counsel obtained police notes detailing two potential witnesses who authorities had interviewed during their investigation of aja death.one of the witnesses had contacted police claiming to have information about the killing of the two year old.the potential witnesses had been staying at a holiday inn about of a mile from bowley lane,where aja was found dead.they both told police that they had heard a loud noise that sounded like a gunshot or a car backfiring on the night of aja death.
after speaking to the first potential witness,jennifer mckinsey,investigators wrote 
she advised that she was going to her vehicle and observed a small vehicle at the bottom of the hill.as she was entering her vehicle she hers sic a loud popping sound like a gun shot.mckinsey advises as she was exiting the parking lot the car sped off.
police also recorded an interview with the second potential witness,richard benson,and summarized it as follows 
benson advises at approximately he left out of the hotel to go to his vehicle which was parked on the hotel parking lot.t he witness states when he arrived at his vehicle he observed a light colored vehicle parked in the block of frankford,the vehicle appeared to have it sic engine running and the dome light on inside.benson states as he entered his vehicle he heard a loud noise like the car back fired sic,at this time the vehicle sped off.
benson described the noise as a pretty loud bang.prior to the public information act request,the state had not disclosed to nicolas the existence of these potential witnesses.because nicolas had not presented these documents to the state court,he filed a motion to reopen state proceedings.the district court stayed nicolas federal habeas proceedings while he exhausted state remedies 
back in state court,nicolas argued that the state failure to disclose the witness statements violated nicolas rights under brady maryland,d.in the circuit court for baltimore city denied the motion to reopen,finding that the statements were not favorable to nicolas.it summarized the arguments on both sides and found 
t hese witnesses would have given testimony that,at best,conflicted with the theory of the case advanced by the petitioner.indeed,arguably the statements by the witnesses were more consistent with the state theory of the case than the defense.
the court of special appeals summarily denied nicolas leave to appeal,and he returned to federal court for habeas review.the district court conducted an in camera review of the state file,which led to additional discovery.in particular,the file contained two letters written by the trial prosecutors to officer hannah and chute.the prosecutors thanked officer hannah for moving aja,although it had been a violation of police protocol,writing 
had you left her in the car,we would never have won this case.it is only because you did move her that the medical examiner saw the fixed lividity on her left side and her back when the autopsy was done.this fact was the whole case.lividity made everything nicolas said a boldfaced lie.
in their letter to chute,the prosecutors similarly emphasized the importance of the lividity testimony,explaining 
the jury was only out for two hours,which is a very short time considering that the trial lasted for fourteen days.we are certain that your testimony was the reason that this jury had no difficulty reaching this verdict.
although these letters,written,could not be brad
