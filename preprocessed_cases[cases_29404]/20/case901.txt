in this proceeding under,louis cooper maintains that his counsel provided him constitutionally deficient legal representation in failing to consult with him about taking an appeal.
cooper pleaded guilty to two drug trafficking offenses and a related firearms offense,without the benefit of a plea agreement.he submitted his plea pursuant to north carolina alford,consenting to punishment even though unwilling to admit his part in the acts constituting the offenses,and the district court accepted the plea.
after objecting to portions of the presentence report,cooper and the government reached a sentencing agreement under which cooper withdrew his objections to the report and the government agreed not to seek a sentencing enhancement for cooper managerial role in the drug offenses.cooper and the government also stipulated to a base offense level of under the sentencing guidelines,which,with a criminal history category i,would subject cooper to a guidelines sentence of to months imprisonment for the drug trafficking counts.accepting the stipulation,the district court sentenced cooper to the low end of the guidelines range,imposing a sentence of months imprisonment for the drug trafficking counts and the mandatory consecutive sentence for the firearms count.
after sentencing,cooper never requested that his counsel,andrew arnold,esquire,file an appeal,and arnold never consulted with cooper on whether to file an appeal.
in this proceeding,cooper requests that his sentence now be vacated on the ground that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when arnold failed to consult with him about taking an appeal.the district court denied the petition.
we affirm.because cooper repeatedly expressed his desire to have the criminal proceeding concluded,received the best possible sentence he could have received under the agreement he entered into with the government,and had no nonfrivolous issues to appeal,we conclude that cooper has not established,as required by roe,that arnold was constitutionally ineffective for failing to consult with him about an appeal or that cooper was prejudiced by arnold failure to consult with him.
on march,after cooper delivered approximately grams of cocaine to a customer with the understanding that the customer would pay for the cocaine later,the customer agreed to serve as an informant for law enforcement officers.under the supervision of the officers,the informant then paid cooper for the cocaine two days later.
on march,cooper,along with two confidential informants,traveled from mineral county,west virginia,to winchester,virginia,to purchase approximately grams of cocaine from an individual known as carlos.after completing the purchase,cooper was arrested on the return trip while stopped at a convenience store in capon bridge,west virginia.law enforcement officers had observed the drug transaction in winchester and had followed the vehicle to capon bridge.cooper was searched incident to the arrest,and officers found a model handgun in cooper waistband and the grams of cocaine in a cup in the backseat of the vehicle,near where cooper had been sitting.
cooper was subsequently indicted for one count of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute and for one count of distributing cocaine,in violation of.he was also indicted for one count of using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c.following his indictment,andrew arnold,esquire,was appointed to represent cooper.
initially,cooper planned to plead guilty to one drug trafficking count and the firearms count,pursuant to a plea agreement with the government.during the plea colloquy,however,the district court became concerned that cooper answers indicated that he believed he was not guilty of the crimes.accordingly,the district court suspended the colloquy to allow cooper to withdraw his plea or to consider pleading pursuant to north carolina alford,holding that a n individual accused of a crime may voluntarily,knowingly,and understandingly consent to the imposition of a prison sentence even if he is unwilling or unable to admit his participation in the acts constituting the crime.a few days later,when the hearing was resumed,cooper entered an alford plea,without the benefit of a plea agreement,to all three counts of the indictment,and the court accepted the plea.during the course of the plea colloquy,the district court advised cooper that his right to appeal will be restricted to the jurisdiction of the court,the voluntariness of the guilty plea,the effective representation of your lawyer,and the application of the sentencing guidelines in this case,and cooper responded that he understood the restrictions.

at the sentencing hearing,the district court overruled two of the objections and scheduled a continuation of the hearing to receive evidence and rule on the remaining objections and his downward departure motion.
at the outset of the second sentencing hearing,cooper and the government reported that they had reached an agreement whereby cooper would withdraw his objections to the presentence report and his motion for a downward departure and stipulate to the base offense level of,as calculated in paragraph of the presentence report.in exchange,the government agreed not to seek an enhancement for cooper managerial role and stipulated to the offense level of.under this agreement,the sentencing guidelines range was to months imprisonment for the drug trafficking counts and a mandatory consecutive sentence for the firearms offense.accepting the agreement,the district court imposed concurrent sentences of months imprisonment,at the low end of the guidelines range,on the drug trafficking counts and a mandatory term of imprisonment on the firearms count,to run consecutively to the terms imposed on the drug trafficking counts.after imposing the sentence,the district court advised cooper of his limited rights to appeal and informed him that if he wished to appeal,he had to do so within days of the entry of judgment,which was october.cooper never filed an appeal.
