petitioner victor carranza,proceeding pro se,seeks leave to file a successive motion raising,as relevant here,two claims that his attorney was ineffective for failing to timely file an appellate brief and appendix,which resulted in the dismissal of carranza direct appeal and that carranza has been denied proper access to the courts,due to,among other things,his attorney ineffectiveness.we hold that,although carranza first motion challenging the legality of his conviction and sentence was previously denied on the merits,his proposed motion is not second or successive under h because it seeks only to reinstate his rights and therefore does not challenge the legality of the sentence imposed.accordingly,we deny the successive motion as unnecessary and transfer the matter to the district court with instructions that carranza motion be accepted for filing.
background 
in july,carranza pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.the district court sentenced him principally to months imprisonment and entered its judgment of conviction in november.carranza filed a timely pro se notice of appeal,and his attorney in the district court,edward edens,was designated as appellate counsel.after attempting to contact edens directly,and then issuing two orders warning of the consequences of failing to file an appellate brief and appendix,this court dismissed carranza direct appeal in june for failure to comply with its scheduling orders.the mandate issued in december.
while his direct appeal remained pending,carranza filed a pro se motion in the district court in which he argued that his sentence should be vacated because he had received ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his november sentencing.the district court denied that motion on the merits in april.see carranza united states,cv,dist.lexis.carranza did not appeal that order.
in january,carranza moved in this court for leave to file a successive motion,asserting that edens had provided ineffective assistance by failing to perfect carranza direct appeal carranza also claims that he has been denied proper access to the courts due to his lack of education and edens ineffectiveness see cir.dkt,doc mot.at pdf.carranza alleges that he only recently received this court docket sheet,from which he discovered that his appeal had been dismissed.id.at pdf pg.carranza attached to his motion a copy of a letter addressed to the illinois attorney registration and disciplinary commission,in which he expresses his intent to initiate disciplinary proceedings against edens for failing to file his appeal brief as promised.
by order entered in april,we stayed the proceedings pursuant to galtieri,at,and directed the government to file a response addressing whether carranza present motion is necessary in light of vu united states,cir per curiam,and urinyi united states,cir per curiam.in those cases,we held that a movant first motion seeking reinstatement of his right to direct appeal,whether successful,see urinyi,at,or unsuccessful,see vu,at,did not render a subsequent motion challenging the conviction or sentence successive within the meaning of h.
the government responded that vu and urinyi should not be extended to permit a second section motion to reinstate an appeal after a defendant has had a full opportunity to bring a collateral attack.cir.dkt,doc.gov t resp.at.it contends that both urinyi and vu are limited to a particular chronology not present here an initial motion seeking only reinstatement of the movant right to appeal,followed by a later motion substantively attacking the conviction or sentence neither case purports to upset the general rule that a movant is required to assert all available claims in his or her collateral attack on the conviction and sentence and,therefore,carranza should have raised his present claims in his first motion,either when it was first filed or by amending it after this court dismissed his direct appeal and carranza motion fails to satisfy the requirements of h.id.at.
carranza generally argues that his proposed motion is not successive because it does not seek to challenge the legality of his underlying conviction and,instead,seeks only to reinstate his rights.
discussion 
under the anti terrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,a petitioner incarcerated pursuant to a federal judgment can not file a second or successive motion in the district court unless he or she first obtains authorization from the court of appeals by demonstrating that certain statutory requirements have been met.see h,b.such authorization is unnecessary,however,if the proposed motion is not second or successive within the meaning of h.see whab united states,cir.while the term second or successive is not defined by the statute,we generally have held that to be considered successive,a new motion must attack the same judgment that was attacked in the prior motion,and the prior motion must have been decided on the merits.vu,at citations,internal quotation marks,and alterations omitted.
the district court denied carranza first motion on the merits in april.the determination of whether this newly proposed motion is successive therefore turns on whether it constitutes an attack on the same november judgment of conviction challenged in the first motion.the holdings of urinyi and vu,as well as the nature of carranza claim,compel us to conclude that it does not.
in urinyi and vu,we held that the movants second motions,which challenged the legality of their sentences,were not successive because their initial motions sought only reinstatement of their rights on the ground that their attorneys were ineffective for failing to file timely notices of appeal.see vu,at urinyi,at.the urinyi movant initial motion was successful in reinstating his right to appeal and,following that appeal,he sought leave to file a second motion presenting nine claims attacking his conviction and sentence.see urinyi,at.relying on our precedent developed in the context of habeas applications brought by state prisoners,we explained that two requests for habeas relief are not successive simply because they are both brought by the same prisoner.urinyi,at quoting vasquez parrott,cir.instead,a second application for habeas relief is considered successive if it represent s a second attack by federal habeas petition on the same conviction.id.quoting vasquez,at.we therefore held that urinyi second motion was not successive because although his initial motion that sought to reinstate his direct appeal certainly concerned his conviction,it did not attack that conviction.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we concluded that urinyi second motion constituted his first full opportunity to seek collateral review of his conviction and sentence and that,by permitting him to file his second motion,he was restored to the procedural posture he would have enjoyed if he had been represented by effective counsel who had timely filed a notice of appeal.id.
in vu,we held that the movant prior unsuccessful motion that sought reinstatement of his direct appeal also did not render successive a later motion challenging the legality of his conviction and sentence.see at.distilling the reasoning of urinyi and vasquez,we concluded that an initial or petition seeking reinstatement of rights is not a challenge to the legality of the sentence imposed.id.at.accordingly,we held that,w hether successful or unsuccessful,a motion that seeks reinstatement of rights does not render a later collateral proceeding a duplicative attack on the conviction.id.
here,carranza allegations that his attorney intentionally allowed his appeal rights to be lost,and that he has been denied proper access to the courts as a result,mot.at pdf,state a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel based on his attorney failure to perfect carranza direct appeal.these allegations,like allegations that rights have been lost due to counsel failure to file a notice of appeal,represent a different species of ineffective assistance claim than those which assert that counsel performance was deficient during the trial or with respect to the arguments r
