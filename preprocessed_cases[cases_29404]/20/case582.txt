edwin galarza galarza appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york mckenna,denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court held,inter alia,that galarza failed to show that the prosecutor exercise of peremptory challenges to strike hispanic members of the venire at trial violated galarza constitutional rights under batson kentucky,d.we find that the trial court correctly determined that his claims as to two potential jurors lacked merit.with respect to galarza three remaining batson claims,we find that the trial court failed to rule whether it credited the explanations proffered by the prosecutor before denying the challenges.we therefore vacate the district court denial of galarza habeas petition and remand his batson claims as to these three prospective jurors for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
galarza,a hispanic individual,was tried before a jury in a new york state court on various narcotics charges.jury selection began on february.the first panel of jurors consisted of eighteen individuals,and after voir dire,the prosecutor used her peremptory challenges to strike eleven members of the venire.defense counsel objected,stating 
for the record,judge,i know that the district attorney has been systematically taking off blacks and h ispanics she intimated that the defendant would want h ispanics,after seeing her peremptory challenges,it seems clear to me that she is knocking off as many minority members as she can for the record,adelpho felix was knocked off,aurea valez was knocked off,edwardo vasquez was knocked off,david vargas was knocked off,catherine rodriguez was knocked off every h ispanic was knocked off peremptorily.
the trial court responded,six h ispanics.is there anything the people wish to say the prosecutor responded that she did not assume that felix was hispanic and that t he only person that i think is obviously h ispanic in just talking to her,as to whether they speak spanish,was valez.the prosecutor then proffered the following reasons for striking the remaining four prospective jurors that galarza had identified 
my reason for striking valez thought she had a problem understanding.i think it was communicated when she was up at the bench yesterday during the initial discussions.vasquez,also clearly in my impression,had a problem understanding.he seemed somewhat confused yesterday when he came up to the bench and he was somewhat confused today when you asked him point blank questions about certain things,he would say no,then he would go ahead and answer in the affirmative.again,that was my reason for striking him from the panel.
vargas seemed very soft spoken and i,on a personal level,did not feel comfortable with that juror.again,my basis was not because he was hispanic.
who is left my reason for striking rodriguez was that she equivocated on the issue whether she could be fair and impartial.she thought she could be fair.my impression of that was that she really had no position one way or the other.she would try to be fair but she was sure and that was the basis for striking her from the panel.
defense counsel objected to the reason proffered by the prosecutor for striking rodriguez.counsel argued that the court had commended rodriguez answer about being fair and impartial and that the prosecutor could have struck rodriguez for cause if she truly believed rodriguez could not be fair.counsel then reiterated the challenges as to the other individuals,stating that the prosecutor had used her peremptory challenges against everyone in the jury box who had a hispanic surname 
w ith respect to all of the individual names,felix,valez,vasquez,vargas,am sure i have forgotten one along here,but i think it patently clear that these are people with h ispanic names.i think that each one of them has been systematically excluded in the first round by the assistant district attorney.i submit this is unfair and i object 
the trial court then ruled on the challenges 
in batson kentucky,the supreme court essentially described what the test is at this juncture and described that the trial judge has certain responsibilities with respect to fairness.i am mindful of me tell you what my perceptions are and clearly,i will watch this in the future.
vasquez and valez did join the line yesterday and came up.when i asked them what would you like to say,they looked at me clearly not knowing why they were there i had forgotten that.when the assistant described that,that is clearly what happened.
vargas could have been excused by either side,because vargas is suing the police department because he was falsely arrested apparently by two new york city police officers.
i am mystified that somebody who is in this line of work,does know felix a sic hispanic name since i am satisfied at least three of them have certain articulable sic reasons,i am not going to stop the trial.i am not going to force one or all of these people who were challenged to be seated over prosecution objections.
we will all pay attention.we will see what happens next.
jury selection continued and concluded the following day.defense counsel raised no further challenges to the prosecutor exercise of peremptory challenges.on may,the jury found galarza guilty of numerous narcotics offenses.
galarza appealed his conviction to the appellate division,first department,claiming,inter alia,that he was denied equal protection of the law because the prosecutor exercised her peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner.the appellate division rejected galarza claim,stating that t o the extent that either defendant has preserved a record of the jury selection voir dire,we agree with the trial court that the prosecutor provided racially neutral reasons for the exercise of peremptory challenges as to each strike at issue.people lafontaine.chief judge kaye of the court of appeals denied galarza leave to appeal,people galarza,and denied it again on reconsideration,people galarza,
on december,galarza filed,pro se,the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,alleging,inter alia,that his due process and equal protection rights were violated under batson by the prosecutor use of her peremptory challenges to strike hispanic individuals from the venire.the district judge referred the petition to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.the magistrate judge recommended that the habeas petition be denied.the magistrate judge determined that galarza counsel had waived galarza batson challenges by failing to pursue them during voir dire.assuming arguendo galarza batson claims were not waived at trial,the magistrate judge found that galarza had preserved for appellate review challenges to only three prospective,rodriguez,and that the trial court had credited the prosecutor explanations for striking each of those individuals.galarza filed timely objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation.the district court adopted the report and recommendation,denied the writ and dismissed the habeas petition,and granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether the prosecutor use of peremptory challenges violated batson.galarza filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court ruling on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo.see english artuz,cir.because a trial court determination of whether a juror was struck for a discriminatory reason turns largely on the judge observations of the attorneys and prospective jurors and an evaluation of their credibility,a reviewing court ordinarily should give those findings great deference.hernandez new york,d.more particularly,when reviewing a batson challenge in the context of a habeas petition,a trial court conclusion that a peremptory challenge was not exercised in a discriminatory manner is entitled to a presumption of correctness,except,inter alia,to the extent that the trial court did not resolve the factual issues involved in the challenge or if the finding is not fairly supported by the record.see d presumption of correctness not applicable if the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state court hearing and d presumption of correctness not applicable if state court factual determination is not fairly supported by the record see also purkett elem,d t he factual findings of state courts are presumed to be correct,and may be set aside,absent procedural error,only if they are not fairly supported by the record.internal quotation marks omitted washington schriver,cir stating that the factual findings of state trial and appellate courts are entitled to a presumption of correctness absent special circumstances,including a determination that the factual finding is not fairly supported by the record.
ii.the batson standard 
the supreme court has set forth a test trial courts are to employ when evaluating whether a party exercised a peremptory challenge in a discriminatory manner.see batson,at.first,a trial court must decide whether the party challenging the strike has made a prima facie showing that the circumstances give rise to an inference that a member of the venire was struck because of his or her race.such a prima facie case may be established,for example,by showing a pattern of strikes against minority prospective jurors.see id.at.this court has held that hispanics are a cognizable group for purposes of the first step of the batson inquiry.united states rudas,cir.
if the party making the batson challenge establishes a prima facie case,the trial court must require the party to proffer a explanation for striking the potential juror.see batson at.this second step does not require the party to give an explanation that is persuasive or even plausible.see purkett,at.
finally,if the party proffers a explanation,the trial court must determine whether the moving party has carried his or her burden of proving that the strike was motivated by purposeful discrimination.see batson at.t he third step of the batson inquiry requires a trial judge to make an ultimate determination on the issue of discriminatory intent based on all the facts and circumstances.jordan lefevre,cir internal quotation marks omitted.at this third step,the persuasiveness of the explanation is relevant.see purkett,at.we have repeatedly emphasized that a trial court may not deny a batson motion without determining whether it credits the explanations for the challenged peremptory strikes.see jordan,at stating that it is error for the trial court to deny a batson motion without explicitly adjudicating the credibility of the or challenging party race neutral explanations for its action in peremptorily striking potential jurors barnes anderson,cir stating that w here a court fails to make such a credibility finding with respect to the proffered explanation for each challenged strike,the appropriate course usually will be to remand for findings by the court as to the challenged strikes and an ultimate determination on the issue of discriminatory intent based on all the facts and circumstances emphasis added internal quotation marks and alterations omitted united states alvarado,cir remanding batson challenge to trial court where it failed to make findings as to whether it credited prosecutor explanations for two of the four strikes challenged by defendant.
iii.waiver 
the magistrate judge determined that galarza batson claims were waived by his counsel failure to pursue the challenges during voir dire.we disagree that defense counsel waived galarza batson challenges as to prospective jurors felix,valez,vasquez,vargas,and rodriguez defense counsel specifically identified each of these members of the venire in arguing his batson prima facie case to the court.after the prosecutor proffered explanations for each of these five prospective jurors,one of the defense counsel again objected to the striking of these five individuals defense counsel thus sufficiently pursued the batson challenges as to these five potential jurors.
the dissent would find that galarza is procedurally barred from raising his batson challenges as to these five prospective jurors because he did not renew his objection after the trial court made its incomplete findings as to whether it credited the explanations for each of these strikes.see dissent at.the dissent waiver analysis,however,turns our habeas law on its head.
we have repeatedly stated that in order for federal habeas review to be procedurally barred,a state court must actually have relied on a procedural bar as an independent basis for its disposition of the case,and the state court reliance on state law must be unambiguous and clear from the face of the opinion.see,fama comm r of corr,cir jones stinson,cir.we apply a presumption against finding a state procedural bar and ask not what we think the state court actually might have intended but whether the state court plainly stated its intention.jones,at.we have found a state court reliance on a state procedural bar to be ambiguous,and thus refused to invoke a procedural bar,where although it appeared that the defendant failed to object sufficiently at trial,the state court rejected defendant claims on appeal as either meritless or unpreserved.tankleff,at internal quotation marks omitted.
despite the dissent suggestion otherwise,no genuine ambiguity can be read into the appellate division holding the court explicitly and only addressed the merits see lafontaine,at.even assuming arguendo an ambiguous reference to a state procedural bar by the appellate division existed,the dissent analysis would require us to disregard our established precedent that such an ambiguity is insufficient to preclude our review of a habeas petition.
beyond disregarding our established precedent,the dissent takes its analysis one dangerous step further.the dissent would invoke a procedural bar where the state court chose not to do so and would have this court independently examine whether a procedural bar exists under state law.rather than respecting the grounds of comity and federalism upon which the adequate and independent state grounds doctrine is based,see jones,at,the dissent would have us review the state court decision to reach the merits and would force us to sit as a state court interpreting state procedural rules in habeas cases before us.this is a step we should not take.
we have no quarrel with the need for contemporaneous objections.unlike the dissent,however,we decline to create a procedural requirement that a party must repeat his or her batson challenges three times at trial in order to avoid a procedural bar.similarly,although we agree with the dissent that a party must raise his or her batson challenges in a manner that would allow a trial court to remedy the problem at trial,we find galarza repeated objections did so.the dissent reliance on mccrory henderson,cir,a case where the defendant raised his batson challenges for the first time over three months after the trial was completed,is misplaced.in contrast,galarza and his objected twice prior to the jury being empaneled.under these circumstances,we disagree with the dissent that the blame for the trial court failure to adjudicate whether it credited each of the reasons proffered by the prosecutor lies squarely with galarza.see dissent at.we decline to invoke a procedural bar which the state courts chose not to invoke,and therefore,find that galarza batson challenges as to felix,valez,vasquez,vargas,and rodriguez were sufficiently preserved for collateral review 
iv.exhaustion 
the magistrate judge further determined that even if defense counsel had not waived galarza batson challenges at trial,galarza was procedurally barred from raising his batson challenges as to valez,vasquez,and felix.the magistrate judge stated that galarza had only preserved for collateral review his challenges to the striking of garcia,rodriguez,and vargas because only those challenges were raised in galarza direct appeal from his conviction.we disagree.
in order to preserve an issue for collateral review,a habeas petitioner must exhaust all available state court remedies by fairly present ing his claims to the state courts.daye attorney general of the state of new york,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted.in order to have fairly presented his federal claims to the state courts the petitioner must have informed the state court of both the factual and the legal premises of the claim he asserts in federal court.id.
galarza brief on direct appeal contained the following in the questions presented section whether appellant was denied equal protection of the law when the trial assistant used her peremptory challenges to strike the first five or six from the jury emphasis added.similarly,the heading to the section of galarza brief concerning the batson challenges referred to the prosecutor striking of five or six hispanic members of the venire.more importantly,the statement of the facts section of the brief described the prosecutor use of peremptory challenges against each of the challenged prospective jurors,including valez,vasquez,and felix the batson challenges that the magistrate judge determined galarza was procedurally barred from raising.in his brief,galarza argued that the prosecutor proffered explanations as to each of the other potential jurors were insufficient,particularly as to rodriguez and vargas accordingly,we find that galarza exhausted his batson claims with respect to prospective jurors felix,valez,vasquez,vargas,and rodriguez.
v.the batson analysis 
because we find that galarza did not waive his batson claims as to felix,valez,vasquez,vargas,and rodriguez,we must examine whether the trial court properly analyzed each of these challenges.after defense counsel raised the batson issues,the trial court required the prosecutor to offer explanations for each of the challenged peremptory strikes.thus,the court sufficiently met its obligations under batson steps one and two.hernandez new york,d once a prosecutor has offered a explanation for the peremptory challenges and the trial court has ruled on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination,the preliminary issue of whether the defendant had made a prima facie showing becomes moot.jordan,at stating that a trial judge may rule on a batson application even in the absence of a prima facie showing of discrimination.the only issue in this case is whether the trial court adequately fulfilled its obligations under the third step of the batson adjudicate the credibility of the explanations for the challenged peremptory strikes and make an ultimate ruling as to each of these five challenged prospective jurors.see jordan,at.
the trial court explicitly credited the prosecutor explanation for striking vasquez and valez,namely,that they had problems understanding.because the trial court factual findings regarding these two individuals are entitled to a presumption of correctness,see d,and are supported by the record,we agree with the district court determination that galarza batson claims as to vasquez and valez are without merit.
the same can not be said of galarza batson challenges as to the striking of rodriguez,felix,and vargas.the trial court did not explicitly rule whether it credited the prosecutor proffered explanations for striking these individuals.the court made no mention of rodriguez in its batson ruling.the trial court sole comment with respect to felix was that it was mystified that somebody who is in this line of work,does know felix a sic hispanic name.it is unclear whether,by this statement,the court discredited the prosecutor assertion that she did not think felix was hispanic or whether it credited the prosecutor assertion but was surprised that she did not know felix was a hispanic surname.the court also did not explicitly rule whether it credited the prosecutor assertion that she struck vargas because he was and because she did not feel comfortable with him.instead,the court stated that either side could have struck vargas for cause.
the fact that the trial court failed to rule on the credibility of the prosecutor explanations as to rodriguez,felix and vargas is further evidenced by the court final statement when ruling on the five or six batson challenges 
since i am satisfied that at least three of them have certain articulable sic reasons,i am not going to stop the trial.i am not going to force one or all of these people who were challenged to be seated over prosecution objections.
emphasis added two of these three appear to have been vasquez and valez,but it is unclear which of rodriguez,felix and vargas was the third.moreover,the court comments not only evidence that the court failed to adjudicate the credibility of the explanations offered by the prosecutor for each of the challenged prospective jurors,see jordan,at barnes,at,but also strongly suggest that the trial court did not credit the prosecutor explanations for striking two or three of the challenged prospective jurors.in our view,the trial court statements also might imply that it was unwilling to make the ultimate determination on the issue of discriminatory intent,jordan,at internal quotation marks omitted,because of a stated reluctance to stop the trial.under these circumstances,we find that the trial court failed to discharge its duties under batson 
although the factual findings of state courts are generally presumed to be correct in habeas proceedings in federal court,see supra section i,this presumption is not applicable to the state court determinations as to prospective jurors rodriguez,felix,and vargas.because the trial court failed to resolve the factual issue of whether it credited the explanations for striking each of these three potential jurors,the presumption of correctness does not apply to its batson rulings as to these individuals.see d ford wainwright,d stating that when a state court does not resolve the merits of a factual issue,there is no determination to which that presumption of correctness could be said to attach campaneria reid,cir stating that the presumption of correctness does not adhere in a case in which the state court has not actually resolved the merits of a factual dispute.similarly,the appellate division factual determination that the trial court credited the prosecutor racially neutral reasons for the peremptory strikes of these three prospective jurors is not fairly supported by the record,and,therefore,is also not entitled to a presumption of correctness.d see also williams bartlett,cir finding that state appellate court factual determination was not entitled to presumption of correctness because it was not supported by the record solomon smith,cir agreeing with district court assessment that the state court determination is not fairly supported by the record as a whole,and thus is not entitled to a presumption of correctness under d.
because we find that the trial court failed to fulfil its obligations under batson as to prospective jurors rodriguez,felix,and vargas,we vacate the district court denial of galarza habeas petition and remand the matter to the district court.we leave to the district court the determination of whether to expand the record as it may deem appropriate to resolve galarza batson claims as to these three jurors,or whether to return the matter,through the device of a conditional writ,to the state court for reconsideration.see howard senkowski,cir remanding batson claim to district court for expansion of the record or to issue a conditional writ.we take judicial notice that the trial judge is still alive,and we therefore disagree with the dissent that in all probability,this case will have to be retried or galarza released.see dissent at.
conclusion 
we find that with respect to three of galarza batson challenges,the trial court failed to adjudicate whether it credited the reasons proffered by the prosecutor before denying the challenges.we therefore vacate the district court denial of galarza habeas petition and remand his batson claims as to these three prospective jurors to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
unlike the majority,i believe that,by failing to object at trial to the deficiencies in the trial court findings on his challenge under batson kentucky,d,galarza has forfeited his claim based on those deficiencies accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
this case is a paradigmatic example of the value of timely objecti
