petitioner gordon davis,currently incarcerated in a new york state prison,appeals from the june,amended judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york seybert,denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,pursuant to,but issuing a certificate of appealability coa.davis habeas petition sought to challenge his new york state conviction on two counts of murder in the second degree,new york penal law,which was upheld on direct appeal.davis habeas challenge is principally based on his argument that he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel,as defined by strickland washington,d,because his counsel performance was objectively unreasonable in failing to advise davis,a offender,that any incriminating statements that he made during his proffer sessions with law enforcement could be used as evidence against him if he stood trial rather than following through with the plea agreement and davis,who later had to stand trial due to his failure to comply with the conditions of his plea,was prejudiced by these errors because he would not have originally agreed to the proposed proffer and plea which included a requirement that he agree to testify against family he been properly informed that his proffer statements could be used against him.
the district court denied davis habeas petition,ruling,inter alia,that his counsel performance did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness in failing to warn davis about the consequences of proffering and even if this failure was unreasonable,davis was not prejudiced by his counsel unreasonable performance because davis would have accepted the plea offer,and would have proffered the statements regardless.with respect to the first determination,we disagree with the district court.however,we do not reverse the district court judgment denying the writ because we affirm the district court determination that the unreasonable performance of davis counsel did not prejudice davis.because strickland requires both a showing that counsel performance was unreasonable and that prejudice arose therefrom,we hold that the state court denial of davis ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
background 
we draw the facts,which are largely undisputed,principally from the district court memorandum and order of june.on or about november,law enforcement officers arrested davis,shamel thomas shamel,davis,and sheron thomas sheron,davis foster sister,for the murder of frank olivieri.sheron had enlisted davis and shamel to beat olivieri,who was sheron former fianc√©,before she set him on fire.on the night of the murder,sheron,davis,shamel,and shamel girlfriend,nikkita cumberbatch nikkita,assembled at sheron apartment.sheron created a mixture of gasoline and lighter fluid and then directed nikkita to take the getaway car to an inconspicuous location and wait for davis and shamel told davis and shamel where to hide in waiting for olivieri and phoned olivieri to request that he come to her apartment immediately and retrieve his cat.
olivieri complied with sheron request and,as soon as olivieri exited sheron apartment building,shamel struck olivieri over the head with a baseball bat.while shamel continued striking olivieri with the bat,davis repeatedly kicked him.after the beating,as planned,shamel and davis stole olivieri wallet and fled to nikkita car.subsequently,sheron set olivieri on fire.according to the medical examiner,it was unclear whether the head injuries or the burns ultimately caused olivieri death.davis,shamel,and sheron were indicted on three counts of murder in the second degree,see penal law intentional murder,depraved indifference murder,felony murder.
davis proffer and guilty plea 
not long after the arrests,the court appointed william nash to serve as counsel to davis,and the suffolk county district attorney office the da commenced plea negotiations with davis and shamel.the da informed nash that davis would have the chance to plead guilty to manslaughter,instead of murder,and might have the chance to be adjudicated as a youthful offender in exchange for davis participation in proffer sessions and davis agreement to testify against sheron and shamel if necessary.if davis accepted this proposal,he would have a sentencing exposure that ranged from a minimum sentence of time served to a maximum sentence of eight and to years in prison.if davis rejected this plea offer,he faced a sentencing exposure of years to life for each of his three counts of murder in the second degree.
nash counseled davis about the benefits of accepting the da offer,highlighting that various defenses,including alibi and entrapment,would not be available to davis if he stood trial and a plea of guilty to manslaughter had the potential to greatly reduce davis sentencing exposure.davis was informed that he might have to testify against shamel and sheron at trial but davis was never told,by nash or otherwise,that any statement he made during the proffer session could be used against him if the plea agreement did not materialize or if,after pleading guilty,davis had to stand trial.even though nash was aware of davis emotional attachments to sheron and shamel,nash did not inform davis of the consequences of the proffer,nor negotiate with the da,at any time,regarding a potential clause,which would have conditioned davis participation in the proffer session on an agreement that his statements could not be used against him if his case went to trial.furthermore,there is no evidence in the record that the law enforcement agents who interviewed davis during the proffer session ever informed davis that his statements could be used against him at a subsequent trial.
following nash advice,davis decided to meet with law enforcement officials for a proffer session on march.during the march,proffer session nash remained outside of the room for most of the time,but entered periodically when davis requested advice or when the interviewers became frustrated with davis.during the proffer session,davis recounted the events leading up to olivieri murder.he also signed an affidavit that enabled law enforcement to obtain a search warrant against sheron.eight days after the first proffer session,on march,davis pleaded guilty to manslaughter,which was accepted by the trial court.davis was not sentenced at that time because the plea agreement also required that he truthfully testify against sheron and shamel if necessary.
ii.davis failure to testify adequately against sheron thomas 
pursuant to the plea agreement,the government requested that davis testify against his foster sister,sheron thomas.to prepare for his testimony at sheron trial,davis met with prosecutors on june,and on august.nash was only present for a portion of the june,meeting.on september,davis took the stand and testified for minutes about the various aspects of sheron plan to beat and set fire to olivieri.davis testimony,which implicated himself and his was consistent with his prior sworn statements.
the following day,davis told the court,through nash,that he would not continue testifying against sheron.the trial court warned davis that he would lose the benefits of his plea agreement if he failed to testify and adjourned the proceedings for the weekend to allow davis to confer with nash.the prosecution informed davis that he would not need to testify against shamel,his half brother,because shamel had recently pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree.despite warnings from nash that davis would likely lose his plea agreement and face trial for murder,davis decided not to continue testifying against sheron,and the trial judge declared a mistrial.davis subsequently explained that sheron had cried during his testimony and that this had affected his ability to proceed.at this time,davis was still unaware that his failure to testify would mean that his proffer session statements could be used against him,but he later admitted that he would have still decided not to testify at that point even if nash had told him about this consequence.
subsequently,the trial court granted davis pro se motion to remove and replace nash as his assigned counsel but refused davis attempts,based on an argument that his counsel was ineffective,to suppress his prior proffer session statements and his minute testimony at sheron trial.the court also rejected davis opposition to the government motion to vacate his manslaughter plea.davis manslaughter plea was vacated and davis case proceeded to trial.
iii.davis trial and state court appeals 
at trial,the government entered as principal evidence against davis,all of davis incriminating statements,except those that he made during his plea allocution testimony from nikkita,the driver of the getaway car and testimony from the medical examiner.after both sides rested,the government successfully moved,without objection from davis,to withdraw the intentional murder count.the remaining two counts,for depraved indifference murder,new york penal law,and for felony murder,new york penal law,were submitted to the jury.during deliberations,the jury requested to have davis incriminating statements repeated.on june,the jury unanimously found davis guilty on both counts of murder in the second degree.on july,davis received two concurrent sentences of years to life.
davis appealed this ruling to the appellate division,second department,contending,inter alia,that nash was constitutionally ineffective as counsel because he left davis alone with law enforcement during the three proffer sessions he failed to inform davis at anytime,including prior to the initial march,meeting and at sheron first trial,that his incriminating statements could later be used against him if his guilty plea was withdrawn and counsel did not secure the of davis statements to law enforcement as a condition of the plea agreement.davis greiner,js,at june.the appellate division upheld the admission of davis prior statements and summarily determined that davis was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel.people davis.on january,judge wesley,then sitting in the new york court of appeals,denied davis leave to appeal.people davis.on november,davis filed a pro se habeas petition pursuant to.
iv.davis federal habeas proceedings 
the district court appointed counsel to represent davis in his habeas proceedings.davis reiterated his ineffective assistance of counsel claim to the federal habeas court,arguing that nash was ineffective in failing to remain in the interview room during davis proffer sessions secure a clause as a condition of the plea agreement and advise him that any incriminating statements made during the proffer sessions could be used against him if he stood trial.on november,the district court held an evidentiary hearing.nash,davis,and assistant district attorney peter timmons,who had served as trial prosecutor,testified at the hearing.
the district court,by memorandum and order,determined that nash failure to remain in the interview room during the proffer sessions was not objectively unreasonable because davis did not request that nash stay in the room and nash informed davis that he would be available outside.davis,at.with respect to davis argument,the district court determined that counsel failure to secure a clause as a condition of the plea agreement was not sufficient to support a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel.davis,at.after considering davis argument regarding nash failure to warn davis about the risks of the proffer session,the district court determined that nash failure to give this advice was not objectively unreasonable and that nash failure did not prejudice davis because he would still have decided to talk to the detectives about his participation in frank olivieri murder even if he had received the advice.davis,at.
notwithstanding these conclusions,the district court granted a certificate of appealability coa on the question of whether nash had an obligation to advise davis,prior to the march,proffer session,that his proffer session statements could be used against him if he stood trial.we therefore focus on nash failure to warn davis,before he accepted the plea offer,about the risks associated with his participation in the proffer session.we do not review whether nash was ineffective in failing to accompany davis during his proffer sessions and in failing to attempt to secure a agreement,as these issues are outside the scope of the coa.see smaldone senkowski,cir per curiam acknowledging that c indicates that this court does not have jurisdiction to consider issues outside the coa.however,these two facts are intertwined with our ineffective assistance inquiry regarding nash failure to advise davis about the risks of proffering because either could have mitigated these risks 
discussion 
we review the district court denial of defendant habeas corpus petition de novo and its factual findings for clear error.deberry portuondo,cir.in a case such as this,where a habeas petition was brought subsequent to the effective date of the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,and the state court has adjudicated the claim on the merits,a federal court can not grant a writ of habeas corpus unless the state court proceedings resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,id.d.
our main inquiry is whether the state court denial of davis appeal relied on an unreasonable application of strickland,which is the relevant clearly established federal law in this case cox donnelly,cir see williams taylor,d.it is well settled that a defendant sixth amendment right to counsel extends to plea negotiations.see,united states gordon,cir per curiam stating that defendant sixth amendment right attaches at the initiation of formal charges and extends to all critical stages in the proceedings,including plea negotiations.strickland test for ineffective assistance of counsel consists of two separate prongs,both of which must be satisfied in order to establish a constitutional violation.a defendant must show both that defense counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.
the certificate of appealability is does not specify whether it incorporates both prongs of strickland.we believe,however,that the coa,properly construed,incorporates both of the strickland prongs.neither prong in itself can establish the denial of a constitutional right,so that for a coa to properly issue,a substantial showing must have been made on both prongs.see generally c slack mcdaniel,d finding that a coa should issue when the petitioner demonstrates that reasonable jurists would find the district court assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.
to determine whether the state court applied this test in an objectively unreasonable manner,see bell cone,d,this court must find that there was s ome increment of incorrectness beyond error but the increment need not be great.francis stone,cir.furthermore,because the state courts summarily rejected davis ineffective assistance claim on the merits,we must focus on the ultimate decisions of those courts,rather than on the courts reasoning.aeid bennett,cir sellan kuhlman,cir w hen a state court fails to articulate the rationale underlying its rejection of a petitioner claim,and when that rejection is on the merits,the federal court will focus its review on whether the state court ultimate decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent.
strickland first prong 
when assessing whether or not counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms,strickland directs us to consider the circumstances counsel faced at the time of the relevant conduct and to evaluate the conduct from counsel point of view.at.davis principally argues that,given the circumstances of this case,nash failure to inform davis before the proffer session that his statements could be used against him if he stood trial fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.according to the government,nash failure to warn davis was objectively reasonable because nash did inform davis that the plea offer hinged on his agreement to testify against his siblings and because it was not foreseeable to nash that davis would not follow through on his part of a stunningly favorable plea and sentencing agreement.gov t br.at.mindful that we indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,see strickland,at,we nonetheless agree with davis 
because davis was unaware that his proffer statements could be used against him and because davis was a young offender who had an apparent emotional connection with the individuals he was asked to testify against,counsel was obliged to inform his client of the consequences of proffering in order to accord with prevailing professional norms.by failing to inform davis of this crucial aspect of the plea bargain,nash breached his duty to explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.model of prof l conduct b wiggins smith,d acknowledging the role of other aba standards as guides to determining what is reasonable quoting strickland,at.
our case law confirms that counsel has a professional obligation to adequately inform her client about the considerations that are relevant to her client decision to accept or deny a plea bargain.in gordon,we affirmed the district court finding of ineffective assistance,ruling that counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness because,when advising his client about whether to accept a proposed plea,counsel grossly underestimated defendant potential sentencing exposure at trial.gordon,at.we acknowledged that this was an error that related to a key consideration for defendant in making an informed decision,stating that knowledge of the comparative sentence exposure between standing trial and accepting a plea offer will often be crucial to the decision whether to plead guilty.id.quoting united states day,cir internal alteration notation omitted.
in purdy united states,cir,we ruled that,even though counsel never advised his client in so many words about whether or not to plead guilty,id.at,he provided effective counsel because he advised his client on the factors necessary to allow defendant to make an informed decision,such as the strength of the government case and other benefits of pleading guilty,id.at.even though nash did properly inform davis about his potential sentencing exposure at trial,the requirement that davis testify against his siblings if necessary,and the strength of the government case,he nonetheless failed to fulfill his professional duty to assist davis in making an informed decision because he neglected to apprise davis of a crucial aspect of the anything davis said during the proffer session could be used against him if he did not satisfy all of the conditions of the plea offer,including following through with his testimony.we consider this to be a crucial aspect of the plea bargain,in part,because it essentially constituted a waiver of davis right against important constitutional protection.see generally boykin alabama,d quoting johnson zerbst.stating that privilege against is a constitutional right that will not be waived by defendant guilty plea without some showing of defendant intentional relinquishment or abandonment of that right.
the circumstances,viewed from nash perspective at the time,clearly indicated davis was not aware that he was waiving his constitutional right against by accepting the plea offer.the record indicates that davis was not otherwise informed,by law enforcement or previous experience,that his proffer session statements could be used against him at a subsequent trial.this court has indicated that a defendant lack of experience and knowledge of his rights are relevant to determine whether counsel performance fell below a standard of reasonableness.in purdy,at,for instance,we found that defendant comprehension of the various factors that would inform his plea decision was relevant to the court assessment of whether or not counsel performance was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.davis lack of awareness made it crucially important that nash inform davis about the gravity of the right he was asked to forfeit in exchange for a plea agreement.
the circumstances of this case also suggested that davis might later decide not to testify and,as a result,be forced to stand trial therefore,the requirement that davis provide statements that could be used against him at such a trial was a particularly risky aspect of the plea bargain.in addition to the relationship between davis and sheron suggested by the facts of the crime itself,nash himself acknowledged that he was cognizant of the emotional attachment between davis and his siblings,stating that he knew for a fact that psychologically,davis had attachments to foster family members.davis apparent emotional attachment to his siblings,combined with his obvious lack of familiarity with the legal system,should have compelled nash to inform davis that his statements could be used against him if he failed to testify against his siblings.in order for davis to be fully informed about the plea,nash was obligated to inform davis about both the benefits and the all reasonably likely the plea offer.
by failing to warn davis of this crucial aspect of the plea offer,nash deprived davis of the ability to make a fully informed decision for himself.this runs counter to prevailing professional norms which require that a defendant make the ultimate,informed choice about whether or not to accept a plea offer and that a lawyer not exert undue influence on a defendant decision.see purdy,at.because the decision of whether or not to accept a plea offer and all of its conditions is ultimately davis decision to make,nash heavy focus on his view of the benefits of proffering should also have included information about the major risks associated with proffering 
the circumstances clearly indicated that davis was unaware that the statements could be used against him if he had to stand trial and that he had some personal considerations that made it difficult for him to comply with the requirement of the plea that he testify against his siblings.by ignoring these pertinent circumstances,nash performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.
our case law acknowledging that attorneys sometimes have strategic reasons for decisions that are later proven to be unsuccessful is inapposite in this case because nash could have had no appropriate strategic reason for failing to inform his client of the risks of proffering.see,united states berkovich,cir a ctions or omissions that might be considered sound trial strategy do not constitute ineffective assistance.internal quotation marks omitted see also united states bayless,cir finding that counsel decision not to file timely motion for recusal was not unreasonable because it might have been based on strategic considerations.the government argument that nash did not inform davis in part because davis did not appear very anxious before his proffer session,is also unavailing in light of the fact that davis was unaware of the risks he was about to take in proffering.
based on the above considerations,we hold that the performance of davis counsel was objectively unreasonable and that any holding to the contrary would be an unreasonable application of the first prong of the supreme court strickland test.
ii.strickland second prong 
while we conclude davis should prevail with respect to strickland first prong,he must also establish that he was prejudiced by his counsel ineffective assistance.strickland,at.the burden is on the defendant to sh
