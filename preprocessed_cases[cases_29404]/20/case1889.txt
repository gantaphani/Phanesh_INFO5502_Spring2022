the petitioner,derryle mcdowell,was convicted of sexual assault,kidnapping and armed robbery and was sentenced to years in prison.at trial,mcdowell trial counsel had him testify in a narrative form rather than lead him through a question and answer format.in considering mcdowell motion,the wisconsin supreme court applied strickland washington,d,and determined that mcdowell trial counsel decision to have mcdowell testify in a narrative format without knowing that he would testify untruthfully and without notifying mcdowell of his decision to do so was deficient,but still denied relief finding no prejudice.the federal district court also denied the petition,holding,in part,that the wisconsin supreme court decision to apply strickland,instead of presuming prejudice under united states cronic,d,was not contrary to clearly established federal law.we agree and affirm the denial of mcdowell petition.
background 
on april,an woman was sexually assaulted by two men near a building at west burleigh street in milwaukee.after the assault,the victim spat ejaculate onto the ground.although the victim could not identify her attackers,the state based its case against the defendant derryle mcdowell on evidence collected from the victim body,clothing and the scene.namely,the police recovered a sample of the victim saliva mixed with semen containing mcdowell dna.
this appeal primarily concerns mcdowell testimony at trial.on the third day of trial,after the state had rested,mcdowell counsel,attorney ronald langford,expressed reservations to the court about his ability to effectively proceed as counsel and asked to withdraw.specifically,he implied that his concerns related to the possibility that mcdowell would testify untruthfully.the trial court advised attorney langford of two options he could recommend to mcdowell that he not testify if his intended account was untrue,or take the middle ground by calling mcdowell to testify in narrative form.at.attorney langford request to withdraw from the case was denied.after a short break,attorney langford informed the court that 
judge,i have no reason to believe in light of what mcdowell has told me that he will not get up there and testify as to the truth.therefore when he takes the stand i will be asking him questions,specific questions with respect to his testimony before this jury.
attorney langford then gave his opening statement,in which he told the jury that mcdowell would testify that he never assaulted the victim and that the area where the crime took place was behind the building where his father lived.counsel further explained that mcdowell had been in the area the night before the assault,had oral sex with his girlfriend and had ejaculated,which would account for his semen being found at the scene.
after attorney langford completed his opening statement,mcdowell took the stand.shortly thereafter,while mcdowell was still on the stand,attorney langford received a note from the public defender office which stated tyroler an appellate attorney in the office of the state public defender says go with narrative.tell that to the client.it must be by narrative.at.mcdowell counsel began his examination in the question and answer format,asking three questions about mcdowell age and residence.he then stated,mcdowell,i want you to look at this jury and tell this jury about the events of april and of.take your time and speak loudly and clearly,please.at.
the court,apparently confused by this change of plans,called a sidebar conference,after which the court instructed the jury not to consider the opening statements or closing statements of counsel as evidence and directed mcdowell counsel to restate the question.attorney langford said,again,mcdowell,take your time and tell this jury what you would like for them to know regarding the allegations against you beginning with where you were and what you were doing on april,through the early morning hours of april.proceed,please.at.in brief,mcdowell testified that he and his girlfriend,sunshine,fooled around and had oral sex behind his father apartment the evening of april.his father caught them in the alley and became angry.he and his father eventually drove sunshine home,returned to the house later that evening and went to bed.mcdowell claims that some key facts were missing from his account which could have been solicited in a question and answer format.the jury ultimately found mcdowell guilty of one count of armed robbery,one count of kidnapping and five counts of first degree sexual assault with the use of a weapon.he was sentenced to years in prison and forty years of probation.
mcdowell filed a motion in the circuit court claiming ineffective assistance of counsel.the circuit court held a machner hearing to determine the validity of mcdowell claim at the hearing,attorney langford testified that he initially believed that mcdowell was lying about this sexual activity with his girlfriend.he noted inconsistencies between their accounts,the fact that mcdowell introduced this theory of defense only after learning about the dna evidence and also recounted a conversation with mcdowell in which mcdowell told him,i say what i need to say to help myself out and if i have to say something untruthful,i say that.at.in preparation for mcdowell taking the stand,attorney langford testified that he warned mcdowell that he might need to testify in a narrative form and,if he did,that mcdowell should testify to everything he would want the jury to know because it would be his only opportunity.attorney langford also testified that he had intended to lead mcdowell through questions,but that his plan later changed when he received the note from the public defender office.attorney langford conceded that he did so without advising mcdowell of the change and without having personally concluded that mcdowell intended to lie.
the circuit court denied mcdowell petition,finding that mcdowell counsel had reacted in a way that best preserved his client rights and discharged his own ethical responsibilities,and that the outcome of the trial would not have been different in light of the dna evidence if mcdowell had testified instead in a question and answer format.see state mcdowell.the wisconsin court of appeals affirmed the circuit court denial of mcdowell petition however,the court of appeals,unlike the circuit court,found attorney langford performance to be deficient because he did not know that mcdowell would testify untruthfully when he switched to a form of narrative testimony and failed to inform mcdowell of the change of plans.id.at.regardless,the court of appeals,like the circuit court,did not find mcdowell to have been prejudiced by this error.id.at.the wisconsin supreme court affirmed the denial of mcdowell petition on the same ground as that of the court of appeals.state mcdowell.
mcdowell then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the eastern district of wisconsin.the district court denied the petition finding that the wisconsin supreme court determination that mcdowell was not prejudiced by his trial counsel performance was not contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states.mcdowell kingston,wl,at.the district court certified the following question for our review 
were the state court decisions rejecting petitioner sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claim contrary to clearly established federal law within the meaning of d 
at.in other words,we consider in the present case whether the wisconsin supreme court decision to apply strickland,which requires a showing of prejudice,instead of cronic,where prejudice is presumed,was contrary to clearly established federal law.
ii.discussion 
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa governs our review of mcdowell petition for writ of habeas corpus.relevant for this review,a federal court can grant relief only if the state court decision was contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as det
