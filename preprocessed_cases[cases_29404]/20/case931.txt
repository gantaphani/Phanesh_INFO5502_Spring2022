nathan wayne bowie petitions this court for review of the district court denial of his petition under for relief from the sentences of death he received in connection with two north carolina murder convictions.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
the unchallenged facts adduced at trial and found by the state court follow.on may,at around,the uncle,william barfield bowie william,and aunt,rochelle bowie rochelle,of nathan wayne bowie bowie approached nelson shuford shuford and calvin wilson wilson in the street.an argument ensued between rochelle and shuford.seeing acquaintances of shuford gathering,william and rochelle walked away from the argument.they then heard shots fired from behind them.rochelle believed that shuford and wilson were shooting at her,but in fact wilson was shooting into the air.
william and rochelle returned to rochelle residence,where william attempted to contact bowie.reaching bowie mother by telephone,william left a message for bowie,explaining what had transpired and asking bowie to meet him at rochelle residence as soon as possible.shortly thereafter,bowie,then old,arrived,carrying a firearm.bowie explained,i had a funny feeling something was going to go down so i brought the gun.william then retrieved a firearm and checked it for bullets.bowie was overheard telling william,i know where he live s.he live s in newton.id.alteration in original.shuford in fact resided in newton.
early the next morning,bowie and william left rochelle house.around,bowie was seen pounding on the front door of shuford residence in newton,calling for shuford to come out,claiming to be neal from charlotte.finding shuford not at home,bowie left,angry and cursing,and sped away in his truck.three witnesses,including two who knew bowie from high school,identified bowie as the man banging on shuford door.
approximately two hours later,shuford and wilson were standing and socializing with four friends in the yard of phillip link.according to multiple eyewitnesses,bowie and william appeared from behind a building and approached the group.shuford asked,w hat up,man,then bowie and william began firing,killing shuford and wilson.
later forensics revealed that shuford had been shot once in the chest by a bullet,dying instantly.wilson was shot in the chest with a bullet and in the head with a bullet.one of the gunshot wounds was delivered after wilson was already on the ground suffering from the other.wilson died several days later from the head wound.neither victim was armed at the time of the shootings,though wilson gun was some distance away in the trunk of his car.
immediately after the killings,bowie and william fled to philadelphia,where they were soon apprehended and charged with the murders.bowie and william were tried together,each for two counts of murder,in the catawba county superior court in north carolina.bowie was represented at trial by two attorneys thomas portwood,portwood and mark killian killian.portwood had a general practice that included criminal work.he had previously represented several capital defendants.it was later revealed that portwood struggled with alcohol dependence during his representation of bowie killian was a young attorney from a firm that engaged primarily in civil matters and had no capital experience.before trial,the two attorneys negotiated a plea offer for bowie in which bowie would have pleaded guilty to two counts of murder,for which he would have received life imprisonment but been spared a potential death sentence.bowie declined the proffered plea agreement,electing instead to go to trial.
a number of witnesses testified at trial as to the essential facts surrounding the killings.for example,disinterested eyewitnesses testified to bowie and william discussion and handling of firearms the night before the killings,to bowie pounding on shuford door,and to the killings themselves.in addition to the undisputed testimony of those witnesses,the government read into evidence two statements that are at issue in this appeal.
the government introduced a voluntary statement that codefendant william had given to police shortly after his arrest.in the statement,william explained that either shuford or wilson took jewelry from rochelle house,which prompted the argument in the street the night before the murders.the next day,william continued,he met up with someone at rochelle house.the two left together in search of shuford and wilson,whom they found in link yard.william and shuford started arguing.william stated that he heard a shot issue from behind him and saw shuford fall to the ground.william explained that he panicked,pulled out his own firearm and fired two rounds in the direction of shuford and wilson before the gun jammed.he heard another shot,then began to run,hearing one final shot behind him as he escaped the scene.william insisted to police that he had brought his gun with him that morning only as a precaution,knowing that at least one of the men had been armed the night before,and that he did not intend to kill anyone.bowie counsel made no objection to the admission of the statement,nor did they ask that a limiting instruction be provided to ensure the jury did not consider the statement to implicate bowie.
the government also introduced a statement that rochelle had provided to investigators on the night of the murders.bowie objected to admission of the statement on the ground,inter alia,that it would violate his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment the trial court overruled the objection and allowed the statement to be admitted under rule of the north carolina rules of evidence,governing admission of statements made by unavailable witnesses.
rochelle explained in her statement that she had argued with shuford regarding the location of her missing jewelry.she confirmed the testimony of other witnesses that bowie and william handled firearms that night at her house.she also stated that the duo drove off the next morning in bowie truck,returning a few hours later in haste to take rochelle and her children to stay with a relative.en route,either bowie or william told her,w e got them.bowie and william told her they were going to philadelphia.
in the face of the essentially undisputed testimony at trial that bowie and william shot shuford and wilson,bowie counsel focused their closing statements on the government supposed failure to prove premeditation,asking the jury to return verdicts for murder.the jury nevertheless found bowie and william guilty of both counts of murder under the theory of acting in concert.
at sentencing,killian took the lead in representing bowie.he presented the testimony of six witnesses bowie mother,joan hunt his former social worker from the catawba county department of social services dss,joanne sigmon two of his high school football coaches his high school principal and his teacher.joan hunt testified that during bowie childhood she was a single parent with no permanent address,staying where she could for the first several years of his life.she explained that bowie had been sexually abused as a child by her mother boyfriend.she admitted that she abused heroin,cocaine and other drugs during that time,on occasion using bowie to consummate transactions with a local dealer on her behalf.she testified that she sought treatment for her drug addictions more than once,with bowie ultimately moving to the sipes orchard home sipes,an orphanage,so she could devote herself to treatment.she explained that bowie biological father was absent for much of his childhood serving a jail sentence for a gang war murder.
joanne sigmon testified that she had supervised bowie foster care from age twelve to age nineteen,one year prior to the murders.she explained that bowie was generally,and that she developed a close relationship with him over his years in the foster system.for example,she and her family hosted a graduation party for him,and she made a personal loan to him to help him buy a truck.the other witnesses also testified positively about bowie character,commenting on his popularity in school,his modest academic success,and his willingness to learn from his mistakes on the football field.
three statutory aggravating factors were submitted to the jury,which found two to exist that each murder was committed while the defendant was engaged in the commission of any other homicide.e and that each murder was part of a course of conduct in which the defendant engaged and which included the commission by the defendant of other crimes of violence against another person or persons,id.e the jury was also asked to consider fifteen mitigating factors.it found the statutory mitigating factor that bowie ha d no significant history of prior criminal activity,id.f.the jury also found nine mitigating factors,focusing primarily on the hardships bowie suffered throughout his childhood,such as the paucity of reliable parental support available to him,and on his successes in high school.the jury rejected the proffered mitigating factors relating to bowie residency at sipes,finding them not to have mitigating value.the jury recommended sentences of death for both murder convictions,and the trial court entered judgment in accordance with those recommendations 
through the same counsel,bowie exhausted his direct appeals.state bowie,cert.denied.he then filed a motion for appropriate relief mar in the superior court for catawba county the mar court.bowie mar,as later amended,put forth,inter alia,three claims that counsel rendered ineffective assistance,in failing to investigate certain aspects of bowie background,including his history,in preparation for sentencing failing to object to the admission of william statement,or,alternatively,failing to request an instruction limiting its relevance to william guilt and failing to appeal the admission of rochelle statement as violative of the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.the mar court denied all three claims.bowie petitions for writ of certiorari in the north carolina supreme court,state bowie,and in the united states supreme court,bowie north carolina,d,were both denied.
bowie then turned to the federal courts for relief,filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the western district of north carolina.the district court found that counsel had been deficient in failing to investigate bowie background properly before selecting their sentencing strategy,and that the mar court had erred in finding otherwise the district court found that such failure did not prejudice bowie,however,and,finding no other mar court error,denied the petition.bowie was ultimately granted a certificate of appealability as to all three issues.
we review de novo the district court denial of bowie petition for a writ of habeas corpus,applying the same standards as did the district court.robinson polk,cir.the and effective death penalty act aedpa,governs our consideration of bowie challenges to his sentence.
for claims adjudicated on the merits in state court,a writ of habeas corpus should be granted under aedpa if such adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it either applies a legal rule that contradicts prior supreme court holdings or reaches a conclusion different from that of the supreme court on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.buckner polk,cir quoting williams taylor,d.a decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it unreasonably applies a supreme court precedent to the facts of the petitioner claim.id.quoting williams,at.
all three of bowie claims focus on the allegedly ineffective assistance of counsel he received at sentencing or on direct appeal.claims that counsel provided ineffective assistance are governed by the familiar test set forth in strickland washington,d.to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,a petitioner must show both that counsel performance was deficient and the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.id.at.in light of the deferential standard of review under aedpa,we are limited to determining whether,for each ineffective assistance claim,the mar court reached a decision contrary to,or unreasonably applied,supreme court precedent.
we now analyze each of bowie ineffective assistance of counsel claims.
bowie primary argument is that his counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to investigate and present at sentencing mitigating evidence contained in the records of his stay at sipes,in his county records,and in the records of his involvement with dss and additional mitigating evidence available from witnesses with personal knowledge of bowie character or the events surrounding the murders.had counsel performed such investigation,bowie surmises,they would have submitted three additional statutory mitigating factors to the jury for consideration.see.f the capital felony was committed while the defendant was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance,f the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was impaired,and f the age of the defendant at the time of the crime.he asserts that,had the additional evidence been introduced at trial and the mitigating factors submitted to the jury,there is a reasonable probability that the jury would not have returned a death sentence,and therefore his counsel was constitutionally ineffective.
ordinarily,we would begin our analysis of bowie claim by examining the first prong of strickland,finding counsel performance to be deficient if it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.at.here,however,the government did not challenge in any meaningful way in its brief the district court finding that counsel performance was deficient for purposes of the first prong of strickland.we thus turn directly to the second counsel deficient performance prejudiced bowie at sentencing 
bowie initially presented the failure to investigate issue to the mar court.the mar court scheduled a hearing to review the additional mitigating evidence that allegedly could have been presented but for counsel failure to investigate.at the hearing,bowie again elicited testimony from his mother,joan hunt,and social worker,joanne sigmon,who had both already testified at trial.they testified that bowie began drinking heavily at an early age,showing signs of a substance abuse problem in high school.bowie sister mekia also testified,corroborating the dire circumstances of bowie upbringing.in addition,bowie called a number of current and former sipes employees,who testified that bowie was generally at sipes.they also testified as to an incident in which a sipes employee was terminated for sexually abusing a sipes resident.no evidence was presented to establish that bowie himself was a victim of sexual abuse at sipes.
bowie also called nathan strahl,a clinical and forensic psychiatrist,who opined that bowie suffered from alcohol dependence,cannabis dependence,major depression,disorder and personality disorder,among others,at the time of the murders.strahl explained that individuals with such disorders can be dangerous people,especially when drinking.the state introduced its own medical experts,however,who testified that,at the time of the murders,bowie did not suffer from a mental or emotional disturbance,nor did he lack the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct.
additionally,bowie trial counsel were called to testify at the mar hearing.portwood explained that he had settled upon a sentencing strategy after his first meeting with present bowie in a positive light,focusing on the popularity and accolades he achieved despite a rough upbringing,instead of presenting him as suffering from various problems and dependencies.portwood based this strategy,he explained,on his previous capital experience he had met with success in avoiding a death sentence for a prior client by presenting only positive character evidence.portwood acknowledged,however,that he abused alcohol during the time he was r
