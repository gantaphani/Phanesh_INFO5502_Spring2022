an indiana jury convicted obadyah,formerly known as christopher peterson,of murdering harchand dhaliwal and marie meitzler.after the indiana supreme court affirmed conviction and sentence on direct appeal and denied collateral relief,the district court granted his petition for writ of habeas corpus.on appeal,we find the indiana supreme court determination that the prosecutor did not violate fifth amendment rights during his closing argument to be an unreasonable determination in light of the evidence.in addition,we find the state court determination of the constitutional error in case an unreasonable application of,federal law.we,therefore,affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
this case involves the murders of harchand dhaliwal and marie meitzler in december.on january,the lake county,indiana police arrested antwion mcgee in connection with a separate shooting and car theft.based on statements mcgee made while in custody,the police then arrested and interviewed on january in connection with the separate shooting and car theft.during the ensuing police interview,further implicated mcgee in the crimes.once confronted with statements,mcgee accused of being involved with the dhaliwal and meitzler killings and led police to former home,where police found a shotgun and shotgun shells in bedroom.
the police confronted with mcgee statements and the discovery of the shotgun in his closet.before the confrontation,however,the police read his miranda rights,and after the confrontation,the police allowed to speak with his mother.after speaking with his mother,waived his miranda rights the next morning and confessed to his role in the dhaliwal and meitzler shootings.
based on his confession to the police and mcgee cooperation,was charged with the murders of dhaliwal and meitzler,however,recanted his statement to the police,pled not guilty to the charges and proceeded to trial where he chose not to testify in his own defense.just before closing arguments in his trial,attorneys for both sides met for a sidebar with the judge.during the sidebar,the prosecutor expressed an intention to argue to the jury that no evidence had been presented as to why would have given a false confession.attorneys objected to this line of argument as a direct reference to decision not to testify,and the judge agreed that the proposed comments would be inappropriate.the prosecutor ignored the court admonishment,however,and shortly after the sidebar made the following statement to the jury during closing argument 
i told you in the opening statement that the defendant confessed to killing these two people with his shotgun.we proved that.we told you that was the cornerstone of our case and why because it is self evidence sic that no one freely and voluntarily confesses to a murder unless they guilty.let the defendant tell you why somebody would freely and voluntarily confess to 
trial record at.at that moment,the defense attorneys interrupted the prosecutor and objected to the prosecutor argument and moved the court for a mistrial.unabated,the prosecutor continued to speak over the objection stating 
on general,why 
defendant counsel can say why a person can confess to a crime.
trial record at.the court took defense counsels motion for a mistrial under advisement and allowed the prosecutor to continue with his closing argument.the prosecutor then continued to focus the jury attention on the defendant confession 
i said the confessions were the cornerstone of our case because it self evidence sic that no one,anybody,nobody will ever confess to a murder freely and voluntarily unless they commit sic it so if you believe that there is any reason for somebody to admit to murder unless they did it,you there what are the chances that if somebody falsely accuses me of murder that within hours i going to falsely admit to it they do match.i mean it just does make sense.it two things do make sense.
trial record at.the court found that the prosecutor comments were not improper and denied the defendant request for a mistrial.the defendant then asked for a jury instruction admonishing the jury as to the prosecutor comment.the court denied counsel proposed instruction and responded that the instructions already given were more relevant than the instruction proposed,which would only call attention to what the court had already told the jury to disregard.the jury convicted on all charges and recommended that he be sentenced to death.the judge agreed with the jury recommendation and entered judgment accordingly.
in his ensuing direct and collateral appeals,counsel attempted to compile a complete and accurate record of the trial proceedings.counsel was greatly impeded in this effort,however,by the state of the official record.before finishing the process of transcribing her notes,the court reporter from trial resigned as a result of illness.a second court reporter and various specialists worked to complete the transcription,and they ultimately finished the job with significant difficulty and only partial success.the resulting record was replete with lines marked undecipherable and errors both major and minor,as the concurring opinion,infra,indicates.
the indiana supreme court ordered two trial attorneys,the deputy prosecutor,and the trial judge to reconstruct the missing portions of the record as well as they could.if either party objected to any portion of the final version,that party was to inform the court by february.neither side objected,and the court declared the reconstruction process complete on may.
on direct appeal,presented twenty claims.in particular,claimed that reversible error occurred when,during its closing argument,the government directly commented on the defendant decision to exercise his constitutional right not to testify.state,i.citing moore state,in support,the indiana supreme court determined that the jury in the case could not have reasonably interpreted the prosecutor comments as a suggestion to infer guilt from the defendant silence.i,at.the state court concluded that the prosecutor did not commit reversible error and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial and refusing to give an admonishment to the jury.id.the indiana supreme court also affirmed conviction and sentence on collateral review.state,ii.
in his petition for writ of habeas corpus,again raised many issues,but the district court only addressed two comments made by the prosecutor during closing argument and the concerns regarding the accuracy of the trial transcript.in granting petition,the district court held that the prosecutor comments during closing argument constituted a violation of rights,davis,d,iii,and that the indiana supreme court did not reasonably apply united states supreme court precedent when it ruled on fifth amendment claim or when it ruled that any alleged fifth amendment violation was harmless error.id.at.in addition,the district court found that the inadequacy of the state trial court record constituted a due process violation.id.at.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court grant of petition for habeas relief de novo.barrow uchtman,cir.a federal court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.a.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,pub,stat,substantially amended the statutory law governing federal review of habeas corpus petitions.see,and.the amendments place a new constraint on the ability of a federal court to grant habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner with respect to claims adjudicated on the merits in state court.williams taylor,d.a federal court can not grant a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by a person in state custody with regard to any claim that was rejected on the merits by the state court unless the adjudication of the claim in state court either 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.a state court factual findings are presumed correct,and the petitioner has the burden of rebutting them with clear and convincing evidence.e.
a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decided a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams,at.a state court decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.
in evaluating whether the state court made an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence we must be objectively convinced that the record before the state court does not support the state court findings in question.under this framework,an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence can occur where the finding is unsupported by sufficient evidence.see,wiggins smith,d ward sternes,cir.
in the instant case,two issues are before us fifth amendment claim relating to the prosecutor comments during closing argument and his due process claim relating to the veracity and accuracy of the trial transcript.both issues were adjudicated on the merits by the indiana supreme court,but because we find sufficient grounds to affirm the district court grant of the writ on fifth amendment claim,we will not reach his due process claim.
fifth amendment rights 
claims that the prosecutor comments during closing argument violated his fifth amendment privilege not to be compelled to testify.as the supreme court has made clear,where the prosecutor on his own initiative asks the jury to draw an adverse inference from a defendant silence,the privilege against compulsory is violated.united states robinson,d.in addition,indirect references to the defendant failure to testify are constitutionally impermissible if the language used was manifestly intended to be or was of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the defendant failure to testify.united states ex rel.burke greer,cir quoting united states lyon,cir.
in addressing fifth amendment claim,the indiana supreme court looked to whether the prosecutor comments in this case could reasonably be interpreted by the jury as an invitation to draw an adverse inference from the defendant silence,i,at.the state court found as follows 
the jury in this case could not reasonably have interpreted the prosecutor comments as suggestion to infer guilt from the defendant silence.while the prosecutor could have been more articulate,it is clear that he was responding to any possible implications that the defendant confession was less than voluntary.his challenge to defense counsel was made to illustrate that the only reason a defendant would confess to a crime he did not commit would be because of coercion or duress.he then pointed out that the state presented substantial evidence that the confession was not the result of coercion or duress.consequently,he was arguing that the confession should be taken by the jury as direct evidence of the defendant guilt.the theme of the state argument was a challenge directed at defense counsel which pointed out the uncontradicted nature of the state evidence of voluntariness and invited defense counsel to explain,in its closing argument,any contrary conclusions.
i,at.we find that the indiana supreme court determination of fifth amendment right is not a decision contrary to or based upon an unreasonable application of federal law.instead,we find that its determination that the jury in case could not have reasonably interpreted the prosecutor comments as a suggestion to infer guilt from the defendant silence an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.
the indiana supreme court decision denying fifth amendment claim was based upon its factual determination that the prosecutor comment,let the defendant tell you was not directed at individually,but,a challenge directed at defense counsel that,invited defense counsel to explain,in its closing argument,why the jury should not take the confession as valid.i,at.we find this determination by the indiana supreme court unsupported by sufficient evidence.just seconds before the prosecutor invited the jury to let the defendant tell you,the prosecutor told the jury that the defendant confessed to killing these two people with his shotgun.trial record at,quoted in iii,d at.specifically,the prosecutor stated 
i told you in the opening statement that the defendant confessed to killing these two people with his shotgun.we proved that.we told you that was the cornerstone of our case and why because it is self evidence sic that no one freely and voluntarily confesses to a murder unless they guilty.let the defendant tell you why somebody would freely and voluntarily confess 
id.over an objection from defense counsel,the prosecutor further compounded his challenge to by continuing to focus the jury attention on the defendant confession 
i said the confessions were the cornerstone of our case because it self evidence sic that no one,anybody,nobody will ever confess to a murder freely and voluntarily unless they commit sic it so if you believe that there is any reason for somebody to admit to murder unless they did it,you there what are the chances that if somebody falsely accuses me of murder that within hours i going to falsely admit to it they do match.i mean it just does make sense.it two things do make sense.
trial record at.without a doubt,the references in this argument to the defendant were aimed at alone and not at his counsel.thus,it was at least reasonable for the jurors to interpret the prosecutor recommendation to let the defendant tell you as a reference to individually,and,therefore unreasonable for the indiana supreme court to determine that no juror could have reasonably made this logical jump.
in following with the legal maxim noscitur a sociis that a term can be properly defined by interpreting the text surrounding that term,we find that the prosecutor natural progression of references including his challenge,let the defendant tell you was purposeful,directed at individually,and intended to guide jurors to an impermissible inference under the fifth amendment.the progression of the prosecutor words constitute clear and convincing evidence rebutting the indiana supreme court finding that the jury in this case could not reasonably have interpreted the prosecutor comments as a suggestion to infer guilt from the defendant silence.
additional clear and convincing evidence rebutting the state court finding can be found by analyzing how the prosecutor used the term defendant throughout its entire closing argument.the district court also reviewed how the prosecutor used the term defendant throughout the closing argument and by the district court count,in the portion of the argument that preceded the suspect language,the prosecutor used the defendant to refer to alone seven and used the term to refer to counsel only once our own independent review reveals an additional instance in which the prosecutor used the defendant to refer to one where the prosecutor use of the word defendant was unclear and six in which the prosecutor referred to a generic or hypothetical defendant 
in the portion of the argument that followed,let the defendant tell you,the district court located instances in which the prosecutor used the defendant to refer to alone compared to only four instances where the defendant meant counsel we agree with the district court assessment of the record,and we have located two additional instances in which the prosecutor referred to individually as the defendant one in which the prosecutor referred to a generic or hypothetical and one case where we find
