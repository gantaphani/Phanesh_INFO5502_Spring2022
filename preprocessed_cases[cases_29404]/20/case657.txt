background 
harris was indicted in june for having murdered kristin huggins due to the pervasive publicity surrounding the murder and his arrest,harris moved the trial court to transfer his case from mercer county,new jersey,where the crime was committed,to a different venue or,in the alternative,for the impanelment of a foreign jury.more specifically,harris argued that a fair trial could not be had in mercer county because of highly prejudicial media coverage by two trentonian and the trenton had a combined circulation in mercer county of about.app at.
the trial court agreed with harris that the likelihood that the taint from these sources would permeat e the trial could not be ignored.app at.the trial court took particular note that the intensity of the newspaper coverage was complicated by the crusade of the trentonian which generated a stream of invective that was constant and prolonged and sensationalized,app at,and which pander ed to its readers worst instincts,app at therefore,although the trial court denied harris motion for a change of venue,it granted his motion to impanel a foreign jury.
harris filed an interlocutory appeal to challenge the trial court decision to impanel a jury from hunterdon county,and the state the trial court decision to impanel a foreign jury in the first instance,arguing that it was unnecessary.the superior court of new jersey,appellate division,held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that prejudice in mercer county may be presumed due to pretrial publicity,and affirmed the trial court decision that th e case should be tried before a foreign jury.state harris,harris i.however,the appellate division also held that the trial court should have considered whether the racial demographics of the county from which it would draw the new jury pool were comparable to the racial demographics of the community in which the crime was committed,and further found that the trial court had abused its discretion in selecting hunterdon county as the source of the jury pool because the racial demographics of hunterdon county differed markedly from those of mercer county.id.at.it then remanded for further proceedings.id.at.
on remand,the trial judge decided to impanel jurors from burlington county,a county contiguous to mercer county,where the racial demographics generally matched those of mercer county,and where the combined readership of the trentonian and the trenton times was only around,divided fairly evenly between the two.see state harris,harris ii.the jury voir dire was conducted in burlington county.during jury selection,harris moved the trial court to change venue from mercer county to burlington county.in support of this motion,harris submitted evidence that,among other things,the trentonian was sold at sites near the mercer courthouse.the trial court denied harris motion.instead,each day of trial the jurors were transported by bus from the burlington courthouse to the courthouse in mercer.meanwhile,the inflammatory publicity continued throughout the trial.state harris,harris iv.
harris was convicted and the jury recommended that he be sentenced to death.harris ii,at.the new jersey supreme court affirmed harris conviction and the jury recommended death sentence.id.at.the new jersey supreme court held,in part,that the selection of a jury composed of residents,and the trial court general questioning of the jurors during the trial concerning any exposure to trial publicity sufficiently ensured that defendant trial was free of extraneous influences.id.at.more specifically,the court noted that in the past it had approved the use of a foreign jury as a trial management technique to ensure that a defendant right to an impartial jury is not compromised,id.at,and it observed that a change of venue has the same benefits and drawbacks as the impanelling of a foreign jury since both methods utilize jurors from communities where publicity may be less intense,id.quoting state williams.although the harris ii court affirmed harris conviction,it stated that w hen a capital case is accompanied by a stream of public invective such as surrounded this case,it occasions us to reconsider our precedent,and held that i n future capital cases a court should change the venue of a capital trial when there is a realistic likelihood that presumptively prejudicial publicity will continue during the conduct of a trial,id.at.later,the new jersey supreme court undertook a separate proportionality review of the recommended death sentence and concluded that harris sentence was not disproportionate compared to other cases.state harris,harris ii.
harris next petitioned for post conviction relief,making multiple claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and assorted other challenges to the validity of his conviction and sentence.harris iv,at.his petition was eventually reviewed de novo and denied by the new jersey supreme court id.at.
thereafter,harris filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the new jersey district court.see harris cathel,civ.aet,wl,at,harris v.while the resolution of his petition was pending,new jersey repealed the death penalty and new jersey governor jon corzine commuted harris death sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.see id.at.harris thereafter abandoned all of his arguments based on the imposition of the death penalty,and pressed only the following claims that flow from the sixth amendment guarantee of a fair trial in light of the pretrial publicity surrounding the case,the trial court use of a foreign jury deprived him of a fair trial the trial court should have taken more extensive precautions to ensure that the impaneled jurors were not infected by the publicity the trial court should have held a hearing to explore allegations of contact between jurors and a former public defender the trial court should have allowed harris to call a witness who would have testified that gloria dunn,who was harris accomplice in the murder of kristin huggins and who was the state primary witness against harris,was a violent person and his counsel was ineffective.id.at.the district court rejected all of harris arguments,denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,and denied harris a certificate of appealability.id.at.this court granted harris petition for a certificate of appealability,finding that the sole claim presented on appeal was adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further,app.at quoting cockrell,and instructed the parties to brief the issue of whether the new jersey supreme court held contrary to,or unreasonably applied,clearly established federal law,see d,in affirming the trial court decision to impanel a foreign jury rather than transfer the case to a different venue in light of the pretrial publicity that surrounded the case,app at 
because this case arises from a state court proceeding in which the merits of harris sole claim on appeal were adjudicated,the standards established by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa apply.see.harris is not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus unless the state proceedings resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence
