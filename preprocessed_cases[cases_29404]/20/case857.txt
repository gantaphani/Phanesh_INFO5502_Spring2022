we granted a certificate of appealability in this case to consider the district court dismissal of jerome steven gordon petition for a writ of habeas corpus.gordon alleges that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal when instructed to do so and for not consulting with him about an appeal.we hold that gordon properly exhausted his state remedies the state court did not adjudicate gordon claim on the merits the district court consequently owed no deference to the state court denial of gordon petition and the district court applied the wrong standard in deciding whether to hold an evidentiary hearing.we therefore reverse and remand.
in,gordon pleaded no contest in a virginia circuit court to one count each of carnal knowledge and soliciting the production of child pornography,pursuant to a plea agreement that did not include a waiver of appellate or rights.the court sentenced him to years in prison with eight years suspended.mufeed said represented gordon at the plea and sentencing hearings.gordon did not timely file a direct appeal.
gordon did,however,pursue collateral relief.in state court,he filed a pro se habeas corpus petition alleging ineffective assistance of counsel at his sentencing hearing.while his petition was pending,gordon moved for leave to amend,seeking to add another claim,this one alleging that his attorney failed to file an appeal when asked to do so and that gordon wrote to said asking for an appeal,but never got any response.he requested an evidentiary hearing and appointment of counsel.gordon later filed a motion to supplement his petition with additional supporting facts,including that he asked said about a possible appeal.
the warden moved to dismiss the petition and attached an affidavit from said.gordon opposed the motion and again moved for leave to amend.to these filings he attached a sworn affidavit.the state court granted gordon various motions for leave to amend but denied gordon request for counsel and,without an evidentiary hearing,dismissed gordon petition.
all told,gordon petition raised six claims.the state court concluded on the first five all related to counsel performance at the sentencing hearing that gordon failed to show deficient performance and prejudice.on the sixth claim,the court found that gordon had not shown deficient performance because gordon had merely inquired about an appeal,not directly requested one.the state court addressed counsel duty to file an appeal when directed to do so,but said nothing about counsel duty to consult.the supreme court of virginia denied gordon petition for appeal.
gordon then filed a pro se habeas corpus petition in the district court.without an evidentiary hearing,the court dismissed gordon petition based on the state court reasoning.gordon appealed,and we granted a certificate of appealability to consider whether,in light of roe flores ortega,d,and united states cooper,cir,counsel was ineffective for not filing a notice of appeal.order,gordon braxton,cir.
our review of the district court dismissal of gordon habeas petition is de novo.teleguz pearson,cir.
to prevail on an claim,a defendant must show that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that counsel deficient performance prejudiced him.strickland washington,d.gordon claim implicates two related duties entrusted to criminal defense attorneys.first,counsel must file a notice of appeal when instructed by her client to do so.flores ortega,at.second,even if the client does not expressly request an appeal,counsel must consult with her client about an appeal when a rational defendant would want to appeal or her client expresses an interest in appealing.cooper,at.dereliction in either duty constitutes deficient performance.see flores ortega,at,cooper,at.a defendant establishes prejudice when he demonstrates a reasonable probability that he would have filed an appeal but for counsel failure to file or consult.flores ortega,at.the defendant need not show that his appeal has merit.id.at.
we begin with the warden argument that gordon did not exhaust his state remedies.the warden does not dispute that gordon properly alleged that said failed to file a notice of appeal.but,according to the warden,gordon did not exhaust his contention that said failed to consult with him about an appeal because gordon did not identify it as a separate claim.we disagree.
state prisoners like gordon must exhaust their state remedies before filing a habeas petition in federal court.b.the purpose of the exhaustion requirement is to giv e the state the opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of its prisoners federal rights.jones sussex i state prison,cir quoting baldwin reese,d.
a habeas petitioner meets the exhaustion requirement by fairly present ing his claim in each appropriate state court,thereby alerting that court to the federal nature of the claim.reese,at quoting duncan henry,d.to satisfy his burden,the petitioner must show that both the operative facts and the controlling legal principles were presented to the state court.jones,at alteration omitted quoting baker corcoran,cir.
we hold that gordon fairly presented the issue in state court.in its decision granting the warden motion to dismiss,the state court determined that gordon petition raised the issue of counsel duty to file a notice of appeal,but found that gordon never expressly requested an appeal.rather,said the court,gordon merely asked counsel is there anything else we can do from this point alterations in original quoting gordon affidavit.but by inquiring about what could be done after being sentenced,gordon was indicating his interest in appealing which,at a minimum,triggered counsel separate duty to consult.the state court,however,said nothing at all about this aspect of said performance.
in addition,the parties filings before the state court referred to strickland,flores ortega,and miles sheriff.as noted earlier,strickland provides the familiar test for a federal sixth amendment claim.at.flores ortega discusses both the duty to consult and the duty to file as falling along a spectrum.at.and in miles,the supreme court of virginia discusses strickland and flores ortega in detail and mentions both the duty to consult and the duty to file.at.this is not unusual,as courts often address both the duty to consult and duty to file when petitioners allege that they were denied their right to appeal because of counsel ineffective assistance.
for example,in united states poindexter,the petitioner alleged that his attorney rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance when he failed to file a timely notice of appeal after being unequivocally instructed to do so,cir.we remanded for an evidentiary hearing and directed the district court to first determine whether poindexter unequivocally instructed his attorney to file a notice of appeal,and,if not,determine if poindexter met his burden on a theory.id.at see also,thompson united states,cir finding no clear error in the district court decision to credit counsel testimony that his client did not expressly request an appeal and then discussing counsel duty to consult gomez diaz united states,cir finding the pleadings unclear as to whether the petitioner expressly requested an appeal but concluding that the pleadings,if true,supported counsel having a duty to consult united states witherspoon,cir declining to decide whether the petitioner expressly requested an appeal because the record showed that,at a minimum,the petitioner expressed an interest in appealing that triggered counsel duty to consult.
thus,on these facts,we reject the warden contention that gordon failed to present his theory and hold,instead,that gordon exhausted his state remedies 
we next consider what standard of review applies to the state court dismissal of gordon petition.the district court looked to the highly deferential standard in d,as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.we review this choice de novo.winston kelly winston i,cir.
