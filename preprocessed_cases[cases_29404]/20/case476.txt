darnell deberry seeks habeas relief based on a batson claim centering on peremptory challenges to four jurors.see batson kentucky,d.the batson court held that the equal protection clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race or on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable impartially to consider the state case against a black defendant,id.at,and defined a process for assessing a claim of racial bias in a peremptory challenge,id.at.first,the defendant must allege facts suggesting that purposeful discrimination has occurred.id.at.once the defendant has made out this prima facie case,the prosecutor must articulate a neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried.id.at.the trial court then will have the duty to determine if the defendant has established purposeful discrimination.id.
because the record initially suggested that the trial judge erred in applying batson,judge leonard sand directed a reconstruction hearing before magistrate judge cheryl pollak.deberry portuondo,wl,deberry ii.at that hearing,the trial judge,new york supreme court justice edward pincus,testified to the factual findings he made at trial and to his understanding and application of batson.applying the deferential standard of review imposed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,judge sand held that justice pincus reasonably applied batson and that his credibility findings were entitled to deference and therefore denied the writ.deberry portuondo,d deberry iii.we affirm.
background 
proceedings in the state courts 
a grand jury charged deberry and a,eric jeffrey,with murder in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the second and third degrees.at trial,the prosecutor,jeff kern,exercised three peremptory challenges to the first panel of prospective jurors without objection from defense counsel.during the first phase of the second round,kern peremptorily challenged three additional.archibald,juror number three smith,juror number seven,and buckner,juror number eight.jeffrey attorney,george sheinberg,then lodged a batson challenge,claiming that e very challenge the people have taken first round and in this round have been individuals who are black.deberry attorney,michael harrison,joined in sheinberg argument.justice pincus said,without contradiction from defense counsel,i believe we do have black jurors.the judge also noted that defendants had not challenged the peremptories that the prosecutor exercised in the first round.sheinberg responded,i would raise it the first challenge.
without explicitly determining whether the defendants had established a prima facie basis for a batson challenge,justice pincus required the prosecutor to offer a basis for challenging each of the three jurors he excused in the second round.the prosecutor explained the challenge to archibald as related to archibald age,saying that he just was comfortable having someone years old judging somebody of similar age.kern also indicated that he had kept other younger jurors on the panel.sheinberg argued that archibald youth was not an appropriate basis for a challenge.justice pincus found the challenge to be appropriate in part,because archibald had said that his youth would help him relate to the defendants.sheinberg replied,all right,how about smith.deberry attorney,harrison,made no response.kern conceded that smith law enforcement background would ordinarily make her an attractive juror for the prosecution,but he claimed that he found smith to be stubborn,somewhat intractable so that if i did convince her or she was skeptical of any part of my case,she is the type of person that may actually hang up the jury.the judge again accepted kern proffered reason,and this time neither defense counsel offered further argument.
kern asserted reasons for excusing buckner were less well defined than his reasons for excusing the first two jurors.he first said,i am going to admit i will be hard pressed to find a reason,but added,i did think her responses were as ringing as i expected.the prosecutor also explained that he had not had sufficient time to question this panel,but he declined the judge offer to recall buckner for further questioning.later kern added that buckner was probably between and fifty,there were women on the jury in that age range,and he was trying to achieve a balanced age range.he further explained that he was just not happy with buckner and argued that because the victim was,he had no motive to knock black people off the jury.justice pincus held that in light of the articulate reasons kern offered for challenging smith and archibald,the plaintiffs had not established a pattern with respect to buckner.however,the judge also indicated that u nhappiness ordinarily would not suffice as a reason for a challenge that is alleged to be discriminatory.neither defense counsel offered any further argument with respect to buckner,and jury selection proceeded to a second phase of the second round.
during the second phase,kern challenged one juror,an woman,hanson.sheinberg,acting for jeffrey,again lodged a batson objection.this time deberry attorney did not join.justice pincus ruled that because he had not found a pattern,he saw no basis for requiring kern to give reasons for challenging hanson.sheinberg objected that a pattern had been established because the only black person is being challenged and there are no other blacks on this jury.in response to a request for clarification from the judge,sheinberg clarified that he meant no o n this selection.the judge then reiterated his ruling that a pattern had not been established.defense counsel made no further argument.
after hearing the evidence,the jury found both defendants guilty of murder in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.justice pincus sentenced deberry to a term of imprisonment of years to life.
deberry appealed to the new york supreme court,appellate division,second department.he claimed two evidentiary errors,complained about inflammatory statements in the prosecutor summation,argued that his sentence was excessive,and contended that justice pincus erred in his application of batson.the appellate division affirmed the conviction and sentence.see people deberry,dep t deberry i.the court rejected the evidentiary and excessive sentence claims on the merits and added the following sentence the defendant remaining contentions are either unpreserved for appellate review see,people allen,people buckley,people balls,or are without merit.id.at.deberry sought leave to appeal from judge titone of the new york court of appeals,who denied his application.later in,the trial court denied deberry motion to set aside his conviction,which was made pursuant to new york criminal procedure law.in january,the appellate division,second department,affirmed.
district court proceedings 
on april,deberry filed a habeas petition in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.the petition included a batson claim as well as other claims not before us on appeal.judge reena raggi,who then served as a district court judge,referred the petition to magistrate judge pollak for report and recommendation.see b b.
on october,after appointing richard levitt to serve as deberry pro bono counsel,judge pollak issued her report and recommendation.with the exception of the batson claim,the magistrate judge recommended denying deberry petition.
addressing the batson claim,judge pollak first rejected respondent claim that the court was procedurally barred from considering the merits of the claim.the procedural bar argument rested on the appellate division holding that the prosecutorial misconduct and batson claims were either unpreserved for appellate review citing allen,buckley,and balls or are without merit,deberry i,at.respondent argued that the particular cases the appellate division cited indicated that it found that each of deberry batson claims was unpreserved for review.judge pollak disagreed,reasoning that it was impossible to determine which of deberry batson claims the state appellate court found to be unpreserved and that,if,as the prosecutor argued,the appellate division found that all of the batson claims and the prosecutorial misconduct claim were procedurally barred,the court would not have added or are without merit to the procedural disposition.she therefore held that the court could consider the merits of the batson challenges.
on the merits,judge pollak held that the state trial court committed at least three errors.first,the trial court failed to explicitly determine whether the explanations for the challenges to archibald and smith were pretextual.second,after finding that the prosecutor explanation for excusing buckner was insufficient,the court erred by revisiting its pattern finding and by assuming that a prima facie case could be made out only by demonstrating a pattern.finally,the court erred by disposing of the challenge to hanson without proceeding to the second and third batson steps,requiring the prosecutor to give a explanation and assessing the credibility of that explanation.
having identified these errors,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court direct a reconstruction hearing at which the prosecutor intent could be determined.she noted that both the assistant district attorney who prosecuted deberry and justice pincus were available to testify,but suggested that if the prosecutor intent could not be reconstructed,the court should order a new trial.finally,the magistrate judge suggested a hearing in district court rather than a remand to state court because such a hearing may require that the trial judge be called as a witness.
judge sand,who replaced judge raggi as the assigned district court judge after her appointment to this court,adopted judge pollak recommendations in their entirety and directed her to hold a reconstruction hearing to determine the prosecutor intent when the jury was selected.deberry ii,wl,at.however,before the hearing was conducted,respondent notified judge pollak that kern could not provide any further explanation of his challenge to hanson.
kern did not testify at the reconstruction hearing.indeed,the only witness was justice pincus,who elaborated on his batson rulings and his understanding of batson.he explained that batson required that challenges be race neutral,gender neutral,sexual orientation neutral,national origin neutral and that in order to be a challenge,there had to be a pattern.respondent attorney asked whether by pattern,the judge was referring to the threshold prima faci e showing.the judge answered that he was.
despite justice pincus understanding that an attorney could not be required to explain his challenges unless a pattern were demonstrated,his ordinary practice was to ask for an explanation as soon as the opposing attorney made a challenge.he initially followed this practice during the trial.
justice pincus next addressed the challenges to each juror.he testified that he believed kern explanation for excusing archibald and that if he had not believed the explanation,he would have put archibald on the jury.when scheinberg responded all right after the judge indicated that the archibald challenge was appropriate,justice pincus believed that scheinberg also accepted the prosecutor reason.
further,the judge accepted kern reason for challenging smith as credible and race neutral.he believed the prosecutor both because of the reasons he gave and because kern is a a very experienced district attorney,very professional,who only raised challenges when he felt there should be challenges.justice pincus also testified that he would have considered a further argument from defense counsel if he had made one.
in discussing buckner,the judge testified that he had not found a pattern by the time kern explained his sense of discomfort.he failed to find a pattern based on the regular demographics of the jury panel and recalled that there were some blacks picked the first round.despite the judge statement that kern uneasiness would not ordinarily be sufficient to rebut a batson challenge,he also found kern explanation to be truthful as race neutral.he believed that kern was simply unhappy with buckner and that he wanted the jury to be balanced between different age groups.the judge also testified that even without a pattern,he would have seated buckner if he had found kern explanation to be incredible.based on scheinberg all right after the prosecutor explanation,justice pincus believed that scheinberg also accepted the prosecutor explanation.
justice pincus explained that he declined to ask for reasons for the hanson challenge because he had not found a pattern in making the determination that there was no pattern,the judge considered kern explanations for excusing the other jurors as well as defense counsel failure to make any claim concerning the first round of challenges.he later defined pattern as specifically rejecting jurors,challenging them based on race,religion,national origin or a sexual orientation.
following the hearing,judge pollak recommended denial of the petition.she credited justice pincus testimony that he had found the prosecutor reasons for excusing archibald,smith,and buckner to be race neutral and credible.judge pollak also found that petitioner failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that justice pincus factual findings were erroneous or constituted an unreasonable determination of the facts.finally,because of gaps in the record concerning the number of black jurors who were actually seated and the lack of supreme court precedent directly on point,the magistrate judge held that justice pincus had not unreasonably applied supreme court law when he declined to require kern to explain his challenge to hanson.judge sand thoroughly reviewed both the magistrate judge factual findings and her conclusions of law.see deberry iii,d.like judge pollak,he held that justice pincus had made the required credibility findings concerning kern explanations for excusing archibald,smith,and buckner.id.at.judge sand,however,took a slightly different approach to evaluating the reasonability of justice pincus treatment of the hanson challenge.he held that it would not have been objectively unreasonable for the trial court to find that any prima facie inference of discrimination had been dispelled by the credible reasons offered for excusing smith and archibald,the judge knowledge of kern general credibility,and the fact that both the victim and the defendants were.id.at.finding the issues to be close,judge sand granted a certificate of appealability.id.at.
deberry filed a timely appeal.he argues both that the state court unreasonably applied batson and that its determination of the facts was unreasonable in light of the evidence.see generally d.in addition to defending the state court findings and holdings,respondent argues that deberry claims are procedurally barred and waived.
discussion 
procedural bar.
a habeas court may not reach a petitioner federal claim if the judgment of the state court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment,coleman thompson,d,unless the petitioner shows cause for his default and prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law,or the petitioner demonstrates a fundamental miscarriage of justice,id.at.where a decision fairly appear s to rest primarily on federal law,or to be interwoven with the federal law,and when the adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the opinion,habeas courts presume that there is no adequate and independent state law ground supporting the judgment.id.at.quoting michigan long,d.
respondent contends that the appellate division held that the batson argument with respect to smith,archibald,and buckner was barred because deberry offered nothing to rebut the prosecutor facially neutral explanations,and that the court refused to consider the argument with respect to hanson because deberry did not join in his objection.deberry contests the adequacy of the procedural bar for the archibald,smith,and buckner claims,arguing that allen,on which the procedural bar arguably rests,is inconsistent with federal law,but he does not contest the independence or adequacy of the buckley procedural ground,which allegedly bars hanson claim.for all four jurors,he argues that the appellate division reliance on procedural grounds is not clear from the face of its decision.
reliance on an independent state procedural bar is not clear from the face of the opinion when a state appellate court dismisses a claim by saying,the defendant remaining contentions are either unpreserved for appellate review or without merit.fama commissioner of corr,cir internal quotation marks and indications of alterations from the original omitted.respondent argues that fama does not save deberry batson claims because the cases the second department cited clearly demonstrate that the court relied on a procedural bar to dismiss both the batson and summation claims we need not decide whether sufficiently specific citations to the law or the record in an otherwise terse affirmance would allow us to find a clear procedural bar because the citations are not sufficiently specific in this case.
in order to assess respondent claim that the citations in the appellate division opinion clearly demonstrate reliance on a procedural bar,we must address in some detail the arguments petitioner and the prosecutor made to the state appellate court as well as the appellate court ruling.in his state court appeal,deberry made analytically distinct claims concerning smith,archibald,and buckner,on one hand,and hanson,on the other.with respect to the first three,he argued that the court erred by failing to judge the credibility of kern explanation.with respect to hanson,petitioner argued that the state court erred by refusing to require kern to explain his challenge.
based on people allen,the prosecutor argued that deberry failed to preserve his claim that the trial court erred by not judging the credibility of kern explanations for challenging smith,archibald,and buckner.the allen court held that after a prosecutor offers a facially neutral explanation for challenging a juror,the defendant must argue that the proffered reason is pretextual.id.at.the prosecutor also argued that deberry did not preserve any claim concerning hanson because deberry attorney did not join in this batson challenge.for this proposition,the prosecutor cited a number of cases including people buckley,in which the court held that a defendant could not rely on his request to preserve an objection to the trial court refusal to charge a lesser included offense.alternatively,the prosecutor argued that all of the batson claims failed on their merits.
in respondent view,the appellate court citation of allen establishes that the court declined to consider the challenges to smith,archibald,and buckner because defense counsel did not specifically question the credibility of the prosecutor explanation.however,as the magistrate judge pointed out,sheinberg,whose batson objection harrison previously had joined,did question the propriety of kern explanation for excusing archibald.in addition,if the state appellate court disposed of all the batson claims and the prosecutorial misconduct claim as unpreserved,there was no reason for the court to add or without merit.thus,we agree with the magistrate judge that is impossible to ascertain with any confidence precisely which claims the appellate division believed to have been disposed of by the citation to allen,and we hold that no independent and adequate state ground bars our review of the archibald,smith,and buckner claims of magistrate judge cheryl pollak dated october,at.having reached this conclusion,we need not determine whether the allen ground is adequate and independent.
the appellate division read in the context of the arguments made to that court and the trial a more difficult question as to hanson.buckley,which the second department cited,holds that a d efendant can not rely on the request of a codefendant to preserve a claimed charge error because strategic considerations may make a charge objectionable to one defendant but not to the other.at.it may be logical to infer that the appellate division intended to dispose of the hanson argument with its citation to buckley as deberry counsel did not specifically join in objection to the hanson peremptory challenge.nevertheless,we conclude for two reasons that it is not clear from the face of the appellate division opinion that the court rejected the hanson claim for procedural reasons.first,the appellate division did not link buckley to hanson in any fashion.second,the prosecutor offered both procedural and substantive reasons for affirming.coleman,at.relying on the prosecutor arguments on a motion to dismiss to find that the relevant state court decision does not fairly appear to rest primarily on federal law or to be interwoven with such law.while we could draw an inference from reading the appellate division decision and the parties briefs that the appellate division relied on a procedural bar,we can not say that its reliance is clear from the face of the opinion.
relying on united states rudas,cir,respondent also argues that deberry waived his claims concerning the jurors.in rudas,we held that once the government offers reasons for its peremptory challenges,a federal defendant must state his continuing objection.at.for three reasons,we reject respondent argument that rudas governs here.first,it is factually inapposite to the smith,archibald,and buckner claims deberry,through,objected to the prosecutor reason for challenging archibald the district court found as a matter of fact that the trial court cut off any further objection to the challenge to smith and justice pincus testified that he ruled on the credibility of the prosecutor explanations,obviating the need for defense counsel to make a further objection.second,respondent seeks to import a federal procedural rule into our section review of a state court decision.however,on section review,we rely on state,not federal,procedural rules.thus,a waiver on which the state court did not explicitly rely will not bar our review of the merits of a claim.galarza keane,cir rejecting contention that petitioner waived his batson claim by not quarreling with the prosecutor explanation because the state court did not explicitly rely on a procedural bar.finally,rudas,which concerned steps two and three in the batson analysis,would not apply,even in a federal proceeding,to the hanson challenge,which was resolved at step one of the batson analysis.see rudas,at.therefore,we hold that deberry did not waive his claims.
iii.standard of review.
we review the district court factual determinations for clear error and its denial of the writ de novo.jenkins artuz,cir.in a case governed by aedpa,a habeas court may grant the writ with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court only if 
the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.a state court factual finding enjoys a presumption of correctness that the petitioner must rebut by clear and convincing evidence.e.
however,if a federal claim has not been adjudicated on the merits,aedpa deference is not required.see miranda bennett,cir.absent aedpa deference,conclusions of law and mixed findings of fact and conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.oppel meachum,cir per curiam torres berbary,cir.but,even without deference,the state court credibility assessment of a prosecutor explanation for challenging a juror merits great deference.hernandez new york,d see also washington schriver,cir discussing standards.thus,in many cases it will be necessary to determine whether the state court has adjudicated a claim on the merits to determine the standard of review.because the appellate division did not explain its basis for affirming the trial court on the batson claims,we can not conclude that it adjudicated those claims on the merits.just as the appellate division decision does not reveal which of the four claims were not reached for procedural reasons,it does not reveal which claims were adjudicated on the merits.therefore,we can not hold any one of the four claims to have been adjudicated on the merits.see miranda,at cir holding that a sentence stating that petitioner remaining contentions are unpreserved for appellate review,without merit,or do not require reversal does not justify aedpa deference.in miranda,we distinguished an earlier decision in which we held that disjunctive language similar to that used by the second department established a determination on the basis that,in the earlier case,neither party claimed that there had been a procedural default and the record demonstrated that appellant preserved his challenge.id.at discussing ryan miller,cir in this case,neither the appellate decision nor the record makes it clear that the appellate division adjudicated deberry batson claims on the merits.indeed,the citations suggest that the appellate court disposed of at least some of the claims for procedural reasons.thus,pursuant to miranda,we can not find an adjudication on the merits at the appellate division level.
despite the lack of clarity in the appellate division opinion,the reconstruction hearing record demonstrates that justice pincus adjudicated the batson claims on the merits.it is not clear whether an adjudication on the merits by a trial court,which is neither explicitly affirmed on the merits nor explicitly rejected by the appellate court,is sufficient to trigger aedpa review.cotto herbert,cir addressing a similar a different procedural deciding it.like the cotto court,we need not resolve this issue on the facts of this case.as we explain below,the trial court rejection of the batson claim concerning smith,archibald,and buckner was entirely.because the judge credibility findings are entitled to great deference even without applying aedpa,the distinction between aedpa and standards is not crucial for these three claims.for slightly more complicated reasons,the applicability or not of the aedpa standard would not alter the outcome on the hanson claim.with regard to hanson,the state trial court relied on its credibility findings concerning the earlier challenges to determine that no pattern had been established.to the extent that our review implicates these earlier credibility findings,we review deferentially even without aedpa.to the extent that we must determine whether the trial judge permissibly found no pattern or prima facie case with respect to hanson,we will review de novo if there was no adjudication on the merits.see oppel,at.applying find that the district did not err in its application of batson,we do not reach the cotto issue.
iv.review of the state court adjudication.
as he explained at the reconstruction hearing,justice pincus believed kern explanations for challenging archibald,smith,and buckner and found those challenges to be race neutral.the district court explicitly credited justice pincus testimony.deberry iii,d at.we must credit it as well unless the district court committed clear error.see jenkins,at.deberry identifies no basis on which we could find that the district court clearly erred,and the record in no way undermines justice pincus testimony or the district court finding.therefore,we accept the district court assessment.
holding that justice pincus made credibility findings does not end our inquiry,we must still determine whether those findings should be set aside.in hernandez,the supreme court explained 
deference to trial court findings on the issue of discriminatory intent makes particular sense because,as we noted in batson,the finding largely will turn on evaluation of credibility.in the typical peremptory challenge inquiry,the decisive question will be whether counsel explanation for a peremptory challenge should be believed.there will seldom be much evidence bearing on that issue,and the best evidence often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge.as with the state of mind of a juror,evaluation of the prosecutor state of mind based on demeanor and credibility lies peculiarly within a trial judge province.
at.internal citations omitted.in the context of a direct appeal from the new york court of appeals,the hernandez court applied a clear error standard of review to the trial court credibility findings.id.at.we see no reason to apply a more stringent standard to a state court credibility findings on habeas review.
just as we found no clear error in the district court appraisal of justice pincus credibility,we find none in the justice assessment of kern credibility.this holding does not imply that the judge could not have reached a contrary decision a finding rejecting the prosecutor explanations would have been supported by the record,including the prosecutor acknowledgment that he kept other young jurors although he challenged archibald because of his youth,smith law enforcement status,and the prosecutor inarticulate explanation of his challenge to buckner deberry iii,d at.nevertheless,all of the prosecutor explanations were facially neutral,the victim was,id.at,it appears that some jurors served on the jury,id.at,and justice pincus was in a far better position than we to evaluate kern demeanor and credibility,especially in light of his long history with kern,id.at similar facts caused the hernandez court to find no clear error in the trial court credibility findings.see hernandez,at.holding no clear error occurred despite the prosecutor challenges to three and perhaps more hispanic jurors because,among other things,the trial court could judge the prosecutor demeanor,and the victim as well as the prosecutor witnesses were hispanic.likewise,we find no clear error in justice pincus credibility findings.
justice pincus found that no pattern had been established prior to the hanson challenge because he credited all of the prosecutor explanations as truthful and race neutral.as we have already explained,we must uphold the prior credibility findings.moreover,we find no error in the judge legal conclusion that defendants had not made out a prima facie batson claim.after the judge ruling that no pattern existed,sheinberg argued that there was a pattern because the prosecutor had challenged the only juror o n this selection.defense counsel bears the burden of articulating the basis,both factual and legal,for a batson challenge.overton newton,cir.here,defense counsel tacitly conceded that the prosecutor prior challenges were no longer relevant to the prima facie showing.hence,the trial court did not err by limiting its consideration to the challenges in the current round.nor can we say that it erred by rejecting the argument that a prima facie claim was established by showing that one juror was excused.
conclusion 
for the reasons we have discussed,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
i concur in judge pooler opinion affirming the district court denial of deberry petition for a writ of habeas corpus.i write separately to highlight a major inconsistency in our cases that discuss the standard of review for state court habeas decisions whose grounds are unclear.in what one experienced district court judge has referred to as a congeries of holdings,taus senkowski,d,weinstein,we have wrestled with the level of deference due when the state court adjudicating habeas claims states that the remaining contentions are either unpreserved for appellate review or are without merit.in fama commissioner of correctional services,cir,we held that such language failed to establish that the claims raised were procedurally barred and that therefore they were amenable to federal habeas review.fama,however,did not address the question of whether the heightened deference granted under d to state court adjudications on the merits applied in such situations.see id.reviewing and rejecting petitioner claims on the merits without discussing d in other words,fama held that claims adjudicated on an either unpreserved or without merit basis were presumed to be preserved.this holding carried with it t
