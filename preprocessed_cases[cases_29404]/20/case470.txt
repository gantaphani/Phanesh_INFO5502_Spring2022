petitioner,john howard,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york feldman,denying his application for a writ of habeas corpus under.howard was convicted of various charges,including murder in the second degree and burglary in the first degree,on august,in the county court of the state of new york,monroe county.howard claims that the trial court erred by allowing the state expert witness to base her testimony on statements otherwise inadmissible pursuant to bruton united states,d limiting howard ability to the state expert and denying howard the right to present a defense.because we find that the trial court limitations on of the state expert witness and its denial of howard ability to call an expert witness were contrary to clearly established federal law and were not harmless,this court reverses the district court ruling and vacates howard convictions for murder in the second degree and burglary in the first degree.in light of these findings,we decline to reach the remaining issue raised by howard,the admission of the state expert testimony based on statements.
howard is currently incarcerated in new york state pursuant to a judgment of conviction on burglary in the first degree,petit larceny,criminal mischief in the fourth degree,and murder in the second degree,entered on august.the trial followed the reversal of his first conviction of these same charges.howard has been incarcerated in connection with these offenses since.
the charges at issue in this petition arose out of the burglary of the home of joanna metz in the early morning hours of april.later that day,metz was found dead in a chair located in an upstairs bedroom in her home.the prosecution claimed at trial that,as a result of the stress caused by the burglary,metz,an old woman with a history of heart problems,suffered a heart attack and died.
howard,along with his two,eric williams and daniel williams,was arrested in connection with the incident.upon their arrests,each provided a statement to the police admitting his involvement in the burglary.each statement verified that all three men participated in the burglary of metz home,but relayed different details regarding what occurred.in his statement,howard admitted taking part in the metz burglary,but he claimed he did not go upstairs and denied he had any contact with metz.he further claimed that he left the house after hearing metz yelling and that eric and daniel williams left the house later,some time after howard had already started walking away.
eric williams statement,which was not allowed in evidence,provided a more detailed,and significantly different,account of the events.in his statement,eric williams claimed that he and howard went upstairs and encountered metz.eric williams said that metz slapped howard three times,after which encounter howard grabbed metz and put her in a chair.eric williams claimed metz,crying,asked for her medicine but that howard yelled at her and would not let her get it.shortly thereafter,eric williams claimed metz body started jumping and then was still.by this time,according to eric williams statement,howard had gone back downstairs.eric williams followed howard downstairs and told howard and daniel williams about metz seizure.
daniel williams written statement,which was likewise not admitted into evidence,indicated that howard and eric williams had gone upstairs while he had remained downstairs.he also stated that eric williams stayed upstairs for a few minutes after howard came back downstairs.in his statement,daniel williams recounted hearing metz say something while the three men were in her house and claimed that both howard and eric williams told him that metz had slapped howard while the two were upstairs.
prior to howard first trial,daniel williams pled guilty and agreed to testify against howard and eric williams.at the trial,however,daniel williams testified that he could not remember what had occurred during the evening in question,that his prior statements about that evening had been based on eric williams statement,and that he would lie if he thought it would help him.daniel williams,at times,stated that he could not remember whether howard went into metz residence,whether howard went upstairs,or even if there was a second level in the house.
the state introduced no evidence tending to show howard presence on the second floor of metz house.his own statement did not indicate that,and neither did the state physical evidence.the state recovered sneaker prints from the residence,but the prosecution forensic chemist could not reach a conclusion regarding which shoes had left the prints.howard sneaker prints were only found in the kitchen.
the state also offered the testimony of jacqueline martin,a county medical examiner,in support of its case.martin testified that metz had died of a heart attack,which was induced by the stress of the burglary.prior to her testimony,defense counsel conducted a voir dire examination of martin in which she revealed that she based her opinion in relevant part on information obtained from the statements of the defendant and his two.the defendant objected to martin testimony on the ground that it was based in part on unreliable,inadmissible statements otherwise precluded pursuant to bruton united states,d.the trial court denied howard motion to exclude martin testimony.
in connection with its ruling to allow the admission of martin testimony,the court also established parameters for the defendant of martin.it ruled that,if howard attacked the basis for martin expert opinion through,the state would be permitted to present to the jury all of the evidence martin considered,including the statement by eric williams.
defense counsel then inquired of the court whether two specific potential questions would open the door to the court admission of eric williams statement.howard attorney indicated his desire to ask can you say to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that,if metz had taken a nitrostat pill,she would not have had a heart attack and can you say to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that if metz house had not been burglarized or broken into on april,that she would have had the heart attack that evening 
the defense designed the first question to address the state claim in its opening statement that metz had medication in her purse,but that the purse was removed from her possession during the burglary.the trial court noted that,if the defense were to mention the medication,the state would be entitled to establish that metz may have experienced additional stress because the medication,according to eric williams statement,had been deliberately withheld.
with regard to the second question,the defense expressed its interest in establishing that there was a possibility metz would have died that day,even in the absence of a burglary.the trial court again held that,if the defense were to so inquire,the state would be entitled to present the evidence relied upon by martin,including eric williams statement.the court explained that the defense proposed question would change dramatically the view of what occurred that morning in the eyes of the jury and that since martin had considered information that demonstrated that this was much,much much more than just an ordinary burglary,the state would be entitled to introduce such information as evidence.trial tr.at.the court also ruled that the defense would not be permitted to ask general questions intended to establish that sometimes individuals have heart attacks even in the absence of a precipitating event.again,the court found that this line of questioning would entitle the state to present the full version of what occurred on the night in question,as relied upon by its expert,martin.
the defense also indicated its intent to call its own expert,richard abbott,who would testify that he could not conclude to any degree of certainty that metz heart attack was induced by stress or any particular event indeed,he would testify that no medical examiner could say with certainty whether the burglary of metz home caused her to suffer a cardiac arrythmia.the trial court ruled that,if the defense called abbott,the state would be able to abbott using eric williams statement and the particular information contained within it.
on direct examination,martin testified that the burglary of the home was an important factor on metz death.trial tr.at.more specifically,martin testified that she believed that the and ransacking on both floors would have caused fear in joanna metz in her condition,and that that fear played a role in her death.trial tr.at.martin also testified that,based on the information in the police records,she concluded the stress metz experienced was severe.trial tr.at.
the defense of martin,limited as it was by the trial court rulings,was extremely brief.howard attorney merely established that there were not any external signs that metz suffered from a heart condition or that metz suffered physical trauma prior to her death,and then he ended his.
the jury found howard guilty of burglary in the first degree,petit larceny,criminal mischief in the fourth degree,and murder in the second degree.on his conviction for murder in the second degree,howard was sentenced to an indeterminate term of years to life to run concurrently with his sentences on the other three convictions,including a sentence of to years on his conviction for burglary in the first degree.howard appealed his conviction to the supreme court of new york,appellate division,raising,inter alia,the challenges outlined below.that court denied his claims.people howard.the appellate division concluded that martin testified that her opinion regarding the cause of death would be the same even without the information obtained from the statement of one of the accomplices.id.at.furthermore,the court found that,should any error have occurred,such error was harmless in light of the other evidence that established that the victim was alive at the time of the burglary.id.the appellate division did not consider the harmlessness of any other error purported by howard to have occurred.with respect to any other issues presented for review before that court,the appellate division simply stated that the court had considered the other contentions raised by defendant and conclude that they are without merit.id.howard sought leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals,which court denied him such leave on september.people howard.having exhausted his state claims,howard timely filed a petition for habeas relief in the united states district court for the western district of new york.
the case was referred upon consent of the parties to magistrate judge feldman.see c.the district court denied howard petition for habeas corpus relief.howard walker,june.the district court granted a certificate of appealability limited to howard allegations that martin reliance on statements to form an opinion regarding the time and cause of metz death violated his rights under the sixth amendment.id.slip op.at.howard appealed to this court.following oral argument,the panel remanded the case to the district court for supplementation of the record pursuant to united states jacobson,cir.the panel required that the district court make findings of fact and conclusions of law on the issue of whether howard had been deprived of the opportunity to present a meaningful defense,in violation of his right to due process under the fourteenth amendment and his right of compulsory process under the sixth amendment,by ruling that the substance of eric williams inadmissible under bruton united states,d could be disclosed if petitioner counsel the prosecution expert witness on the basis of her opinion or called his own expert witness.howard walker,fed.appx,cir.
on remand,the court below issued an amended decision and order without holding a hearing.the district court found that howard meaningful defense argument depended on the extent to which the government expert,martin,had relied on the statement.the court found that martin based her opinion on ample other evidence not tainted by bruton.howard walker,wl,at july.magistrate judge feldman cited to the fourth department determination that martin testimony would be the same even without information obtained from the statement of one of the accomplices.id.at quoting people howard,dep t,leave to appeal denied.the district court also rejected howard contention that the trial court limitations on his ability to martin or to call his own expert witness violated his constitutional rights under the compulsory process clause of the sixth amendment or the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.
the appeal having been reinstated to this court docket pursuant to our march,mandate and having heard argument on march,in an order dated march,this court reversed the district court denial of a writ of habeas corpus and vacated howard state conviction for murder in the second degree by order on march,and indicated that this opinion would follow.the evidentiary rulings challenged by howard implicate both his conviction for murder in the second degree and burglary in the first degree.howard is guilty of burglary in the first degree if he or another participant in the crime c auses physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime.penal law.the evidentiary rulings discussed below do not,however,implicate howard conviction for petit larceny,criminal mischief in the fourth degree,or the lesser included offense of burglary in the second degree as none of those charges requires a jury to find the element of physical injury to a person.
ii.discussion 
this court review of a denial of a petition for habeas corpus is de novo.see,zappulla new york,cir.the district court factual findings are reviewed for clear error.see,cox donnelly,cir.
federal habeas review of state convictions 
a federal court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.a.a claim that a state conviction was obtained in violation of state law is not cognizable in the federal court.see estelle mcguire,d dunnigan keane,cir.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,substantially amended the statutory law governing federal review of habeas corpus petitions.see,and.the amendments place a new constraint on the ability of a federal court to grant habeas corpus relief to a state prisoner with respect to claims adjudicated on the merits in state court.williams taylor,d.a federal court can not grant a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by a person in state custody with regard to any claim that was rejected on the merits by the state court unless the adjudication of the claim in state court either 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.to determine whether this standard of review applies,this court must first determine whether the state court adjudicated an issue on the merits.a state court adjudicates a petitioner federal claims on the merits when it disposes of the claim on the merits,and reduces its disposition to judgment.norde keane,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a claim need not be addressed in detail by a state court to have been adjudicated on the merits.see,ryan miller,cir finding that a blanket statement that t he defendant remaining contentions are either unpreserved for appellate review or without merit constituted adjudication on the merits.in the instant case,all of the issues before this court were adjudicated on the merits by the state court.people howard,dep t we have considered the other contentions raised by defendant,including those raised in his pro se supplemental brief,and conclude that they are without merit,leave to appeal denied.
clearly established federal law refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.kennaugh miller,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.a federal court may not grant habeas simply because,in its independent judgment,the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.fuller gorczyk,cir quoting williams,at.rather,a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decided a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams,at.
a state court decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.as this court has instructed the district courts,i n determining whether an application was objectively unreasonable,a habeas court does not require that reasonable jurists would all agree that the state court erred on the other hand,the most important point is that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application.jones stinson,cir quoting williams,at.although some increment of incorrectness beyond error is required the increment need not be great.id.quoting francis stone,cir internal alteration omitted.
if this court finds that the state court engaged in an unreasonable application of established law,resulting in constitutional error,it must next consider whether such error was harmless.see brecht abrahamson,d.again,this court is required to consider the state court resolution of this question.in the instant case,the state court determined that admission of martin testimony was not in error and,furthermore,if it had been in error,the error would have been harmless.the state court engaged in no explicit resolution,however,of the question of whether the restrictions on howard ability to put forward an expert witness or to martin were harmless.
when the state court concludes that any error was or would be harmless,that finding is subject to the same standard of deference as is any other legal conclusion.zappulla,at citing mitchell esparza,d per curiam.that is,this court must find that the state court harmless error determination,whether the people proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained,was objectively unreasonable.id.quoting mitchell,at.
following aedpa,this court has yet to define the standard of review appropriate to determine whether a constitutional error challenged on collateral review is harmless where the state court does not address the question of harmlessness.see benn greiner,cir gutierrez mcginnis,cir ryan,at.prior to the passage of aedpa,on collateral review,determination that an error was not harmless required a court to find that the error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brecht,at.quoting kotteakos united states.alternatively,this court might apply aedpa standard of review for state court legal the state court resolution of legal questions resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law despite the fact that the state court did not reach a determination on the question of harmlessness.d see benn,at.where the question has arisen,this court has declined to resolve it,finding instead that the harmlessness determination would be identical under either analysis.benn,at citing analogous cases.
b.a criminal defendant rights pursuant to bruton 
howard claims arise under the sixth amendment confrontation clause,recently interpreted by the supreme court in crawford washington,d.this court has previously determined that the holding of crawford is irrelevant to our review of the state courts analysis of a habeas petitioner claim on the merits because the petitioner conviction became final prior to the date of that ruling.see mungo duncan,cir.therefore,this court takes the contours of howard sixth amendment rights as of the date that his conviction became final,considering whether the state court adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
howard claims that his rights under the sixth amendment were violated by the trial court ruling which allowed the state expert witness to testify to an opinion based in relevant part on the otherwise inadmissible hearsay statement of eric williams.the supreme court has long held that the the utterance of a made after the termination of the conspiracy was inadmissible against other.delli paoli united states,d,overruled on other grounds by bruton,at.where two or more defendants are tried together,such a statement could be admissible against the declarant under the admissions exception to the hearsay rule.in delli paoli,the court held that under such circumstances,the state could offer such a statement as evidence against the declarant and any prejudice to the other defendant could be overcome by a limiting instruction to the jury.id.at.however,finding that a limiting instruction is insufficient to mitigate the prejudice to the against whom such a statement is otherwise inadmissible,the supreme court has held that such statements are not admissible in a joint trial.bruton,at.
the supreme court firm stance on the inadmissibility of such statements is founded on the fact that the credibility of such statements is inevitably suspect,a fact recognized when accomplices do take the stand and the jury is instructed to weigh their testimony carefully given the recognized motivation to shift blame onto others.id.at.the sixth amendment serves to ensure and protect the jury trial function.the supreme court has long concerned itself with the likelihood that the admission of statements will distort the truthfinding process.lee illinois,d.
the confession of an accomplice is presumptively unreliable.id.in the context of an accomplice confession,the supreme court has concluded that the truthfinding function of the confrontation clause is uniquely threatened when an accomplice confession is sought to be introduced against a criminal defendant without the benefit of.id.at.due to his strong motivation to implicate the defendant and to exonerate himself,a statement is intrinsically much less reliable than hearsay generally.bruton,at.white,dissenting.
constituting hearsay,eric williams statement was admissible only if it bore independent indicia of reliability.ohio roberts,d see also lee,at.prior to the appellate division ruling,the supreme court had found that certain hearsay exceptions rely upon such solid foundations that admission of virtually any evidence within them comports with the substance of the constitutional protection.roberts,at.internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,if a hearsay declarant was unavailable to testify at trial where he would be subjected to the rigors of,but the declarant statement bore adequate indicia of reliability,a defendant rights pursuant to the sixth amendment were not violated by the admission of the statement.id.at.where there are particularized guarantees of trustworthiness,otherwise inadmissible hearsay was rendered admissible pursuant to roberts.
as a preliminary matter,there are no such particularized guarantees of trustworthiness with respect to eric williams confession the state does not argue as such and no facts in the record support such a conclusion.furthermore,the supreme court has consistently held that statements that inculpate both the declarant and another person ought to be considered with even greater suspicion than that applied to hearsay statements generally.see lilly virginia,d describing a long line of supreme court cases analyzing the inherent unreliability of such statements.
the facts of this case constitute a casebook example of the circumstances that would cause a court to question,as a matter of law,the reliability of a statement.significant admissible evidence,not the least of which was each defendant signed and sworn confession,existed to support the conviction of one or all of eric williams,daniel williams,or john howard for the burglary of metz home.the ability to convict one or more defendants on the charge of felony murder,however,was compromised by each man incentive to lay blame for the death of metz on the other two men.in new york state,an individual may be guilty of murder in the second degree where a cting either alone or with one or more other persons,he commits or attempts to commit an enumerated felony,and,in the course of and in furtherance of such crime or of immediate flight therefrom,he,or another participant,if there be any,causes the death of a person other than one of the participants.penal law emphasis added.the law also provides,however,an affirmative defense to felony murder.a defendant is not guilty of felony murder where he can prove that he 
a did not commit the homicidal act or in any way solicit,request,command,importune,cause or aid the commission thereof and b was not armed with a deadly weapon,or any instrument,article or substance readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury and of a sort not ordinarily carried in public places by persons and c had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant was armed with such a weapon,instrument,article or substance.
id.the likelihood that the accused will prove the affirmative defense is immeasurably enhanced should he credibly attribute the homicidal act to one of his.
the statements made and signed by eric williams,daniel williams,and john howard following their arrest illustrate the incentives to distort the truth faced by following termination of a criminal conspiracy when that conspiracy is under investigation by law enforcement authorities.while each acknowledged his involvement in the burglary of metz home,howard and daniel williams denied any interaction with metz,physical,verbal,or otherwise.in addition,each of the three men suggested that the other two men may have climbed the stairs to the second floor of the house,where metz was found dead,or had the opportunity to go upstairs while the declarant was either downstairs in the kitchen or just outside the house.eric williams admitted to going upstairs,but claimed that howard physically assaulted metz.his statement,constituting inadmissible hearsay,was not admissible against howard.indeed,admission of the statement would have proven uniquely threaten ing to the truthfinding function of the confrontation clause.lee,at.quoted in lilly,at.
because the defense did not contest that the medical cause of metz death was cardiac arrythmia,the material question was what had caused the cardiac arrythmia.while the state averred that stress resulting from the burglary caused metz to suffer cardiac arrythmia,the defense asserted that no person could conclude with any degree of certainty what had brought on the arrythmia.
the trial court allowed an expert witness for the state,jacqueline martin,to testify to her opinion regarding the cause of metz death.in reaching an expert opinion on this question,martin considered the police files and reports of the incident,which reports included the three statements of howard,eric williams,and daniel williams.
the district court relied upon the state appellate court finding that martin voir dire testimony established that her opinion would be the same even without information obtained from the statement of one of the accomplices.howard,at.the district court accepted this finding as correct in light of aedpa requirement that state court findings of fact are presumptively correct absent contrary clear and convincing evidence.e.see howard,wl,at.however,this finding confuses the contours of martin opinion and its bases.the record clearly demonstrates that martin expert opinion on the cause of metz cardiac arrythmia,as heard by the jury,rested on eric williams otherwise inadmissible statement.
as described above,martin opinion regarding metz death consisted of two parts.the first,that metz death was caused by a cardiac arrythmia,was not seriously contested by the defendant.howard did,however,contest the second part of martin opinion,that the cardiac arrythmia was caused by stress resulting from the burglary.in the course of voir dire,howard counsel questioned martin regarding the impact of the three men statements on her opinion.
howard counsel is your opinion as to cause of death in this case contingent to some degree upon the representations in eric williams statement being true 
martin yes.
okay.if those representations were not true,would that possibly change your opinion as to cause of death 
a.as to cause of death,i do think so.
trial tr.at.when pushed to specify to what she understood cause of death to refer,however,martin defined cause of death to mean cardiac arrythmia,due to arteriosclerosis.trial tr.at.the fact that the immediate cause of metz death was cardiac arrythmia was not contested.asked,on the other hand,whether she could,without relying on the statements,give an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to whether,in fact,the house robbery brought about the cardiac arrythmia,martin testified that she could not do so.trial tr.at.
there exists clear and convincing evidence,indeed it is indisputable,that martin testimony that the burglary caused metz death relied on the statement.on the basis of that statement,martin testified before the jury that the burglary was an important factor on metz death.trial tr.at.the appellate division ruling was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.martin relied on inadmissible inherently unreliable hearsay in formulating an opinion to which she testified before the jury.
experts are generally permitted to rely on otherwise inadmissible evidence in formulating an expert opinion expert witnesses can testify to opinions based on hearsay or other inadmissible evidence if experts in the field reasonably rely on such evidence in forming their opinions.united states locascio,cir.such reliance does not,as a rule,violate a defendant confrontation clause rights.this court has previously concluded that i t is rare indeed that an expert can give an opinion without relying to some extent upon information furnished him by others.reardon manson,cir,cert.denied,d.an expert may be permitted to rely on such information without interfering with a defendant sixth amendment rights.id.a defendant rights under the confrontation clause are protected where the expert is available for questioning concerning the nature and reasonableness of his reliance.id.
a number of structural mechanisms ensure that an expert reliance on hearsay furthers,rather than hinders,the truthfinding process.see lee,at.first,trial courts exercise the authority to ensure that an expert testimony rests upon reliable bases and foundation.see daubert merrell dow,d see also kumho tire carmichael,d.second,as an expert,the witness herself is assumed to have the skill to properly evaluate the hearsay,giving it probative force appropriate to the circumstances.locascio,at quoting in re agent orange prod.liab,aff,cir,cert.denied,d.third,expert witnesses are subject to.see united states feliciano,cir finding that constitutional problems raised by allowing a law enforcement agent to testify as both an expert and fact witness while relying on otherwise inadmissible hearsay were mitigated by the opportunity,which defense counsel seized,to explore on the limitations of the witness experience and his testimony.on,an attorney is free to challenge an expert methodology,her conclusions,and the bases for her conclusions.to the extent that the reliability of certain facts accepted by an expert is questionable,the exercise and process of allow a defendant to bring any such factual disputes to the attention of the jury.
the factors generally relied upon to ensure that an expert reliance on hearsay does not violate a defendant rights under the sixth amendment did not exist in this case.the court only voir dire question of martin asked whether the statements of daniel williams,eric williams,and john howard were pieces of information that would be considered by other experts in the field of forensic pathology as important items to rely on in forming an opinion about the causation of death,a question martin answered,yes.trial tr.at.since the supreme court ruling in daubert,however,it has been clear that the fact that experts generally rely on a particular methodology or source of information is neither necessary nor sufficient to ensure admissibility at trial.daubert,at.in this case,where the court was obligated to protect the defendant confrontation clause rights,martin assurance that her methodology conformed with that of forensic pathologists generally was not sufficient to procure the admissibility of her opinion,where that opinion was based on a statement.
while the statements are presumptively unreliable,we decline to decide whether the admission of the state expert testimony based on statements is equivalent to the unconstitutional admission of a statement.this court declines to determine whether admission of expert testimony based on a statement violates a defendant confrontation rights in every case.in this case,howard was denied his right to that witness or to rebut that witness testimony by presenting his own expert witness.because these denials,in and of themselves,constituted harmful constitutional errors,this court does not decide whether the admission of martin testimony,based on presumptively unreliable statements,had it not been accompanied by the court limitations on howard rights to and compulsory process,would have violated howard confrontation clause rights.
c.the trial court limitations on howard of martin 
a defendant in a state criminal prosecution has a right,guaranteed by the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution,to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi see pointer texas,d holding that the sixth amendment confrontation clause is made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment.the central concern of the confrontation clause is to ensure the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the trier of fact.maryland craig,d,quoted in lilly virginia,at.trials are by their nature adversarial processes,and it is this adversarial nature that ensures the fulfillment of their truthfinding function.the supreme court has stated that 
confrontation insures that the witness will give his statements under impressing him with the seriousness of the matter and guarding against the lie by the possibility of a penalty for perjury forces the witness to submit to,the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth 
california green,d quoting wigmore,evidence ed.
this court considers howard right of as it existed at the time his conviction became final.as previously described,supra at,the admission of an statement may violate the confrontation clause.roberts,at.limitations on can also violate a defendant confrontation clause rights.t he right of is included in the right of an accused in a criminal case to confront the witnesses against him.pointer,at.the right of,though not absolute,is one of the most firmly established principles under supreme court law.cotto herbert,cir considering a petition for writ of habeas corpus under.as a result,a denial of without waiver would be constitutional error of the first magnitude smith illinois,d internal quotation marks omitted.not inconsistent with a defendant right to confrontation,trial judges retain wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on such based on concerns about,among other things,harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues,the witness safety,or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.delaware van arsdall,d.limitations on may be lawful and legitimate if they are harmonious with the goal of ensuring the legitimacy of the truthfinding process.after all,t he right of is implicit in the constitutional right of confrontation,and helps assure the accuracy of the process.chambers mississippi,d quoting dutton evans,d.
accordingly,while the right to is not absolute,it is effectively denied when a defendant is prohibited from expos ing to the jury the facts from which jurors,as the sole triers of fact and credibility,could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.davis alaska,d.if a defendant is prevented from doing so,he states a violation of the confrontation clause.van arsdall,at.in this case,howard was not able to engage in of martin that would shed light on her reliability by questioning her methodology,the factual bases upon which she rested her conclusion,or the soundness of the opinion itself.
here,the trial court ruling that,if the defense challenged the basis of martin opinion,the state would be permitted to admit eric williams statement in its entirety,offered howard a choice.the court required howard to choose between his sixth amendment right to martin,and his sixth amendment right to exclude the unreliable hearsay confession of a.the supreme court has recognized that a court may not subject a defendant to such a sacrifice.simmons united states,d w e find it intolerable that one constitutional right should have to be surrendered in order to assert another.
this court recognizes that the simmons principle has not widely been applied in the sixth amendment context.united states harris,cir citing united states kahan,d,cert.denied,d.this court has previously determined that a criminal defendant testimony at a hearing held to determine whether he qualifies for appointment of counsel can not be used as part of the government case against him.harris,at.the supreme court,however,in kahan,declined to apply the simmons principle where a criminal defendant statements on a financial disclosure form,completed for the purposes of exercising his sixth amendment right to counsel,were admitted against him at trial not for the purposes of establishing the truth of the statements,but for the purposes of establishing defendant knowledge that such statements were false.kahan,at.the supreme court determined that the criminal defendant faced no intolerable choice of the sort that simmons sought to relieve.id.at.in making the false financial disclosure,the defendant did not exercise what was believed by the claimant to be a valid constitutional claim.id.
the instant case is more analogous to simmons than it is to kahan.kahan had no right to counsel as he was not in reality indigent.howard did have an absolute right under bruton and to exercise the rights to confrontation and compulsory process.furthermore,the inability to martin or to present abbott testimony were essential to howard felony murder conviction and had a prejudicial impact on the jury deliberations on that charge.united states hardwell,cir citing,inter alia,harris,at to support a holding that a defendant can not be forced to choose between the sixth amendment right to counsel and the fifth amendment right against.accordingly,the simmons principle is particularly apt in this case.therefore,this court examines the choice posed to howard as it would an outright limitation on his right to or,as discussed infra at,his right to present a defense.
by conditioning howard right to martin on the surrender of another constitutional right,the court effectively foreclosed howard opportunity to engage in that would challenge the nature and reasonableness of martin reliance on eric williams statement,or any other basis upon which she reached her conclusion.reardon,at.as discussed supra at,the trial court limitation on howard of martin was particularly harmful to the truthfinding process given her reliance upon unreliable hearsay in forming her expert opinion.even setting aside,however,the constitutional implications of allowing martin to testify to an opinion based upon statements,the court limitation on howard of martin was an unreasonable denial of howard rights under the confrontation clause.
in this case,the trial court barred howard from engaging in even the most basic of martin,thereby gutting the function of,the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested.davis,at.the trial judge ruling barred areas of that went to the reliability of martin conclusion itself as well as to the basis of her opinion.howard was not permitted to question her conclusions or the information on which they were based in any way without risking the admission into evidence of eric williams statement.the court found that,if howard attempted to establish that it was possible that metz would have suffered a heart attack even in the absence of a burglary,the state would be permitted to present eric williams statement to the jury.
the district court,in denying howard petition,noted that the ruling by the trial judge here did not restrict or preclude defense counsel from engaging in or challenging the veracity of martin.rather,the trial court ruling simply defined an inevitable consequence should defense counsel pursue a particular line of impeachment questioning.howard walker,slip op.at june.the district court found that the trial judge fashioned a remedy that balanced the defendant bruton rights with his right to effective,slip op.at.the trial court ruling can hardly be considered a balancing,however,where the only entitlements compromised belonged to the defendant.
the trial court did not simply define an inevitable consequence of.the trial court rulings on what constitutes opening the door failed to consider the serious constitutional violation in conditioning the opportunity for on howard waiver of his bruton rights.howard was entitled to exclusion of eric williams statement and in making exclusion of such statement contingent upon howard sacrifice of another equally fundamental constitutional right,the trial court denied howard rights guaranteed by one of the most firmly established principles under supreme court law.cotto,at.in light of longstanding supreme court precedent,the trial court ruling involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law and,therefore,can not withstand collateral review.see d.
howard inability to call an expert witness 
the trial court ruling that,were howard to call abbott to testify,the prosecution could introduce the substance of eric williams statement through effectively prohibited howard from presenting abbott testimony to the jury.howard argues this ruling denied him the right to a fair opportunity to defend himself against the state accusations.
the right at issue arises from the right to compulsory process under the sixth amendment.in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor const.amend.vi.the right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense at a criminal trial is a fundamental constitutional right secured by both the compulsory process clause of the sixth amendment and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.washington schriver,cir citing supreme court cases.few rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense.taylor illinois,d.this right protects,among other things,the process.the ends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgment were to be founded on a partial or speculative presentation of the facts.id.at.quoting united states nixon,d.to those ends,t he rights to confront and witnesses and to call witnesses in one own behalf has long been recognized as essential to due process.chambers,at.
however,t he accused does not have an unfettered right to offer testimony that is incompetent,privileged,or otherwise inadmissible,and his right may yield to rules and procedure of the adversary process that provide each party with a fair opportunity to assemble and submit evidence to contradict or explain the opponent case.taylor,at.a trial court may consider the the broader public interest in a full and truthful disclosure of critical facts.see id.at.restrictions on a defendant right under the sixth amendment to introduce testimony on his behalf,however,may not be arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.rock arkansas,d.
to establish a sixth amendment violation,a defendant must demonstrate that he was deprived of the opportunity to present a witness who would have provided testimony that was both material and favorable to his defense.united states,d.materiality requires that the omission be evaluated in the context of the entire record.id.at.when considering whether a trial court exclusion of expert witness testimony violated a criminal defendant right to compulsory process,a analysis is appropriate.first,we consider the trial court reasons for excluding the evidence.second,we consider the strength of the prosecution case as a whole.see washington,at agard portuondo,cir citing united states agurs,d,rev on other grounds,d.
in this case,the trial court ruled that,were howard to call an expert witness,the court would allow that expert to be using the statement.
howard counsel my understanding,judge,if i were to call a medical expert on behalf of defendant,that the people would be permitted to him relating to the basis of his opinion and using the statements and the particular information contained in those statements is that right 
the court yes,for the reasons i have already stated.
trial tr.at.the testimony of abbott was clearly favorable to the defense.through that testimony,howard sought to establish that metz death may have occurred even if there had been no burglary,thus supporting a reasonable doubt regarding his guilt.while howard had no obligation to come forward with evidence,the constitution entitled him to the opportunity to challenge the state evidence against him.without abbott testimony,which controverted the state case in favor of murder in the second degree as well as burglary in the first degree,howard had no opportunity to contest martin testimony that she could,to a degree of reasonable certainty,draw a conclusion regarding howard role in causing metz cardiac arrythmia.furthermore,abbott testimony supported howard only available defense to the felony murder charge.therefore,the omitted evidence,particularly as it would have been provided by a medical expert,create d a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist and,as such,constitutional error has been committed.agurs,at.furthermore,while the state case in support of howard role in the burglary was substantial,its case supporting both felony murder and the physical injury element of burglary in the first degree was speculative and circumstantial.under such circumstances,the crucial role abbott testimony would have played in howard defense should not be minimized.
the instant case is easily distinguishable from washington,in which this court found that exclusion of a defendant expert was not constitutional error because the defendant was not deprived of the opportunity to make the argument that was supported by the expert testimony.washington,at.in that case,the defendant sought to establish,through expert testimony,that a young victim testimony was unreliable.the washington court was able to list the myriad ways in which the defendant had put evidence regarding the witness unreliability before the jury,including witnesses accounts of inconsistent statements by the young witness to a social worker and an assistant district attorney,the defendant of the young victim,and the simple fact that the victim age was itself evidence that the jury could consider.id.at.this court can point to no such analogous opportunities to present the relevant argument in this case.given the trial court ruling,howard could not martin analysis of the cause of metz cardiac arrythmia.nor could anyone other than a medical expert seriously rebut martin testimony regarding causation.the omitted testimony of abbott was both material and favorable to howard case.
in spite of the materiality and favorableness of abbott testimony,it is possible that the trial court excluded such testimony to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process
