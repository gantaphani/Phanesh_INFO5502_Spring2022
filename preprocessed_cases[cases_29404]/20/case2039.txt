roman sought a writ of habeas corpus seeking release from incarceration and other relief on the basis that the deportation order underlying his conviction was contrary to law.the district court denied relief.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.deportation proceedings 
first entered the united states without inspection in and later became a lawful permanent resident.in,pleaded guilty to a charge of possession with intent to deliver narcotics.he was sentenced to four years imprisonment.
after his conviction,the ins instituted deportation proceedings against as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.during a hearing before an immigration judge ij,applied for relief pursuant to c also referred to as c the ij denied application for c relief,and appealed the ij decision to the board of immigration appeals bia.
while the appeal was pending before the bia,congress enacted the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat,and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,stat,which substantially curtailed the ability of certain aliens to apply for discretionary relief and to seek judicial review of adverse administrative decisions.relevant to this case,d of aedpa barred c relief to individuals who had been convicted of certain drug offenses.
also while appeal was pending before the bia,the attorney general considered the effect of the d bar on aliens whose petitions for discretionary relief were pending at the time of aedpa passage.see matter of soriano,interim,wl.in soriano,the attorney general determined that d of aedpa precluded c relief even for petitioners whose immigration cases were pending on the date of aedpa enactment.
on march,the bia affirmed the ij denial of discretionary relief to.specifically,the bia cited soriano and held that d of aedpa prevented it from granting the discretionary relief that he was seeking.
shortly thereafter,the ins issued a warrant of deportation,and on may.never appealed the bia order,nor did he seek to challenge his deportation in any way.
criminal proceedings 
illegally reentered the country only one year later.in february,was apprehended and charged with violation of a and b illegal reentry.after had been charged,the supreme court handed down its opinion in ins cyr,d,in which the court reached a different conclusion than had the attorney general concerning the availability of c relief after aedpa.the court stated 
we find nothing in iirira unmistakably indicating that congress considered the question to apply its repeal of c retroactively to such aliens as cyr.we therefore hold that c relief remains available for aliens,like respondent,whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who,notwithstanding those convictions,would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.
id.at.moved to dismiss his indictment on the basis of the cyr decision,but his motion was denied.then filed the present action also filed a motion to reopen his deportation proceedings with the bia on the same basis.see.
district court proceedings 
in his habeas action,requested the following relief.first,sought an order that the deportation order was null and void as unconstitutional.at.also requested an order declaring the criminal proceedings instituted in the northern district of illinois improper as unconstitutional.id.additionally,asked the district court to declare that aliens who were unjustly and illegally deported in reliance of the attorney general decision in matter of soriano have the right to apply for,or reassert their right to c relief,despite an ins regulation to the contrary,id.finally,sought an order requiring the bia to reopen his deportation proceedings to enable him to reassert his previously denied application for c relief id.at.
the respondents then filed a motion to dismiss the petition and the district court granted the motion.the district court first determined that,because the bia now had denied the motion to reopen,see,ex,that ruling was ripe for review.however,citing this court decisions in sharif ashcroft,cir,and chowdhury ashcroft,cir,the district court concluded that had filed the action in the wrong court any review of the denial of the motion to reopen should have been taken to this court.
with respect to the removal order,the district court held that the supreme court decisions in ins cyr,d,and ins,d,allowed it to entertain a habeas action that raised pure questions of law.however,the court rejected argument that these recent supreme court decisions afforded every convicted alien a constitutional right to seek c relief.furthermore,the court noted that had applied for c relief before the ij the ij,however,had denied that relief after a full hearing.consequently,because had not suffered any prejudice from the alleged deprivation,no constitutional violation had occurred.
timely appealed the district court dismissal of his habeas petition.
analysisa.propriety of the petition for habeas corpus 
the respondents maintain that is not currently in their custody,nor was he at the time he filed his petition for the writ of habeas corpus.consequently,they argue,this court should dismiss the petition.we agree.
brings his present action pursuant to.although is the substantive provision for the writ of habeas corpus,and set forth the procedure one must follow to bring a petition and to obtain the relief of the writ.specifically,application for the writ shall allege the facts concerning the applicant commitment or detention,the name of the person who has custody over him and by virtue of what claim or authority,if known.the court must then issue the writ or issue an order to show cause why the writ should not be granted.see.that document shall be directed to the person having custody of the person detained.id.furthermore,unless the writ raises only issues of law,the person to whom the writ is directed shall be required to produce at the hearing the body of the person detained.id.these procedural requirements establish that t he writ of habeas corpus does not act upon the prisoner who seeks relief,but upon the person who holds him in what is alleged to be unlawful custody.braden judicial circuit court of kentucky,d.consequently,a petition for a writ of habeas corpus must be directed to the individual or individuals who holds the petitioner in allegedly unlawful custody.
furthermore,it is not sufficient that the named respondent simply be involved,in some manner,with the petitioner detention.sections and indicate that the custodian is the person having a control over the prisoner.guerra meese.specifically,when a prisoner is serving a sentence in a federal facility,the warden of that facility is the prisoner custodian within the meaning of id.
at the time the present petition was filed,was incarcerated awaiting trial on the charge of illegal reentry.consequently,the proper respondent to habeas petition was the warden of the facility in which was being held.see id petition,however,failed to name the warden of the facility in which he was being detained.petition named only the attorney general,the commissioner of the ins and the district director of the ins,none of whom possessed control over at the time the petition was filed.
despite this shortcoming,maintains that the court nevertheless should entertain the petition against the named respondents for a number of reasons.first,he notes that the requirement is determined at the time of the filing of the petition,and he was detained at the time of the filing of his petition.reply br.at.we do not dispute this as a general principle,see,carafas lavallee,d however,it does little to forward argument.specifically,the question here is not whether was in custody per se at the time his petition was filed,but who held in custody at the time he filed his petition.as set forth above,t he writ of habeas corpus does not act upon the prisoner who seeks relief,but upon the person who holds him in what is alleged to be unlawful custody.braden,at.here,failed to name as a respondent the person holding him in allegedly unlawful custody.
also argues that,for purposes of this case,the attorney general should be considered the legal custodian because he controls the deportation and criminal processes for enforcement of the immigration laws.reply br.at.again,this argument misses the mark.the power to control some aspect of the petitioner legal process does not render that official the petitioner custodian for habeas purposes.in rejecting this argument with respect to the parole commission,the district of columbia circuit stated 
appellees argue that because the commission has the power to release them,the commission is their custodian.but their argument extends to any person or entity possessing some sort of power to release them.under appellees theory,the attorney general of the united states could be considered the custodian of every prisoner in federal custody because he supervises the federal bureau of prisons.see.we have specifically rejected this interpretation.sanders bennett.
guerra,at see also thornburgh,thus it should be abundantly clear that habeas petitioners,such as,can not properly bring suit against such officials as the attorney general and such entities as the parole commission.rather the proper defendant in federal habeas cases is the warden.
finally,points to a number of district court cases in which the courts have found that the attorney general was the proper respondent when a petitioner brings a habeas petition to challenge the execution of a final order of removal.see,lee ashcroft,d.although at least one circuit has addressed and soundly rejected this approach,see vasquez reno,cir,we need not reach the issue.here,is not being detained under a final order of deportation.was not the subject of immigration proceedings at the time his petition was filed,nor is he at the present time.indeed,neither the ins nor its successor agency,the department of homeland security,has taken even the preliminary step of filing a notice of detainer with the criminal authorities.consequently,the cases cited by simply are not applicable to the present situation.
thus,at the time his petition was filed,was not in the custody of any of the named respondents for habeas purposes.absent custody by the authority against whom relief is sought,jurisdiction usually will not lie to grant the requested writ.campillo sullivan,cir see also vasquez,at because the petitioner did not direct his habeas petition to the person having custody of the person detained,the district court ought not to have acted on the merits.digrado ashcroft,d,holding that,because the petitioner named the incorrect respondent,jurisdiction is lacking pursuant to.we therefore affirm the district court judgment dismissing petition for the writ of habeas corpus for failing to name the proper custodian 
review of motion to reopen 
proper forum for review 
as noted above,in addition to bringing his habeas action in the district court,also filed a motion to reopen proceedings with the bia on the ground that the bia erred when it denied his application for c relief based on soriano.the bia denied the motion to reopen it stated 
i n his motion the respondent reported that he to his native country of mexico subsequent to the immigration judge noted decision.as such,this board is without jurisdiction to consider the respondent motion.d a motion to reopen shall not be made by a person who is the subject of deportation proceedings subsequent to his departure from the united states.
before the district court,claimed that the bia failure to reopen the proceedings was a violation of his equal protection rights,citing cyr.the district court determined that the issue was not properly before it because this court has exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the bia.
claims that the district court failure to consider the challenge to the denial of the motion to reopen was in error.according to,his only recourse to challenge the denial of the motion to reopen was through habeas because iirira and aedpa curtailed his right to judicial review of bia actions in the courts of appeals.we agree with the district court that should have sought review of the denial of the motion to reopen in this court.a brief review of recent supreme court and circuit cases is helpful in understanding our conclusion.
we begin our review with the supreme court decision in ins cyr,d.in cyr,the petitioner,a lawful permanent resident,pleaded guilty in march of to a charge of selling a controlled substance.in april,after the passage of iirira and aedpa,the ins instituted deportation proceedings against him.the ins and bia took the position that,under iirira and aedpa,the attorney general no longer had the discretion to grant c relief to petitioners such as cyr cyr responded by filing a habeas action seeking a determination of his right to apply for c relief.in that action,the attorney general argued that,not only did aedpa and iirira withdraw his ability to grant discretionary relief under c,but also,as a result of other amendments adopted in aedpa and iirira,there was no judicial forum available to decide whether these statutes did,in fact,deprive him of the power to grant such relief.id.at.
the supreme court rejected the attorney general position.the court stated that under the statutory scheme,a petitioner could have challenged the attorney general position through a habeas proceeding.furthermore,the court held that nothing in iirira or aedpa clearly abrogated a petitioner right to seek habeas relief for pure questions of law.most pertinent for our purposes,the court held that a c does not affect a petitioner ability to seek habeas relief.the court stated 
the term judicial review or jurisdiction to review is the focus of each of these three provisions.in the immigration context,judicial review and habeas corpus have historically distinct meanings.in heikkila,the court concluded that the finality provisions at issue preclud ed judicial review to the maximum extent possible under the constitution,and thus concluded that the apa was inapplicable.nevertheless,the court reaffirmed the right to habeas corpus.noting that the limited role played by the courts in habeas corpus proceedings was far narrower than the judicial review authorized by the apa,the court concluded that it is the scope of inquiry on habeas corpus that differentiates habeas review from judicial review.both a and a c speak of judicial review that is,full,nonhabeas review.neither explicitly mentions habeas,or.accordingly,neither provision speaks with sufficient clarity to bar jurisdiction pursuant to the general habeas statute.
id.at.quoting heikkila barber.additional citations and footnotes omitted.after determining that habeas review was still available to the petitioner,the court turned to the merits of the claim it noted that 
t wo important legal consequences ensued from respondent entry of a guilty plea in march he became subject to deportation,and he became eligible for a discretionary waiver of that deportation under the prevailing interpretation of c.when iirira went into effect in april,the first consequence was unchanged except for the fact that the term removal was substituted for deportation.the issue that remains to be resolved is whether iirira b changed the second consequence by eliminating respondent eligibility for a waiver.
id.at.the court further explained why these consequences were significant in determining whether the bar on c was retroactive 
iirira elimination of any possibility of c relief for people who entered into plea agreements with the expectation that they would be eligible for such relief clearly attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.plea agreements involve a quid pro quo between a criminal defendant and the government.in exchange for some perceived benefit,defendants waive several of their constitutional rights including the right to a trial and grant the government numerous tangible benefits,such as promptly imposed punishment without the expenditure of prosecutorial resources.there can be little doubt that,as a general matter,alien defendants considering whether to enter into a plea agreement are acutely aware of the immigration consequences of their convictions.given the frequency with which c relief was granted in the years leading up to aedpa and iirira,preserving the possibility of such relief would have been one of the principal benefits sought by defendants deciding whether to accept a plea offer or instead to proceed to trial.
id.at.internal quotation marks,citations and footnotes omitted.after reviewing these effects,the court held that the bar to discretionary relief contained in iirira did not apply to those whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements that occurred prior to the law passage 
prior to aedpa and iirira,aliens like cyr had a significant likelihood of receiving c relief.because respondent,and other aliens like him,almost certainly relied upon that likelihood in deciding whether to forgo their right to a trial,the elimination of any possibility of c relief by iirira has an obvious and severe retroactive effect.
we find nothing in iirira unmistakably indicating that congress considered the question whether to apply its repeal of c retroactively to such aliens.we therefore hold that c relief remains available for aliens,like respondent,whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who,notwithstanding those convictions,would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.
id.at.footnotes omitted.
in ins,d,a companion case to cyr,the court applied the holding in cyr and upheld the petitioners right to seek habeas relief.however,in doing so,the court made the following observation concerning iirira bar to judicial review 
the scope of this preclusion is not entirely clear.though the text of the provision is quite broad,it is not without its ambiguities.throughout this litigation,the government has conceded that the courts of appeals have the power to hear petitions challenging the factual determinations thought to trigger the provision such as whether an individual is an alien and whether he or she has been convicted of an aggravated felony within the meaning of the statute.in addition,the government has also conceded that the courts of appeals retain jurisdiction to review substantial constitutional challenges raised by aliens who come within the strictures of a c.as the petitions in this case do not raise any of these types of issues,we need not address this point further.
id.at.citations omitted.consequently,the supreme court explicitly left open the possibility that judicial review,as opposed to habeas,was available to at least some aliens despite the seemingly absolute language of a c.
circuit case law 
soon after the passage of iirira and aedpa,this court recognized that a c did not operate as a complete bar to judicial review of bia decisions.in laguerre reno,cir,we noted that,despite this provision,courts of appeals maintained the power to consider constitutional issues and to correct bizarre miscarriages of justice.id.at.we further explained this power in ins,cir.we stated 
section a a iii provides that a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.therefore,a c generally eliminates our jurisdiction to review any final order of deportation against an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.however,we retain jurisdiction to determine whether we have is,to determine whether an alien criminal conviction is indeed an aggravated felony under the ina,thereby triggering the jurisdictional bar of a c.see,xiong ins,cir yang ins,cir.moreover,in addressing a similar jurisdictional bar announced in an earlier enacted amendment to the ina,we have held that an alien may challenge his deportability on constitutional grounds directly in the courts of appeals,provided that he raises a substantial constitutional claim.see reno,cir singh reno,cir laguerre reno,cir.thus,while we honor congress intent to curtail judicial review of final deportation orders for certain disfavored criminals,we have retained jurisdiction over any substantial constitutional claims raised as a safety valve to prevent bizarre miscarriages of justice.see laguerre,at.
id.at.see also ins,cir.we then set out the path a court must follow to determine whether it could address a petitioner claims 
w e must first determine whether the bia correctly concluded that was an alien deportable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony.if we answer this question in the affirmative,we must then consider whether has nevertheless raised substantial constitutional claims,and we may assert jurisdiction over claims only if we find that he has.
at.after determining that the petitioner was,in fact,an aggravated felon,we went on to address and reject his claims that his due process and equal protection rights had been violated.
it is true that this court recognition of safety valve review in the courts of appeals,in cases such as laguerre and,coincided with our conclusion that iirira and aedpa had abolished habeas review for certain categories of aliens.see laguerre,at.however,the supreme court decision in cyr,reaching the opposite conclusion with respect to iirira and aedpa effect on habeas review,has not altered our view that the courts of appeals still play a role in reviewing substantial constitutional questions arising in the immigration context.see,perryman,cir,cert.denied,d,uslw sharif ashcroft,cir.specifically in,this court stated 
although g bars from obtaining an order commanding the ins to adjust his status or precluding his removal,this does not mean that the courts have ceased to exist for cases in which a true miscarriage of justice may be occurring.laguerre reno,at.for example,the supreme court held in ins cyr,d,that the district courts continue to have jurisdiction under to entertain habeas corpus petitions based on pure questions of law.furthermore,the observation in this court decision in yang ins,cir,remains true the provisions in the amendments to the immigration laws do not preclude the court of appeals from determining whether the alien is being removed for a permissible reason.thus,the agency does not have the final say on constitutional matters instead,that power rests with the courts.singh reno,cir.
at parallel citations omitted see also brooks ashcroft,cir stating that the court of appeals is not foreclosed from consideration of brooks petition for review if he has raised substantial constitutional issues.
in sum,this court repeatedly has acknowledged its authority to review substantial constitutional questions presented through a petition for review of a final order of the bia.furthermore,this court has continued to assert its jurisdiction to review substantial constitutional questions even after the supreme court decision in cyr.finally,the supreme court has not held that the ability of the district courts to entertain an alien habeas action negates the authority of the courts of appeals to consider substantial constitutional questions when presented through a petition for review of a decision of the bia.see,at.consequently,because raises a constitutional challenge to the bia application of its regulation in the denial of his motion to reopen,we believe that the district court properly determined that review of the equal protection issue should have been directed to this court 
despite circuit case law establishing the right of aliens to present substantial constitutional questions to this court through a petition for review of a final order of the bia,did not seek direct review of the bia denial of the motion to reopen in this court.consequently,constitutional challenges concerning the bia failure to reopen are not properly before this court.
equal protection violation 
however,even if there were a viable procedural path by which we could address equal protection challenge,it is clear that those challenges are completely without merit argues that,which precludes a liens with a final order of deportation who have illegally returned to the united states from applying for c relief is unconstitutional because it runs afoul of the supreme court decision in cyr and because it irrationally distinguishes one group of aliens from another according to,cyr mandates that all aliens,regardless of whether they have left the country or returned illegally,are entitled to apply for c relief.as well,continues,the attorney general can not justify the regulation as complying with cyr because it initially was promulgated prior to cyr and did not acknowledge that soriano retroactivity analysis was in error.finally,claims that there is no legitimate reason to deny c relief to aliens who have illegally reentered the country.
classifications that distinguish among groups of aliens are subject to rational basis review,and will be found valid if not arbitrary or unreasonable.brooks ashcroft,cir.under this slight standard of review,the distinctions made by the government are given a strong presumption of validity.the government need only articulate a rational reason for making the distinction,and need not provide any evidence to support the rationality of the reason.domond ins,cir.
the respondents have set forth several reasons for denying those who have entered the country illegally after a final order of deportation the opportunity to apply for c relief we focus on only one of those reasons.the respondents maintain that the rule discourages individuals from entering the country illegally to apply for different types of relief.we believe this consideration suffices as a rational basis for denying c relief to those who have illegally reentered the country.the united states has a legitimate interest in seeing that individuals who cross their borders do so legally and in accordance with set procedures.it has a corollary interest in deterring individuals from crossing its borders illegally illegal reentries put the safety of aliens and law enforcement personnel at risk and,more generally,frustrate the orderly administration of the nation immigration laws.
we note that other courts have recognized the legitimacy of this rationale.in ashcroft,cir,the ninth circuit accepted this justification for implementing.in that case,the ninth circuit,rejecting an equal protection challenge to,stated 
alvarenga finally contends that i violates the equal protection clause because it arbitrarily and irrationally discriminates between two classes of aliens without a rational purpose.we disagree.distinctions between different classes of aliens in the immigration context are subject to rational basis review and must be upheld if they are rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.ram ins,cir.section permits certain aliens who were in deportation proceedings before april,to file a motion to reopen to seek c relief that they were denied on the basis of the decision of the attorney general in in re soriano,wl bia,which was overruled by.section i,however,states that a liens with a final order of deportation who have illegally returned to the united states are not eligible for reopening under.the government has a legitimate interest in discouraging aliens who have already been deported from illegally reentering,and this distinction is rationally related to that purpose.
consequently,because the attorney general has proffered a rational basis for distinguishing an alien who has reentered the country illegally from one who never had departed with respect to c relief,we do not believe that runs afoul of the equal protection clause 
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court dismissing petition for the writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.
c provided c nonapplicability of subsection a aliens lawfully admitted for permanent resident who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,may be admitted in the discretion of the attorney general without regard to the provisions of subsection a of this section other than paragraphs and c.nothing contained in this subsection shall limit the authority of the attorney general to exercise the discretion vested in him under section b of this title.the first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to an alien who has been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of at least years.
eventually pleaded guilty to the criminal indictment.his conviction currently is on appeal to this court.see united states.
the former recently has been redesignated for the sake of consistency,we use the former designation throughout this opinion.
one ground of dismissal urged by the respondents was that the issue of the motion to reopen was not ripe because the bia had not yet ruled on the motion.see.
if had been released on bail pending his trial on the charge,the proper respondent would have been the court under whose order was temporarily released.see reimnitz state attorney of cook county,cir.
the respondents maintain that,even if had named the proper custodian in his habeas action,there are other barriers to our granting relief,namely,that has waived any challenge to the deportation order by departing the country.according to the respondents,the former bars habeas relief to aliens who have left the country pursuant to a deportation order.that provision states an order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available as of right under the immigration laws and regulations or if he has departed from the united states after the issuance of the order.every petition for review or for habeas corpus shall state whether the validity of the order has been upheld in any prior judicial proceeding,and,if so,the nature and date thereof,and the court in which such proceeding took place.no petition for review or for habeas corpus shall be entertained if the validity of the order has been previously determined in any civil or criminal proceeding,unless the petition presents grounds which the court finds could not have been presented in such prior proceeding,or the court finds that the remedy provided by such prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order c emphasis added.consequently,a district court can not review an order of deportation by way of habeas if the petitioner has departed after issuance of the order.see,goonsuwan ashcroft,cir.counters that the former does not apply to him by virtue of iirira transitional rules.those rules provide in relevant part c transition for certain aliens.general rule that new rules do not to the succeeding provisions of this subsection,in the case of an alien who is in exclusion or deportation proceedings before the title effective date a the amendments made by this subtitle shall not apply,and b the proceedings including judicial review thereof shall continue to be conducted without regard to such amendments.transitional changes in judicial the case in which a final order of exclusion or deportation is entered more than days after the date of the enactment of this act,notwithstanding any provision of section of the immigration and nationality act section of this title as in effect as of the date of the enactment of this act,to the contrary g there shall be no appeal permitted in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a or section a a iii,b,c,or d of the immigration and nationality act sections a or a a iii,b,c,or d of this title as in effect as of the date of the enactment of this act,or any offense covered by section a a ii of such act section a a ii of this title as in effect on such date for which both predicate offenses are,without regard to their date of commission,otherwise covered by section a a i of such act section a a i of this title as so in effect statutory notes emphasis added.acknowledges that the transitional rules generally exempt from iirira coverage those individuals whose proceedings were instituted prior to iirira passage.however,he also points out that the transitional rules state that,notwithstanding any provisions of,there is no further review of bia orders for individuals whose final order of deportation issued after october,and w
