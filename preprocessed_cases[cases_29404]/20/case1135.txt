kenneth eugene foster was convicted in texas state court of capital murder during the course of a robbery in and sentenced to death.the district court granted conditional habeas relief on foster claimed unconstitutional sentence under the eighth amendment,as construed in enmund florida,d,and tison arizona,d,because the jury did not make the requisite factual findings whether foster acted with reckless indifference to human life and whether he played a major role in the activities leading to the murder.for foster remaining claims,the court denied relief and a certificate of appealability coa.see.
the state appeals the conditional.subsequent to our recent denial of foster coa request,foster dretke,wl cir.march,petition for cert.filed,june,foster requested another coa to pursue a claim.in so doing,he maintained a coa request for that claim had been inadvertently omitted from his initial coa request.oral argument addressed the state appeal and the extremely belated coa request.
coa denied conditional habeas relief granted by the district court vacated habeas relief denied.
on the evening of august,foster and three brown,dewayne dillard,and julius on armed robberies around san antonio,texas,beginning with brown announcing he had a gun and asking whether the others wanted to rob people i have the strap,do you all want to jack.during the phase of foster trial,steen testified he rode in the front seat,looking for potential victims,while foster drove.
steen and brown testified to robbing two different groups at gunpoint that night the four men divided the stolen property equally.the criminal conduct continued into the early hours of the next day august,when foster began following a vehicle driven by mary patrick.
patrick testified she and michael lahood,were returning in separate cars to his house she arrived and noticed foster vehicle turn around and stop in front of michael lahood house patrick approached foster vehicle to ascertain who was following her she briefly spoke to the men in the vehicle,then walked away towards michael lahood,who had reached the house and exited his vehicle she saw a man with a scarf across his face and a gun in his hand exit foster vehicle and approach her and michael lahood michael lahood told her to go inside the house,and she ran towards the door,but tripped and fell she looked back and saw the gunman pointing a gun at michael lahood face,demanding his keys,money,and wallet michael lahood responded that patrick had the keys and patrick heard a loud bang.
michael lahood died from a gunshot wound to the head.the barrel of the gun was no more than six inches from his head when he was shot it was likely closer than that.brown had similarly stuck his gun in the faces of some of the night earlier robbery victims.
later that day,all four men were arrested each gave a written statement identifying brown as the shooter.brown admitted being the shooter but denied intent to kill.he testified that he approached michael lahood to obtain patrick telephone number and only drew his weapon when he saw what appeared to be a gun in michael lahood possession and heard what sounded to him like the click of an automatic weapon.
in may,foster and brown were tried jointly for capital murder committed in the course of a robbery.the jury found each guilty of that charge and answered the special issues at the penalty phase to impose a death sentence for each.
on direct appeal,foster contended,inter alia because he did nothing more than agree to commit and participate in robberies,his death sentence violated the eighth amendment application of texas penal code b conspiracy party liability violated the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution and the trial court erred in refusing a jury instruction on the offense of aggravated robbery.the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed foster conviction and sentence.
the court held,inter alia foster sentence did not violate the constitution because,before convicting him of capital murder as a party,the jury had to determine he intended to promote the commission of intentional murder a instruction under b is appropriate when no such charge is in the indictment because the statute describes attempt to carry out,not the offense of,conspiracy and a instruction was not warranted because nothing in the record would permit a rational jury to find foster guilty only of aggravated robbery and not murder in the course of a robbery.see foster state.june unpublished tcca opn.three judges dissented,and would have held,inter alia,that foster was entitled to a instruction.id.at mansfield,dissenting.
the supreme court of the united states denied a writ of certiorari.foster texas,d.
in april,before the conclusion of his direct appeal,foster filed for relief.after holding evidentiary hearings,the court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law,recommending denial of relief the court of criminal appeals denied relief in an unpublished order.ex parte foster.
the supreme court again denied a writ of certiorari.foster texas,d.
foster presented claims in his petition,including the claim for which he belatedly seeks a coa from this court.included with the petition were new affidavits and other supporting evidence,and an evidentiary hearing was requested.the state moved for summary judgment.on march,the district court granted conditional habeas relief as to sentencing for three claims and denied relief,as well as a coa,for the remaining.among other rulings,the requested evidentiary hearing was denied and the state motion was denied as moot.see foster dretke,no,dist.lexis.
each side appealed.to do so,foster requested a coa from our court on two claims.foster,wl,addresses the denial of that request.
review of this habeas proceeding is subject to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa.see,penry johnson,d.before addressing the conditional habeas relief granted by the district court,we consider the belated coa request for a claim.
under aedpa,foster may not appeal the denial of habeas relief unless he obtains a coa from either the district,or this,court.c fed.b slack mcdaniel,d.under federal rule of appellate procedure b,the district court must first decide whether to grant a coa before one can be requested here.as noted,the district court denied a coa for the claim foster seeks to appeal here.
obtaining a coa requires a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c,cockrell,d slack,at.for that requisite showing,an applicant usually must demonstrate reasonable jurists could debate whether or,for that matter,agree that the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further,at.quoting slack,at.where,as here,the district court habeas denial includes a procedural ruling,as opposed to one on the underlying constitutional claim,the showing is expanded.see hall cain,cir.in that situation,the applicant must show jurists of reason would find debatable whether the habeas petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and the district court procedural ruling was correct.id.
in determining whether to grant a coa,this court is,inter alia,limited to a threshold inquiry into the underlying merit of foster claims,at.this threshold inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.id.at.instead,the court must make an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.id.because foster was convicted of capital murder and received the death penalty,any doubts as to whether a coa should issue must be resolved in his favor.hernandez johnson,cir,cert.denied,d.
for purposes of the mandated threshold inquiry,we recognize that,in ruling on the merits,the district court was required by aedpa to defer,with limited exceptions,to the state court resolution of foster claims.the exceptions provided by aedpa turn on the character of the state court ruling.
first,such deference is mandated both for questions of law and for mixed questions of law and fact,unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d see hill johnson,cir,cert.denied,d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law under d if it reaches a legal conclusion in direct conflict with a prior decision of the supreme court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the supreme court based on materially indistinguishable facts.miniel cockrell,cir,cert.denied,d.
second,such deference is required for the state court decision unless it was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in the light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.on the merits,pursuant to aedpa,the state court factual findings are presumed correct in district court,foster had the burden of rebutting that presumption by clear and convincing evidence.e.this threshold inquiry is considered against the elements for foster claim.again,it is but one of the procedures mandated by aedpa for deciding whether a coa should be granted.
as presented in state and federal court,foster seeks a coa for his claim he is innocent,as proven by dillard testimony during a evidentiary hearing and an affidavit from steen presented for the first time during the proceeding.before addressing the request,we must decide whether to consider it because of its untimeliness.
foster initial coa request to our court was filed on june and addressed two claims neither concerned actual innocence.on june,the state filed its opposition it did not,of course,address,as foster had not raised the issue.foster filed a reply brief on july for his coa request and a on october to the state reply brief regarding its appeal from the conditional,in which he also addressed his coa request.neither of foster reply briefs addressed or claimed he had inadvertently failed to include that issue in his coa application.it is assumed that,in replying to the state briefs,foster counsel read them.obviously,in doing so,he should have noticed an claim was not addressed.
foster did not make this assertion until after our march.on march,approximately ten months after foster initial coa application was filed,foster counsel filed a motion for consideration of inadvertently omitted issue,claiming that,while reading our march coa denial,he immediately noticed that the opinion addressed only two issues there was no mention regarding the claim.that motion stated counsel brief for the initial request included twelve pages of argument about whether a reasonable and fair jury would more likely have acquitted foster in light of the accounts of dwayne dillard and julius steen and this issue not being addressed in the march alarmed counsel.counsel then acknowledged he had failed in the initial application to submit the portion of his brief addressing dillard and steen,and asked our court to consider the omitted issue.
pursuant to aedpa,there is no limitations period governing the filing of coa requests.of course,foster april notice of appeal satisfied the related limitations period for filing an appeal.fed.in any event,in a situation such as this,where foster appealed the denial of relief on various claims and requested a coa for that,he generally would have waived any claim not addressed in his coa.
foster situation,however,is somewhat different than the usual case where a party waives a claim by failing to raise it.here,counsel claims he unintentionally failed to do so because he filed the wrong brief.
as noted,foster initial coa request to our court was denied.generally,we would not consider this new request.because the state appeal is pending in our court,however,we will consider the coa request for the claim.counsel in future cases are warned that,should they seek to likewise raise coa requests,they may well not be allowed to do so,for obvious reasons.in this instance,counsel purported reasons for failing to initially request a coa on this issue are nothing short of inexcusable.
pursuant to a plea agreement,steen testified at trial against brown and foster dillard did not testify.foster maintains dillard testimony in the proceeding and steen affidavit in the proceeding clarifying steen trial testimony demonstrate foster actual innocence and ineligibility for the death penalty.
as of the evidentiary hearing,dillard had already begun serving a for another capital murder he committed with steen.dillard testified there was no agreement to commit robberies the night of michael lahood murder although he dillard provided the gun,he had nothing to do with the robberies or the murder foster was just the group driver,not the getaway driver after the second robbery,foster said he wanted to stop,so dillard took the gun back and believed no more robberies would be committed that night he directed foster to drive through the residential area where michael lahood lived foster stopped because a woman flagged the car down and because steen told him to there was no agreement to rob michael lahood and,after brown shot michael lahood,foster tried to leave but dillard would not let him.
steen affidavit in the proceedings stated concerning his trial testimony that he understood what was probably fixing to go down when brown exited the vehicle at michael lahood residence,he understood,at that point but not before,what might happen steen did not think foster knew what was going to happen there was no agreement to commit robbery everyone was shocked after brown shot michael lahood and by testifying at trial he needed to stay awake because he was riding shotgun,he meant a person gets a good view in the front seat,not that riding in that position means committing robberies.
in denying habeas relief in march,the court of criminal appeals did not address dillard testimony.steen affidavit,of course,was also not mentioned,because it was presented for the first time during proceedings.
in addressing foster claim,the district court first noted herrera collins,d,precludes that claim being brought as an independent ground for habeas relief.foster,dist.lexis,at.rather,the district court noted an claim may be used to raise an otherwise habeas claim.it cited schlup delo,d,for the following proposition a petitioner seeking to surmount a procedural default through a showing of actual innocence must establish it is more likely than not that,in the light of the new evidence,no juror,acting reasonably,would have voted to find the petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.
the district court then stated dillard new testimony and steen affidavit merely repeat the same assertions made by brown trial testimony and foster statements to police namely,that brown exited the vehicle at michael lahood house only to get patrick telephone number and the jury rejected brown testimony by finding him guilty of capital murder.the court also stated the jury implicitly rejected foster claims to police that he was not involved in the night robberies he had no idea brown carried a gun when he approached michael lahood and,when brown exited the vehicle,foster did not think brown was going to rob michael lahood.the court held because dillard new testimony and steen affidavit merely repeat testimony the jury heard and rejected,there is no reasonable possibility any rational jury would have found foster not guilty of capital murder based on that testimony and affidavit.foster,dist.lexis,at.
foster conceded during oral argument his claim is raised here only as a claim.as the district court held,is not an independently cognizable claim.dowthitt johnson,cir,cert.denied,d see also graves cockrell,cir.
the supreme court recently decided house bell,d,a habeas case in which house,protesting his innocence,sought access to federal court to pursue habeas corpus relief based on constitutional claims that are procedurally barred under state law,id.at and as a claim for such relief,id.at.the court concluded house provided substantial evidence suggesting he might not have committed the murder for which he was convicted and thus held he satisfied the schlup standard,enabling him to use his claim to raise an otherwise procedurally barred habeas claim.id.at.
the court,h
