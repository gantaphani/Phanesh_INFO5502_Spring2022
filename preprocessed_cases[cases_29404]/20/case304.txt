the primary issue in this case,as certified by the district court,is whether a statecourt decision denying an claim can be contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,the prejudice requirement in strickland washington,where petitioner receives identical concurrent sentences,only one of which is the subject of an claim.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
in the early morning hours of may,petitioner appellant jose tavarez shot and killed his girlfriend,liliana alvarez,in her bedroom.tavarez was charged in new with murder in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.he was tried before a jury in new york supreme court,queens county.acceding to a request by the prosecution,the trial court charged the jury on manslaughter as a offense.
at the conclusion of the trial,the jury announced a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.these verdicts are not in question.
the clerk of the court then asked about the weapons charge and the following exchange took place 
the clerk as to the second count of the indictment,criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree,how do you find the defendant 
the foreperson not guilty.
the clerk so that we are clear,i will ask you again,as to the second count of the indictment,criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree,how do you find the defendant 
the foreperson not guilty.
the clerk ladies and gentlemen of the jury,listen to the verdict as it stands recorded,criminal possession of a weapon 
the court do you want to go back and fill the rest of the box in go back and fill it out.

whereupon,the jury entered the courtroom 
the clerk let the record reflect the deliberating trial jurors are once again present in the courtroom.madam foreperson,as to the second count of the indictment,criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree,how do you find the defendant 
the foreperson guilty.
tavarez app.
the court then polled the jurors,who unanimously reported that their verdict was not guilty as to murder,but guilty as to manslaughter in the first degree and guilty as to criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.on september,tavarez was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of fifteen years,to be followed by five years of supervised release,on the manslaughter and weapons convictions.he was also assessed a mandatory surcharge.
on direct appeal to the appellate division in,tavarez,through counsel,argued that he had been denied his fourteenth amendment right to a fair trial and also suggested that he had been placed in double jeopardy when the trial court sent the jury back to the jury room following its announcement of a not guilty verdict on the weapons count.tavarez added that if the appellate division was inclined to find the claim unpreserved,then it should hold that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the trial court sent the jury back into the jury room.the appellate division rejected the claim,stating that t he defendant remaining contention is not preserved for appellate review and,in any event,is without merit,and did not expressly address tavarez claim.people tavarez,leave to appeal denied,table.
tavarez then commenced state proceedings by filing a motion to vacate the judgment,pursuant to.proc.law h,in the state trial court in which he was convicted.tavarez again asserted,among other things,that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the trial court sent the jury back.the state court found that tavarez failed to raise the claim before the appellate division on direct appeal,and thus deemed the claim procedurally barred on grounds.
tavarez subsequently filed a petition for habeas corpus pursuant to.the district court cogan,denied relief.tavarez larkin,civ,wl,at may.as to ineffective assistance of counsel,the court ruled that while tavarez counsel had been deficient in failing to to the verdict procedure,tavarez could not establish prejudice under the deferential standad of review mandated by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa because he had been sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment.see id.at.
as for the claim,which the district court interpreted as including a claim,the district court agreed with the appellate division that the claims had been procedurally defaulted in the trial court when counsel failed to object.see id.at.moreover,tavarez could not,the district court held,overcome this procedural bar by arguing that trial counsel was ineffective because review of state court decisions on claims advanced solely to overcome a procedural bar are themselves subject to aedpa deference.see id.at.in other words,whether advanced as an independent ground for relief,or as cause to excuse a procedural default and reach the merits of separate claims,tavarez ineffective assistance claim was doomed by aedpa.the district court issued a certificate of appealability as to two specific questions whether a state court decision denying an ineffective assistance of counsel claim can be contrary to,or an unreasonable application of the prejudice requirement in strickland,where the petitioner received concurrent sentences,only one of which is the subject of the ineffective assistance claim and whether,when a state court has held that a claim is procedurally barred,and that the bar will not be excused by ineffective assistance of counsel,a federal habeas court should apply aedpa deference in considering whether that ineffective assistance of counsel claim can serve as cause and prejudice for excusing the procedural default.id.tavarez appeals.
discussion 
we review a district court denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo and the underlying state court decision on the merits for an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.lynch dolce,cir quoting rivas fischer,cir see d.where,as here,the state court does not provide reasons for its dismissal of a petitioner claim on the merits,we consider what arguments or theories could have supported the state court decision,and may grant habeas only if there could be no disagreement among fairminded jurists that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of the supreme court.harrington richter.
as an initial matter,we decline the district attorney invitation to dispose of this case by invoking the discretionary concurrent sentence doctrine.see united states davis,cir recognizing that concurrent sentences do not moot a challenge to one of the two sentences.
we therefore proceed to consider tavarez claims.tavarez first contends that he is entitled to habeas relief because he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial when his attorney failed to object to the jury verdict on the weapons count.under strickland washington,tavarez must show that his attorney performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,id.at,and that there was prejudice,meaning a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,id.at see also lynch,at describing strickland prejudice as meaning a reasonable probability that,but for counsel error,the outcome would have been different emphasis added.on appeal,tavarez does not dispute that the state courts rejected his claim on the merits thus,to obtain habeas relief on his claim,tavarez must establish that the state court rejection of the claim was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
we agree with the district court that even assuming,arguendo,that trial counsel in this case acted unreasonably in failing to object,tavarez can not show prejudice.we therefore answer the first question in the certificate of appealability in the negative.tavarez argues that this case is governed by our decision in jackson leonardo,cir,in which we held that the potential collateral consequences of a conviction were sufficient to establish strickland prejudice,even where the defendant received identical concurrent sentenc
