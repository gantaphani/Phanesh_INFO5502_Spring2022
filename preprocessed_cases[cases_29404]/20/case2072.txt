alonzo perry was convicted in a wisconsin state court as a party to a crime on several counts,including first degree intentional homicide,and was sentenced to life imprisonment.after pursuing direct appeals and proceedings in the state court system,perry filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in federal district court,arguing that the wisconsin court of appeals had unreasonably applied federal law in violation of his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel and his fourteenth amendment right to due process.the district court denied his petition,and perry appeals.we affirm.
factual procedural background 
in the early morning hours of august,harry roberts was killed and two other men,michael moore and walter parker,were injured in an armed robbery and shooting incident outside of havana tavern in milwaukee,wisconsin.three persons,alonzo perry,joenathon burnley and leugene hampton,were arrested and tried for their involvement in the crime.all three of the accused were clearly involved in the crime.there is some dispute as to the degree of involvement and who actually pulled the trigger during the assault.
at the trial of alonzo perry,the state presented testimony by the two wounded men,by a witness,howard thomas,and by police officers walsh and july,who had arrived at the scene as the incident was occurring.immediately following the incident,parker told detectives that he had seen three men with masks come out of a field and then run back into it after the shooting.thomas testified that he saw three men running from the scene.moore testified that he was at the bar with roberts and parker that evening,that the three of them left the bar at closing and went to roberts car,and that moore got into the passenger side while roberts got into the driver side.moore explained that he then heard multiple coming from the sidewalk,saw the barrel of a gun sticking through the window and closed his eyes.he felt that he had been shot in the arm and heard the person with the gun say,this is a jack.moore testified that a second person with a gun was standing behind the person talking to him,and that the second person gun was not pointed at the car.moore further testified that the first person asked for money and reached into his front shirt pocket and took twenty dollars.he stated that the second person said,this is enough money,shoot him anyway.moore testified that he told the first person he had more money in his shoe,and that the first person then removed his moore sock and the two men then left.moore testified that the weapon the first man pointed at him looked like a nine millimeter weapon.moore further testified that he had heard two guns going off in rapid sequence,that he was sure if both guns were fired into roberts car,and that he did not know whether the shots from the second gun came from the second person standing outside his door or from somewhere else.all of the bullet casings found near the scene of the shooting,and all of the bullets found in roberts car and in the victims,came from a nine millimeter gun.a single caliber bullet was lodged inside the radio of a car parked in front of roberts car.the evidence indicated that the bullet had entered that car through the rear window.
perry and hampton were apprehended and arrested close to the scene,and burnley was apprehended and arrested later.when perry was found,he was carrying a magazine for a caliber handgun and he was missing a shoe.police recovered his shoe in a nearby yard and they found a caliber handgun near the shoe.the handgun had the capacity to hold eight rounds,seven in the magazine and one in the chamber.when the gun was found,the magazine contained six rounds and there was one unfired cartridge in the chamber.the nine millimeter weapon itself was never found.the next morning,however,a nine millimeter magazine was found near the spot where perry and hampton had been apprehended.
in the days following his arrest,perry made two separate statements to detectives which were also admitted at his trial.in the first statement,he asserted that burnley was the primary actor in the shooting,that burnley had the nine millimeter weapon,that he had fired all the shots into the car and into the victims and that his brother,hampton,who was present at the scene,was not involved in the incident.in his second statement,he stated that he and burnley arrived at the bar around and that burnley had hampton nine millimeter handgun and was taking it to hampton,who was already at the club.perry also admitted that he was carrying his own weapon.perry further stated that,before going into the bar,burnley left the nine millimeter under the seat of the car,as the tavern had a metal detector,but that perry kept his gun with him since he knew he could not get into the bar since he was only nineteen.perry explained that he waited outside for burnley and hampton and they came out around.he further stated that the three of them walked to burnley car and got ready to rob anyone that was walking down the street with some gold on.they got into the car,and all put on masks or skull caps.hampton then got the gun from underneath the seat.while watching for victims,hampton pointed to three men walking toward a car parked behind them and stated man,let get them.let get them.in recounting the shooting this time,however,perry now stated that hampton was the primary actor and that hampton had the nine millimeter weapon and fired all of the shots into the car.he also stated that burnley was involved as a searcher,but was unarmed.in both statements,perry admitted that he was present,was armed with a handgun,that he fired the gun once,into the air,but not toward any car or person and that he did not know that any actual shooting of persons was going to take place.
on august,perry was charged with one count of first degree intentional homicide as a party to the crime,under.and two counts of attempt to commit first degree intentional homicide as a party to the crime,under,and and one count of armed robbery as a party to the crime,under.a and.the state theory at trial was that perry agreed to participate in an armed robbery and was therefore guilty of each count as a party to the crime,because under wisconsin law a party to a crime is liable for the natural and probable consequences of a crime,here armed robbery.see.c.thus,the state argued that the intentional murder of roberts and the attempted intentional murders of moore and parker were the natural and probable consequences of an armed robbery.
perry defense theory was that intentional murder was not the natural and probable consequence of armed robbery,and thus at most he was guilty as a party to a crime of felony murder,which in wisconsin occurs where a person causes the death of another during the commission of a felony,see.to support this theory,perry counsel argued that perry did not have the requisite intent to kill and had no advance knowledge that anyone would be shot during the robbery.based on this theory,at the jury instruction conference,defense counsel requested the court to instruct the jury on felony murder,as well as on first and second degree reckless homicide.the state objected to the latter instructions but did not object to a felony murder instruction,and the court agreed to give the jury that instruction,although it refused to give instructions on first or second degree reckless homicide.it is at this point we encounter the pivotal issue in this appeal.in requesting the felony murder instruction,perry counsel did not specifically discuss the need for the party to a crime instruction to reference the felony murder instruction,and,as a result,the party to a crime instruction was only given with reference to the intentional homicide charge,and did not refer to the alternative,lesser included offense of felony murder.
the end result was that the trial court instructed the jury in the following manner first,the instruction for the substantive offense of first degree intentional homicide and the lesser included offense of felony murder second,the instruction for attempted first degree intentional homicide third,the instruction for armed robbery and last,the party to a crime instruction,specifically referencing the first degree intentional homicide charge 
on february,the jury convicted perry of first degree intentional homicide as a party to the crime,two counts of attempt to commit first degree intentional homicide as a party to the crime,and one count of armed robbery as a party to the crime.on march,the state court judge sentenced him to life imprisonment on count one,with eligibility for parole to occur in not less than years,to years on count two,to be served consecutively,and years on count three to be served concurrently.on count iv,perry was sentenced to years to be served consecutively to the other counts,but that sentence was stayed.additionally,perry received years of probation consecutive to counts one,two and three.
perry appealed his conviction in state court,raising issues which are not part of this appeal.on september,the wisconsin court of appeals affirmed his convictions.the wisconsin supreme court denied his petition for review on november.perry then filed for relief in wisconsin state circuit court,raising several claims,including whether his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to ensure that a jury instruction on party to a crime liability referenced the felony murder charge and whether the wisconsin jury instruction on the natural and probable consequences theory of party to a crime liability impermissibly removed the burden from the state of proving the defendant intent to kill.as to his first argument,perry contended that,since the evidence was undisputed that he did not shoot roberts,the jury could not have found him guilty of felony murder according to the jury instructions provided.the only choice left to the jury,perry argued,was to convict him of intentional homicide as a party to a crime.however,if the jury had been given a party to a crime instruction in relation to the felony murder instruction,perry believes that the jury might have convicted him on that lesser charge instead.as to his second argument,perry argued that an intentional murder was not a natural and probable consequence of armed robbery,and that the party to a crime jury instruction incorporating that theory relieved the state of its burden to prove his intent.
the state court denied all of perry claims,holding that under state,he could not raise constitutional issues for the first time in relief without demonstrating sufficient cause for not having raised the issues on direct appeal.id.at.concluding that he had not demonstrated such cause,the court held that he had procedurally defaulted those issues.perry appealed,and the court of appeals also denied his claims for relief.perry filed a timely petition for review to the wisconsin supreme court,which denied his request on december.
perry filed a petition for habeas relief under section d in federal district court,raising the same issues.the district court concluded that perry had procedurally defaulted the claim that the natural and probable consequences jury instruction violated his right to due process,and therefore denied him habeas relief on that basis.regarding perry ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the district court concluded that the state had waived its argument that perry procedurally defaulted this claim by failing to address it in its brief,and therefore proceeded to address the merits.in doing so,the district court concluded that the court of appeals had not unreasonably applied strickland washington in denying perry relief,and therefore denied his claim for habeas relief on this ground as well.the district court noted that it would have been preferable for the party to a crime instruction to specifically refer to felony murder by stating that perry could be guilty of felony murder if he or another fired the fatal shot,but concluded that,in the context of the entire trial,including the evidence presented,the arguments of both sides,and the totality of the jury instructions,counsel failure to request a more precisely tailored instruction did not cause prejudice to perry as required by strickland.accordingly,the district court denied perry habeas relief on all grounds perry filed a motion for a certificate of appealability,which the district court granted.perry now appeals.
ii.analysis 
applicable standards 
perry argues that he is in custody in violation of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.specifically,he argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel under the sixth amendment and strickland washington,d,because his trial counsel failed to ensure that a jury instruction on party to a crime liability was integrated with the jury instruction on the lesser included offense of felony murder.further,he argues that he was denied due process under the fourteenth amendment,sandstrom montana,d and in re winship,d because the trial court used a jury instruction on the natural and probable consequences theory of party to a crime liability,which he claims impermissibly shifted the burden of proof on intent to him.
in reviewing the district court decision to deny habeas corpus relief,we review issues of law de novo and issues of fact for clear error.see,todd schomig,cir.a defendant may only obtain habeas relief from a state court conviction where he establishes that the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.see d.
under the unreasonable application clause of section d,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.williams taylor,d,concurring,but writing for the court.thus,we will defer to a reasonable state court decision.anderson cowan,cir.
moreover,federal habeas relief is only available to a person in custody in violation of the united states constitution or laws or treaties of the united states,see a,and is unavailable to remedy errors of state law.see estelle mcguire,d it is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine determinations on questions.a federal court will also not review a question of federal law decided by a state court if the decision of the state court rests on a state procedural ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.stewart smith,d coleman thompson,d.against this backdrop,we consider perry claims.
alleged constitutional violations 
sixth amendment strickland 
first,perry argues that the wisconsin court of appeals determination that he was not deprived of effective assistance of counsel was unreasonable in light of strickland washington,d.the rule set forth in strickland is clearly established federal law,see d,and provides that perry must establish that his attorney performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and the deficient performance caused him prejudice.at.specifically,perry argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to ensure that the jury instruction on party to a crime liability included a reference to the lesser included offense of felony murder.as noted,the jury instruction on party to a crime liability was only integrated with the first degree intentional homicide charge,and not with any of the others,including felony murder.this omission,perry contends,was fatal because his defense theory was that,at most,he was guilty of felony murder,as a party to the crime,not of first degree intentional homicide.however,since the party to a crime instruction did not reference the lesser included offense of felony murder,perry argues that his theory was wasted on the jury because,by not being properly instructed,it was unable to find him guilty of the lesser offense,even though they may not have been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of first degree intentional homicide.
the wisconsin court of appeals recited the appropriate strickland test and,in concluding that perry counsel had not been ineffective,reasoned that the jury instructions in their entirety properly set forth the law on party to a crime liability.perry,however,argues that this is unreasonable because the mere fact that the party to a crime liability instructions were given for the first degree intentional murder charge can not cure the defect with respect to the felony murder charge.because we have concerns about the propriety of these instructions at a minimum,they were not clearly drafted,we will assume for purposes of this decision that perry counsel was deficient in failing to object to them.however,that does not end the inquiry.rather,we must also determine whether the court of appeals was unreasonable in concluding that the jury could have independently determined that perry was guilty of first degree intentional homicide,and therefore that perry was not prejudiced by the instructions.
initially,perry argues that the court of appeals,by considering whether the jury could have independently determined that perry was guilty of first degree intentional homicide,improperly applied a sufficiency of the evidence standard,as opposed to the strickland standard.we disagree.under strickland prejudice prong,perry must establish that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.at.by considering whether the jury could have independently reached the verdict it did,the court of appeals was merely reaching the conclusion that any error by perry counsel was not prejudicial.therefore,it applied the proper standard.we now consider whether its application was unreasonable.
as noted above,under strickland,to establish prejudice,perry must prove there is a reasonable probability that,but for the counsel failure to object to the improper instruction,the result of the proceeding would have been different.perry argues that there is a reasonable probability that the jury believed it could not impose felony murder because of the improper instruction,but not wanting to let him completely off the hook,found him guilty of first degree intentional homicide.given the instructions in their entirety,the testimony presented to the jury,the arguments of both the state and perry counsel and the overwhelming evidence of perry guilt,we conclude that it is not reasonable to conclude that the instruction led the jury to believe that it could convict perry of felony murder only if he directly caused the death of the victim.see cupp naughten,d courts must review instructions in the context of the overall charge which includes testimony of witnesses,argument of counsel,receipt of exhibits in evidence,and instruction of the jury by the judge.the charges,the attorneys arguments,perry own statements offered into evidence and the jury instructions as a whole all spoke in terms of perry culpability on each count as a party to the crime.thus,it was absolutely clear at trial that perry was being charged,on all counts,as a party to the crime furthermore,the jury was specifically instructed not to reach the felony murder charge if it found perry guilty of first degree intentional homicide.we presume that juries follow instructions.see united states miller,cir.thus,even assuming that the party to a crime instruction should have referenced the felony murder instruction,once the jury concluded that perry was guilty of first degree intentional homicide,as a party to the crime,the jury never needed to reach the felony murder instruction.under these circumstances,there is no reasonable probability that,but for counsel error in failing to object to the jury instruction,the result of the proceeding would have been different.see strickland,at.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.for these reasons,we conclude that the court of appeals reasonably concluded that perry did not suffer prejudice because of the jury instructions.
due process rights 
next,perry argues that the wisconsin court of appeals erred because the trial court use of wisconsin pattern jury instruction on the natural and probable consequences theory of party to a crime liability impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to him in violation of his fourteenth amendment due process rights as set forth in sandstrom montana,d,and in re winship,d.
as previously noted,we may not review a federal claim,such as perry due process claim,if the state court rests its decision on a state procedural ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.stewart,at.at.wisconsin has a procedural rule that bars a criminal defendant from raising,in a postconviction motion,a constitutional issue that could have been,but was not,raised on direct appeal from his conviction,unless the defendant can offer a sufficient reason for not asserting the issue on his direct appeal.see,at.although this court has recognized the rule as an adequate state ground,that question is not at issue here.see liegakos cooke,cir.perry argument is that the court of appeals reliance on this ground was not independent of the federal question.
in support of this position,perry cites harris reed,d,wherein the supreme court held that the adequate and independent state ground doctrine does not bar habeas review of the federal claim unless the state court actually relied on the procedural default as an independent basis for its decision.at.to be an independent basis for the state court ruling,the state court therefore must have clearly and expressly relied on procedural default as the basis of its ruling.braun powell,cir.perry claims that the state court of appeals did not clearly and expressly deny his due process claim on procedural default grounds,and therefore that basis can not serve as an independent and adequate state ground.
to understand his argument a little additional detail is necessary.it is undisputed that perry failed to raise his due process claim on direct appeal the first time he raised it was in his motion for relief in wisconsin state court.as previously noted,on perry petition for relief,the wisconsin state court denied all of perry claims,holding that he had procedurally defaulted them under the rule and that he had not demonstrated sufficient reason for his failure to raise the issues on direct appeal.nevertheless,the state court went on to consider the merits of perry sixth amendment claim,reviewed the record,and concluded that the claim lacked merit and that his counsel performance was not deficient or prejudicial.the state court did not reach the merits of perry due process claim.perry appealed,and the court of appeals also denied his claims for relief.the court of appeals agreed with the state court that perry had procedurally defaulted his claims and that perry offered only conclusory allegations for his failure to raise the issues on direct appeal.reciting the supreme court test in strickland washington,d,the court of appeals further held that perry trial counsel was not ineffective because the jury instructions,in their entirety,properly set forth the law on party to a crime liability as it relates to felony murder.next,the court of appeals concluded that,based on the evidence presented at trial,the jury could have independently determined that perry committed first degree intentional homicide as a party to a crime,and therefore perry had not been prejudiced.while affirming the trial court order in its entirety,the court of appeals did not specifically address perry argument regarding a violation of his due process rights.in its analysis,the district court reasoned that the court of appeals had merely overlooked the due process claim,and thus concluded that it was clear that perry had procedurally defaulted the argument.perry argues,however,that the court of appeals did not actually rely,through a clear and express statement,on the procedural rule and that its silence on the due process claim indicates that it did not rest its decision on an independent and adequate state procedural ground.
however,a close review of the court of appeals decision reveals that it did clearly and expressly rest its decision regarding perry due process claim on procedural default.after restating all of perry arguments,including his due process argument,the court of appeals stated that the circuit court denied perry postconviction motion without a hearing,finding that the claims were barred by,and that the allegations in the motion did not state a sufficient reason to overcome that bar.the court then recited the standard and concluded w e agree with the state that since perry has already had a direct appeal in this case,in order to succeed here,he must show that postconviction counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the effectiveness of trial counsel in either a postconviction motion on or direct appeal.the court of appeals then addressed the merits of perry ineffective assistance of counsel claim,and in concluding that trial counsel did not err in failing to object to the jury instructions,necessarily concluded that perry had not established that his postconviction counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the trial counsel conduct.the court of appeals then held that,under the rule,perry had not established sufficient reason for his procedural default.thus,while the court of appeals did not address impact with specific reference to perry due process argument,it is still clear from its decision that the court considered the argument to have been procedurally defaulted.therefore,while it is possible that the wisconsin court of appeals could have been more precise,we find that its statements,when considered in context,are sufficiently plain to constitute reliance on the independent and adequate state law ground of procedural default.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons stated herein,we conclude that perry did not establish that the wisconsin court of appeals unreasonably applied the strickland washington test in determining that perry sixth amendment right to counsel had not been violated,and that perry argument that the jury instructions violated his due process rights under the fourteenth amendment is barred by an independent and adequate state ground,procedural default.therefore,we affirm the decision of the district court to deny perry petition for habeas corpus relief under.
the jury instructions provided,in relevant part 
the defendant in this case is charged with first degree intentional homicide.you must first consider whether the defendant is guilty of that offense.if you are not satisfied that the defendant is guilty of first degree intentional homicide,you must consider whether or not the defendant is guilty of felony murder,which is a less serious degree of criminal homicide.
intentional homicide and felony murder require that the defendant caused the death of the victim.first degree intentional homicide requires the state to prove the additional fact that the defendant acted with the intent to kill.felony murder requires the state to prove that the defendant caused the death of harry roberts while committing or attempting to commit the crime of armed robbery.
the elements necessary to constitute each crime will now be defined for you in greater detail.
the court then gave the jury substantive instructions on first degree intentional homicide,felony murder and attempt to commit first degree intentional homicide.each instruction was phrased in terms of the defendant actions or intent.
the court then proceeded to give the party to a crime instruction,as follows 
the criminal code of wisconsin provides that whoever is concerned in the commission of a crime may be charged with and convicted of the commission of a crime although he did not directly commit it.
the state contends that the defendant was concerned in the commission of the crime of armed robbery as a member of a conspiracy or as an aider and abetter.
before you may find the defendant guilty,you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was a member of a conspiracy or aided and abetted to commit the crime of armed robbery,that first degree intentional homicide was committed in pursuance of armed robbery,and that under the circumstances,first degree intentional homicide was a natural and probable consequence of armed robbery.
first,consider whether the defendant was a member of a conspiracy or aided and abetted to commit the crime of armed robbery 
next consider whether the crime of first degree intentional homicide was committed.
first degree intentional homicide,as defined in the criminal code of wisconsin,is committed by one who causes the death of another human being with intent to kill that person or another.the state must prove by evidence which satisfies you beyond a reasonable doubt that the following two elements were present.
first,that the defendant or someone he was working with caused the death of harry roberts.
second,that the defendant or someone he was working with intended to kill harry roberts.
mere presence at the scene of the crime and knowledge that a crime is being committed are not sufficient to establish that the defendant aided and abetted the crime,unless you find a reasonable doubt that the defendant was a participant and not merely a knowing spectator.
if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is a member of a conspiracy or aided and abetted the commission of armed robbery,that the crime of first degree intentional homicide was committed,and that under the circumstances first degree intentional homicide was a natural and probable consequence of armed robbery,you should find the defendant guilty.
emphasis added.
perry lawyer committed a fearful mistake at the trial,though not because he told the jury in his closing argument that they should convict his client of felony murder,which is second degree in wisconsin,rather than of murder.he said this because the charge was pat and because if convicted only of felony murder and armed robbery perry would have been eligible for parole after years,while if convicted of murder,as he was,he would be sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole and so he was.but,fatally,his lawyer failed to object to an instruction that,if taken we have no reason to doubt that it the jury from convicting perry of felony murder and,in the circumstances,foredoomed him to be convicted of murder.for the instruction required the jury to find,in order to convict perry of felony murder,that he had caused the murder victim death.the evidence was uncontradicted that the victim was killed by another of the robbers,not perry.the entire point of felony murder is that the felon who did not cause a death,in the ordinary meaning of the word,nevertheless is guilty of a form of murder.perry was charged with and convicted of murder under wisconsin party to a crime statute,which makes an aider and abettor or a conspirator liable not only for the crimes that he agreed to assist with or participate in but also for any other crime that was the natural and probable consequence of the crime that he aided an accomplice to commit or that he conspired to commit.c.the and instructions should have been integrated in the sense of being presented to the jury with a clear indication of the difference between the two crimes the difference is not,as the instruction stated,that only felony murder requires proof that the defendant caused the death of the victim.the causation requirements of the two statutes are in fact the same.the difference is that the statute requires that the death have been a natural and probable consequence of the crime that the defendant conspired to commit or aided and abetted the commission of.
it is highly probable that the jury was confused by the wording of wisconsin statute,the gist of which was repeated in the instructions whoever causes the death of another human being while committing or attempting to commit a crime specified in various statutes,including the statute criminalizing armed robbery may be imprisoned for not more than years in excess of the maximum period of imprisonment provided by law for that
