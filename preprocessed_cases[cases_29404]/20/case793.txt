opinion of the court 
federal prisoner joseph fiorelli filed a pro se motion under to set aside his conviction on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court denied the motion without conducting a hearing on fiorelli claim.fiorelli responded with a motion to reconsider,which the district court also denied.this appeal followed.
we consider whether fiorelli filed his notice of appeal within the time limits of federal rule of appellate procedure a,and hence,whether we have jurisdiction to consider this case.we conclude that in computing the time for an appeal,any delay by the prison officials in transmitting the district court order denying fiorelli motion must be subtracted from the time for filing a motion for reconsideration.prison delay,if established,would toll the limitation for filing a motion under federal rule of civil procedure,and make fiorelli appeal timely.the present record does not contain the relevant dates of the prison receipt and delivery of the district court order denying fiorelli motion.we will therefore vacate the district court dismissal,and remand for the appropriate factual findings.
background 
on december,fiorelli was sentenced to months imprisonment following his convictions for racketeering,extortion,embezzlement,and obstruction of justice.some six years later,on january,fiorelli filed a motion to set aside his conviction pursuant to alleging ineffective assistance of counsel during his trial.fiorelli motion alleged that his counsel failed to disclose a plea agreement offered by the government that would have resulted in a term of imprisonment.fiorelli allegedly learned of this plea offer during a conversation with thomas carroll,an attorney and family friend.carroll did not represent fiorelli in his criminal trial,and fiorelli alleged only that carroll was aware of a plea offer.
on april,the district court denied fiorelli motion.on about april,fiorelli,again representing himself,filed a motion for reconsideration purportedly under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court denied the motion for reconsideration in a second opinion entered on may.fiorelli then filed a notice of appeal on july.we issued a certificate of appealability limited to the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel.
discussion 
determining whether we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal requires us to address several novel questions.first,whether the federal rules of civil procedure are applicable to motions.second,when a district court order is deemed entered under the federal rules.third,whether our decisions regarding the mailbox rule in prison suits apply to motions for reconsideration.this analysis is necessitated by the long delay in fiorelli notice of appeal.the district court denied fiorelli motion on april,and under federal rule of appellate procedure a b fiorelli had sixty days to file a notice of appeal.as fiorelli appeal was not filed until july,his appeal is untimely unless the limitation is tolled.
we first consider the applicability of the federal rules of civil procedure to this motion.section permits federal prisoners to challenge their sentence in a proceeding before the sentencing court,rather than the district court in the jurisdiction where the prisoner is confined.kaufman united states,d t he legislation was intended simply to provide in the sentencing court a remedy exactly commensurate with that which had previously been available by habeas corpus in the district the prisoner was confined.quoting hill united states,d united states nahodil,cir.historically,a federal prisoner motion to vacate,set aside,or correct a sentence,under was considered an independent civil suit,and not a proceeding in the original criminal prosecution.heflin united states,d united states hayman.neely united states,cir washington united states,cir.congress and the supreme court altered this tradition in with the adoption of the rules governing section proceedings for the united states district courts the section rules.pub,stat.the advisory committee notes to the section rules state that contrary to the supreme court earlier decisions,a motion under is a further step in the movant criminal case and not a separate civil action section rule advisory committee notes discussing,at.
the section rules do not automatically make all of the federal rules of procedure applicable to motions,and the district courts are instructed to apply either the federal rules of civil procedure or criminal procedure if no other procedure is specifically prescribed.section rule.rule,however,specifically prescribes that t he time for appeal from an order entered on a motion for relief made pursuant to these rules is as provided in rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure.thus,while a motion is deemed a further step in the movant criminal case,it is also considered a civil remedy for purposes of appellate jurisdiction.
confusion arises from the interplay of section rules and,because neither explains whether the federal rules of civil procedure related to appellate rule a are also applicable.see,fed.a a measuring the time to file an appeal from the entry of the order disposing of motions under federal rules of civil procedure b,b,and.in this case,we are concerned with the requirement under civil rule that judgments be set forth on a separate document and entered in the docket of the district clerk,and the time limitations accompanying motions for reconsideration under civil rules and.
the majority of the circuit courts considering the separate document requirement of civil rule a have concluded that the rule applies to motions.united states johnson,collecting cases and see jenkins united states,cir discussing practice prior to promulgation of civil rule,and holding that some directive reflecting the final judgment is always required for filing an appeal but see williams united states,cir holding no judgment is required upon an order denying a motion.in addition,both of the circuit decisions to consider the issue have applied civil rules and to motions.united states martin,cir united states clark,cir.
as noted by the second and ninth circuits,motions for reconsideration may be filed in criminal cases.martin,at clark,at.extending the time constraints imposed by civil rules e and b to motions in proceedings creates consistency with petitions for writs of habeas corpus by state prisoners under.browder,dep t of,d applying civil rule to habeas proceeding section rule advisory committee notes b ecause appellate rule a is applicable in habeas cases,it likewise governs in cases even though they are criminal in nature.using the time provisions of both civil rules also synthesizes the directive of section rule to calculate the time for an appeal pursuant to appellant rule a,with the exception of appellate procedure a providing that motions under civil rules and may toll the period for filing a notice of appeal.
for these same reasons,we also hold that the separate document requirement of civil rule a and the entry requirement of b apply to motions.in civil suits,the period for filing a notice of appeal under appellate rule a commences with the entry of a judgment set forth on a separate document as required by civil rule a.gregson assocs.architects gov t of the virgin islands,cir.and as explained in detail below,entry means the entry of the judgment in the civil docket maintained by the clerk office.thus,the direction in section rule to apply appellate rule a includes these related provisions of civil rule that explain how the time limitations for filing a notice of appeal are calculated.johnson,at.
having concluded that the requirements of civil rule apply to proceedings,we take the opportunity to explain the somewhat arcane matter of determining the entry date of district court order under the rule b.houston greiner,cir.the confusion arises from the numerous dates attached to the district court order denying fiorelli motion for reconsideration.the district court dated its order may,and the clerk office stamped the order as received on may.however,the docket sheet prepared by the clerk office notes that the order was entered on may
