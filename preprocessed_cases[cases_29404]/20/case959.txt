this is an appeal from the dismissal of a federal habeas corpus petition as untimely under a limitations provision in the and effective death penalty act aedpa,d a,which requires that a petition be filed within one year of the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking direct review.the petitioner here a maryland prisoner obtained,in a collateral proceeding,an order allowing him to file a belated application for leave to appeal his conviction and sentence.the controlling issue in this case is whether the state appellate court consideration and denial of his appeal application in a subsequent proceeding was direct review.we conclude that it was.as a result,the statute of limitations began to run when the time expired for seeking further direct review through a writ of certiorari from the united states supreme court.because the federal petition was filed within one year of the expiration of the time for seeking direct review,it is not barred by aedpa statute of limitations.accordingly,we reverse and remand.
in october douglas frasch pled guilty to first degree sexual assault in the circuit court for charles county,maryland the maryland circuit court.on december,he was sentenced to life in prison.his lawyer failed to file an application for leave to appeal,which would have been the route for seeking direct review of the conviction and sentence.on december,almost ten years after he was sentenced,frasch filed a petition for postconviction review under the maryland uniform postconviction procedure act the upca,crim.proc.et,in the maryland circuit court.frasch asserted,among other grounds,that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel because his lawyer failed to file an application for leave to appeal his conviction and sentence to the court of special appeals of maryland.frasch time for filing an application for leave to appeal had expired thirty days after he was sentenced.the state attorney conceded that frasch sixth amendment rights had been violated because frasch had not been informed of his right to file an application for leave to appeal by either his lawyer or the sentencing court.as a result,on october,the maryland circuit court entered an order granting frasch the right to file,within thirty days,a belated application for leave to appeal.the court order did not address other issues raised by frasch in his petition,but the order was entered without prejudice to his ability to file an additional petition on the unaddressed issues.on october,frasch filed his application for leave to appeal his conviction and sentence in the court of special appeals of maryland.that court read,considered,and denied his application on july.because frasch application for leave to appeal was denied,he was not entitled to file a petition for a writ of certiorari in the court of appeals of maryland.see,cts.jud.proc.on september,frasch filed a second petition for postconviction review under the upca in the maryland circuit court.in this petition frasch reasserted the issues from his first petition that had not been addressed in the october order allowing him to file a belated application for leave to appeal.after his second petition was denied by the maryland circuit court,the court of special appeals denied his application for leave to appeal on december,thereby ending his state postconviction review.
frasch came to federal court on august,when he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district of maryland.the state of maryland moved to dismiss the petition on the grounds that it was not filed within the statute of limitations prescribed by aedpa.see d a.specifically,maryland argued that frasch conviction became final on january,when the statutory deadline for filing an application for leave to appeal expired.because his conviction became final prior to april,aedpa effective date,maryland argued that the statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition expired one year later,on april.the district court agreed with the state and dismissed frasch petition.frasch now appeals and we review de novo the district court application of d a.see crawley catoe,cir.
aedpa provides that a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.d.this period begins running from the latest of several potential starting dates.see id.d a d.for our purposes,the relevant starting date is the date on which the state judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.id.d a.simply put,the limitation period begins running when direct review of the state conviction is completed or when the time for seeking direct review has expired.hill braxton,cir.as we will explain,frasch federal habeas petition was timely under a straightforward application of d a.
a maryland defendant like frasch who pleads guilty is not entitled to an appeal as a matter of right.such a defendant may,however,seek direct review of his conviction and sentence by filing,within thirty days of judgment,an application for leave to appeal to the court of special appeals of maryland.see,cts.jud.proc.e.b mcelroy state,characterizing a defendant application for leave to appeal after a guilty plea as direct review.if the court of special appeals denies the defendant leave to appeal,he is not permitted to seek review in the court of appeals,maryland highest court.see,cts.jud.proc.the defendant only option for seeking further direct review is to petition,within the allowed time of ninety days,for a writ of certiorari from the united states supreme court.see final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had,may be reviewed by the supreme court by writ of certiorari.in the event the defendant does not file a petition for a writ of certiorari,the time for seeking direct review expires on the ninetieth day after the court of special appeals denies the application for leave to appeal.see d a harris hutchinson,cir.this is the day or date when the statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition begins to run.
on october,the maryland circuit court granted frasch a new deadline for filing an application for leave to appeal his conviction and sentence to the maryland court of special appeals.frasch filed a timely application for leave to appeal on october,and the court of special appeals completed its direct review of his conviction and sentence on july,when it issued a decision stating that it had read,considered,and denied his application.frasch did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court,and thus his time for seeking further direct review expired ninety days later on october.because frasch was seeking state collateral review on october,aedpa statute of limitations was tolled until december,the date on which state collateral review ended.see d providing that the statute of limitations is tolled while a defendant pursues state collateral review.thus,his federal habeas petition was timely when it was filed on august.
to get around this straightforward application of d a,maryland focuses on the fact that frasch did not file his application for leave to appeal within the original deadline prescribed by state rule,that is,he did not file it within thirty days of sentence or judgment.see.b.frasch failed to meet this deadline because neither his lawyer nor the sentencing court informed him of his appeal rights.nearly ten years passed,and frasch initiated a collateral proceeding to obtain the right to file his application beyond the original deadline.maryland claims that because frasch gained the right to file a belated application through a collateral proceeding,the court of special appeals consideration of his application constituted collateral,not direct,review.because there has been no direct review in frasch case,according to maryland,his time for seeking direct review expired for purposes of d a when the original deadline for filing an application for leave to appeal expired on january.thus,maryland says that frasch time for filing a federal habeas petition expired on april,at the end of aedpa grace period.we disagree.
to determine what constitutes direct review for purposes of d a,we look to state maryland law.see bridges johnson,cir.the maryland court of special appeals consideration of a defendant timely application for leave to appeal constitutes direct review.see mcelroy,at.yet maryland asserts that the court consideration of frasch application was not direct review.maryland argues that because frasch used a collateral review proceeding to obtain the right to file his application for leave to appeal under a new deadline,the proceeding remained collateral when he filed and pursued the actual application.maryland argument appears to be based on salinas dretke,cir,an opinion in which the fifth circuit held that a state court consideration of a belated appeal did not constitute direct review because the defendant had obtained the right to file the appeal through state habeas collateral proceedings.we reject the salinas approach because it ignores that two separate proceedings are involved.here,the nature of the review conducted by the maryland courts was different in each proceeding,and the nature of the review is the key to determining whether it was collateral or direct.see orange calbone,cir concluding that direct review occurred when oklahoma state prisoner was granted a belated appeal in which he was required to follow the procedural rules for a direct appeal,and the state appellate court review ed the issues raised on the merits without the typical res bar analysis normally employed in a case involving review.
to obtain the right to file a belated application for leave to appeal,frasch initiated a collateral proceeding under state law.see,crim.proc.a.it is undisputed that the maryland circuit court consideration of frasch request to file an application outside of the statutory deadline constituted collateral review because the proceeding was initiated under,and subject to the restrictions of,the upca.under the upca a petitioner may assert only four types of claims that the sentence or judgment was imposed in violation of the constitution of the united states or the constitution or laws of the state the court lacked jurisdiction to impose the sentence the sentence exceeds the maximum allowed by law or the sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack on a ground of alleged error that would otherwise be available under a writ of habeas corpus,writ of coram nobis,or other common law or statutory remedy.id.a.in sum,a claim under the upca does not constitute a part of the original criminal cause,but is an independent and collateral civil inquiry into the validity of the conviction and sentence.state bar ass kerr,see also mosley state,noting that collateral review under the upca is not an appeal of the judgment but rather is a collateral attack designed to address alleged constitutional,jurisdictional,or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial.
after frasch collateral proceeding ended with the order granting him the right to file a belated application for leave to appeal,he was no longer proceeding under the upca.indeed,he was in the same procedural posture as if he had timely pursued a direct appeal.orange,at.thus,when frasch filed his application for leave to appeal,he was not limited to asserting only the four types of claims allowed under the upca.see,crim.proc.frasch was seeking direct review,and the court of special appeals consideration of his application constituted direct review.when the court of special appeals considers a timely application for leave to appeal,it decides whether to deny the application grant the application and affirm the judgment of the court grant the application and reverse the judgment of the lower court grant the application and remand the judgment to the lower court with directions to that court or grant the application and order further proceedings in the court of special appeals.f.the decision rendered by the court of special appeals is part of the direct review.
as maryland acknowledged at oral argument,frasch was able to assert in his belated and authorized application in all of the claims he could have asserted in an application filed by the original deadline in.that is the case because frasch is a defendant who was denied,through no fault of his own,his right to an appeal which he desire d and to which he was entitled.garrison state,emphasis omitted.such a defendant is granted a belated appeal to e nsure that he obtain s as full a review as if his appeal had been properly pursued.wilson state.as a result,when the court of special appeals of maryland read and considered frasch application for leave to appeal,the court had the same decision options it would have had if frasch had filed by the original deadline.see.f.frasch application for leave to appeal was therefore treated in every respect as a timely one,which compels the conclusion that the court of special appeals engaged in direct review.
the dissent argues that the court of special appeals of maryland consideration of frasch belated application for leave to appeal was collateral review,not direct review or part of the direct review process,post at.first,the dissent asserts that it was not direct review because frasch resorted to postconviction collateral proceedings to obtain the right to file the application.see post at.the problem with this argument,as we have already explained,is that it ignores that the proceeding in which frasch obtained the right to file his belated application was distinct from the proceeding in which he filed the application and the nature of review was different in each proceeding.see supra at.
second,the dissent asserts that the court of special appeals consideration of frasch belated application for leave to appeal was not direct review because frasch was not in the same procedural posture under the upca after the court considered his application as he would have been if he had filed a timely application.frasch was in a different procedural posture,the dissent asserts,because a prisoner is entitled to file only one petition under the upca,and a prisoner like frasch who uses the upca to obtain a belated application for leave to appeal his conviction and sentence must include any other postconviction claims in his one petition.see post at.the first problem with this argument is that frasch procedural posture under the upca after the court of special appeals considered his application for leave to appeal has nothing to do with whether the court consideration constituted direct review.the nature of review engaged in by the court of special appeals is the key to determining whether the review was direct or collateral,and it is frasch procedural posture in that court after he was allowed to file the application that is a factor in determining the nature of review.as noted above,once frasch filed his belated application,he was in the same procedural posture in the court of special appeals as one who timely pursues an application for leave to appeal.see supra at.
moreover,the dissent is incorrect as a factual matter in contending that frasch ended up in a different procedural posture under the upca after pursuing his application for leave to appeal.frasch asserted a number of claims in his initial postconviction petition,including the claim that he was entitled to file a belated application for leave to appeal his conviction and sentence.the maryland circuit court order awarding frasch the right to file a belated application did not address the other claims,but the order was entered without prejudice to his ability to file an additional petition on those claims.after his application for leave to appeal was rejected by the court of special appeals,frasch did in fact file an additional petition in the maryland circuit court reasserting the unresolved claims raised in his first petition.thus,frasch,like a maryland prisoner who files a timely application for leave to appeal,had one chance to assert all of his postconviction claims under the upca.he did so in his initial petition,and all of his claims were eventually considered by
