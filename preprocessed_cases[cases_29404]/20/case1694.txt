petitioner matthews was convicted by bench trial in of three counts of murder and one felony firearm count.having unsuccessfully pursued his appeals through the michigan state courts,matthews filed a series of motions with the state courts beginning in.his last such motion was denied by the michigan supreme court on december.in july,matthews sought a writ of habeas corpus under his petition is thus governed by aedpa.the district court granted the writ on several grounds,including insufficiency of evidence and ineffectiveness of counsel in violation of the fourteenth and sixth amendments.the court ordered matthews release,pending only the resolution of this appeal brought by the respondent,warden abramajitys.the respondent argues,inter alia,that the district court erred in its substantive analysis and that matthews petition is untimely under aedpa time limit because the gaps between matthews various filings with the michigan courts do not toll the running of the statute under d.we reverse in part and affirm in part,and we affirm the grant of the writ on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel.
in the summer of,bruce baxter brought diamonds to the kayanan jewelry in oak park,michigan and commissioned the design and manufacture of a gold ring in which to set the jewels.when the ring was completed,the diamonds were arranged in the shape of a trisected circle,recognizable as the logo of the automobile company.krikor oknayan,one of the ring makers,testified in that although the jewelers had retained the mold,no other rings like baxter had been made.
petitioner was convicted by the state of michigan of participating in the triple homicide of baxter,his wife marilyn,and their friend and neighbor robert williams.on the morning of december,the three were shot to death,apparently by multiple assailants,at baxter residence on westwood street in detroit.there were no witnesses to the killings of the baxters in their basement the only person left alive in the baxters house was their orphaned daughter twyla,a infant found,by police,uninjured in her upstairs nursery.police found bruce baxter with his hands bound behind his back,shot four times with three different weapons.marilyn baxter was found nearby,still in her nightclothes,also dead of four gunshots.although there was no evidence of forced entry,the house had been looted,including the secret drawer beneath the carpet where bruce hid his money.the ring,and other various other valuables,were missing from the house.
robert williams had apparently encountered the assailants when he arrived at the baxter household at approximately,had been shot and had fled through his own yard into the yard of the james ellison,where he was shot again and collapsed.ellison witnessed the final moments of williams life.after ellison heard the shots,he saw a figure bending over williams,lifting williams body as if to check him out.when ellison confronted this individual and asked what was going on,the figure stared at ellison for a moment,concealed a dark object that had been in his hand,and ran away.ellison indicated that this man was wearing a light blue puffy jacket and was in height.ellison testified the man was not petitioner matthews.ellison spoke briefly to williams before he lost consciousness and died,attempting to comfort him,but all ellison could comprehend of williams responses was two garble guys.
moments thereafter,three men ran from westwood street turning onto orangelawn street,and turning again to run down minock street,parallel to westwood.several boys between the ages of and,on their way to school at the time,were able to describe these men as armed with handguns.the boys descriptions were hampered by the fact that,familiar with,and alerted to,the sound of gunshots,they all wisely took cover by throwing themselves on the ground or ducking behind trees and bushes.
the evidence about the incident that six of the boys gave at petitioner trial has been extensively detailed by the district court in its published opinion,matthews abramajtys,d,and need only be summarized here.while the boys testimony on the route and number of the men was consistent,their descriptions varied to some extent.generally,however,the boys remembered one as wearing a gray and blue georgetown jacket and another as wearing a red sixers jacket the descriptions of the third figure were more vague,although some boys remembered him as hooded.all of the boys who testified claimed to have been unable to see the faces of the three men.over the objection of the defendant,the prosecution introduced into evidence a mug shot of matthews taken months earlier,which shows him wearing a dark blue georgetown jacket 
matthews was a resident of this neighborhood of detroit,and was acquainted with baxter.testimony established that he had met with baxter for an hour in the basement of baxter home two days before the murders.like bruce baxter,but at an apparently lower volume,matthews was involved in the buying and selling of jewelry.on the morning of december,matthews had been seen on orangelawn,walking in the direction of the baxter residence,wearing blue jeans and a dark jacket.police officer gilbert mcreynolds testified that this occurred around.marilyn prior also saw the three assailants run by her home near the intersection of minock and orangelawn at.she only glanced at the men,and could not be positive,but testified that she thought one of them might be matthews,whom she claimed to be familiar with from the neighborhood and because he went to cody high school with her nieces 
by december,two days later,petitioner was in illinois,where he called his girlfriend rose marie marks.marks testified that when matthews returned to detroit sometime between december and december,he showed her baxter ring.matthews apparently told marks that he wanted to purchase this ring,and attempted unsuccessfully to convince her to give him seven hundred dollars for this purpose.other testimony established that petitioner behaved in a fashion inconsistent with this status as prospective purchaser.in the days following his display of the ring to marks,matthews took the ring to jeweler brian berry,to whom he sold it for and a gold rope necklace,a week before christmas.berry,as well as others,averred that at this time the ring was far more valuable,worth to 
seven days earlier,on the evening of december,the ring had still been in baxter house.the baxters employed their nephew,jonathon hudson,as babysitter and housekeeper.one of hudson perks was that he was allowed to wear the ring as he went about his daily chores,which hudson enjoyed doing,and did almost every day because he felt that it looked so sharp.hudson testified that he was working the night before the murders putting up christmas decorations and that he placed the ring back in its normal place that evening.hudson left the baxter house at approximately 
after petitioner was arrested,the above set of facts were presented by the state to the detroit recorder court,where matthews waived his jury right and received a bench trial.matthews was represented at this trial by attorney leroy daggs.daggs premised his defense on the theory that because there was no positive identification of matthews at the crime scene and no physical evidence tying him to the murders,the government case would fail.daggs marilyn prior to emphasize the equivocal nature of her identification,but did not any of the child witnesses to develop their description of the apparent perpetrators.
lorenzo matthews is at least inches in height,and the earlier descriptions of the height of the fleeing men by both pryor and the children seemed to be inconsistent with this stature.not surprisingly,the prosecution did not develop this height point during direct testimony,either.that daggs recognized this issue is evidenced by his use of it during closing argument,but he felt no need during the trial to get the witnesses to state in a positive way that the people they saw could not have been matthews,relying instead on their inability to be sure that it was matthews.matthews had asked daggs to arrange for a showup identification.daggs demurred from doing this for some time,but eventually a photo showup was performed.a child witness,deon corbett,participated in the showup and stated that none of the individuals shown had been among the fleeing men.daggs chose not to call corbett to the stand,although he appears to have been aware of the results of the showup,as he had to be forestalled from telling the court about the results.
indeed,daggs called no witnesses of his own,although he was apparently in contact with various members of matthews family who had indicated a willingness to testify.at the district court evidentiary hearing,matthews sister and mother testified that they had been ready to state that petitioner had left their common home shortly after in the company of his red pit bull,en route to his brother house.they remembered telling daggs this,and being told by daggs that he would call them to testify.sandra elliott,at that time matthew,told the district court that matthews had arrived with his dog at her home at or,right before my kids went to school.after being informed of this,daggs told elliott he would get back to her.
daggs plan was to win on a directed verdict.when the government closed,daggs argued his case to the bench,pointing out the lack of identification and anything placing matthews any closer than the general neighborhood.as to the ring,daggs argued that no one knows how it came into matthews possession and that the ring might well have been removed before the murders.daggs also questioned whether matthews might not have sold the ring to berry before december,since berry recollection of the date of the sale,a week before christmas,was inexact.
the court denied daggs motion without deliberation.the court pointed out that the testimony had been that matthews was in possession of the ring after the murders,presumably referring to the statement of matthews girlfriend and it was the possession of this ring that,in the court view,tied matthews to the crime scene as one of the fleeing men.the court concluded that a juror could find and probably would find on the evidence that i outlined the defendant participated in the murders.the court then asked daggs to proceed.
the defense instead rested.the record then discloses that the court summoned counsel to the bench and had a discussion.the court statement is worth quoting at length 
i aware,as is the prosecutor and the defense counsel,of course,no person accused of a crime such as the defendant need sic to prove his innocence.it is not my desire the defendant put in a defense.it is,however,as i contemplate the opinion i gave in reasons to the defense motion for a directed verdicted sic,a case where the defendant may wish to give some thought to whether or not he wishes to proceed in the manner announced by his counsel as resting at this stage.i perfectly willing the matter be argued.and i come to a conclusion on the basis of what is presented.
defense counsel agreed he would give some thought to the matter of mounting a defense.
daggs defense consisted of recalling three of the government witnesses.he recalled marilyn prior and again elicited the fact she was unable positively to identify matthews he also elicited testimony that,as far as prior remembered,the three men appeared to be the same height.daggs recalled brian berry and attempted to highlight uncertainty as to the date of the ring sale.finally,daggs recalled an autopsy technician,apparently for the purpose of highlighting uncertainty as to the time that the baxters were shot.then he rested.he presented a rambling closing argument in favor of reasonable doubt,pointing out that no witness had mentioned seeing a big man like his client.he also relied on testimony that bruce baxter normally left for work at and,therefore,someone had to have been in the house before that time.as matthews was seen out and about at,the person who detained baxter was unlikely to have been matthews.daggs proposed that matthews may have been acting as middleman for the ring,and need not actually have participated in its theft.
the trial court was unpersuaded by daggs and found the overall assemblage of circumstantial evidence sufficient for conviction,discussing this evidence in detail as part of its decision,and noting that it found no inconsistent circumstances relating to the defendant participation.matthews was sentenced to three concurrent life terms without parole,plus two years.
matthews appealed,presenting several issues,including insufficiency of evidence and ineffective assistance of counsel.we elide most of the details of matthews unsuccessful odyssey through the michigan state courts,addressed by the district court at d at,as,with one minor exception,the warden does not assert that matthews failed to exhaust his claims.however,the respondent does claim that matthews motions for relief were insufficient to toll aedpa statute of limitations.see matthews abramajtys,d rejecting this claim.
it may therefore be useful to review briefly the sequence of events.matthews filed a motion for relief from judgment with the trial court raising eight grounds for relief,including insufficient evidence and ineffective assistance of counsel.the trial court denied the motion on september.matthews filed an application for leave to appeal to the michigan court of appeals on march,which was subsequently ruled defective on august.however,he filed another application for leave to appeal on september,which was treated on the merits and denied by the court of appeals on march.this application was timely under michigan law.he then filed an application for leave to appeal with the michigan supreme court on april,which was denied on december.
matthews petition for habeas corpus was received on july.after hearing the evidence of the witnesses discussed above,along with that of petitioner,and attorney daggs,the district court granted the writ on four grounds that the admission of the mug shot was a denial of due process by introducing evidence of other crimes before the factfinder,that daggs had rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance,that matthews appellate counsel,by insufficiently pursuing an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim,was himself constitutionally ineffective,and that there was insufficient evidence for any rational finder of fact to find matthews guilty of homicide.respondent abramajtys appeals,asserting that the habeas petition was untimely filed,was barred by the equitable doctrine of laches,and contained an unexhausted claim regarding the failure to challenge marilyn pryor erroneous placement of petitioner at cody high school,and that the district court erred as to all four bases for its grant of relief.
standard of review 
in the appeal of a habeas corpus decision under,legal conclusions are reviewed de novo and findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.see delisle rivers,cir.matthews petition was filed in may.its review,therefore,is governed by the provisions of the aedpa as they apply to.harris stovall,cir.the relevant section of d provides that an application for a writ of habeas corpus shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
williams taylor,d,outlines the degree to which federal habeas courts should defer to state court decisions.the court held that,in order for the writ to issue,a decision must be contrary to supreme court precedent in the sense that the state court arrive d at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or the state court confront ed facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrive d at a result opposite to ours.id.at.a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant
