orlando brad jones petitions for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,alleging that the commonwealth of virginia violated his fifth amendment rights by punishing him twice for the same offense.the deferential review of state court judgments mandated by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa requires us to affirm the district court denial of habeas relief.
to better understand this case procedural history and the parties arguments,we must briefly set forth the nature of jones atypical constitutional claim.he contends that the commonwealth violated his rights under the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment not by subjecting him to multiple prosecutions for the same offense but by subjecting him to multiple punishments for the same offense.see north carolina pearce,emphasis added.
when the government convicts a defendant for two crimes based on identical conduct,the fifth amendment requires that the sentencing court determine whether the legislature intended that each violation be a separate offense.garrett united states.if the legislature did intend each violation to be a separate offense,then the double jeopardy clause provides no protection against multiple punishments.but if the legislature did not intend to punish the same conduct twice,the double jeopardy clause bars two or more punishments for the same offense,and thus prevent s the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.missouri hunter.
when the claim is made in relation to state offenses,federal courts are essentially bound by state court interpretations of state legislative intent on this score.thomas warden,cir.that is because,when the charged offenses violate state law,the double jeopardy analysis hinges entirely on the question of what quantum of punishment the state legislature intended.see sanderson rice,cir the supreme court has placed the state legislative definition of the crime at the heart of double jeopardy analysis.once a state court has answered that question,t here is no separate federal constitutional standard requiring that certain actions be defined as single or as multiple crimes.id.
in brown commonwealth,a double jeopardy case,the supreme court of virginia considered the intent of the virginia general assembly when a defendant is accused of abduction by detention and another crime involving restraint of the victim,both growing out of a continuing course of conduct.id.at.the brown court held that the general assembly intended to subject such a defendant to separate penalties for separate offenses only when the detention committed in the act of abduction is separate and apart from,and not merely incidental to,the restraint employed in the commission of the other crime.id.at.this rule has since come to be known as the incidental detention doctrine.see,walker commonwealth.
with this understanding of the double jeopardy and state law principles at issue in this case,we turn to the facts.
on december,jones donned a mask and,together with his cousin,robbed at gunpoint a mcdonald restaurant in hampton,virginia.the commonwealth charged jones with robbery,ann.abduction,id.wearing a mask in public,id.and two counts of using a firearm while committing a felony,id,one each for the robbery and abduction.the charges stemmed from evidence that during the lasted just ninety directed mcdonald floor supervisor anthony williams to travel about twenty feet from the front cash register to the back cash register to retrieve money stored there.jones pled not guilty to all five charges.
at the conclusion of the commonwealth case,defense counsel moved to dismiss the two abduction charges on the ground that the abduction must be separate and apart from and not merely incidental to the restraint employed in the commission of the robbery.the trial court denied the motion on the merits,finding that two distinct robberies had taken place,one for each cash register.the trial court reasoned that,because the commonwealth charged jones only with the first robbery,and the abduction charge was incidental only to the second robbery,the commonwealth did not violate double jeopardy principles because the abduction was not incidental to the charged robbery.
on september,the jury convicted jones on all counts.the trial judge,following the jury recommendation,sentenced jones to years in prison five years for the robbery,three for using a firearm during the robbery,one for wearing a mask in public,twenty for the abduction,and five for using a firearm during the abduction.thus,the convictions accounted for years of jones year sentence.
jones timely filed petitions for appeal,first in the court of appeals of virginia and then in the supreme court of virginia.in his supporting identical briefs to each court,jones asserted the following as an assignment of error 
the trial court erred in concluding that the abduction and related firearm charge could be sustained without a scintilla of evidence in the record to show intimidation or force in the movement of the victim from one cash register to the other cash register in the course of this robbery.
in the argument sections for this claim,jones cited to brown and described the claim in terms very similar to those used in that case the alleged abduction is not the type of case that the legislature envisioned as a separate offense from a crime such as this robbery,for it is intrinsic in the very act of this robbery.compare brown,at i n the enactment of the abduction statute the general assembly did not intend to make the kind of restraint which is an intrinsic element of robbery a criminal act,punishable as a separate offense.jones did not explicitly refer to the double jeopardy clause or the constitution of the united states.
on july,the court of appeals of virginia denied jones appeal without mentioning double jeopardy,the constitution,or brown.instead,the court focused on the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the abduction charges.on december,the supreme court of virginia summarily denied jones petition for appeal.
jones,now proceeding pro se,filed with the state supreme court a petition for state habeas relief.this time,he explicitly alleged that his conviction is in contravention of the double jeopardy clause in the fifth amendment to the constitution of the united states.the court denied jones state habeas petition,finding his double jeopardy claim procedurally barred under slayton parrigan,because jones could have raised his double jeopardy claim on direct appeal,but assertedly did not do so.
on march,pro filed this petition in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia,raising several grounds for relief.the district court granted the commonwealth motion to dismiss all but jones double jeopardy claim,and appointed counsel to represent jones in the proceedings.in its subsequent briefing as to that claim,the commonwealth argued that the claim was procedurally defaulted because it was not properly presented to and thus exhausted before the state courts not cognizable on federal habeas because it involved only a question of state legislative intent and in any event meritless under virginia incidental detention doctrine.although the commonwealth did not cite to the deferential aedpa standard of review in its brief to the district court,it drew upon that standard,arguing that,should the district court reach the merits of jones claim,jones would bear the burden of showing not merely that the state court application of law was wrong,but that it was unreasonably wrong.
on march,the district court denied jones petition.the court refused to find jones double jeopardy claim procedurally barred,but held that punishing jones for both robbery and abduction did not violate double jeopardy under virginia incidental detention doctrine.the court did not mention the aedpa standard of review.
the district court subsequently granted jones a certificate of appealability as to this issue,and jones timely noted this appeal.we review a district court denial of a habeas petition de novo,applying the same standard that the district court was required to apply.longworth ozmint,cir.in opposing jones petition,the commonwealth presents three,procedural default,and the we address in turn 
the commonwealth initially maintains that jones failed to present and so exhaust his double jeopardy claim to the state appellate courts on direct appeal.the commonwealth argues that jones did not exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the state,b a,because he neglected to expressly invoke the double jeopardy clause before the virginia appellate courts,and instead litigated only a state law claim concerning the sufficiency of the evidence of the abduction and firearm counts.resp.br.this argument fails.
of course,it is true that b efore seeking a federal writ of habeas corpus,a state prisoner must exhaust available state remedies,thereby giving the state the opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of its prisoners federal rights.baldwin reese,citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also breard pruett,cir.to provide the state with this opportunity,the prisoner must fairly present his claim in each appropriate state court,thereby alerting that court to the federal nature of the claim.reese,at see also matthews evatt,cir.the habeas petitioner must raise his claim before every available state court,including those the supreme court of review is discretionary.boerckel.
moreover,the burden of demonstrating fair presentment lies with the habeas petitioner,who must do more than scatter some makeshift needles in the haystack of the state court record.mallory smith,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,it is not necessary to cite book and verse on the federal constitution so long as the constitutional substance of the claim is evident,west wright,cir internal quotation marks omitted,rev on other grounds,such that both the operative facts and the controlling legal principles are presented to the state court.baker corcoran,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
thus the supreme court has held that a litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a petition or brief,for example,by citing in conjunction with the claim a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds.reese,at emphasis added.the court drew no distinction between citation to a opposed to a,so long as the cited case rested its holding on federal law.see peterson lampert,cir en banc f or purposes of exhaustion,a citation to a state case analyzing a federal constitutional issue serves the same purpose as a citation to a federal case analyzing such an issue.accordingly,our sister circuits have uniformly concluded that citation to such a state case,as a general matter,provides fair presentment of a federal constitutional claim.see,jackson edwards,cir peterson,at mccandless vaughn,cir barrett acevedo,cir hannah conley,cir scarpa dubois,cir.see also ellsworth levenhagen,cir finding that petitioner citation to a state case alerted the state court to his sixth amendment claim and thus fairly presented the claim.
for example,in daye attorney general of new york,cir en banc,a nearly unanimous en banc second circuit held that the petitioner had exhausted his claim when he cited to two state cases in which the state highest court had analyzed similar contentions in federal constitutional terms and where his claim was within the ambit of a long line of cases establishing this constitutional right.id.at.the daye court explained i f the courts of the state in question have themselves previously treated that fact pattern as appropriate for constitutional analysis,it would be unreasonable to suppose that they are not alert to constitutional considerations.id.at see also ellsworth,at.
here,as in daye and ellsworth,jones cited to a state deals exclusively with federal double jeopardy law,and the supreme court of virginia has since expressly recognized that its ruling in brown regarding incidental detention only applies when the guarantee of double jeopardy may be implicated.walker,at emphasis added.jones also alerted the state courts to the federal nature of his claim when he used clear double jeopardy language,inspired by brown,in his briefs.further,jones presented a fact punishments for abduction and a closely related virginia courts have regularly considered appropriate for double jeopardy analysis.see,brown,jerman,dep t of,d,powell commonwealth.
finally,the commonwealth itself recognized and addressed the double jeopardy issue in its opposing brief before the state supreme court,evidencing jones fair presentment of that claim.see smith digmon,per curiam finding that state opposition in its brief to petitioner constitutional claim in state court supported conclusion that petitioner had fairly presented that claim daye,at even if not alerted by the defendant,the state court might be alerted by the briefs filed by the state in opposition.
in an attempt to circumvent this more than ample authority supporting jones contention that citation to brown fairly presented his double jeopardy claim,the commonwealth offers a technical argument.virginia contends that jones failure to include brown or double jeopardy language specifically in his assignments of error on direct his clear focus on brown in the argument sections of his appellate us from holding that he fairly presented that claim.the commonwealth directs our attention to the rules of the supreme court of virginia,which provide that o nly errors assigned in the petition for appeal will be noticed by this court.c.however,the commonwealth cites no authority for the proposition that a petitioner exhausts for federal habeas purposes only assigned errors.in fact,as the district court noted,although we of course defer to appropriate state procedural rules in determining if a petitioner has exhausted a claim,we have previously disregarded a virginia defendant failure to identify a claim in his assignments of error,finding the claim fairly presented by the argument section of his brief.compare kasi angelone,cir with pet r br.in kasi commonwealth,available at wl,at vii,xi,stating in assignment of error only that trial court erred in conducting voir dire,with no reference to federal law.
moreover,even assuming that a petitioner only exhausts assigned errors,jones assignment of a sufficiency of evidence error fairly presented his double jeopardy claim.this is so because the supreme court of virginia has regularly treated sufficiency of the evidence and double jeopardy interchangeably in this context.see powell,at analyzing brown claim under the heading,sufficiency of the evidence jerman,at finding that the evidence was sufficient for an abduction conviction because the abduction evidence was separate from the evidence supporting defendant assault conviction.when a state highest court has previously considered two iterations of a federal constitutional claim interchangeably,a habeas petitioner invocation of either fairly presents that claim.we decline to punish jones for following the state supreme court lead.
this is one of those instances in which the ultimate question for disposition,will be the same despite variations in the legal theory or factual allegations urged in its support.picard connor,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.even the commonwealth inadvertently concedes as much.see resp.br.i f the evidence was sufficient to support both the abduction charge and the robbery charge,then there was not a single offense and his convictions do not violate the double jeopardy clause.
for these reasons,we must reject the commonwealth contention that jones failed to exhaust his double jeopardy claim.as the district court held,he has done so and thus complied with b a.
even if jones properly exhausted his double jeopardy claim,the commonwealth argues that he procedurally defaulted the claim,thereby foreclosing federal habeas review.the commonwealth points to the supreme court of virginia state habeas opinion,in which that court,invoking slayton parrigan,concluded that jones had not raised his double jeopardy claim on direct appeal.slayton holds that a state prisoner may not obtain state habeas relief by raising a claim of error in state habeas proceedings that he could h
