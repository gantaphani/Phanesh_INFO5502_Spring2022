ralph oyague oyague appeals from a judgment entered july,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york jack weinstein,district judge.the district court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus but granted oyague a limited certificate of appealability with respect to two closely related claims alleged ineffective assistance of his trial counsel and alleged involuntariness of his guilty plea.we affirm.
background 
oyague was charged in suffolk county,new york in an indictment premised on a january,robbery of national westminster bank in huntington station,long island.the indictment charged the following under new york criminal law one count of attempted murder of a police officer in the first degree,four counts of robbery in the first degree,two counts of robbery in the second degree and one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.an offense report prepared by the suffolk county police department charged that oyague and a companion entered the bank on the date in question armed with hand guns.the police asserted that while his accomplice remained in the public area of the bank,telling employees and customers to look at the floor,oyague jumped behind the counter into the teller area,took money out of two different tellers drawers and then threatened the assistant bank manager at gunpoint saying he would blow her head off unless she opened the locked drawers of two tellers who were at lunch.before these additional drawers could be unlocked,the two men fled from the bank with the proceeds of the robbery.the police reported that as the bank robbers fled,two shots were fired,one of which struck a responding officer in the leg.oyague was found hiding near the scene with a canvas bag and a caliber handgun with the serial numbers filed off.
oyague later gave a statement to police admitting to his involvement in the robbery 
eddie and i ran out of the bank towards where the car was parked.just before we got to the car,a police car showed up.when i saw the cop get out of the car i turned towards him with the gun in my hand.i kind of blacked out,everything was happening so fast,at that time the gun could have gone off,i do remember hearing the shot.i started to run and threw the canvas bag and the gun as i was running.the next thing i knew a cop tracked me to the ground and handcuffed me.
the hearing 
on november,the trial court commenced an evidentiary hearing prior to which the district attorney office turned over extensive rosario material.the court ordered a recess so that the material could be reviewed by oyague counsel,and the status of any plea offer could be discussed.when the court reconvened,oyague counsel stated that his client would not accept the plea offer discussed during the lunch break.the state then called its first witness,detective john clark.clark testified that during his questioning of oyague,he accused the suspect of shooting a police officer.clark testified that oyague answered,i did know anyone got shot,and i never heard a shot i just remember running from the bank and i remember getting arrested.i do remember anything else.maybe i blacked out.
oyague alleges that during another short recess,the trial judge commented to him that he should plead guilty because the prosecution had a lot of evidence against him and that if oyague were convicted,he would spend the rest of his life in prison.oyague counsel averred that in advising his client regarding the consequences of accepting or rejecting the plea offer,he told oyague that if he were found guilty by a jury after trial he could be sentenced consecutively on the robbery counts to serve a maximum of years to life imprisonment.
after the court recess,oyague counsel informed the trial court that a plea agreement had been reached.counsel advised that oyague had agreed to plead guilty on two counts of first degree robbery and on one count of first degree assault,a lesser included offense of the charge of attempted murder,with the understanding that if he complied with the terms of his release and appeared for sentence on january,one of the robbery counts would be dismissed,and he would be sentenced to a term of to years imprisonment.if,alternatively,oyague violated the law or failed to appear for sentencing,he agreed to be sentenced in absentia to consecutive sentences of to years on each robbery count,and to years on the assault count.
the plea proceedings 
when the trial judge asked oyague whether he had had sufficient time in which to consult with his attorney about the plea,oyague answered,no.the judge then told oyague to sit down because he was not playing games anymore.after a series of further questions by the court,oyague acknowledged that he had had sufficient time to discuss the proposed plea with his counsel.oyague also told the court that he was taking antidepressants and had taken zoloft within the last hours.in response to the court questioning regarding his medication use,oyague said he was not aware that taking zoloft impaired his judgment.when the prosecutor began examination of oyague in connection with his plea allocution,oyague responded to the questions saying,i am not well i just had a dizzy spell.the plea continued after a short break during which oyague stated sir,i want to finish.oyague then answered yes,when the prosecutor asked whether he,along with his nephew,had entered the bank with a handgun and stole money from two separate teller stations,two separate tellers.the following colloquy addressed the assault count 
prosecutor and while you were running,you spun and you shot at one of the police officers,striking him in the leg is that correct 
the defendant i do remember that,sir.
the court did you you turn around and shoot the gun 
the defendant i was told i did.i was in shock.
the court did you turn around and fire that gun 
the defendant i was told i did,your honor.it is possible.
the court did you hold the gun 
the defendant yes.
the court was the police officer struck the people prove the police officer was struck by the 
clayton that correct.
the court you did turn and shoot that gun is that correct,oyague 
the defendant i believe so,your honor.
the court that fine.
whereupon the trial court accepted oyague plea.
procedural history 
proceedings 
on january,prior to his scheduled sentencing date,oyague,with the assistance of new counsel,filed a motion to withdraw his plea.he made the following arguments there was no factual basis for the assault plea when he neither recalled the shooting nor admitted an intent to harm and the plea was not knowing or voluntary because of insufficient time to consult with his lawyer,faulty sentencing information given by the judge and counsel,his disoriented and unwell state during the hearing,and the judge coercive statements recommending that he plead guilty due to the strength of the prosecution case.
in its january,decision,the trial court denied oyague an evidentiary hearing and denied his motion to withdraw the plea,on the grounds that it was knowing and voluntary.the court made the following findings oyague stated belief that he shot the police officer was sufficient for allocution oyague was not required to allocute to all elements of count of the indictment because he pleaded guilty to assault,a lesser included offense of attempted murder oyague had been lucid,rational and able to fully comprehend his plea at the time he entered it oyague dizzy spell and the fact he was taking antidepressants did not warrant vacatur of his plea since oyague acknowledged that he understood the plea proceeding and his faculties were not impaired by the medication oyague did acknowledge during the plea proceeding that he had been afforded sufficient time to consult with his attorney and that he believed pleading guilty was in his best interest and there was no evidence that he had been misinformed of his sentence exposure because he could have received years to life if he was convicted on all counts in the indictment.the trial court further found that even if the lawyer representation was wrong,it was harmless error because oyague,who was at the time of the plea,would most
