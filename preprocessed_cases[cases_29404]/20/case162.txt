korey gray appeals the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus from his convictions for distributing cocaine and for doing so in a public park.the appeal presents a single issue whether the state courts violated batson kentucky,d,and its progeny,hernandez new york,d,and powers ohio,d,by permitting the prosecutor peremptory challenge to an hispanic juror without demanding a explanation.we affirm.
gray,who is,was charged with unlawfully distributing cocaine under.laws ch.c and unlawfully distributing cocaine in a public park under.laws ch.gray allegedly sold worth of crack cocaine to an undercover police officer in a park in boston dorchester neighborhood.he was tried before a jury in suffolk county superior court.
during jury selection,the commonwealth and gray were entitled to use a maximum of six peremptory challenges each.after the prosecutor began by striking four jurors,the court commented,t hat four challenges and three of those challenges are people of color who are black people.the defendant is a black person.defense counsel responded,out of the fourteen jurors seated here,there are five black people.he wants to strike three of them i ca see any other reason they would be stricken except for the fact that they black people you ca just strike jurors because they black or hispanic m y client is black and he entitled to a jury of his peers.
in response,the prosecutor first claimed that one of the jurors was not properly termed an,so that the commonwealth had in fact stricken only two out of four black jurors,not three out of five.the court summoned that juror to sidebar and asked her whether she was a person of color.the juror answered no,but answered yes when the court asked whether she was hispanic.the court remarked,so basically we have two black persons who are being challenged.defense counsel responded,we going to end up with one black juror because she intended to peremptorily challenge the other one due to his membership in a police that this had occurred because the prosecutor had stricken the other jurors solely because they black.
the court agreed,announcing,there has been a prima facie showing of impropriety that the pattern of conduct has developed whereby prospective jurors have been challenged peremptorily are members of a distinct group,namely two black people,and there is a likelihood that they being excluded from the jury based solely on their group membership.thus,the court called upon the prosecutor to offer a neutral reason for challenging the two jurors.
the prosecutor explained that he had challenged one of the black jurors because she lived in the neighborhood of the alleged crimes,which in his experience created the threat of knowledge about the area that frankly makes jurors questionable.he pointed out that he had used another of his peremptory challenges on a married white male juror from the same neighborhood,who would otherwise be a model juror but for the fact that he lives in dorchester.the prosecutor suggested that,if his challenge to the juror from dorchester was nevertheless disallowed,he should be entitled to withdraw his challenge to the white juror from dorchester because if i going to have people from dorchester on there by order of the court then i might as well not strike the white juror.the prosecutor explained that he had stricken the other juror because she had a prior conviction for robbery.
in rebuttal,defense counsel argued,we going to end up with a totally white jury because the commonwealth is striking people of different ethnic backgrounds,citing to the hispanic juror as an example.that led to the following colloquy between defense counsel and the court 
carol t here are nine white people and he challenged one.
the court he also challenged the hispanic person,did he 
carol yes,but she not white or caucasian.i say she closer to a black person.
defense counsel did not ask the court to require the prosecutor to give a reason for striking the hispanic juror,and the court did not do so.during voir dire,though,that juror had revealed that she was just recently a defendant in a criminal case,but was found qualified to serve when she said that her own experience would not affect her ability to render a fair and impartial verdict on the charges against gray.
the court then allowed the commonwealth challenge to the juror who had the robbery conviction,but disallowed its challenge to the juror who lived in the neighborhood where the crimes occurred.the court did,however,permit the prosecutor to withdraw his peremptory challenge to the white juror from that neighborhood,leaving the commonwealth with three unused strikes.the prosecutor used one of those against a juror whose race is not apparent from the record.the prosecutor also attempted to strike another juror,but that was disallowed when the superior court deemed it discriminatory,rejecting the prosecutor explanation that he had stricken that juror out of a concern that she harbored resentment toward law enforcement officials due to her recent layoff from her job as an airport security screener.the prosecutor did not use his sixth and final peremptory challenge.
as to the hispanic juror,the court noted that it had asked her whether or not she was a person of color and she indicated that she was not and that she was in fact a hispanic person.when defense counsel protested that a hispanic group is another ethnic group similar to the black group,the court responded,i really do think the hispanic can be considered black and i do think the case law considers it.
trial proceeded,and gray was convicted on both counts,ultimately receiving consecutive sentences of months on the distribution count and months on the distribution in the park count.gray appealed his convictions,claiming,in relevant part,that the superior court had acted in derogation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,as well as article xii of the massachusetts declaration of rights,by fail ing to require the prosecutor to articulate his reasons for his peremptory challenge of the hispanic prospective juror.
the massachusetts appeals court affirmed in an unpublished opinion.commonwealth gray,table,wl.while peremptory challenges are presumed to be proper,the court explained,that presumption may be rebutted by a showing that there is a pattern of excluding members of a discrete group and it is likely that individuals are being excluded solely on the basis of their membership within this group.id.at quoting massachusetts curtiss.o nly once the judge determines that it is likely that a juror has been excluded for these reasons will the burden shift to require the challenging party to offer a reason for the challenge.id.quoting commonwealth garrey.
noting the superior court ruling that a preliminary showing of impropriety as to prospective jurors had been made,the appeals court rejected gray claim that this finding as to those prospective jurors should have extended to the commonwealth challenge to the hispanic juror.id.first,the court observed that,under massachusetts law,hispanics are neither members of the black race nor are they a separate race,but rather members of an ethnic class.id.citations omitted.second,the appeals court reasoned that the superior court made an implied finding that no prima facie showing of impropriety had been made when it allowed the commonwealth challenge to the hispanic prospective juror and refrained from asking the prosecutor a reason for his challenge,and that this implied finding is clearly supported by the record.id.citing commonwealth suarez.
following his unsuccessful appeal,gray filed an application for further appellate review by the massachusetts supreme judicial court,which was denied,commonwealth gray,and a petition for a writ of certiorari from the united states supreme court,which was likewise denied,d.he then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court,see,claiming that the state courts had violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment by permitting the prosecutor to use a peremptory challenge to exclude a n hispanic prospective juror where the prosecutor was discriminating against the selection of persons as jurors.the district court denied the petition in a written order.gray brady,d.
at the outset,the district court determined that gray federal equal protection claim had not been adjudicated on the merits by the state courts so as to trigger the deferential standard of review under d,part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of id.at.the district court reasoned that,because the federal and massachusetts rules on challenging the use of peremptory challenges based on a juror protected status differ slightly,the state courts resolution of gray claim under massachusetts law had not subsumed the federal standard.id.thus,the district court concluded,gray federal constitutional claim had not been adjudicated on the merits by the state courts and therefore would be reviewed in federal court de novo.id.
the district court nevertheless denied gray claim on the merits,rejecting his two arguments why it was error for the superior court not to ask for a justification for the prosecution challenge to the hispanic juror.id.at.the court found simply no support in the record for gray first argument that the superior court had gone no further because of its erroneous belief that a prosecution challenge to a n hispanic juror would not violate the batson rule where the defendant was black,contrary to the teaching of powers.id.the district court explained that the superior court had found no prima facie showing as to the hispanic juror not because she was not black like the defendant,but because she was not black like the other challenged jurors.id.
the district court also rejected gray second argument,namely,that the state courts should have found prima facie,intentional discrimination against minority jurors including the hispanic on the prima facie showing of intentional discrimination against the jurors.id.at.the district court allowed that a prima facie showing of discriminatory challenges to jurors from one minority group might be the kind of additional circumstantial evidence that would lead a judge to draw an inference of a more generalized discriminatory intent and,therefore,that it was possible to draw an inference of bias toward the hispanic juror based on the prima facie showing of bias toward the jurors.id.
pointing out that whether to draw an inference of discriminatory use of preemptories is an intensely case and question,however,the district court concluded that such an inference was not compelled,so there was no error in declining to draw an inference of discriminatory targeting of the lone hispanic juror because she could broadly be considered a minority,like the black jurors.id.finally,the court rejected gray proposal that peremptory challenges of jurors who variously fall with in different ethnic groups must be amalgamated in assessing a batson claim,observing that neither the supreme court,nor any other federal court,has adopted that view of the law.id.
before delving into the merits of gray claim,we pause to note a threshold issue.the respondent argues that gray batson claim was actually adjudicated on the merits by the state courts so as to prevent federal habeas relief unless their decisions were contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.d.because this standard of review,by its terms,applies only to federal claims that were in fact adjudicated on the merits in state court,i f the federal claim was never addressed by the state court,federal review is de novo.pike guarino,cir.the respondent argues that,while the massachusetts appeals court cited its own law,and not any federal law,in rejecting gray claim that the prosecutor should have been required to provide a reason for striking the hispanic juror,the court nevertheless adjudicated the federal aspect of that claim on the merits by applying a state standard that is the functional equivalent of the federal standard.
as this argument suggests,a adjudication of an issue framed in terms of state law is nonetheless entitled to deference under section d as long as the state and federal issues are for all practical purposes synonymous and the state standard is at least as protective of the defendant rights as its federal counterpart.foxworth amand,cir.the federal standard for claims of discrimination in jury selection entails a inquiry 
first,the trial court must determine whether the defendant has made a prima facie showing that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge on the basis of race.second,if that showing has been made,the burden shifts to the prosecutor to present a explanation for striking the juror in question third,the court must then determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.
rice collins,d citations omitted.the district court ruled that this standard offers greater succor to a defendant than its massachusetts counterpart,under which,as followed by the appeals court in this case,the obligation to offer a reason for the challenge only arises after the judge has determined it is likely that there was a discriminatory reason for the challenge.d at.the district court reasoned that the appeals court had thus applied a more rigid standard than that established by batson,which requires only a prima facie showing of discrimination at step one of the inquiry.id.quoting aspen bissonnette,cir.
the respondent argues that,while the appeals court did articulate the commonwealth likelihood standard in rejecting gray claim that the prosecutor had impermissibly stricken the hispanic juror based on her group status,the court nevertheless applied a test that was functionally equivalent to the supreme court prima facie standard.but we need not resolve that argument to resolve gray batson claim because,as explained infra,we conclude that it fails even under a de novo standard of review.accordingly,we simply assume without deciding that,as the district court determined,the state courts did not adjudicate gray batson claim on the merits so as to engender deferential review under d.
as he did in the district court,gray advances three arguments in support of his claim that the state courts erroneously concluded that the prosecutor did not have to advance a rationale for striking the hispanic juror.first,he contends that the superior court mistakenly believed that gray,because he is not hispanic,could not object to the exclusion of an hispanic juror.second,he argues that the state courts wrongly ignored the evidence of discriminatory animus toward the jurors in finding no discriminatory animus against the hispanic juror.third,he asserts that the state courts erred in evaluating the challenges to the hispanic juror and the jurors separately,as opposed to challenges directed at minority jurors as a class.
like the district court,we find no merit in the first two claims.we also reject the third claim,because gray has provided no evidence or authority for the proposition that minorities a term he does not even attempt to a cognizable group for batson purposes,and we find none.
first,gray is correct that race is irrelevant to a defendant standing to object to the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges,as the supreme court held in powers,at.affirming a white defendant right to challenge the discriminatory exclusion of from the jury within the contemplation of batson.as the district court observed,though,nothing in the record suggests that the superior court relied on the fact that gray is not hispanic in declining to ask the prosecutor to give a reason for excluding the hispanic juror.
indeed,the superior court took note of gray race only at the very outset,when it sua sponte noted the number of panelists stricken by the never mentioned gray race again,whether in its discussions of the hispanic juror or otherwise.the appeals court,then,properly treated the superior court not demanding an explanation for the prosecutor striking the hispanic juror as an implicit ruling that gray had not made out a prima facie case of discrimination,rather than an implicit ruling that gray could not challenge that juror excl
