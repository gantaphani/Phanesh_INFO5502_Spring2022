the primary issue raised on this federal habeas appeal is whether an escaped prisoner can shorten his term of actual incarceration under the common law doctrine of credit for time erroneously at liberty because,after he was picked up,he was inadvertently released and remained at liberty for a period of fourteen months before he was eventually arrested again.the district court answered this question no,espinoza sabol,and so do we.
in,gilbert espinoza was sentenced to a term of months imprisonment for two federal drug convictions.the parole commission set a presumptive parole date of january,for espinoza.he never met that date while in custody and so was not on parole.instead,about two weeks before his presumptive parole date,he escaped.on december,he walked away from the new mexico halfway house in which he had been serving his sentence.at that point,more than two years of the term remained to be served.
the bureau of prisons bop on january,found him guilty of escape and subsequently made a recommendation to the parole commission that his presumptive parole date be rescinded,after a disciplinary hearing which espinoza did not attend.on january,the commission reopened and retarded his presumptive parole date and scheduled a rescission hearing to take place upon espinoza return to a federal institution.see a.retard is a term of art in the parole context and means to postpone a presumptive parole date.see king simpson,cir.a criminal escape charge under a was also filed against espinoza in federal court.
espinoza remained at liberty until june,when state authorities in new mexico arrested him for shoplifting they transferred him to the custody of the marshals service.federal prosecutors declined to pursue the criminal escape charge.the marshals service,rather than returning espinoza to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence for the drug crimes,mistakenly released him from custody on june.although the record is not clear,the marshals seem to have booked espinoza,whose full name is gilbert,was apparently misidentified as gilbert,a man of approximately the same age with a social security number similar to espinoza and who was not subject to a prison sentence at the time.
fourteen months later,on august,espinoza was arrested again,this time on new federal drug charges.in federal court in new mexico,he pled guilty and was sentenced to a term of months imprisonment on march.the sentencing court was aware of espinoza prior report noted that he had time remaining on his sentence and that he had committed his new offense after escaping.the court was not explicit as to whether espinoza new sentence should run concurrently with his sentence or whether they should run consecutively.
upon espinoza return to custody and after a hearing on august,the bop found him guilty of escape.the parole commission rescinded espinoza presumptive parole date on april,on the basis of this finding,as well as based on his new conviction.the bop then calculated espinoza period of incarceration,concluding that he had to serve the remainder of his sentence with credit for periods that he spent in custody,including the period of june.because the new mexico federal district court had been silent as to whether espinoza new sentence would be served concurrently or consecutively with the sentence,the bop decided the question and concluded that the sentences were consecutive.the result was that espinoza served the remainder of his sentence from august,to january,and began serving his sentence immediately thereafter.
espinoza filed a pro se petition for habeas relief under in massachusetts federal court,alleging that the bop had erred in calculating his period of incarceration and was requiring him to serve time on the dismissed escape charge.the court appointed counsel,who reframed the issues.in a supplemental pleading,espinoza argued that he was entitled to credit against his sentence for the time he spent at liberty between june,and august,and that the bop had erred in determining that his two sentences were to run consecutively.
on april,the district court granted the government motion to dismiss,holding that the june,detention did not recommence his sentence and thus did not trigger the time at liberty doctrine and that the bop had correctly determined that espinoza sentences were to run consecutively.the court concluded that the parole commission had erred in not holding a rescission hearing within days of espinoza return to federal custody,see a,but that this error did not entitle espinoza to additional sentence credit.
a.the doctrine of credit for time erroneously at liberty 
espinoza argues he should be given credit against his sentence for the time he spent erroneously at liberty.espinoza argument is that because the marshals service erred by confusing him with a similarly named person with a like social security number in releasing him on june,he should be given credit through august,the date of his next arrest,toward his sentence.he says it was not his fault he was released on june,but the government,and so his final release date should have been october,and not december.
the length of the term of actual imprisonment to be served following a criminal conviction and sentence is subject to various constitutional and other legal restraints,both as to increases and as to decreases of the time in confinement.for example,an increase in sentence after a defendant has begun to serve his sentence may contravene the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.breest helgemoe,cir.however,if the original sentence was erroneous,the constitution contains no general rule prohibiting a court from finding that sentence erroneous and holding that a sentence of greater length was required by law.dewitt ventetoulo,cir.
as to a claimed decrease in time of incarceration,substantive due process may prohibit the continued incarceration of a prisoner under certain facts.the substantive component of the due process clause is violated by executive action when it can properly be characterized as arbitrary,or conscience shocking,in a constitutional sense.county of sacramento lewis,d quoting collins city of harker heights,d see also united states,cir when testing executive action,the supreme court has used the shocking to the conscience test.dewitt,at.most cases in which a prisoner seeks credit for his time at liberty involve some form of constitutional due process claim while we have not explicitly addressed such a claim,we have recognized that in the extreme case based on a number of revision may cross the line and violate due process and our rationale could conceivably apply to a time at liberty constitutional claim.see dewitt,at.but this is not an extreme case,and appropriately espinoza does not make any claims to release based on a constitutional provision.we will assume,in espinoza favor,that he may seek relief even when no due process claim is stated.
in the federal criminal justice system,mechanisms for granting credits that can be used to adjust time served have been largely set by legislation.for example,b specifies that a defendant convicted of a federal crime has a right to receive credit for certain time spent in official detention before his sentence begins.that credit is determined by the attorney general,not by a court.see united states wilson,d.in the sentencing reform act of,congress,with few exceptions,abolished parole,which eliminated one mechanism for allowing prisoners credit to reduce their time served.prisoners may now receive credit only in carefully circumscribed situations,such as for their good behavior while incarcerated see,b allowing grant of credit toward the service of a sentence for satisfactory behavior.the relationship between the release date and credits to be given for satisfactory behavior is set forth in.see chavez,cir.although congress could have codified some program of credit for persons erroneously released,it has not done so.espinoza claim to early release is not based on any statute.
congress strong interest in federal sentences raises other considerations,which interact with the claim espinoza makes.espinoza argument raises a concern about
