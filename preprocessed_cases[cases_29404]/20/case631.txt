opinion of the court 
this appeal seeks review of a denial of a petition for habeas corpus by edward sistrunk,an inmate in respondents custody.after pursuing and exhausting his state court avenues for appeal,sistrunk sought habeas relief from the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on the basis of newly discovered evidence of his actual innocence.the district court concluded that the pennsylvania state courts disposition of sistrunk appeal was not contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,and denied his petition.we will affirm.
the certificate of appealability coa limits our review to a single issue whether sistrunk habeas petition was timely filed according to d d.by sheer counting of calendar days,it is undisputed that sistrunk petition was filed long after his timeliness period expired.but because the anti terrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa provides several avenues for petitioners to satisfy timeliness,sistrunk argument requires us to determine whether he is entitled to statutory tolling or different types of equitable tolling that might save his claim.specifically,sistrunk contends that he is entitled to statutory tolling on the basis of uncovering new,exculpatory evidence equitable tolling due to government witness tampering or equitable tolling because he is actually innocent.
we conclude that sistrunk does not qualify for these tolling exceptions.sistrunk delays are inexcusable,his evidence is not new,and even if we permitted equitable tolling for actual innocence,sistrunk proofs of actual innocence fall short.we will,therefore,affirm the district court judgment.
in the early morning hours of july,edward sistrunk used his automobile horn and headlamps to harass a car driven by julmaine moody on a residential road in philadelphia,pennsylvania both cars pulled over.an altercation between the cars occupants broke out,but ceased abruptly when a passenger in moody car recognized a passenger in sistrunk car as an acquaintance.all reentered their respective vehicles,and the cars returned to the roadway.sistrunk then positioned his moving car alongside moody,drew a revolver,aimed at a passenger in moody car with whom he had had a heated exchange,and fired.missing its intended mark,the bullet struck the unarmed and pregnant moody in the head,killing her.
sistrunk evaded capture for three months until his arrest in north carolina.multiple witnesses identified sistrunk as the shooter,including sistrunk intended victim,david snyder.out of the many people who implicated sistrunk in the murder,one witness of particular significance here,gregory anderson,gave a statement to police and testified at a preliminary hearing on january,that he was in sistrunk car at the time of the murder and that sistrunk was the murderer.anderson disappeared before trial and therefore did not testify,but sistrunk defense counsel successfully argued to admit anderson hearing testimony at trial.the trial court found as a fact that all witnesses agreed sistrunk was the shooter.
on may,the court sentenced sistrunk to life imprisonment for murdering moody.in addition,the court sentenced sistrunk to concurrent imprisonment terms for possession of an instrument of crime,reckless endangerment,and simple assault.the pennsylvania superior court affirmed sistrunk sentence on july.the pennsylvania supreme court then denied sistrunk petition for allowance of appeal on december.his conviction became final on march,when sistrunk deadline for filing a petition for certiorari in the united states supreme court passed.see c kapral united states,cir.
sistrunk filed a petition for relief under the pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.ann,on december,contending that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the effectiveness of his trial counsel.the pcra court dismissed sistrunk petition because sistrunk had already litigated the issues on direct appeal.the pennsylvania superior court then affirmed this dismissal on june.
sistrunk filed a second pcra petition on june,contending that newly discovered evidence entitled him to a new trial or evidentiary hearing.sistrunk alleged that he had uncovered evidence proving that another person had confessed to shooting moody.sistrunk claimed to have first heard on april,that damon rodriguez now deceased had told manuel rodriguez in that damon had driven the car on the night of the murder and had shot moody.the pcra court dismissed this petition as untimely on july.the superior court affirmed this dismissal on january.the pennsylvania supreme court then denied sistrunk petition for allowance of appeal on october.
on august,sistrunk filed a third pcra petition,asking the pcra court to vacate his conviction based on more newly discovered evidence of his actual innocence.in this petition,sistrunk alleged that his attorney received a letter from gregory anderson sistrunk cousin on june,admitting to perjuring himself at sistrunk preliminary hearing by testifying that sistrunk was the shooter.anderson further claimed that police investigators coerced him into giving false testimony,specifically against sistrunk,by threatening to charge anderson with conspiracy.after testifying to sistrunk detriment at the preliminary hearing and then failing to appear at trial,sistrunk claimed that anderson felt the need to finally clear his conscience.
this third pcra petition pended in pennsylvania state court when sistrunk filed his federal petition,on december.in it,sistrunk raised two claims for relief based on newly discovered evidence of innocence the damon rodriguez confession,which sistrunk learned about on april,and the gregory anderson letter,which sistrunk received on june.on july,magistrate judge hey issued a report and recommendation,advising dismissal of both claims.in an order memorandum filed on october,the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania adopted the recommendation to dismiss sistrunk rodriguez claim,but,because sistrunk third pcra petition still pended,the district court stayed the anderson claim.on october,the district court recommitted the claim to magistrate judge hey for a supplemental report and recommendation.
on february,magistrate judge hey recommended that sistrunk anderson claim be dismissed as.the magistrate judge concluded that sistrunk conviction became final on march,sistrunk federal petition was filed on december,seven years past aedpa time limit,see d the anderson letter was not newly discovered evidence under d d,and thus did not create a new limitations period sistrunk third pcra petition did not toll the aedpa limitations period sistrunk was not entitled to equitable tolling and no coa should issue.
sistrunk filed his objections with the district court on march.the district court concluded that none of sistrunk objections had merit,affirmed the magistrate judge denial of a coa,and dismissed sistrunk habeas petition with prejudice on april.sistrunk then filed an application for a coa with this court under c,which we granted on march.
the district court had jurisdiction under a.as discussed below in part iii,we have jurisdiction under and c.
we apply a mixed standard of review.we scrutinize jurisdictional questions and legal conclusions under a plenary standard of review.see lambert blackwell,cir.on the merits,however,a federal court is limited to deciding whether a conviction violated the constitution,law,or treaties of the united states.estelle mcguire.a state court interpretation of state law binds a federal court sitting in habeas corpus.bradshaw richey.under aedpa,moreover,we must deny the writ unless the petitioner shows that the state court conviction unreasonably applied clearly established federal law,was contrary to clearly established federal law,or was based on an objectively unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.see d williams.taylor.
before turning to sistrunk substantive arguments,we address briefly and ultimately dismiss the government contention that we lack jurisdiction because sistrunk habeas petition does not state a constitutional claim.this argument attacks our jurisdiction on two levels.first,the government contends that the absence of a constitutional claim renders the coa defective,barring us from considering sistrunk claims.second,the government argues that sistrunk petition points only to his as a constitutional harm.because,in the government view,a freestanding claim of innocence is not a proper basis for federal habeas relief absent an independent constitutional violation occurring in the state trial,albrecht horn,cir citing herrera collins,sistrunk petition even if it were timely would lack the requisite underlying independent constitutional violation needed for our jurisdiction.
we conclude that our exercise of jurisdiction is proper.first,the united states supreme court opinion in gonzalez thaler,destroys the government attack on the coa.even a defective coa does not thwart our jurisdiction.rather,o nce a judge has made the determination that a coa is warranted which has happened here the coa has fulfilled its gatekeeping function.id.at.no further scrutiny of the coa is necessary.see id.at section c is a nonjurisdictional rule.
second,we need not address whether a freestanding claim of actual innocence would be cognizable on federal habeas review because that is not all that sistrunk petition offers sistrunk claims of innocence,rather,expressly incorporate separate constitutional violations.sistrunk states in his petition that he was denied his fourteenth and sixth amendment rights,not only because he is allegedly innocent,but also because newly discovered evidence shows that witnesses colluded to keep the identity of the real murderer a secret and one witness gregory anderson perjured himself due to government coercion.these claims are probative of innocence,to be sure,but they also implicate sufficiently sistrunk right to due process.indeed,a conviction obtained through use of false evidence,known to be such by representatives of the state,must fall under the fourteenth amendment.napue illinois,see lambert blackwell,cir stating that the government may not knowingly use perjured testimony at trial.the same result obtains when the state,although not soliciting false evidence,allows it to go uncorrected when it appears.napue,at see united states agurs,t he court has consistently held that a conviction obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony is fundamentally unfair.maxwell roe,cir granting habeas relief based on an actual innocence claim for a conviction stemming in part from perjured testimony.moreover,the teachings of brady maryland,require prosecutors to disclose any benefits that are given to a witness,including any possible lenient treatment in a given case.although the veracity of sistrunk allegations may be in question,the constitutional violations they encompass comprise an integral and unavoidable part of sistrunk claims on the way to demonstrating his innocence,sistrunk new evidence would show also that the government violated sistrunk due process rights.such a showing would unquestionably establish one or more independent constitutional violations and therefore would grant us jurisdiction to review the merits of sistrunk petition if and only if it is timely we turn now to address that question.
there can be no dispute that sistrunk petition would be without aedpa tolling exceptions.sistrunk conviction became final on march.see d.he had until one year from that date to file a habeas petition.id.d a.sistrunk did not file his federal petition,however,until december,many years too tardy.sistrunk then rushed to raise three tolling arguments,any one of which would salvage his petition.he contends that he is entitled to statutory tolling of his entire petition under d for the time during which his state postconviction review pended equitable tolling because of the discovery of new evidence or equitable tolling because he is actually innocent.we ultimately reject each,and will affirm the district court judgment.
sistrunk contends first that his petition is subject to aedpa express statutory tolling provision,which permits tolling for the time during which a properly filed application for state postconviction review is pending in state courts.see d swartz meyers,cir.sistrunk application was indeed pending he filed a new petition for review in the state pcra court within days of receiving the letter.the issue here is whether the application was properly filed.although aedpa permits a tardy state court filing upon the discovery of new evidence,see d d,sistrunk contention depends on whether the anderson letter fits within aedpa definition of new evidence the date on which the factual predicate of the evidence was known.we hold that it does not.
the district court concluded that sistrunk petition for state review was not properly filed because the anderson letter did not constitute newly discovered evidence under d d.rather,the district court held,sistrunk knew of anderson perjury no later than january,over a decade before he supposedly uncovered this evidence.
sistrunk contends that this holding was in error,because he did not learn of the factual predicate underlying anderson letter until june,when his attorney received it.his knowledge of his own innocence notwithstanding,sistrunk insists that he could not have introduced evidence about anderson initial reticence to come forward,the perjury of a key witness,police misconduct,or witness tampering until his receipt of anderson revelations the government responds that the facts of sistrunk innocence and anderson perjury were long ago determined,and the appearance of a new witness to testify to that fact does not restart the limitations period.
because the anderson letter does not fit within aedpa definition of new evidence,we agree with the district court that sistrunk petition was improperly filed,and thus,can not toll aedpa limitations period.evidence becomes known on the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence.d d.here,the pcra court found that sistrunk not only could have known,but actually did know of the vital facts underlying both the anderson letter and rodriguez affidavit,damon rodriguez was the real shooter and gregory anderson perjured himself long before the filing of his habeas petition.see app.this finding by the state court binds us.see warren kyler,cir i t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine determinations on questions.quoting estelle,at.because evidence that is previously known,but only newly available does not constitute newly discovered evidence,united states jasin,cir,we will not construe the evidence of innocence sistrunk offers as new.similarly,to the extent that the anderson letter introduced new evidence of the reasons behind anderson perjury,evidence known but unavailable at trial does not constitute newly discovered evidence within the meaning of rule.id.
sistrunk next contends that the government attempt to actively mislead him with respect to his rodriguez affidavit claim entitles him to equitable tolling.because sistrunk can not show both extraordinarily burdensome circumstances as well as reasonable diligence in investigating the claim,see schlueter varner,cir,we hold that he can not avail himself of equitable tolling.
the district court rejected this contention because sistrunk knew of rodriguez guilt and anderson perjury and yet did nothing about these facts for twelve years,placing his case far outside the bounds of reasonable diligence.
sistrunk,seeking to construct an unstated declaration of what the court meant but did not say,contends that he was actively misled by the pcra court.according to sistrunk,although the pcra court dismissed his entire petition as untimely,it did not mean to affix the label untimely to all of the claims within the petition,but meant instead to dismiss his affidavit claim on the merits.because the court alleged misstating led sistrunk to believe his claim was dismissed as untimely,he had thought that a federal habeas petition would be futile.see pace.diguglielmo.after discovering the error in,sistrunk then diligently filed his federal
