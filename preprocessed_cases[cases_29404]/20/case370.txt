respondent,the superintendent of correctional facility the superintendent,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york johnson,granting petitioner jermaine richardson application for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court concluded that the new york state trial court improperly admitted testimony based on two pretrial identifications of richardson by witness tacius in violation of richardson due process rights.we conclude that the district court erred because richardson failed to exhaust state remedies with respect to one of the identifications,and the determination of the new york courts that the other identification was not unnecessarily suggestive was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.accordingly,we reverse.
background 
on the night of october,four,raul ruiz,stanford lambert,and a man known as shaka were standing near a pay phone being used by a fifth man,denzel coleman.richardson approached these men and asked about the phone.two other men then approached.a robbery ensued,and shots were fired.as a result,ruiz and lambert were taken to the hospital for gunshot wounds,and coleman died.
a police officer heard the shots and observed four or five men running away.the officer ran after them,ordered them to stop,and arrested the two who did so,richardson and joseph moore.he did not recover a weapon or any proceeds of the crime from richardson.another man did not stop and escaped.the officer also arrested robert hankins,who was sitting in the backseat of a nearby car.the officer observed dwayne finch throw a gun while fleeing the crime scene and recovered the gun.his partner arrested finch.
the police asked to identify the participants in the crime at the police station,and he drove there,following a police car.as entered the,he saw richardson and two significantly taller men presumably moore and hankins in handcuffs.he immediately and spontaneously identified richardson as one of the shooters to an unknown police officer.
about an hour later,the police showed richardson,moore,and hankins together in a room to via a mirror as part of an identification procedure.again identified richardson as one of the shooters.also said that moore looked like the person who shot coleman but ultimately identified finch as coleman killer during a lineup conducted a few hours later.
also on the night of the shooting,some police officers presented richardson to ruiz at the hospital emergency room.ruiz,agitated at the sight of richardson,tried to jump off his gurney and yelled that richardson was the one who shot him and took his gold chain.the next day,ruiz identified richardson from a photo array.
before trial,richardson moved to suppress ruiz hospital identification and pierrelouis identification at the showup,arguing that both had been conducted in a suggestive manner.in february,following a hearing pursuant to united states.wade,the trial court denied the motion.in march,after the parties became aware of initial,spontaneous identification of richardson,richardson moved to suppress that identification as well.the trial court reopened the wade hearing to consider this motion,but ultimately denied that motion as well.
richardson was tried jointly with hankins and finch at trial,identified richardson and testified that richardson shot ruiz.ruiz also identified richardson and testified that richardson tried to take his chain and shot him.both witnesses testified about their identifications of richardson.richardson testified that he did not participate in the robbery or shooting and merely ran away when someone started shooting.the jury found richardson guilty of all counts remaining against him,including one count of murder in the second degree,two counts of attempted murder in the second degree,two counts of assault in the first degree,two counts of assault in the second degree,one count of reckless endangerment in the first degree,one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree,one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree,and four counts of robbery in the first degree richardson was sentenced to fifteen years to life in prison.
richardson appealed,arguing that the first,accidental identification by was impermissibly suggestive and influenced each of subsequent identifications of richardson.richardson no longer argued,however,that the second,official showup at the police station was unduly suggestive in its own right,nor did he challenge the identification by ruiz in the hospital.the appellate division of the new york supreme court affirmed his conviction,reasoning that viewing of richardson was accidental,unarranged,not attributable to any misconduct on the part of the police,and not unduly suggestive.people richardson.in april,the new york court of appeals denied richardson application for leave to appeal.people richardson.after several failed attempts to obtain relief and related appeals in state courts,richardson filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court.richardson superintendent of corr.facility,d.the district court granted richardson petition,finding that the conclusion of the state courts that identifications were not unduly suggestive was contrary to clearly established federal law and that the admission of pierrelouis identification testimony violated richardson due process rights.id.at.the superintendent now appeals.

discussion 
richardson failed to exhaust state remedies with respect to the second identification.
preliminarily,the superintendent claims that richardson is procedurally barred from challenging second viewing because richardson did not exhaust that challenge before the state courts this claim has merit.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,a n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state.b a.exhaustion requires that the prisoner fairly present the federal claim in each appropriate state court including a state supreme court with powers of discretionary review.baldwin reese,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a prisoner has not fairly presented a federal claim before a state court if the federal claim is not mentioned in the prisoner state court brief.see id.at.
here,richardson challenges both the first and second identifications,but did not directly challenge the second,official identification before the state appellate court.richardson appellate division brief argued that the first viewing was impermissibly suggestive.although his brief stated that g iven the total lack of effort on the part of the police to reduce the suggestiveness herein it is apparent that this identification was not reliable and that e ach of louis subsequent identifications of richardson was premised upon th e initial highly suggestive procedure,richardson app.div.br,it did not describe the second identification or argue that the official showup was impermissibly suggestive.as the appellate division was not expected to look beyond richardson brief to locate the claim that the second viewing was suggestive,richardson did not fairly present that claim before the appellate division see baldwin,at.richardson therefore failed to exhaust his claim that the second identification was improper.
were we to dismiss richardson petition without prejudice to allow him to exhaust his claim in state court,new york procedural rules would bar him from raising the claim at this point.see n.proc.law c spence superintendent,great meadow corr.facility,cir.when a petitioner can no longer present his unexhausted claim of trial error to the state courts,we deem the claim procedurally barred.acosta artuz,ci
