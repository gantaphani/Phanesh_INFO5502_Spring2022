ricky wayne short,who pled guilty to a federal drug charge and is currently incarcerated,appeals the denial of his motion to vacate his sentence.his attorney negotiated a plea agreement pursuant to which short indictment was amended without further action by the grand jury.short contends that this amounted to constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to both the amendment and the plea agreement.the amendment increased the quantity of cocaine alleged in short indictment from grams to grams.short also argues that the amendment deprived the district court of jurisdiction and gave rise to other constitutional violations.
in response,the government argues that short attorney rendered effective assistance with regard to the plea agreement because short willingly accepted responsibility for the amended drug charge.the government also asserts that the amendment did not deprive the district court of jurisdiction,and that short remaining claims are barred by his plea agreement in which he waived the right to collateral review.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
in august of,officers associated with the lawrence county tennessee sheriff department executed a search warrant at the residence of angela darlene williams.present at the home were williams and her ricky wayne short,both of whom were found smoking cocaine at the kitchen table.in the course of the ensuing search,the officers uncovered approximately four kilograms of cocaine in the master bedroom and approximately one kilogram of cocaine on the kitchen floor,along with other drug paraphernalia.a subsequent investigation revealed that,prior to the search,williams and charles lee furk had traveled to texas to purchase the cocaine using in cash provided by short.after purchasing the drugs in texas,furk and williams returned with the cocaine to williams residence in tennessee.
both williams and short were arrested at the scene.the report filed by the arresting officers described the quantity of cocaine found in the residence as approximately pounds,an amount roughly equal to kilograms.
procedural background 
a federal grand jury issued a indictment in october of,charging that in july and august of,both short and furk conspired to distribute five hundred grams or more of cocaine on august,both short and furk possessed five hundred grams or more of cocaine with the intent to distribute on october,furk possessed a quantity of cocaine with the intent to distribute and both short and furk,if convicted,would be subject to forfeiture of any real or personal property involved in the commission of the offenses.
following short arrest,his attorney entered into plea negotiations with the government,ultimately arriving at a plea agreement.at short hearing before the district court in february of,the government filed a motion to amend count one of the indictment,the conspiracy count.the motion sought to change count one from charging short with conspiring to possess five hundred grams or more of cocaine to conspiring to possess five thousand grams or more of cocaine.the text of the motion explained that this amendment was the product of conversations between counsel and was appropriate and necessary to accomplish the negotiated plea agreement to be presented to the district court.only the assistant attorney signed the motion.but when the court asked whether the defense had any objections to the amendment,short counsel stated that he did not.the court then orally granted the motion to amend the indictment and issued a written order to that effect later in the day.following the hearing,however,the court commented to counsel for the government that amending the indictment without seeking reindictment through the grand jury was an atypical procedure.
under the terms of short plea agreement that he signed at the hearing in open court,short pled guilty to count one as amended and agreed to certain property forfeitures.he also waived any right to direct or collateral review of his conviction or sentence apart from claims of ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct.in exchange,the government agreed to drop counts two and three of the indictment and to recommend that short receive a sentencing reduction due to his acceptance of responsibility,receive care at a medical facility for an existing shoulder injury,participate in a program,and be incarcerated in a facility near his home.
before accepting short guilty plea,the district court explained to him all of the charges in the indictment,including the amended gram quantity charged under count one.the court further inquired as to whether short was competent to enter a plea and whether he was aware of his right to plead not guilty and proceed to trial.after receiving satisfactory answers,the court explained that life in prison was the maximum sentence to which short could be subject,and short responded that he understood.the court later asked whether short was completely satisfied with his attorney performance,and he responded that he was.having explained the charges and established short competency,the court asked short how he wanted to plead.short responded i want to plead guilty.the court again explained to short the amended count one that charged conspiracy to possess and distribute grams of cocaine,and asked whether short understood what he was charged with.short again responded that he did.nothing in the record,however,indicates that the court specifically informed short of his right to be reindicted by a grand jury.
the court next questioned short regarding the circumstances of the drug incident from which the charges arose.short explained that he had given not the alleged by the government to furk so that furk and williams could purchase four kilos of cocaine,but that he had no idea where or how they would acquire the drugs.when asked how much cocaine the pair had brought back,short responded i do really know.the court further inquired why he did not know,and short responded i did weigh it.
after questioning short,the district court called special agent utley noble to give the government statement of the case.noble testified regarding both the agreement between short and furk to purchase drugs and the execution of the search warrant as described earlier.the record provides no basis for noble knowledge of these facts,but short raised no objection to the testimony on that ground.noble first testified that the arresting officers discovered approximately one kilogram of cocaine on the kitchen floor and that approximately four kilograms of cocaine were found in the master bedroom.noble subsequently testified that ferk sic purchased in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in texas that he brought back to tennessee in his truck.following noble testimony,the court asked short whether he took issue with any of noble assertions.short initially questioned only the location of furk truck.he then claimed that he did not recall the kilogram of cocaine allegedly found on the kitchen floor,explaining simply that i do remember it being on the floor.
having heard from the witnesses and accepted short plea,the district court ultimately sentenced short to months in prison,followed by five years of supervised release.the court arrived at this sentence by applying the mandatory minimum required under b a where the drug quantity involved is grams or more.given short criminal history category of i and the offense reduction recommended by the plea agreement,the sentencing guidelines range for short conviction under the amended count one was between and months of imprisonment.but because this guidelines range fell below the statutory mandatory minimum of months that the amended charge required,short plea agreement provided for an alternate sentence of months,which the district court ultimately imposed.
short did not directly appeal either his conviction or his sentence.he filed the present motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to in june of.short argued that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance with regard to both the amendment of his indictment and his plea agreement,and the amendment of the indictment deprived the district court of jurisdiction and violated short constitutional rights.the district court denied the petition on the grounds that short had not produced any evidence of his counsel ineffectiveness,that he had otherwise knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to collateral review under his plea agreement,and that there was an adequate factual basis for his guilty plea.short then filed a timely notice of appeal.the district court issued a certificate of appealability as to all of the claims raised by short.
ii.analysis 
standard of review and legal framework 
a prisoner seeking relief under must allege either an error of constitutional magnitude a sentence imposed outside the statutory limits or an error of fact or law that was so fundamental as to render the entire proceeding invalid.mallett united states,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.short directs his claims to the first and third categories.he alleges both that his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated and that the amendment of his indictment was invalid because it violated his fifth amendment right to indictment by a grand jury.
short waived his right to trial by jury and signed a plea agreement in which he waived his right to collateral and direct review except with regard to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct.this court generally enforces such waiver agreements.davila united states,cir.short must establish his ineffective assistance of counsel claim by a preponderance of the evidence.see pough united states,cir.short additional argument regarding subject matter jurisdiction is also reviewable because subject matter jurisdiction is not subject to waiver.see united states titterington,cir.
the district court denied short motion.we review a district court denial of a federal prisoner motion to vacate,set aside,or correct a sentence de novo,but will overturn its factual findings only if they are clearly erroneous.moss united states,cir.a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel presents a mixed question of law and fact that we similarly review de novo.mallett,at.de novo review also is also accorded claims regarding subject matter jurisdiction.cardinal united states,cir.
b.the district court correctly determined that short counsel provided constitutionally effective assistance 
to establish ineffective assistance of counsel,short must prove that his trial counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland washington,d.the supreme court subsequently modified strickland prejudice prong in the case of a defendant who pleads guilty,holding that such a defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel errors,he would not have pleaded guilty and instead would have insisted on going to trial.hill lockhart,d.
in evaluating an claim,we strongly presume counsel to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.strickland,at.as a result,defendants alleging ineffective assistance of counsel bear a heavy burden of proof.whiting burt,cir.a defendant challenging his attorney conduct during plea bargaining must show that counsel did not attempt to learn the facts of the case and failed to make a estimate of a likely sentence.he must also show that his lawyer deficiency was a decisive factor in his decision to plead guilty.united states cieslowski,cir.
short failure to request an evidentiary hearing prevents a meaningful assessment of his attorney conduct 
short makes no claim that his attorney advised him to lie to the court or to plead guilty to a charge that he did not commit,or that his attorney failed to advise him of the consequences of accepting the government plea offer in comparison to the alternatives.nor does short allege that his attorney failed to consult him regarding the amendment to the indictment.rather,short simply asserts that the evidence does not clearly show that he was,in fact,responsible for five kilograms of cocaine.short thereby implies that his attorney unreasonably advised him to plead guilty to that charge without making an attempt to learn the true facts.
the limited record contains no evidence regarding what short attorney discovered concerning the pertinent facts,or how he specifically advised short with respect to the plea negotiations.short did not request an evidentiary hearing before the district court,which would have shed light on these issues,but instead chose to rely on the transcripts as the only evidence to support his motion.
any contention of an inadequate investigation is strongly undermined by short own plea colloquy in which he openly accepted responsibility for grams of cocaine and raised no objection to agent noble characterization of the quantity that short conspired to purchase as in excess of five kilograms.furthermore,short testified that he had no issues regarding his counsel performance.given the strong presumption in favor of an attorney competence,short own admission of the drug quantity,and the testimony of the government witness,short has not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that his attorney either ignored or failed learn the facts of his case before advising him to plead guilty.
short per se argument fails 
rather than stating specific facts regarding his attorney knowledge or the advice he provided,short claims to have stated a prima facie case for ineffective assistance based on the allegedly unfavorable terms of the plea deal that his attorney negotiated.he argues that because his attorney advised him to accept a plea offer that required him to plead guilty to a more severe charge than that for which he was indicted,and because the reduction offered by the government did not in fact reduce his sentence due to the mandatory minimum prescribed by statute,his attorney assistance was per se ineffective.this argument requires analysis under the second prong of strickland,which addresses prejudice to the defendant.at.
to demonstrate prejudice,short must establish that there is a reasonable probability that,but for his counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.the supreme court has held that under certain egregious circumstances,however,a defendant can assert a per se claim in which the court will presume prejudice.hunt mitchell,cir citing united states cronic,d.those circumstances include the actual or constructive denial of assistance when counsel was either totally absent,or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding.cronic,at.in addition,if counsel is burdened by an actual conflict of interest,then a more limited presumption of prejudice applies.strickland,at.the court in cronic noted that a part from circumstances of that magnitude,however,there is generally no basis for finding a sixth amendment violation unless the accused can show how specific errors of counsel undermined the reliability of the finding of guilt.id.at.
short does not argue that his attorney was completely absent or that his attorney was prevented from assisting short during a critical stage of the proceeding.furthermore,no authority supports the argument that the acceptance of an allegedly unfavorable plea bargain creates an additional category of per se ineffective assistance that would relieve him of the burden of demonstrating actual prejudice.see craker mccotter,cir holding that a defendant who,on the advice of his attorney,accepted a sentence as part of a guilty plea for passing bad check,but who did not allege that he would otherwise have proceeded to trial,did not establish a per se ineffective assistance claim.
instead,short raises an alternative argument that the negotiated amendment of his indictment in and of itself violated his fifth amendment rights,creating per se prejudice.the fifth amendment provides in pertinent part that n o person shall be
