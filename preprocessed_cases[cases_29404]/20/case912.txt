uuno mattias matt baum appeals from the district court opinion and order of september,dismissing his petition for habeas corpus relief.see baum rushton,the district court opinion in january,baum was convicted in the court of general sessions for pickens county,south carolina,of the murder of his stepfather,randall pinion.baum had previously been brought to trial for the pinion murder in october,but,early in that trial second day,the trial judge declared a mistrial after learning that pinion body had just been discovered.on direct appeal,the court of appeals of south carolina rejected baum contention that the discovery of the body did not constitute manifest necessity for the mistrial and,thus,that his subsequent conviction was obtained in contravention of the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment.see state baum,the state decision.after exhausting his double jeopardy claim in the south carolina state courts,baum pursued such claim in these habeas corpus proceedings.as explained below,we affirm the district court denial of relief.
the court of appeals of south carolina,in the state decision disposing of baum direct appeal,outlined the facts surrounding the pinion murder as follows 
on october,randall pinion went to his bank and filled out an affidavit of forgery concerning two checks in the amount of apiece and made out to matt baum.the bank employee who assisted pinion gave him the original affidavit of forgery and instructed him to take it to the police if he desired to prosecute.on october,two days prior to pinion disappearance,he arrived at work upset and told a that matt baum,pinion stepson,had stolen some money from him.pinion told the he would give baum two days to repay the money or he was going to turn baum in to the police.on the morning of his disappearance,pinion stated to the that he was giving baum until that evening to give him his money.pinion never filed a police report in regard to the alleged forgeries.two weeks earlier,baum threatened to kill pinion after pinion had physically abused baum mother.
on friday,october,pinion disappeared after leaving work.his black pickup truck was not at his easley,south carolina home on friday night or saturday morning,but appeared at his house between and on saturday,october.between and on sunday,october,the truck again disappeared from the house.pinion truck was subsequently found in a church parking lot a few days later.
on november,baum sold a set of taylor made golf clubs to a sporting goods store,explaining they belonged to his stepfather,who had passed away and left him the clubs.pinion owned several sets of golf clubs,including a taylor made set.
police investigated pinion home and pickup truck and found pinion blood in various places throughout his home,as well as in the bed of his pickup truck.the police also found a bloody shoe print inside pinion home.the police concluded that pinion had been beaten to death inside of his home and someone thereafter attempted to clean up the crime scene.
based on their investigation,the authorities developed baum as a suspect in pinion disappearance.on november,after receiving a tip on his possible location,police attempted to apprehend baum as he fled in a white pickup truck.the chase reached speeds of more than miles per hour,and ended when the white truck became disabled following a traffic accident.when the police searched the disabled truck they discovered the keys to pinion truck,a couple of pinion checks,baum driver license,and a pair of tennis shoes whose tread was consistent with the bloody shoe print found inside pinion home.
state baum.
although the police had not located pinion body,the grand jury in pickens county returned an indictment on november,charging baum with the pinion murder.baum trial began on october,with judge john kittredge presiding.that day,a monday,the jury was sworn,the parties delivered their opening statements,and the prosecution presented three witnesses.at the start of the trial proceedings the following tuesday morning,the prosecution notified the court and the defense,during an conference in the judge chambers,that it had just learned that a body had been discovered in north carolina and identified as pinion.the prosecution thereafter made a motion in open court but outside the presence of the jury for a trial continuance or a mistrial based on the discovery of the victim body.the prosecution explained that the north carolina authorities had recovered the body on saturday,and sent a teletype about the body to the easley police department on sunday.according to the prosecution,the detectives assigned to the pinion murder investigation did not learn about the teletype until monday evening,and a positive identification of the body as pinion was not made until tuesday morning.the identification was made by pinion dentist,based on the north carolina medical examiner description of distinctive dental work.the prosecution presented the trial judge with an affidavit from the dentist,executed that very morning,verifying pinion identification.
the prosecution asserted that a continuance or a mistrial was necessary to give both sides of this case time to look at what evidence may come forward as a result of the discovery of pinion body.the prosecution explained 
obviously,there may do know what going to show up,but there may be evidence exculpating the defendant.and if that true,he needs to have access to that.conversely,there may be evidence that inculpates him and shows that he,in fact,is the one who dumped the body.and if that the case,he should not be allowed to benefit from his attempt at obstructing justice.
either way,your honor,i am aware that the jury has been sworn.i would ask that your honor,if you are inclined to grant my motion,find that this is for good cause and not as a result of some wrongdoing or anything else in that way of the state,and therefore would not prejudice us by attaching jeopardy to a trial that we begun.
your honor knows that we are here and are prepared to go forward.and it not any attempt whatsoever to continue this trial.as a matter of fact,i believe myself and the family who are here behind me are as ready as the defendant himself to get this behind us.but this is important evidence that we need to have some time to look at.
id.at.the defense responded that it was not joining in the prosecution motion in any way,shape,form or fashion.we are here.we ready for trial.and we ready to proceed,your honor.id.at.over this objection by the defense,judge kittredge declared a mistrial.he explained that,
b ased on the level of certainty that this may,indeed,be the remains of pinion,a mistrial is warranted for good cause,not the result of anything caused or done,any act or omission by the state.i feel this is a matter of manifest necessity and that jeopardy will continue.jeopardy does not attach and begin anew in my firm judgment,and i so rule that this is a matter of manifest necessity that potentially could enure to the benefit of the defendant.a key issue in the case was the fact that the body had not been found.this revelation is significant.and if it actually turns out,based on the scientific examination,that this is indeed the remains of pinion,then this case should well not continue and be retried at another date.
id.at.judge kittredge then reiterated that jeopardy will continue and concluded the proceedings,subject to the retrial.id.at.
on november,judge kittredge entered a written order declaring mistrial.see state baum,the mistrial order the judge stated therein the following findings of fact and conclusions of law 
based upon everything presented to this court,i hereby find that the discovery of the victim body almost one year after the date of the alleged murder was in no way a result of any act,omission,negligence,bad faith,or lack of effort on the part of the state.the state has diligently attempted to locate the deceased but had simply been unable to do so.in this regard,it is reasonable to conclude that whomever placed the body of randall pinion in the remote area of mcdowell county did so to secrete the whereabouts of the deceased and avoid detection.furthermore,given the fact that the defendant was incarcerated since november,unable to make bond,it was imperative upon the state to proceed to trial without further delay.in fact,there was an order requiring the case to proceed to trial.
i specifically find that it is of manifest necessity that a mistrial be granted in this case.the potential for exculpatory evidence being located with the body and the disposition site is significant and could potentially benefit or even exonerate the defendant.this court is aware of the concerns regarding a mistrial in any case and makes its decision after careful review of all the circumstances and the possible alternatives to granting a mistrial.
the court is aware of the decision in gilliam foster,cir en banc,and specifically finds that there was no other alternative available to the court to resolve this matter.it is imperative that the jury charged with deciding this case be given any and all relevant evidence upon which to base their decision.to ignore the opportunity to explore the disposition of the body,which could very likely be exculpatory to the defense,is too great.as stated in state prince,the standard for declaring a mistrial depends upon the existence of manifest necessity or the ends of public justice,the latter being defined as the public interest in a fair trial designated to end in just judgment.see also illinois somerville,d.furthermore,to suspend the trial of the case and allow the sitting jury to resume the trial approximately two months later would be fundamentally unfair to all concerned especially defendant and the jurors and contrary to the ends of justice.
having found the existence of manifest necessity for the mistrial,jeopardy continues in this case and the state is not prohibited from retrying this case at a later time.

on january,baum second trial commenced,with judge henry floyd presiding.the defense promptly moved for an order,on double jeopardy grounds,barring the state from moving forward with the trial.judge floyd denied the defense motion,observing that under the existing case law of this state the previous trial judge has tied my hands and i have no authority to override his order.the trial thereafter proceeded and,on january,the jury found baum guilty of murder.judge floyd sentenced baum to life in prison 
baum appealed to the court of appeals of south carolina,raising his double jeopardy claim.by its state decision,a panel unanimously rejected such claim,observing in pertinent part 
baum asserts that the state sought a mistrial to simply marshal evidence to strengthen its case against him,and that the grant of a mistrial on such basis is clearly prohibited by the double jeopardy clause.we agree that,as it has evolved in this country,the prohibition against double jeopardy is intended to condemn the practice of the prosecution requesting a mistrial for the sole purpose of buttressing weakness in its evidence,and the strictest of scrutiny is appropriate when the basis for a mistrial is the unavailability of critical prosecution evidence.arizona washington,d.however,we do not believe the facts of this case warrant the conclusion that this was the reason behind the granting of the mistrial.
first,we can not say the body of the victim in this case was critical evidence in the prosecution of baum such that its unavailability triggers the strict scrutiny announced in arizona washington.as noted by baum,the fact that randall pinion had been murdered was not in issue.at any rate,we conclude the discovery of the body of a victim during a murder trial,is an extremely important piece of evidence which has just as much potential to exonerate as to inculpate an accused.the judge recognized as much,and found that the public interest in a fair adjudication was implicated by the possibility of discovering exculpatory evidence and giving the jury the benefit of the fully developed facts when deciding the matter.consequently,we believe manifest necessity was clearly established,and find no abuse of discretion in the trial judge determination that a mistrial was dictated by such.
baum,at.the state court of appeals thereafter denied baum petition for rehearing,and the supreme court of south carolina and the supreme court of the united states denied baum petitions for writs of certiorari.
in september,baum filed his petition for habeas corpus relief in the district of south carolina,asserting his double jeopardy claim,which was exhausted in the state courts on direct appeal the parties filed for summary judgment,and the matter was assigned to a magistrate judge.on april,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation,concluding that the state summary judgment motion should be granted and baum denied.on september,the district court opinion was issued,granting the state summary judgment motion,denying baum summary judgment motion,and dismissing the habeas corpus petition with prejudice.on may,this court awarded baum a certificate of appealability on his double jeopardy claim.we possess jurisdiction over baum appeal pursuant to and.
we review de novo a district court denial of habeas corpus relief on the basis of a state court record.see tucker ozmint,cir.because the court of appeals of south carolina adjudicated baum double jeopardy claim on the merits on direct appeal,its state decision is entitled to deference pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.see d.aedpa mandates the use of a analysis to assess whether a habeas corpus petitioner is entitled to relief.under the first step of the analysis,we may award relief only if the state court adjudication of the issue on its merits resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or the adjudication resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.id.and,even if error is identified,habeas corpus relief can only be granted,under the second step of the aedpa analysis,if the error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brecht abrahamson,d internal quotation marks omitted.finally,the state court factual determinations are presumed to be correct and may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence.see e.

e ven if the first trial is not completed,a second prosecution may be grossly unfair.it increases the financial and emotional burden on the accused,prolongs the period in which he is stigmatized by an unresolved accusation of wrongdoing,and may even enhance the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted.the danger of such unfairness to the defendant exists whenever a trial is aborted before it is completed.consequently,as a general rule,the prosecutor is entitled to one,and only one,opportunity to require an accused to stand trial.

justice story rendered the classic formulation of the manifest necessity test in united states perez,wheat.see arizona washington,at.the perez court ruled that the state trial judge discharge of the jury over the defendant objection,because the jury could not agree on a verdict,constitute d no legal bar to a future trial.wheat.at.justice story articulated that,
in all cases of this nature,the law has invested courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict,whenever,in their opinion,taking all the circumstances into consideration,there is a manifest necessity for the act,or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.they are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject and it is impossible to define all the circumstances,which would render it proper to interfere.to be sure,the power ought to be used with the greatest caution,under urgent circumstances,and for very plain and obvious causes and,in capital cases especially,courts should be extremely careful how they interfere with any of the chances of life,in favor of the prisoner.but,after all,they have the right to order the discharge and the security which the public have for the faithful,sound,and conscientious exercise of this discretion,rests,in this,as in other cases,upon the responsibility of the judges,under their oaths of office.
id.the perez formulation,as the court later described it in somerville,abjures the application of any mechanical formula by which to judge the propriety of declaring a mistrial in the varying and often unique situations arising during the course of a criminal trial.at.indeed,the court explained in arizona washington,it is manifest that the key word necessity can not be interpreted literally instead,we assume that there are degrees of necessity and we require a high degree before concluding that a mistrial is appropriate.at.
the arizona washington court offered examples of cases that do a high degree of necessity.the court observed that one extreme is represented by cases in which a prosecutor requests a mistrial in order to buttress weaknesses in his evidence an abhorrent practice that the prohibition against double jeopardy as it evolved in this country was plainly intended to condemn.arizona washington,at.internal quotation marks omitted.as such,the court instructed that the strictest scrutiny is appropriate when the basis for the mistrial is the unavailability of critical prosecution evidence,or when there is reason to believe that the prosecutor is using the superior resources of the state to harass or to achieve a tactical advantage over the accused.id.at.footnote omitted see also downum,at.sustaining double jeopardy plea where mistrial resulted from prosecution failure to locate and serve subpoena on essential witness.
by contrast,the arizona washington court identified the other extreme of cases as those,like perez,involving the classic basis for a proper mistrial,the trial judge belief that the jury is unable to reach a verdict.arizona washington,at.in such cases,the court instructed,the trial judge declaration of a mistrial is to be accorded great deference by a reviewing court.id.at.
other cases lie somewhere between these two extremes on the spectrum of necessity,and may or may not satisfy the manifest necessity test.see downum,at.recognizing that extreme case of h arassment of an accused by declaration of a mistrial so as to afford the prosecution a more favorable opportunity to convict fails to mark the limits of the guarantee wade hunter.observing that the guiding principles of the perez decision command courts in considering whether a trial should be terminated without judgment to take all circumstances into account and thereby forbid the mechanical application of an abstract formula internal quotation marks omitted.for instance,while the downum court determined that jeopardy attached when the mistrial was declared because of the prosecution failure to locate and serve a subpoena on an essential witness,see at,the wade court refused to hold that the absence of witnesses can never justify discontinuance of a trial,see at.concluding that there was no double jeopardy bar to second where first was dissolved because key witnesses were unavailable due to military necessity.
the somerville court,though acknowledging that virtually all of the cases turn on the particular facts and thus escape meaningful categorization,recognized that,generally speaking,a trial judge properly exercises his discretion to declare a mistrial if an impartial verdict can not be reached,or if a verdict of conviction could be reached but would have to be reversed on appeal due to an obvious procedural error in the trial.at.the latter circumstance existed in somerville,where the trial judge had declared a mistrial over the defendant objection after deeming the indictment to be insufficient to charge a crime.see id.at.concluding that the mistrial met the manifest necessity requirement of our cases,since the trial court could reasonably have concluded that the ends of public justice would be defeated by having allowed the trial to continue.the former circumstance was found in arizona washington,where the trial judge had declared a mistrial because of improper remarks made by the defense during its opening statement to the jury.see at.according highest degree of respect to the trial judge evaluation of the likelihood of juror bias,even though another judge might have proceeded with trial after giving cautionary instruction,and concluding that manifest necessity supported mistrial ruling.
significantly,the arizona washington court cautioned that a trial judge must always temper the decision whether or not to abort the trial by considering the importance to the defendant of being able,once and for all,to conclude his confrontation with society through the verdict of a tribunal he might believe to be favorably disposed to his fate.at.quoting united states jorn,d plurality opinion.the court explained that,i n order to ensure that this interest is adequately protected,reviewing courts have an obligation to satisfy themselves that,in the words of justice story,the trial judge exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial.id.accordingly,if a trial judge acts irrationally or irresponsibly,his action can not be condoned.id.internal citations omitted.because the arizona washington trial judge had not act ed precipitately in response to the prosecutor request for a mistrial,but rather had evinc ed a concern for the possible double jeopardy consequences of an erroneous ruling and provided both defense counsel and the prosecutor full opportunity to explain their positions on the propriety of a mistrial,the court was persuaded that the judge exercised sound discretion and that the mistrial ruling was supported by the high degree of necessity which is required in a case of this kind.id.at.jorn,at.concluding that trial judge failed to exercise sound discretion when he abruptly and sua sponte discharged jury,without hearing from parties or considering possibility of continuance.
we substantially relied on arizona washington for our decision in gilliam foster,wherein we framed the primary issue before us as whether the state trial judge exercised sound discretion in granting the prosecution motion for a mistrial because the jury viewed certain photographs prior to their formal admission into evidence,cir en banc emphasis added see also perez,wheat.at recognizing that trial courts are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject of whether to discharge a jury from giving any verdict because there is a manifest necessity for the act,or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.we explained in gilliam that,under the sound discretion inquiry,i f the grant of a mistrial by the trial judge amounts to an irrational or irresponsible act,he must be found to have abused his discretion in finding that manifest necessity for the mistrial existed.at.
from the controlling supreme court precedent,we gleaned the following factors relevant to the sound discretion inquiry,whether the exercise of discretion by the trial judge in granting a mistrial was sound as opposed to irrational or irresponsible 
first,a reviewing court should look to whether a trial judge rationally could conclude that the grant of the mistrial was compelled by manifest necessity or whether the ends of public justice demanded that one be granted on the peculiar facts presented.in addition,a reviewing court may find relevant whether the trial judge acted precipitately or whether the trial judge expressed concern regarding the possible double jeopardy consequences of an erroneous declaration of a mistrial,heard extensive argument on the appropriateness of such a measure,and gave appropriate consideration to alternatives less drastic than granting a mistrial.
gilliam,at internal citations omitted.applying these factors to the gilliam record,we determined that neither manifest necessity nor the ends of public justice required a mistrial,and that the trial judge had otherwise failed to exercise sound discretion in declaring one,in that he acted precipitately,never evinced any awareness that the grant of a mistrial might implicate or deprive petitioners of their constitutional right to have the empaneled jury decide their guilt,and ignored an obvious and adequate alternative to the grant of a mistrial.id.at.we therefore ruled that the double jeopardy clause barred a retrial of the petitioners.see id.at.
importantly,because this matter comes before us pursuant to baum petition for habeas corpus relief,our review focuses on the propriety of the state decision of the court of appeals of south carolina.we may award baum relief only if the state itself accorded deference to the trial judge mistrial ruling in rejecting baum double jeopardy be found deficient under the highly deferential standards mandated by aedpa.those standards are contained in d contrary to and unreasonable application clauses,as well as in d unreasonable determination of the facts provision.we emphasize that it is supreme court precedent,and not fourth circuit precedent,to which we look in applying the aedpa standard of review.bustos white,cir 
in disposing of baum double jeopardy claim in the state decision,the state court of appeals identified and applied controlling supreme court precedent,including arizona washington and illinois somerville.see state baum.accordingly,the state decision did not contravene such thereby qualify baum for relief under d contrary to relying on contradictory legal conclusions.see williams taylor,d recognizing that,under contrary to clause,federal habeas court may grant writ if state court arrived at conclusion opposite to that reached by supreme court on question of law.baum contends that he is otherwise entitled to contrary to clause relief,however,because the state court of appeals decided his double jeopardy claim differently than the supreme court has decided such a claim on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.id.at.
additionally,baum maintains that he qualifies for relief under d unreasonable application clause,as well as d unreasonable determination of the facts provision.therefore,we assess whether the state court of appeals engaged in an objectively unreasonable application of supreme court precedent to the facts of baum case.williams,at.citing d unreasonable application clause.we also consider whether the court based its decision on an objectively unreasonable factual determination in view of the evidence before it,bearing in mind that f actual determinations by state courts are presumed correct absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.cockrell,d citing d,e see also lenz washington,cir.
baum relies on two contentions in seeking habeas corpus relief on his double jeopardy claim first,that the state court of appeals should have applied strict scrutiny to the trial judge mistrial ruling and,second,that the court should have concluded,even without the application of strict scrutiny,that the trial judge abused his discretion in declaring the mistrial.we assess these contentions in turn,within the confines of the highly deferential standard of review mandated by aedpa.
we begin with baum contention that the state court of appeals should have applied strict scrutiny to the trial judge mistrial ruling.as the supreme court recognized in arizona washington,the strictest scrutiny is appropriate when the basis for the mistrial is the unavailability of critical prosecution evidence,or when there is reason to believe that the prosecutor is using the superior resources of the state to harass or to achieve a tactical advantage over the accused.at.footnote omitted see also,downum,at.concluding that second trial contravened double jeopardy clause,where first jury discharged because prosecution failed to locate and serve subpoena on essential witness,and thereby entered upon the trial of the case without sufficient evidence to convict quoting cornero united states,cir.significantly,however,the state court of appeals concluded that it could not deem pinion body to be critical evidence in the prosecution of baum such that its unavailability triggers the strict scrutiny announced in arizona washington.baum,at.the court explained that,a s noted by baum,the fact that randall pinion had been murdered was not in issue.see also acknowledgment in baum state court of appeals brief that the fact that the victim had been murdered was not contested.the court further observed that the mistrial was declared on the ground that the body had just as much potential to exonerate as to inculpate to afford the prosecution a tactical advantage.baum,at see also mistrial order the potential for exculpatory evidence being located with the body and the disposition site is significant and could potentially benefit or even exonerate the defendant.
in these habeas corpus proceedings,baum challenges the state court of appeals characterization of the body as not being critical prosecution evidence,evidence necessary to the prosecution to obtain a conviction.baum asserts that evidence that the body of the victim had been found was important to establishing the fact that pinion had died,and he points to the trial judge acknowledgment,in making his oral mistrial ruling,that the discovery of the body was a significant revelation.br.of appellant citing.baum further criticizes the notion that the mistrial ruling was premised on the possibility that the body would produce exculpatory evidence.according to baum,
a t the time of the trial judge ruling,there was no evidence to suggest that the newly discovered,decomposed body could in any way exculpate the defendant.any doubt on this matter was established by the defense objection to the motion for a mistrial.at the second trial,the evidence tended to show that a full dna profile could not be developed from the remains of the body because it was so decomposed.while the prosecution was able to use the partial dna print to confirm the medical examiner identification of the body from dental records as being that of randall pinion,it was very unlikely that a decomposed body would be able to provide a dna sample sufficient to exculpate appellant.
id.at internal citation omitted.
unfortunately for baum,he has failed to rebut,by clear and convincing evidence,the factual determination that pinion body did not constitute critical prosecution evidence.see e.rather,baum merely asserts that the body was important and significant evidence,without to the determination of the state court of the prosecution could not have obtained a conviction without the body.of course,such an argument would be difficult for baum to make,in the state court of appeals recognized and baum brief to that court himself acknowledged that the fact that randall pinion had been murdered was not in issue.baum,at see also.
furthermore,baum contention that it was unreasonable to believe the body might lead to exculpatory evidence,because of its heavily decomposed state,is unavailing.the record reflects that,at the time the mistrial was declared,the body was just freshly discovered,and the trial judge did not know what evidence it would or would not reveal.the judge expressed a belief,however,that exculpatory evidence could be found not only with the body,but also at the disposition site.mistrial order.the record contains no evidence that the trial judge was on notice that the body was too decomposed to produce exculpatory evidence or that there was no possibility of locating such evidence upon examination of the surrounding site.indeed,there has been no showing that,at the time of the mistrial ruling,anyone knew for sure that a search for exculpatory evidence would be a futile endeavor 
finally,baum theory that the trial judge should have known pinion body was too decomposed to reveal exculpatory evidence undermines any contention that the mistrial ruling was intended to afford the prosecution a tactical advantage.if the judge was aware that the body was too decomposed to reveal exculpatory evidence,he was also aware of the impossibility of discovering inculpatory evidence.and,it would have been apparent to the judge that the body could only constitute evidence of pinion unnecessary to the prosecution,in that it undisputedly had at the ready sufficient alternative proof that pinion had been murdered 
in these circumstances,it was not objectively unreasonable for the state court of appeals to rule that pinion body did not constitute critical prosecution evidence,and that the purpose of the mistrial was not to bestow on the prosecution a tactical advantage over baum.as such,the court properly refused,consistent with supreme court precedent,to apply strict scrutiny in its review of the trial judge mistrial ruling.
we turn to baum contention that the court should have concluded,even without the application of strict scrutiny,that the trial judge abused his discretion in declaring the mistrial.in assessing this contention,we utilize gilliam analytic framework for performing a sound discretion inquiry.under this framework,which was gleaned from controlling supreme court precedent,we first look to whether the trial judge rationally could conclude that the grant of the mistrial was compelled by manifest necessity or whether the ends of public justice demanded that one be granted on the peculiar facts presented.gilliam,at.next,we consider whether,on the one hand,the trial judge acted precipitately,or whether,on the other hand,he expressed concern regarding the possible double jeopardy consequences of an erroneous declaration of a mistrial,heard extensive argument on the appropriateness of such a measure,and gave appropriate consideration to alternatives less drastic than granting a mistrial.id.at.of course,under aedpa,we are constrained to accept the state court of appeals answers to these questions so long as they were not contrary to,and did not involve an unreasonable application of,supreme court precedent,and providing they were not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.see d united states dunbar,cir reviewing double jeopardy claim on direct appeal.
on the first question whether the trial judge rationally could conclude that the grant of the mistrial was compelled by manifest necessity or whether the ends of public justice demanded that one be granted on the peculiar facts presented,gilliam,at state court of appeals focused on the unique circumstance of the discovery of pinion body.more specifically,the court recognized that,although the body did not constitute critical prosecution evidence,it was nevertheless an extremely important piece of evidence which ha d just as much potential to exonerate as to inculpate baum.baum,at.according to the court,manifest necessity for the mistrial ruling was clearly established by the trial judge finding that the public interest in a fair adjudication was implicated by the possibility of discovering exculpatory evidence and giving the jury the benefit of the fully developed facts when deciding the matter.id.
notably,in discussing the amount of deference due to the trial judge,the state court of appeals invoked both supreme court and south carolina decisions 
given the varying and often unique situations arising during the course of a criminal trial,the united states supreme court has recognized a broad discretion reserved to a trial judge in declaring a mistrial.state kirby,quoting somerville,at.a trial judge decision to grant a mistrial will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.state rowlands.
baum,at.the court thereby suggested that,like the trial judge determination in arizona washington,the trial judge mistrial ruling in baum case was entitled to special respect.at.baum distinguishes arizona washington,however,on the ground that the mistrial contrast to the mistrial in his declared out of concern for juror bias.he further maintains that,on the spectrum of necessity discussed in arizona washington,his case falls closer to the end of the spectrum where manifest necessity does not exist because the mistrial was granted on the basis that critical prosecution evidence was unavailable.br.of appellant internal quotation marks omitted.
even accepting baum position that the trial judge mistrial ruling is entitled to little deference,baum yet fails to establish that the state decision was deficient enough to entitle him to habeas corpus relief under aedpa baum attempts to convince us otherwise by drawing analogies to factually distinguishable cases in which manifest necessity was not found,and by conjuring up analogous hypothetical scenarios in which manifest necessity presumably would not be found.for example,in his appellate brief,baum asserts that the logic underlying the state decision manifest necessity determination,that the jury should have the benefit of fully developed facts,would cover any of the missing witness cases where the supreme court has determined that a mistrial was improperly granted.br.of appellant.and,at oral argument,baum counsel analogized this matter to a hypothetical sexual assault case where the prosecution proceeds to trial in reliance on eyewitness identification,but then moves for a mistrial to utilize newly announced,potentially inculpatory or exculpatory dna testing.according to baum,a mistrial in such circumstances would never be,thus,the mistrial in his case should not have been declared either.
simply put,baum analogies and hypothetical scenarios are unhelpful to him.although the supreme court has demonstrated a willingness to deduce some general principles from its established double jeopardy jurisprudence,see somerville,at.recognizing that,generally speaking,a trial judge properly exercises his discretion to declare a mistrial if an impartial verdict can not be reached,or if a verdict of conviction could be reached but would have to be reversed on appeal due to an obvious procedural error in the trial,the court has admonished time and again that virtually all of the cases turn on the particular facts and thus escape meaningful categorization,see also jorn,at.the conscious refusal of this court to channel the exercise of judicial discretion according to rules based on categories of circumstances reflects the elusive nature of the problem presented by judicial action foreclosing the defendant from going to his jury.internal citation omitted.moreover,baum has not identified a single supreme court case involving facts close enough to the facts here to compel a decision in his favor.see williams,at.recognizing availability of habeas corpus relief under d contrary to clause if state court decided matter differently than supreme court has on set of materially indistinguishable facts.
to be sure,the mistrial in question was declared as the result of an extraordinary event the discovery of pinion body on the eve of baum trial and the body identification just before the start of the trial second day.although baum wished to proceed without delay,the judge believed the ends of public justice could only be served by a mistrial.the court of appeals expressed no hesitation in deeming the discovery and identification of pinion body to constitute manifest necessity for the mistrial rather,the court declared such necessity to be clearly established by the trial judge finding that the public interest in a fair adjudication was implicated by the possibility of discovering exculpatory evidence and giving the jury the benefit of the fully developed facts when deciding the matter.baum,at.although we might consider manifest necessity a closer call than the state court of appeals apparently did,we can not say that its determination was objectively unreasonable.
it is entirely understandable why the trial judge and the state court of appeals conferred special significance on the body as a potential source of,particularly,as a potential source of exculpatory evidence.baum was,needless to say,presumed to be innocent.and there are countless examples of exculpatory evidence including dna evidence being recovered from victims of murder and other crimes.see,thompson connick,cir robbery conviction vacated as result of bloody swatch from victim pants excluding thompson as perpetrator pierce gilchrist,cir rape conviction vacated b ecause dna analysis demonstrated that pierce could not have been the source of the semen found on the rape victim gomez atkins,cir murder charge against gomez dismissed due to exculpatory results of scientific tests on victim fingernail scrapings and loose hairs found on her body see also rick brundrett,questions of innocence sometimes the bad guy is the one doing time,the state columbia,july,at a recent exoneration case involved perry mitchell,who was freed in after serving more than years in prison for the rape of a teenage girl in lexington county.he was convicted largely on the testimony of the victim a dna test later said he did do it.
because of the singular and potentially substantial evidentiary value of the victim body to a murder case,it also was reasonable for the state court of appeals to endorse the trial judge determination that further examination of pinion newly discovered body was justified to afford the jury the benefit of the fully developed facts.as the supreme court recognized in wade,a defendant valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal must in some instances be subordinated to the public interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments.at.in light of this principle,the wade court approved of a second of the defendant even though the first was dissolved because of the absence of prosecution witnesses,because a tactical military not the prosecution bad caused the witnesses to be unavailable.id.at.see also united states ex rel.gibson ziegele,cir rejecting double jeopardy claim where mistrial declared due to sudden illness of key prosecution witness,which rendered him unable to take stand for at least one to two weeks.here,the trial judge found that the belated discovery of pinion body was in no way a result of any act,omission,negligence,bad faith,or lack of effort on the part of the state,mistrial order,and that the potential evidentiary value of the only as a source of exculpatory evidence for baum,but also relevant evidence imperative to a just judgment by the too great to ignore,id.at.the state court of appeals agreed with the trial judge manifest necessity determination,and we also must say that it was a rational one 
next,we consider whether the trial judge otherwise exercised sound discretion in declaring the is,whether the trial judge acted precipitately,or whether he expressed concern regarding the possible double jeopardy consequences of an erroneous declaration of a mistrial,heard extensive argument on the appropriateness of such a measure,and gave appropriate consideration to alternatives less drastic than granting a mistrial.gilliam,at.this issue was not explicitly addressed in the state decision.we nevertheless agree with the district court that,a lthough the south carolina court of appeals did not specifically indicate it found the trial judge made a reasoned decision,with those exact words,it is clear that the court of appeals reviewed the trial court decision and found it appropriate based on sound discretion.district court opinion.in these circumstances,we still apply aedpa deferential standard of review in considering the sound discretion question,but we must conduct an independent review of the record and the applicable law to make the aedpa determinations.fullwood lee,cir citing bell jarvis,cir en banc.
the record reflects that,at the start of the second day of baum trial just after the body had been identified as pinion,the trial judge conducted an conference in his chambers,during which,according to the parties,the prosecution announced the discovery of the body.the judge then conducted proceedings in open court,outside the presence of the jury.at that time,the prosecution moved for a trial continuance or a mistrial,described the events surrounding the discovery and identification of pinion body,and argued the merits of the motion.the defense was afforded an opportunity to it did so,registering its objection to the prosecution motion on the ground that baum was ready to proceed.the judge then announced his decision to declare a mistrial,explaining that it was a matter of manifest necessity,in that there was good cause shown and no bad faith demonstrated by the prosecution,and that further examination of the body could enure to the benefit of the defendant.id.furthermore,the judge evinced an awareness of the ramifications of his mistrial ruling,by discussing the manifest necessity issue and specifying that jeopardy will continue.id.
thereafter,in his written mistrial order,the judge reiterated the reasons for his manifest necessity determination and emphasized that he ruled only after careful review of all the circumstances and the possible alternatives to granting a mistrial.mistrial order.the judge also acknowledged our gilliam decision and found that there was no other alternative available to the court to resolve this matter.id.as to the possibility of a trial continuance,the judge observed that to suspend the trial of the case and allow the sitting jury to resume the trial approximately two months later would be fundamentally unfair to all concerned especially defendant and the jurors and contrary to the ends of justice.id.
baum contends that t he short amount of time that passed between the request for a mistrial or continuance and the granting of the mistrial demonstrates that the trial judge failed to meaningfully consider the continuance alternative.br.of appellant.although the proceedings leading up to the mistrial ruling or at least the proceedings in open court were indeed brief,there is no indication that the trial judge restricted the parties opportunity to be heard or otherwise acted precipitately.rather,the judge heard all the argument the parties apparently wished to give,expressed concern about the jeopardy issue,and,as reflected in the mistrial order,considered and rejected a trial continuance as a possible alternative to a mistrial.
baum also attacks,for lack of support in the record,the judge finding that a continuance would have been necessary.yet baum fails to rebut such finding by clear and convincing evidence,asserting only that the prosecution willingness to pursue this option reveals that the continuance would not have been for nearly so long a period of time.br.of appellant.the finding of the was in a far better position than any reviewing court to evaluate the likely length of delay and its probable effects on baum and the can not be overturned on such a flimsy basis.moreover,even if another judge might have granted a continuance instead of a mistrial,this judge was not obligated to do so.arizona washington,at.according highest degree of respect to judge mistrial ruling,even though some trial judges might have proceeded with the trial after giving the jury appropriate cautionary instructions.put succinctly,whereas the judges in jorn and gilliam acted irrationally and irresponsibly,see jorn,at.judge abruptly and sua sponte discharged jury,without hearing from parties or considering continuance option gilliam,at judge acted precipitately,failed to acknowledge defendants interest in proceeding before empaneled jury,and ignored obvious and adequate alternative to mistrial,the judge in this case can reasonably be said to have exercised sound discretion.that is,such a conclusion is neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established supreme court law 
pursuant to the foregoing,we affirm the district court dismissal of baum petition for habeas corpus relief.
in nine short sentences immediately following the prosecution motion for a continuance or mistrial,the trial court in this case declared a mistrial without adequately considering reasonable alternatives to what was undoubtedly a drastic course of action.a month later,the court issued a written order setting forth constitutionally insufficient justifications for its actions.under these circumstances,i can not conclude that the trial judge expressed concern regarding the possible double jeopardy consequences of an erroneous declaration of a mistrial,heard extensive argument on the appropriateness of such a measure,and gave appropriate consideration to alternatives less drastic than granting a mistrial.gilliam foster,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.
the majority has thoroughly set forth the facts,and i do not read them differently.relevant to my consideration,however,is the following on october,the second day of baum trial,the prosecution moved for a continuance or mistrial based on the discovery of pinion body.at that point,the jury had been sworn in and had heard the testimony of three witnesses.baum opposed the motion,but the trial court granted it.in granting the mistrial,the court stated,in its entirety 
i going to declare a mistrial.i have received an affidavit from the dentist.based on his review of the situation and a conference with the medical examiner for the state of north carolina,based on the level of certainty that this may,indeed,be the remains of pinion,that a mistrial is warranted for good cause,not the result of anything caused or done,an act or omission by the state.i feel this is a matter of manifest necessity and that jeopardy will continue.jeopardy does not attach and begin anew in my firm judgment,and i so rule that this is a matter of manifest necessity that potentially could inure to the benefit of the defendant.a key issue in the case was the fact that the body had not been found.this revelation is significant.and if it actually turns out,based on the scientific examination,that this is indeed the remains of pinion,then this case should well not continue and be retried at another date.
again,i note jeopardy will continue,and that my ruling in the case.
on november,approximately one month after the court granted the state motion for a mistrial,it issued a written order explaining its reasoning for doing so.
at baum second trial,he argued that the double jeopardy clause barred the proceedings,but the judge denied the motion,noting,i agree with your argument,but i ca grant you the relief simply because under the existing case law of this state the previous trial judge has tied my hands and i have no authority to override his order.on january,the jury found baum guilty,and the judge sentenced him to life in prison.
the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment mandates that no person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.the supreme court has instructed that w e resolve any doubt in favor of the liberty of the citizen,rather than exercise what would be an unlimited,uncertain,and arbitrary judicial discretion.downum united states,d internal quotation omitted.
in arizona washington,the supreme court recognized that a second trial increases the financial and emotional burden on the accused,prolongs the period in which he is stigmatized by an unresolved accusation of wrongdoing,and may even enhance the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted,d internal footnote omitted.thus,in view of the importance of the right to freedom from double jeopardy,and the fact that it is frustrated by any mistrial,the prosecutor must shoulder the burden of justifying the mistrial if he is to avoid the double jeopardy bar.his burden is a heavy one.id.at.
in gilliam foster,this court noted,if the grant of a mistrial by the trial judge amounts to an irrational or irresponsible act,he must be found to have abused his discretion in finding that manifest necessity for the mistrial existed.at.in making this assessment,the court,construing supreme court precedent,set forth two prongs for a reviewing court to consider first,whether a trial judge rationally could conclude that the grant of the mistrial was compelled by manifest necessity or whether the ends of public justice demanded that one be granted on the peculiar facts presented.id.additionally,a court should consider whether the judge acted precipitately or whether the trial judge expressed concern regarding the possible double jeopardy consequences of an erroneous declaration of a mistrial,heard extensive argument on the appropriateness of such a measure,and gave appropriate consideration to alternatives less drastic than granting a mistrial.id.at.
applying these factors to the present case,first,the trial court rationale behind its finding of manifest necessity was grossly insufficient.at trial,the court primary reason for declaring the mistrial was that it viewed pinion body to be crucial evidence without which a trial could not proceed.yet both the state and the appellant were prepared to proceed to trial without the body.the state was prepared to present what it thought was sufficient evidence to support its theory that baum murdered his stepfather i believe myself and the family who are here behind me are as ready as the defendant himself to get this behind us,and the defense was prepared to defend against such a theory we are here.we ready for trial.and we ready to proceed,your honor.id.neither side depended on pinion body for its case.thus,the body could not have reasonably been viewed as crucial evidence whose absence would undermine the trial.
notably,the trial court did not consider at the time of the mistrial declaration whether there were alternatives to a mistrial,and it did not hear extensive argument on the appropriateness of the mistrial.
in order to determine if the mistrial was required by manifest necessity,the critical inquiry is whether less drastic alternatives were available.if alternatives existed,then society interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments was not in conflict with the defendant right to have the case submitted to the jury.
united states shafer,cir internal quotations and citations omitted emphasis added see also harris young,cir if obvious and adequate alternatives to aborting the trial were disregarded,this suggests the trial judge acted unjustifiably.
there is no indication in the record as to why a suspension of baum trial would have been necessary in order to examine the body properly.as we noted in united states sloan,speculation can not serve as a basis for manifest necessity,cir quoting united states allen,cir alteration in original.in actuality,the coroner report was ready at the end of the day the mistrial was actually granted.at most,therefore,the trial would have had to have been suspended only a short period of time in order to allow each side to assess the newly acquired evidence.see,dunkerley hogan,cir t he apparent availability of at least one alternative to a the trial for to us to conclude that a mistrial was not a manifest necessity.tellingly,the prosecutor asked for either a continuance or a mistrial.thus,even the state thought that a continuance would have been sufficient to consider the new evidence.
of course,the trial court did not know at the time how long it would take to examine pinion body,and deference is owed to the court in its assessment of whether a continuance is warranted.but deference is not blind approval,and i f the record reveals that the trial judge has failed to exercise the sound discretion entrusted to him,the reason for such deference by an appellate court disappears.washington,at.see also gilliam,at.the record in this case presents absolutely no justification for the trial judge estimate.as the gilliam court aptly noted in that case
