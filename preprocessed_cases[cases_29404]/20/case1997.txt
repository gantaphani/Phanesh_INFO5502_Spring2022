jerry ward appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of illinois denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought under.his appeal presents the question of whether a federal habeas court may review procedurally defaulted claims of alleged structural errors when the petitioner has not argued that the procedural default is excused by cause and prejudice or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result if the claims are not addressed.we hold that a federal habeas court may not review such claims,and therefore we affirm the district court denial of ward petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
background 
ward has not rebutted the state court factual determinations.therefore,we presume the state court recitation of the facts to be correct.e,mahaffey schomig,cir.
ward was indicted by a grand jury for the shooting murder of bruce herd,the bludgeoning murder of pamela williams,the armed robbery of bruce herd,and possession of a stolen motor vehicle.
at ward jury trial,police officers joseph scardino,james peck,and james summerville testified that they responded to a call of a man being dumped from a car on february.at approximately,they found a black male lying in the snow with a gunshot wound to the skull.the body was later identified as bruce herd.
officer scardino and his partner left the scene to drive around the area.they were alerted to the description of the suspect vehicle.shortly thereafter,they found a car that matched the description and ultimately arrested ward,the driver of the car.from the front seat of the car,the officers recovered a caliber revolver and two spent cartridges.officer scardino testified that he saw a red substance in the form of dots as well as a white fleshy material or matter on the car and on ward face and clothes.
after ward had been handcuffed,officers peck and summerville joined officer scardino.officers peck and summerville testified that they saw a red substance and a white flesh substance on ward face and on the front of his clothing.they saw the same red and white materials on the trunk and right rear quarter panel of the car.ward was arrested and transported to the police station.at the station,additional detectives noted that red splatters appeared on ward outer jacket,trousers,shoes,and undershorts.
shortly after ward arrest,officers received an additional notification about a man shot.officers ultimately found the second victim,pamela williams,lying in the snow.an officer testified that a tire jack and hat were lying in the snow near the body.
an evidence technician collected the physical evidence from the case,including plastic cups and soda cans recovered from the car that ward had been driving,and numerous fingerprints,and blood samples found at the crime scenes.the technician also took many photographs of the crime scenes.a serologist for the crime lab,pamela fish,analyzed the samples taken from ward clothing,the tire jack,the garage door,car trunk lid,and car right fender.she testified that the bloodstains were consistent with williams blood and inconsistent with ward and herd blood.from the shot residue analysis and swabs taken from ward hands,a crime lab chemist concluded that the evidence was consistent with ward having recently discharged a handgun.
the state also presented the report of a firearm expert.that expert had concluded that the bullet that had killed herd had been fired from a caliber revolver like the one recovered from the car ward had been driving.a latent print examiner conducted an exam of the fingerprints taken from the exterior of the car and from the items recovered from the car,finding that a print from the exterior passenger window and a print from one of the plastic cups recovered from the car were made by ward.williams matched a print from the soda can found in the car,and herd matched a print from a plastic cup.no prints were recovered from the gun or tire iron.
a medical examiner performed the autopsies on the victims,concluding that herd was killed by a gunshot wound to the back of the head,and that williams died from injuries due to beating.the examiner discovered external injuries and eleven internal injuries to williams and noted that the beating would have caused the emission of brain matter.
other testimony at trial included that of curtis rollins,who testified that while he was in his home at,he heard two gunshots.he looked out the window but could not see anything because a garage blocked his view.at he went to the store and on his return he saw a body laying in front of a garage in the alley.
after the state rested,defense counsel called detective warren gavin.gavin testified that during his february,interview of rollins,rollins had not stated that he had heard two shots fired at on february.defense counsel attempted to introduce a statement that ward had made to the police about how he had acquired the car,but the judge ruled the statement inadmissible.
on the next day of trial,defense counsel requested a continuance for the purpose of locating five additional witnesses.the defense proffered that three of the witnesses would testify to ward alibi a fourth would testify to his recollection of seeing two black men,neither of whom was ward,remove a body from the car and drive away the fifth would testify that he saw two black men remove a body from a car and drive away.the court granted a lunch recess to locate the witnesses,but the defense was able to locate only one witness during the allotted time.ward decided not to call that witness,and he rested his case.
the jury returned guilty verdicts on the charges of murder,armed robbery,and possession of a stolen motor vehicle.ward waived his right to sentencing by the jury.the trial judge sentenced him to death for each of the murders,in addition to a term of imprisonment for the armed robbery conviction and a term of imprisonment for the possession of a motor vehicle conviction,the sentences to run concurrently.
the illinois supreme court affirmed ward appeal of his convictions and sentences on direct appeal.people ward.the illinois supreme court later affirmed the dismissal of ward petition.people ward.
ward filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court pursuant to.while the petition was pending,former illinois governor george ryan commuted ward sentence to natural life in prison without possibility of parole.ward then filed a second amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court.the district court denied all of the claims in the petition.regarding the claims that ward advances in this appeal,the district court found that they were procedurally defaulted in the state courts.because ward did not attempt to overcome the procedural default by arguing cause for noncompliance with the state procedural rule and actual prejudice arising from the alleged constitutional violations,or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would occur if the district court did not address the merits of the claims,the district court concluded that the claims were not subject to review in a petition.united states ex rel.ward mcadory,c,wl,order dismissing habeas corpus petition.the district court granted a certificate of appealability on the sole issue of whether edwards carpenter,d requires a petitioner to establish cause and prejudice with respect to procedurally defaulted claims of alleged ex parte communications,perjured testimony,and brady violations,in order to obtain review in the habeas court.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court findings of law de novo.walton briley,cir.
in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,ward claimed that his custody was in violation of the constitution of the united states because his trial judge had engaged in two ex parte communications,the state had knowingly presented perjured testimony,and the state had failed to tender an exculpatory photograph of ward taken shortly after his arrest.ward argued that the combined effect of these three errors constituted a structural defect in the constitution of the trial mechanism mandating automatic reversal.see arizona fulminante,d.ward conceded before the
