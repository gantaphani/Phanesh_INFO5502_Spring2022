edward pinchon was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison for the killing of his adult male lover.pinchon,who was old at the time of his arrest,was transferred from juvenile court to a state criminal court to be tried as an adult.after exhausting his direct appeals without success,he returned to the state trial court with a petition for postconviction relief.the state trial court dismissed pinchon petition because it was filed after the expiration of tennessee statute of limitations for such claims.
prior to this dismissal,pinchon had also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court,asserting insufficiency of the evidence and faulty jury instructions as grounds for relief.he later filed an amended petition that added two claims after the state courts ruled against him.the district court dismissed pinchon claims as untimely and procedurally defaulted,and it further concluded that pinchon and claims,which were pursued on direct appeal in state court,had no merit.
on appeal,pinchon limits his challenges to the district court rulings regarding his and claims.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
the parties do not dispute the underlying facts in this case.they are set forth in the opinion of the tennessee court of criminal appeals as follows 
the defendant was seventeen years old on april,and he had been spending time,including overnight visits with the victim,leslie handy,a or homosexual male.although the defendant slept in the victim bed when he stayed overnight,he testified that their sexual activity was limited to the victim fellating him.the victim occasionally purchased clothes for the defendant,and at the victim request,the defendant kept these clothes at the victim residence.
much of the evidence inculpating the defendant came from the testimony of mary jones,who was the victim neighbor and had known him since he was a young boy when he had gone to school with her children.she had known about the victim relationship with the minor defendant for six months to a year.she testified the defendant would stay at the victim house for about five nights a week and that they got along pretty good.however,three or four days before april,she was in her lawn talking to the victim,who was a few feet away inside his kitchen,when she heard a slap.the victim said the defendant had slapped him,and the victim threatened to hit the defendant with a skillet.the defendant spent the night of april at the victim residence,and the victim took him to school on the morning of april.
on the evening of april,jones was visiting with the victim in his house when the defendant arrived in the company of three other boys.at one point,the defendant playfully wrestled with the victim,who was wearing a style dress and was seated o n the living room floor.jones testified that the defendant then went to the back of the house,returned to the living room with a shotgun,and ordered everyone to leave because they was fixing to make love.the victim,who was not taking the defendant seriously,told him to stop acting the fool and to put away the shotgun.at some point,the defendant said he would bust the victim head to the fat.however,the defendant put away the shotgun,and he and his three companions left.
a few minutes later,the victim phone rang,and jones answered to find the defendant on the line.the defendant said he wanted to speak to the victim and that he was going to kill that bitch.she gave the phone to the victim,who conversed with the defendant.approximately fifteen minutes later,the defendant and his three companions returned to the victim house.jones was still present and quoted the defendant as saying,how much you bet i wo kill that bitch the defendant then told jones that if she did want to see what happened she had better leave.when the defendant pulled a pistol out of his jogging pants,jones retreated to her apartment next door.ten seconds later,as she reached her steps,she heard a shot.as she stepped inside the door,she heard four or five more shots.she heard footsteps on the gravel outside and looked out to see the defendant and two of the boys running along the driveway.a neighbor who was outdoors a few houses away testified that he heard shots and then saw five or six young men run to a dark car and drive away.
jones called the police,who arrived and found the victim eyeglasses on the porch and his slippers between the storm door and the closed,wooden front door of the house.there were bullet holes in the door frame that indicated that bullets had struck the frame from the outside of the house.inside,they found the victim o n the floor,clutching the telephone,dead from a bullet wound to the heart.
the theory of the defense was posited by the testimony of the defendant and two of the other young men,vernon grigsby and jeffrey pinchon edward cousin,who visited the victim home that night.although their stories conflicted in several respects,grigsby,jeffrey pinchon,and the defendant testified that they and josh graham went in graham car to the victim house twice on the evening of april,because the defendant wanted to get his clothes.during the first visit,the defendant playfully wrestled with the victim and procured the shotgun however,they denied that the defendant made the comment and denied that he threatened the victim in any way.the defendant retrieved a couple of items of clothing,and they left.in an hour or two,after the defendant decided that he wanted the rest of his clothes,they returned.the defendant put his clothes in a bag,and the defendant,jeffrey pinchon,and grigsby went down the driveway and left josh graham behind.the defendant and jeffrey pinchon said that they raced to graham car in order to claim the front seat.grigsby testified that graham and the victim were having words on the victim porch.the trio heard shots.grigsby saw the victim falling through the front door and the door closing.they testified that graham,with pistol in hand,fled to the car.
all four got into the car,and graham drove away.grigsby testified that graham threatened to hurt us if we said anything.jeffrey pinchon testified that no one mentioned the shooting.graham let the three boys out and left.none of the boys called the police.
on july or august,the defendant was arrested.on april,josh graham was murdered.the parties entered a stipulation of fact which indicated that a person had been charged with graham murder,that the case was apparently unrelated to the case on trial,and that the defendant had given the state notice of its defense that graham was the perpetrator sometime in the weeks before graham was killed.

procedural background 
because he was old at the time of his arrest,pinchon initially faced charges in juvenile court.following a hearing to determine whether pinchon should be tried as an adult,the juvenile court concluded in the affirmative and exercised its discretion to transfer pinchon to the davidson county criminal court.
pinchon was convicted by a jury of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.on direct appeal,the tennessee court of criminal appeals affirmed pinchon conviction and sentence,rejecting his arguments that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction and that one of the jury instructions violated his due process rights.pinchon then filed a pro se application for permission to appeal with the tennessee supreme court,which was denied on december.pinchon state,no,wl,at.app.although pinchon current counsel maintains that pinchon never received notice of this denial,pinchon testified at his state postconviction proceeding that he did in fact receive a letter from the tennessee supreme court notifying him of its refusal to hear his appeal.in addition,in pinchon petition for postconviction relief,signed by him on december,pinchon stated that the tennessee supreme court denied his request for permission to appeal on december,demonstrating that he knew about the denial and the date it was issued.there is no evidence in the record indicating that this notice was untimely or inadequate in any way.
approximately three months later,on march,pinchon filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee,bringing the same two claims that he had raised on appeal in the state appellate court.evidently having forgotten the prior notice that he had received informing him that his application for permission to appeal had been denied,or not understanding its effect,pinchon mailed a letter to the tennessee supreme court in september,seeking an update regarding the status of his appeal.the request read in full i would like to know the status of my pending motion to reconsider.the last date i received any information was on.since then i have not heard anything.the record does not clarify what pinchon is referring to when he mentions a motion to reconsider,there being no evidence that any such motion was filed.in response to this inquiry,pinchon received a handwritten,unsigned,and undated note from the tennessee supreme court that read on,the case was mandated closed jurisdiction was returned to the trial court.nothing currently pending because the case is closed.pinchon maintains that,with the help of a fellow inmate,he understood this note to indicate that his conviction was final on december,and that he had one year from that date to file for postconviction relief.
while his habeas petition was pending in the district court,pinchon also filed a pro se petition for postconviction relief in the davidson county criminal court.pinchon mailed this petition on december,one year and days after the tennessee supreme court denied his application for permission to appeal.he obtained counsel shortly after the filing.the state trial court held two evidentiary hearings regarding pinchon petition,during which pinchon informed the court about his receipt of the handwritten note from the tennessee supreme court and presented evidence that he had been diagnosed as having a mild form of mental retardation.
finding that pinchon petition was not filed within the statute of limitations for seeking postconviction relief,and that pinchon had not demonstrated mental incompetence sufficient to excuse his tardy filing,the davidson county criminal court granted the state motion to dismiss.that ruling was affirmed by the tennessee court of criminal appeals.the tennessee supreme court then denied pinchon application for permission to appeal.
meanwhile,the district court,which had been holding pinchon habeas petition in abeyance pending his exhaustion of remedies,reopened the petition on august,following the tennessee supreme court denial of pinchon application.on march,four years after filing his original filed a motion to amend his petition to add claims regarding both the transfer hearing in juvenile court and the conduct of his trial.the district court never directly ruled on this motion.instead,it granted the state motion for summary judgment,concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support pinchon conviction,that any error regarding the jury instructions at trial was harmless,and that pinchon claims were both untimely and procedurally defaulted.
the district court,on june,certified two issues for pinchon to pursue on appeal whether he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial,and whether there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to sustain pinchon conviction.shortly thereafter,on november,pinchon filed a motion in this court to expand the certificate of appealability coa to include the issue of whether he received ineffective assistance of counsel in the juvenile court at his transfer hearing.this court,construing pinchon notice of appeal as a motion to expand the coa,issued an order denying expansion of the coa on december.that order,however,made no mention of pinchon motion to add a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel at the transfer hearing.rather,the order declined to expand the coa to address the claim that pinchon had raised in the district court.the order concluded by stating that t he case will proceed on the issues certified for appeal by the district court whether pinchon received reasonably effective assistance of counsel at trial and whether the state proof was sufficient to support pinchon conviction.
pinchon then filed his principal brief in this case.in addition to addressing the two issues certified for appeal,pinchon challenges the district court dismissal of his amended petition as untimely,and he raises the claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the juvenile court transfer hearing.on april,prior to filing its principal brief,the state filed a motion to strike the portions of pinchon brief regarding the timeliness of his amended petition and his claim insofar as it pertains to the transfer hearing.the state contends that neither of these arguments was certified for appeal.we have not previously ruled on the state motion to strike.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision to grant or deny a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.joseph coyle,cir.both the district court and this court are bound to apply the provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa in this case because pinchon filed his petition after aedpa effective date.see woodford garceau.under aedpa,a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus with respect to a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings only if the decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases or if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from that precedent.joseph,at brackets,citation,and internal quotation marks omitted.on the other hand,a decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case,williams taylor,or if it either unreasonably extends or unreasonably refuses to extend a legal principle from supreme court precedent to a new context,joseph,at citation omitted.
aedpa deferential standard of review,however,applies only to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in s tate court proceedings.nields bradshaw,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.we must therefore apply the de novo standard of review to claims properly before us where no ruling was made on the merits by the tennessee state courts.see id.at.
scope of the coa 
as a preliminary matter,we must clarify what issues are properly before us.the state contends that pinchon can not pursue his claim or his arguments regarding the timeliness of his amended petition because neither the district court nor this court granted a coa as to those issues.according to the state,we thus lack jurisdiction over those issues in the absence of a coa specifically referencing them.
in response to the state argument,pinchon contends that we should consider his claim as it relates to his transfer hearing because neither the district court order nor this court december,order clarify the scope of the coa.this assertion is only partially accurate.the district court order granting a coa on two issues makes clear that pinchon claim relates only to his attorney performance at trial.
we first observe that our resolution of pinchon motion to expand the coa will not affect the outcome of his appeal.as discussed below in part,pinchon amended petition,in which he first raised his in claim,was untimely in the district court.this means that even if we were to grant pinchon motion to expand the coa to include the claim,pinchon would still not be entitled to any relief.his motion is therefore moot,which also moots the state motion to strike insofar as it is related to the claim.
we now turn to the state motion to strike as it pertains to pinchon arguments about the timeliness of his amended petition.although it is a statutory requirement that a coa reference the specific issue to be addressed on its face,a procedural issue that possibly bars addressing an underlying constitutional claim is an appropriate matter to be addressed under a coa.lordi ishee,cir citation omitted addressing a issue where the district court granted a coa only as to the merits of a petitioner claim see also wright sec y for the dep t of,cir unless we review a district court threshold ruling that a claim is procedurally barred from consideration,it would be a waste of our time to consider the merits of the claim.
the district court in the instant case granted a coa on the substance of pinchon claim,but denied a coa as to the timeliness issue on the basis that pinchon did not present proof to support his equitable tolling contentions.but before we can reach the merits of the claim,we must first address the timeliness of pinchon amended petition.pinchon timeliness arguments therefore constitute an appropriate matter to be addressed under the coa.
in sum,we decline to expand the coa to include pinchon claim on the basis of the analysis below.on the other hand,we deny the state motion to strike pinchon arguments regarding the timeliness of his amended petition because the resolution of this issue is an inherent part of the analysis of his remaining claim.
the district court granted summary judgment to the state on pinchon claim,concluding that pinchon had failed to file his amended petition containing this claim within the statute of limitations for filing federal habeas petitions,and in any event,the claim was procedurally defaulted.pinchon now appeals both of these determinations.
timeliness of pinchon amended petition in federal court 
under aedpa,a petitioner has one year from the time that his or her judgment becomes final on direct appeal to file a petition for habeas corpus in federal court.d a.this statute of limitations begins to run from the latest of four circumstances,one of which is the date on which the judgment became final by conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.sherwood prelesnik,cir quoting d a.but t he time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending does not count against a petitioner when calculating the filing deadline under d a.d.
the tennessee supreme court denied review of pinchon conviction on december.pinchon conviction therefore became final on march,the first day following the expiration of the period during which he was eligible to petition the supreme court for certiorari.see lawrence florida,recognizing that direct review under d a includes review by the supreme court fed.a c.he filed his initial habeas petition in the district court on march,well before the aedpa deadline expired.pinchon original habeas petition was therefore timely.
but pinchon original habeas petition contained only his and claims.he did not raise his claims until he filed an amended petition on march,well after the statute of limitations had run.a portion of this nearly gap is excused because of pinchon postconviction proceedings.on december,pinchon initiated postconviction proceedings in state court,which tolled the aedpa statute of limitations until may,at which time the tennessee supreme court denied him relief.see id.at t he filing of a petition for certiorari before the supreme court does not toll the statute of limitations under d.allen bell,app x,cir applying lawrence retroactively where,as here,the petitioner did not argue any reliance on this court precedent that tolled the period for seeking certiorari to the supreme court following state postconviction review.
assuming that pinchon state petition was properly filed under d,it tolled the habeas statute of limitations for the approximately years while it was pending.but this tolling does not help pinchon because he waited almost an additional ten more months before filing his amended habeas petition in the district court.these ten months,plus the months between the date on which pinchon conviction became final and his filing for state postconviction relief,combine to render pinchon amended habeas petition untimely.
in an effort to overcome this late filing,pinchon raises two arguments.he first contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.because t his statute of limitations is not jurisdictional,a petitioner who misses the deadline may still maintain a viable habeas action if the court decides that equitable tolling is appropriate.allen yukins,cir.in a case like the present one,where the facts are undisputed and the district court decides as a matter of law that equitable tolling does not apply,this court reviews the district court decision de novo.id.at.
we consider five factors in determining whether equitable tolling should apply 
the petitioner lack of notice of the filing requirement the petitioner lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirement diligence in pursuing one rights absence of prejudice to the respondent and the petitioner reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the legal requirement for filing his claim.
id.citation omitted.the absence of any prejudice to the opposing party is a factor to be considered only after a factor that might justify tolling is identified.id.at citation omitted.
in assessing the timeliness of pinchon amended petition,the district court determined that pinchon mental retardation did not excuse his late filing.the district court relied on the state courts determination that pinchon mild mental retardation did not render him unable to manage his court filings or participate in the proceedings in concluding that his mental condition similarly did not hinder him in federal court.it further noted that pinchon obtained counsel several years before filing his amended complaint.
pinchon does not challenge the district court analysis in this regard and,in arguing for equitable tolling,he makes only the general allegation that the state would not be prejudiced by any tolling.but we can not consider the absence of prejudice to the state until pinchon identifies a factor that would support equitable tolling.see id.because pinchon fails to identify such a factor,we affirm the district court ruling.
in addition to his argument,pinchon maintains that his claims contained in the amended petition are timely because they relate back to the claims in his original petition under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.although pinchon characterizes the theory as a justification for equitable tolling,these are actually two separate theories.see,watkins lujan,cir t he issue of equitable tolling is distinct from the theory under.c.the district court rejected pinchon argument,holding that his claims did not relate back because they were not tied to the same common core of operative facts as the claims,as required by mayle felix.
in mayle,the supreme court resolved a circuit split regarding how broadly to interpret the provision contained in the former rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure rule c as of december,in the context of habeas proceedings.the court adopted a narrow reading of the rule,concluding that an amended habeas petition does not relate back where it asserts a new ground for relief supported by facts that differ from those in the original petition.id.at.instead,the claims in the original and amended petitions must be tied to a common core of operative facts.id.at.pinchon contends on appeal that because mayle was decided in june three months after he filed his amended district court erred by applying that case standard to his filing.
this court has not specifically held that the mayle standard applies to cases,but on two occasions it has applied the mayle standard in dismissing,as,amended petitions filed before that case was decided.see evans united
