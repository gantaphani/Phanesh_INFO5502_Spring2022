petitioner william wickline,an ohio death row inmate,appeals the denial of his rule e motion to alter or amend the district court judgment dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
wickline was convicted by a court of two counts of aggravated murder,for the deaths of christopher and peggy lerch.the panel sentenced wickline to life imprisonment on one count and to death on the other.after unsuccessful direct appeals and state proceedings,wickline filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.finding that wickline claims were either procedurally defaulted or lacked sufficient merit to warrant granting the writ,the district court dismissed his petition.both wickline and respondent the state filed motions to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to.e.the district court granted the state motion and amended the judgment to hold that the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,is applicable to wickline petition.wickline rule e motion was denied.
ii.standard of review 
in a habeas proceeding,this court reviews a district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.lucas,cir.because wickline filed his habeas petition on may,after the effective date of aedpa,this court reviews the petition under the standards set forth in aedpa.see lindh murphy,d williams coyle,cir a federal habeas corpus case is filed or pending for the purposes of lindh and the aedpa only when the petition for the writ is filed.as amended,d provides as follows 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the threshold question under aedpa is whether the petitioner seeks to apply a rule of law that was clearly established at the time his conviction became final.williams taylor,d.the phrase clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court.id.at.
procedural default 
the district court concluded that many of wickline claims are procedurally defaulted for failure to raise them at the earliest opportunity.when a petitioner defaults on his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule,federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman thompson,d.
in maupin smith,cir,this court set forth a analysis for determining whether a petitioner federal constitutional claims are barred by the petitioner failure to follow a state procedural rule whether a state court rested its holding on procedural default so as to bar federal habeas review is a question of law,reviewed de novo.combs coyle,cir.this court looks to the last explained judgment when answering that question.id.
iii.discussion 
ineffective assistance of counsel 
while wickline asserts a number of grounds for relief in his petition,the parties focused primarily on one issue at oral ineffective assistance of trial counsel.we will therefore address that issue first.wickline claims that his trial counsel was ineffective in several areas,most notably in the alleged failure to investigate or present mitigating evidence.under strickland washington,d,a violation of the right to effective assistance of counsel has two components 
first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.
id.at.review of counsel performance is highly deferential and requires that courts indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.id.at.to demonstrate that counsel performance was deficient,a defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.to establish prejudice,he must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.there is no question that strickland qualifies as clearly established federal law under aedpa.williams taylor,at.
wickline argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence at the penalty phase.according to wickline,his counsel should have investigated his mental health history and presented expert testimony on his psychological condition.wickline also asserts that counsel should have investigated and presented evidence of his history,character,and background as mitigating evidence.the ohio supreme court rejected wickline argument,noting that,unlike most cases,the record contained a statement of counsel strategy,which led the court to conclude that the manner in which appellant was represented at the mitigation phase was the result of an informed and tactical strategy.state wickline,ohio.the court did not find that the sentencing decision would have differed,even assuming counsel performance was deficient.
under the ohio death penalty scheme,
a capital defendant found guilty of a death specification has to present some mitigating evidence in order to avoid the death penalty.if a jury has nothing to weigh against the aggravating circumstance,it almost certainly must find that the aggravating circumstance outweighs the nonexistent mitigating circumstances,and recommend death.
mapes coyle,cir emphasis in original.w hen a client faces the prospect of being put to death unless counsel obtains and presents something in mitigation,minimal standards require some investigation.id.emphasis in original.consequently,this court has held that failure to investigate possible mitigating factors and failure to present mitigating evidence at sentencing can constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.see coleman mitchell coleman ii,cir,cert.denied,d skaggs parker,cir,cert.denied,d carter bell,cir.
after being convicted and sentenced to death,wickline moved for a new trial based in part on his counsel failure to investigate mental health evidence.at a hearing before the original panel,dan hunt,one of wickline trial attorneys,testified regarding his strategy at the penalty phase.before trial,counsel hired a private investigator who had been a homicide detective with the columbus police department for twenty years.according to hunt,this investigator interviewed just about everybody.wickline trial counsel personally interviewed key witnesses,including wickline brother and his common law wife.hunt,john wolery,who had represented wickline for many years,knew wickline friends and talked with his father.although counsel did not perform a separate mitigation investigation,counsel testified that their pretrial investigation was conducted for both guilt phase and mitigation phase purposes,and that he could not separate the two.
after the panel returned a guilty verdict,wickline counsel turned to the mitigation statute and the section of the ohio public defender manual dealing with the mitigation hearing.counsel went through each mitigating factor with wickline.counsel advised wickline that he could have a psychiatric report,but counsel chose not to have one for two reasons.first,wickline wanted nothing to do with psychiatrists or psychologists.second,counsel felt that a psychiatric report would reflect negatively on wickline.counsel also advised wickline that a presentence report delving into his background could be prepared.again,wickline wanted nothing to do with the probation officer.counsel requested to speak with wickline family.according to hunt,wickline was very strong on this,he did not want to drag his family into this thing,and basically told us no as far as his family was involved.counsel was also concerned that if they put witnesses on the stand testifying to wickline good character,it would open the door for the prosecution to bring in evidence of bad acts committed by him and that such evidence would greatly damage any mitigating factors they presented.counsel reviewed wickline prison files but chose not to present them to avoid highlighting his numerous incarcerations.
after two or three meetings to discuss their strategy,wickline and his counsel decided to argue that christopher and peggy lerch facilitated the murders by attempting a drug.the panel had already rejected wickline primary no murders had taken place.counsel felt that it would be best to focus on their strongest mitigating factor,avoid the danger of opening the door to harmful information,and not cloud it up with stuff we could prove.hunt testified that wickline made the final decision to proceed as they did.
in strickland,the supreme court noted that t he reasonableness of counsel actions may be determined or substantially influenced by the defendant own statements or actions.counsel actions are usually based,quite properly,on informed strategic choices made by the defendant and on information supplied by the defendant.strickland,at.furthermore,a n attorney conduct is not deficient simply for following his client instructions.coleman mitchell coleman i,cir,cert.denied,d,and cert.denied,d.
here,wickline counsel investigated prior to trial,hiring a private investigator to interview persons with knowledge about the case and personally interviewing key witnesses.this investigation was performed for the purposes of both the guilt phase and the penalty phase.after the panel returned a guilty verdict,counsel discussed mitigation strategy with wickline two or three times.wickline did not want to speak with a psychiatrist or a probation officer or involve his family.consequently,wickline and his counsel reached the decision to focus on their strongest mitigating the lerches facilitated the murders by participating in drug dealing and attempting a drug.wickline made the final decision to proceed with this strategy.based on the record evidence of wickline strategic choices,counsel investigation and presentation of mitigating evidence did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.see coleman i,at holding that petitioner was not deprived of the right to effective assistance of counsel at sentencing where petitioner did not cooperate with counsel regarding the investigation and identification of mitigating evidence,imposed restrictions upon counsel,and refused to submit to further psychological or psychiatric testing.but see coleman ii,at finding that counsel performance,given the combination of petitioner uninvestigated personal history and the consequently deficient penalty phase closing argument,to be objectively unreasonable.
even if counsel were deficient in investigating and presenting mitigating evidence,wickline fails to satisfy the prejudice prong of strickland.wickline argues that his trial counsel could have presented mental health evidence.the mental health evidence submitted with his petition for relief indicates that wickline did not suffer from any mental condition relevant to the murders of the lerches.the records state that t here is no evidence of a thought disorder or psychotic reaction,that p sychological testing reveals that he is functioning in the superior range of general intelligence,and that he has an iq of.the mental health evidence indicates that wickline suffered from depression however,there is no evidence that his depression affected his conduct here.see state white,ohio,in contrast,defendant mild depression was undisputed,but it is unclear what role if any it played in these crimes.this is,at best,a weak mitigating factor.wickline also argues that his trial counsel should have introduced evidence of his good behavior during prior incarcerations.counsel reviewed wickline prison records and decided not to present them because they would highlight wickline extensive criminal history.
finally,wickline claims that his trial counsel erred in not presenting any evidence regarding his allegedly troubled upbringing.he vaguely states that his relationship with his father was crucial to his development and the way he handled frustration and rage.wickline also asserts that the death of his mother devastated him.the state contends that wickline family experiences do not provide a justification or explanation for this crime.see state dickerson,ohio,while these experiences are unfortunate,they are not uncommon.it takes no citation of authority to state that many other people have endured similar experiences without resort to lawlessness.
wickline has failed to demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that,but for his trial counsel failure to present this evidence,the result of the penalty phase would have been different.therefore,his claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence fails strickland prejudice prong.the ohio supreme court determination that wickline counsel was not deficient at the penalty phase and that even if it were,the sentencing decision would not have been different is not contrary to or an unreasonable application of strickland.accordingly,wickline is not entitled to any relief on this ground 
b.other arguments 
wickline allegations that his trial counsel was ineffective in other areas are likewise without merit.he contends that his counsel was unable to prepare for trial or to properly advise him on the issue of jury waiver due to the state discovery violations.the ohio supreme court rejected this argument,finding that wickline was not prejudiced by the alleged discovery violations,and,therefore,he was not prejudiced by any ineffectiveness of counsel resulting from those alleged discovery violations.this implied conclusion was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of strickland wickline also asserts that there were many deficiencies in the trial phase caused by his counsel allegedly substandard performance.this assertion is without merit,in that the record demonstrates that trial counsel did not concede the element of prior calculation and design wickline has failed to present any evidence to overcome the presumption that the panel ignored any improper evidence counsel failed to redact from his brady motion and wickline has not shown that his counsel conduct fell below a standard of objective reasonableness regarding his decision to call jay mccarty as a witness.wickline argument that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request a change of venue is procedurally defaulted even if it were not,however,this claim fails because wickline was tried by a panel,rather than a jury,and he has failed to present any evidence that the panel was prejudiced by pretrial publicity.likewise,the argument that wickline was denied effective assistance of counsel in the failure to obtain expert and investigative assistance for the trial phase is also procedurally defaulted,because he never presented the claim on direct appeal,raising it for the first time in his state proceedings.even if this claim was not procedurally defaulted,the ohio court of appeals alternative ruling,that the claim fails on the merits,is not contrary to or an unreasonable application of the prejudice prong of strickland.
wickline further asserts that he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel iaac.his claims in this regard are procedurally defaulted due to his failure to comply with the rule set forth in state murnaha
