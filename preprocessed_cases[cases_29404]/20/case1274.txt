burl cain,the warden of the louisiana state penitentiary the warden,appeals the district court grant of a writ of habeas corpus to brandon haynes pursuant to on his sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claim.a panel of this court,analyzing haynes habeas petition under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,affirmed the district court ruling.the panel majority held that haynes counsels decision to concede guilt on the offense of second degree murder in a capital murder case amounted to a constructive denial of counsel under united states cronic,d.we granted rehearing en banc,thereby vacating the panel opinion.see fifth cir.
subsequently,the supreme court clarified the scope of the second cronic exception to strickland in bell cone,d.in bell,the court reaffirmed that cronic applies in those cases in which defense counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing.bell,at.at quoting cronic,at.more importantly,it clarified that an attorney failure must be complete,noting that the difference between the situations addressed by strickland and cronic is not of degree but of kind.id.we now must determine whether the louisiana state court application of strickland washington,d in this case was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.in order to do so,we must decide whether haynes attorneys decision to partially concede guilt resulted in a constructive denial of counsel under cronic,or whether it was a valid trial strategy,which we review under the usual test for constitutionally adequate assistance of counsel articulated by the supreme court in strickland.
in october of,haynes was employed on a construction project at the louisiana state university biomedical center in shreveport,louisiana.around midnight on october,haynes entered the lsu medical center,which was located next to the construction site.while walking through the medical center,haynes encountered a female graduate student,fang yang,who was conducting research in one of the medical center laboratories.haynes forcibly took yang to the roof of the building where he proceeded to rape and rob her.at some point during the rape and robbery,yang either fell or was thrown off the roof of the building.construction workers discovered her body the following morning.an autopsy revealed that yang had died as a result of injuries from the fall.the autopsy also found several cuts on yang body,which the medical examiner believed were compliance or torture wounds,as well as semen residue in yang vagina and rectum.
police subsequently identified haynes as a suspect based on video surveillance tapes showing haynes on the upper floors of the medical center turning off other surveillance cameras on the night of the attack,as well as an eyewitness who confirmed that haynes was in fact in the building on the night yang was killed.haynes was arrested and indicted for first degree murder.
the evidence establishing haynes involvement in the abduction and killing of yang was substantial.in addition to the video surveillance tapes and an eyewitness placing haynes in the medical center on the night of the crime,police found human blood in haynes car and on his pants.they also recovered yang wallet,which haynes had hidden in the wall of his home.moreover,dna analysis established that it was haynes semen that was found in the victim.
at trial,the prosecution theorized that haynes had intentionally killed yang during the course of her rape and armed robbery haynes two attorneys strategy aimed solely at avoiding a first degree murder conviction and with it the possibility of the death penalty.defense counsel conceded that the evidence established that haynes kidnaped,raped,and robbed yang,but argued that it did not establish that haynes intentionally killed her.thus,according to defense counsel,haynes only could be convicted for second degree murder 
pursuant to this strategy,haynes counsel,during his opening statement,began by telling the jury that he would be up front with them.he conceded that haynes kidnaped,raped,and robbed yang and that the victim perished shortly after these offenses occurred.he then contrasted the overwhelming evidence establishing these facts with the paucity of evidence regarding haynes specific intent to kill yang.
following the defense opening statement,haynes addressed the court outside the presence of the jury.haynes objected to his attorneys concessions and stated that he was innocent.haynes further stated that he specifically requested that his attorneys not make any concessions regarding his guilt for the commission of the offense.haynes also asked the court to appoint new attorneys.the state trial court denied his request,assuring him that he had excellent lawyers and could testify if he wished.
the jury found haynes guilty of first degree murder,but could not agree on an appropriate punishment.the trial court therefore sentenced haynes to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.see crim.the louisiana appellate and supreme courts subsequently upheld haynes conviction on direct appeal.
haynes then sought state relief,alleging that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial because of his counsels unauthorized concessions of partial guilt.the louisiana court of appeal,applying strickland,denied relief upon finding that defense counsels partial concessions were part of a valid trial strategy which succeeded in avoiding the death penalty.see state haynes,so d,
haynes then filed a federal habeas petition,renewing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the district court granted haynes habeas petition,concluding that the state court had applied the incorrect legal standard in evaluating haynes claim.specifically,the district court held that haynes attorneys partial concession of guilt without haynes consent constituted a constructive denial of counsel.relying on cronic,the court held that haynes was not required to show that his attorneys concessions actually prejudiced him,as required by strickland.in reaching its decision,the district court did not discuss or apply aedpa deferential scheme.the panel majority affirmed the district court decision.
the warden maintains that the district court and the panel majority erred in granting federal habeas relief because the state habeas court decision was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.in response,haynes asserts that the state habeas court decision was contrary to clearly established federal law because the state court applied the wrong legal standard.specifically,haynes maintains that the state court should have evaluated his ineffective assistance of counsel claim under cronicinstead of strickland.thus,according to haynes,the district court properly granted habeas relief.
because haynes filed his habeas petition on july,our review is governed by aedpa.see lindh murphy,d.under aedpa,we must defer to the state habeas court unless its decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d because the district court failed to conduct its review under aedpa,instead applying the supreme court precedent de novo,it violated aedpa dictate that federal district courts should defer to state habeas court decisions unless their adjudication is either contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established supreme court precedent williams taylor,d.the contrary to and the unreasonable application clauses in d have independent meaning.id.a federal habeas court may issue a writ under the contrary to clause if the state court applies a rule different from the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases,or if it decides a case differently than the supreme court ha s done on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.bell.at.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant a habeas writ if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case.id.
the supreme court in bell analyzed a similar case under aedpa contrary to clause in which the petitioner argued that cronic applied because defense counsel entirely failed to submit the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing.id.ordinarily,to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,a habeas petitioner must satisfy strickland familiar test.strickland,at.first,a defendant must demonstrate that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,with reasonableness being judged under professional norms prevailing at the time counsel rendered assistance.andrews collins,cir quoting strickland,at.when assessing whether an attorney performance was deficient,the court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.strickland,at.second,if counsel was deficient,t he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.
the supreme court decision in cronic created a very limited exception to the application of strickland test in situations that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in the particular case is unjustified.cronic,at.the supreme court has identified three situations implicating the right to counsel where the court will presume that the petitioner has been prejudiced.bell,at,d,at.first are situations in which a petitioner is denied counsel at a critical stage of a criminal proceeding.bell.at quoting cronic,at.second,and most relevant here,are situations in which a petitioner is represented by counsel at trial,but his or her counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing.id.finally,prejudice is presumed when the circumstances surrounding a trial prevent a petitioner attorney from rendering effective assistance of counsel.id.citing powell alabama.
haynes argues that the second exception applies in this instance and therefore he is relieved from establishing prejudice.specifically,he contends that his counsel failed to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing on the individual elements constituting the offense of second degree murder.in bell,the supreme court clarified when an attorney failure to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing results in a constructive denial of counsel.the court,reiterating language in cronic,stated that an attorney must entirely fail to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing for the presumption of prejudice to apply.bell.at quoting cronic,at.emphasis in original.in other words,an attorney must completely fail to challenge the prosecution case,not just individual elements of it.id.critically for purposes of this appeal,the court further noted that when applying strickland or cronic,the distinction between counsel failure to oppose the prosecution entirely and the failure of counsel to do so at specific points during the trial is a difference not of degree but of kind.id.under this rationale,when counsel fails to oppose the prosecution case at specific points or concedes certain elements of a case to focus on others,he has made a tactical decision.id.at.by making such choices,defense counsel has not abandoned his or her client by entirely failing to challenge the prosecution case.such strategic decisions do not result in an abandonment of counsel,as when an attorney completely fails to challenge the prosecution case.under the court reasoning,then,cronic is reserved only for those extreme cases in which counsel fails to present any defense.we presume prejudice in such cases because it is as if the defendant had no representation at all.in contrast,strategic or tactical decisions are evaluated under strickland traditional test for deficiency and prejudice.
previous circuit court decisions have elaborated on this distinction between ineffective assistance of counsel and the constructive denial of counsel.collectively,these decisions reinforce the notion that defense counsel must entirely fail to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing for the cronic exception to apply.gochicoa johnson,cir holding that w hen the defendant receives at least some meaningful assistance,he must prove prejudice in order to obtain relief for ineffective assistance of counsel quoting goodwin johnson,cir.thus,when analyzing an attorney decision regarding concession of guilt at trial,courts have found a constructive denial of counsel only in those instances where a defendant attorney concedes the only factual issues in dispute.see united states swanson,cir holding that a lawyer who informs the jury that it is his view of the evidence that there is no reasonable doubt regarding the only factual issues that are in dispute has utterly failed to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing.in contrast,those courts that have confronted situations in which defense counsel concedes the defendant guilt for only offenses have consistently found these partial concessions to be tactical decisions,and not a denial of the right to counsel as such,they have analyzed them under the strickland test.
in the instant case,haynes defense counsel did not entirely fail to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing.rather,haynes attorneys acknowledged that the prosecution evidence establishing that haynes raped and robbed yang was overwhelming.after making this specific concession,however,haynes attorneys remained active at trial,probing weaknesses in the prosecution case on the issue of intent.they state witnesses to emphasize that yang wore thick glasses which were never located and that the victim landed face down when she fell,supporting their theory that she may have accidentally fallen when trying to flee from haynes.they also elicited testimony that yang pants were only slightly pulled down in an attempt to show that she could have run off the roof under her own power.defense counsel hoped that this strategy would the graphic nature of the crime and would focus the jury attention on the one area where the prosecution case was not exceedingly strong.
in sum,this is not a situation in which haynes attorneys abandoned their client.instead,they continued to represent him throughout the course of the trial,adopting a strategy which in their judgment accorded haynes the best opportunity for a favorable outcome.ultimately,their strategy proved effective in avoiding the death penalty for their client.as the supreme court indicated in bell,when defense counsel pursue a strategy,even if it involves conceding certain elements or remaining inactive at specific points during the trial,we will examine the effectiveness of their performance and the propriety of their decisions under strickland.bell.at.thus,we hold that the louisiana state court properly identified strickland as the correct governing legal principle under which to evaluate haynes ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the state court adjudication of haynes habeas petition,therefore,was not contrary to clearly established federal law.
having concluded that the state habeas court evaluated haynes claim under the correct legal standard,the sole remaining issue is whether the state court adjudication of haynes claim under strickland involved an unreasonable application of that standard to the facts of this case.because we are reviewing this case under aedpa deferential scheme,haynes must do more than merely show that the state habeas court incorrectly applied strickland to this case.rather,he must demonstrate that the louisiana court of appeal applied strickland in an objectively unreasonable manner.see d williams,at.
haynes counsel faced the demanding task of defending a client who was accused of committing a brutal and senseless crime.the prosecution had nearly conclusive proof that haynes raped,robbed,and then murdered yang.the prosecution had videotape of the defendant and eyewitness testimony both placing haynes at the crime scene.dna test results established that his semen was found in the victim.the police found a knife,which could have caused the cuts found on the victim,in haynes car.the police also located yang wallet in haynes home.given the overwhelming evidence defense counsel faced,the louisiana court of appeal was not unreasonable in concluding that the strategy ultimately adopted by haynes attorneys likely succeeded in obtaining the best possible outcome under the circumstances.
nevertheless,it is plausible that the failure of haynes attorneys to obtain his consent might constitute deficient performance under strickland.even assuming,however,that haynes has established deficient performance,he has failed to show prejudice.for haynes to establish prejudice,he must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.based on the prosecution nearly conclusive evidence that haynes committed the offense in question,the louisiana court of appeal properly concluded that haynes had failed to establish that without the concession strategy,he would have been acquitted of first degree murder.consequently,haynes can not show that the state habeas court conclusion that he was not prejudiced by his attorneys strategy was objectively unreasonable.
we hold that the state court decision applying strickland to haynes ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not contrary to the governing law set forth by the supreme court for ineffective assistance of counsel cases.moreover,we hold that the state court did not unreasonably apply strickland to the facts of this case.based on the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court grant of a writ of habeas corpus to haynes.
in my judgment,the majority correctly concludes that haynes defense counsel did not entirely fail to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing.united states cronic,d.defense counsel,in my opinion,subjected the prosecution first degree murder case to meaningful adversarial testing by attempting to establish a defense of lack of intent through and examination of witnesses and argument.thus,the adversarial process protected by the sixth amendment,as described in cronic,was preserved.the accused had counsel acting in the role of an advocate.cronic,at.citation and footnote omitted.defense counsel require d the prosecution case to survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing,on the question of first or second degree murder and,more important,caused it to fail that testing on the question of a life or a death sentence.the constitutional guarantee was not violated here,because the process did not lose its character as a confrontation between adversaries.id.at.
i disagree,however,with the majority perhaps unintentional implication that cronic second situation of presumptive ineffectiveness applies only where the defense attorney completely fails to challenge the prosecution case,that is,only when the attorney has totally abandoned his client,as if the defendant had no representation at all.op.at.i believe the second cronic exception applies,and prejudice is presumed,even when counsel makes some effort at a defense,if counsel makes no meaningful attempt to challenge the prosecution case.for example,if the defense counsel represents his client at trial but,for no good reason,fails to the only prosecution witness linking the defendant with the crime,he fails entirely to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing in my opinion,the broad and loose language in bell cone,d,was not intended to alter the meaning of cronic second situation.in cone the court dealt with defense counsel failure to affirmatively defend by not adducing sufficient available mitigating evidence this was not a per se dereliction such as failure to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing.moreover,we should keep in mind that the discussions of the per se prejudicial situations in both cronic and cone constituted dicta in those cases and were not intended as holdings or rigid rules absolutely governing future unforeseen cases.
on the other hand,i disagree with my dissenting colleagues,because i do not think that the defendant sixth amendment claim of denial of the right of has been timely or properly raised.the right to announced in faretta california,d,is subject to several limitations.as the faretta opinion recognized,the right to is not absolute.the defendant must voluntarily and intelligently elect to conduct his own defense,and most courts require him to do so in a timely manner.martinez court of appeal of california,d citations omitted.after objecting to his defense counsel strategy at the early stage of the trial,haynes did not assert his right to or clearly call for the discharge of his attorneys.consequently,the trial judge did not inquire into the voluntariness or intelligence of such a nonexistent claim.subsequently,haynes continued to allow the defense counsel to represent him,and he elected not to testify at trial or to further protest the trial strategy pursued.under these circumstances,haynes either waived his claim or failed to properly raise and preserve it for our review.in either case,a reversal of his conviction on the theory that he has suffered a violation of his sixth amendment right to is unwarranted based on the record designated for our review.
the fundamental issue in this case is whether the sixth amendment and due process clause of the fourteenth amendment give a defendant the right to require his appointed counsel to contest every charged crime when the defendant informs the judge and his appointed counsel that he is innocent and wants an actual innocence defense faretta california,d and brookhart janis,d demonstrate that the accused himself,not his appointed lawyer,has the authority to decide whether his lawyer should concede guilt to a lesser charge.because these two cases are clearly established law,the state court application of the strickland test misidentifies the correct governing legal principle,and is therefore contrary to clearly established federal law.i would therefore affirm the grant of the habeas writ.
initial observations 
my analysis of the trial court proceedings indicates the following.first,the evidence of haynes guilt is overwhelming.second,haynes trial counsel were and provided him with a professional defense.third,trial counsel decision to concede guilt on the lesser charge of second degree murder in the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt as to that charge was a successful approach to take in that it spared haynes the death penalty.fourth,the outcome of the case conviction for first degree murder with a life sentence without possibility of parole was a reliable one based on the overwhelming evidence of the defendant guilt.
for these reasons,trial counsel performance was not deficient under strickland first prong and haynes was certainly not prejudiced by the trial counsel approach under strickland second prong.on the contrary,trial counsel tactic was probably in haynes best interest.thus,applying strictly a strickland analysis,haynes would not be entitled to habeas relief however,in my view,strickland does not provide the appropriate framework for analyzing this case.
ii.the majority error 
the majority opinion rests on the incorrect assumption that defendant sixth amendment claim is controlled by strickland.it is not.this case raises a much broader concern that goes to the very core of what the sixth amendment means and asks us to address important questions involving due process and the right to a fair trial.
it is undisputed that haynes defense counsel conceded haynes guilt as to the second degree murder charge during opening statements.subsequently,haynes informed the trial judge that he wanted to address the court.the judge then sent the jurors out,and haynes counsel stated that anything haynes said was against the advice of counsel.haynes then unequivocally asserted 
i do agree with what these lawyers are doing,talking abou
