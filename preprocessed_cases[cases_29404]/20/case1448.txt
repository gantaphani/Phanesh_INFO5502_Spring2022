on friday evening,september,at approximately,anthony klann victim and paul stoney lewis visited a cleveland area bar called the saloon.at that time,lewis encountered thomas mike keenan,a former employer of his,whereupon the two engaged in a conversation,left the bar in keenan truck,and went to another bar nearby called coconut joe.shortly thereafter,klann,edward espinoza and,joe,arrived at coconut joe.

mimsel dandec and her boyfriend,adam flanik,lived in the same apartment building as lewis.at approximately on the date in question,dandec and flanik were awakened by what they described as screaming,shouting and banging outside.dandec testified that she heard someone yell,i want my dope or my coke.flanik went to investigate and found keenan pounding on another apartment door in search of lewis.after flanik directed keenan to lewis door,keenan and espinoza kicked it in while they repeatedly declared that they were going to kill lewis.lewis was not in his apartment at that time,so keenan and espinoza got back in the truck and drove off.
meanwhile,defendant had stayed in the truck with the victim during the incident at lewis apartment building.flanik testified that defendant had a large knife poised within inches of the victim face.flanik also testified that the victim looked like he had been crying,and like he had been roughed up a little bit.

bagley,wl,at,paragraph breaks added.in july of,the district court held a evidentiary hearing,which focused on brady claim.
on march,the district court granted petition for a writ of habeas corpus the court held that most of the evidence that introduced to support his brady claim was suppressed by the prosecution and favorable to the defense the court further held that most of this suppressed evidence was material and that was able to demonstrate cause and prejudice to overcome his failure to raise the brady claim in state court.the district court,however,rejected other grounds for relief.
the district court granted a certificate of appealability on the following issues upon which the court ruled against whether is actually innocent,whether knowingly waived his right to a jury trial,whether counsel for was constitutionally ineffective for failing to ask for the recusal of one of the trial judges,and whether was denied due process because the prosecution failed to preserve certain evidence that argues may have exculpated him.
the warden appeals the district court decision on the ground that failed to exhaust his brady claim in state court.the warden did not raise exhaustion before the district court,and the district court,although noting that the state failure to raise exhaustion does not invariably waive the defense,refused to engage in a sua sponte analysis,wl,at.specifically,with respect to the brady claim,the district court noted that because a motion for relief would be untimely,that because throughout this rather lengthy habeas proceeding,the warden has never asserted an exhaustion defense,and that because the state was responsible for suppressing brady evidence,the state can not now assert failure to exhaust this claim as a bar to this court review of it.id.at.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa states that a federal court can not grant a writ of habeas corpus to a prisoner held in state custody unless a the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state or b i there is an absence of available state corrective process or ii circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.b.under aedpa,the state shall not be deemed to have waived the exhaustion requirement or be estopped from reliance upon the requirement unless the state,through counsel,expressly waives the requirement.b.in this case,it is undisputed that the warden was aware of,but never argued to the district court,failure to exhaust his state remedies.
never presented his brady claim to a state court.offers three arguments for why this court should nonetheless address the merits of the claim the warden expressly waived the exhaustion requirement there is no state process through which could obtain relief and t he interests of comity,federalism,and justice are not served by requiring to return to state court.
we conclude that the warden expressly waived the exhaustion requirement,and we need not address alternative arguments.aedpa does not explain how a state expressly waives the exhaustion requirement,but says only that the state can not be deemed to have waived the requirement unless it expressly waived the requirement.waiver is traditionally defined as an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.see,united states olano,d quoting johnson zerbst.courts also generally agree that express is synonymous with clear or unambiguous.for example,in the context of statutory waivers of sovereign immunity,courts alternatively define an express waiver as a clearcut waiver,a specific waiver,an explicit waiver,an unequivocal waiver,a plain waiver,a manifest waiver,an affirmative waiver,an unambiguous waiver,or a waiver described by a combination of these adjectives.shaw library of congress,similarly,in determining whether congress has permitted state regulation that otherwise would violate the negative implications of the commerce clause,this court noted that,
while the supreme court has generally required an express statement of congressional policy to allow otherwise impermissible regulation of interstate commerce,t here is no talismanic significance to the phrase expressly stated,however it merely states one way of meeting the requirement that for a state regulation to be removed from the reach of the dormant commerce clause,congressional intent must be unmistakably clear.
acquisition tyson,cir quoting timber,wunnicke,d emphasis added.see also kelly lee old fashioned hamburgers,cir en banc holding that the requirement in federal rule of civil procedure b that the district court make an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and an express direction for the entry of judgment in order to direct the entry of a final judgment to fewer than all of the parties in a case is met where the record reflects the district court unmistakable intent to enter a partial final judgment emphasis added.
the warden expressly waived the exhaustion requirement because her counsel conduct during the district court proceedings manifested a clear and unambiguous intent to waive the requirement.in response to motion to amend his habeas petition in order to add the brady claim,the warden stated that she took no position on the motion,but requested the opportunity to file a response if the district court granted the motion to amend.on october,the warden filed a motion to expand the record to include evidence that the warden argued undermined brady claim.on november,the district court granted both motions.importantly,with respect to motion to amend his habeas petition,the district court stated that its understanding was that the warden would not argue that the brady claim was unexhausted 
based on the motion briefs and conversations with counsel,the court finds this claim is exhausted,as petitioner is without an available remedy.thus,the court grants the instant motion without concern that respondent will subsequently move to dismiss the petition for failure to exhaust the amended claim.in so granting,however,the court reserves respondent right to assert that the claim is procedurally defaulted,if appropriate,in the supplemental return of writ.
furthermore,in her amended return of writ,the warden argued that petition contained procedurally defaulted claims because the claims were never presented in state court and if now were presented,would be found untimely by
