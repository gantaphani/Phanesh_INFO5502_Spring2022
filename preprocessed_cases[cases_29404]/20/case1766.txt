jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction to hear magana appeal from the district court denial of his petition for habeas corpus under.
ii.background 
magana was charged in september with three counts possession with intent to deliver more than but less than grams of cocaine conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver more than but less than grams of cocaine and possession with intent to deliver marijuana.either immediately before or the day of trial,magana attorney,rudolph wartella received an offer to plea bargain from the michigan state prosecutor.ginther hr g at.prior to that time,no plea offer was forthcoming from the prosecutor office.id.wartella conveyed to magana that the state offered to dismiss one cocaine count in exchange for magana guilty plea to the other one.wartella stated that it was his understanding that if magana pleaded to one cocaine count,he would receive a sentence.id.he also told magana that he would receive,at most,a sentence were he to be convicted at trial.id.at.because wartella did not believe that the plea bargain offered magana any benefit over going to trial,he advised magana to reject the plea offer.id.at.magana then rejected the plea.
following a jury trial,magana was convicted of the two cocaine charges and acquitted on the marijuana charge.joint appendix at.he was sentenced,pursuant to michigan comp.laws a iii,to two mandatorily consecutive terms of ten to twenty years imprisonment.that statute states that a person who possesses with intent to deliver more than but less than grams of a controlled substance is guilty of a felony and shall be imprisoned for not less than years nor more than years.a iii.according to,a term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to subsection a shall be imposed to run consecutively with any term of imprisonment imposed for the commission of another felony.emphasis added.
after his conviction and sentencing,magana filed a motion with the michigan court of appeals seeking an evidentiary hearing,known as a ginther hearing,and a new trial based on his assertion that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for advising him to reject the plea offer.the michigan court of appeals granted the motion for the ginther hearing and remanded to the trial court.people magana,order granting motion and remanding.
the trial court conducted the ginther hearing on may.at that hearing,wartella and magana each testified as to his understanding of the plea bargain and the potential sentences involved in accepting the plea offer versus going to trial.magana asserted that,had his trial counsel informed him that his sentences would run consecutively if he was convicted,he would have pleaded guilty.following the hearing,the trial court held that magana trial counsel was not constitutionally ineffective because magana could not prove that,but for his counsel faulty advice,he would have accepted the plea.people magana,macomb cty.cir.may.
magana then filed a motion for peremptory reversal in the michigan court of appeals,arguing that the trial court committed plain error by denying his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the michigan court of appeals denied the motion for failure to persuade the court of the existence of manifestly reversible error warranting peremptory relief without argument or formal submission.people magana,order denying motion.thereafter,magana appealed the trial court decision.the michigan court of appeals affirmed the trial court finding that magana had not suffered prejudice from his counsel failure properly to advise him of his potential sentence should he go to trial,and then remanded the case to the trial court for further findings on a claim of entrapment.people magana.april.following the trial court rejection of magana entrapment claim,the michigan court of appeals affirmed the trial court decision,people magana,and the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal,people magana.
having exhausted his state remedies,magana filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in federal district court pursuant to.the district court denied magana petition.according to the district court,p etitioner counsel testified at the ginther hearing that it was his understanding,and he informed petitioner accordingly,that each of the cocaine charges carried potential sentences of ten to twenty years and that those two sentences could not run consecutively.at.the district court also concluded that p etitioner testified that he was aware that each of the charges carried potential sentences of up to twenty years incarceration.at.because magana provided no credible evidence which shows that the state court conclusion was an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent,the district court denied magana petition for habeas relief.
magana then filed a motion in the district court seeking a certificate of appealability for his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the district court denied the certificate of appealability.thereafter,magana filed a notice of appeal with this court,which was construed as a motion for a certificate of appealability under.we granted a certificate of appealability on magana sole claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
iii.analysis 
standard of review 
when a district court decision to deny habeas corpus relief under is appealed to this court,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.palazzolo gorcyca,cir.
because magana petition for habeas corpus relief was filed in june,after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,which amended,aedpa governs our review of the state court decisions in this case.according to the amended version of,we may not grant a writ of habeas corpus with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the federal court must presume that all determinations of factual issues made by the state court are correct unless the defendant can rebut that presumption by clear and convincing evidence.see e.
the supreme court has clarified that the phrases contrary to and unreasonable application of in d have independent meaning.penry johnson,d.in order for a state court to render a decision contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent,the state court must appl y a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court cases,or confront a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrive at a different result.williams taylor,d,concurring.an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law may occur,in contrast,when the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.an unreasonable application of law is not,according to the supreme court,merely incorrect rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.
we must,therefore,determine whether the state court conclusion that magana was not deprived his right to effective assistance of counsel is contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
in order to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,a petitioner must show both that his counsel performance was constitutionally deficient such that he was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment,and that he was prejudiced by his counsel errors.strickland washington,d.to prove constitutionally deficient performance,petitioner must show that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.strickland,at.if he can meet this standard,then petitioner must establish prejudice by demonstrating that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.the supreme court standard for analyzing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,first articulated in strickland,was clearly established law as of the time magana brought his state court appeal.williams,at.
the strickland analysis also applies to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel involving counsel advice offered during the plea process.hill lockhart,d.according to the supreme court,a petitioner who asserts that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for encouraging him to plead guilty must prove both that his counsel performance was deficient and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel errors,he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.id.at.following lockhart,we have held that a petitioner who claims that his counsel was ineffective for encouraging him to reject a plea bargain and go to trial states a viable sixth amendment claim.turner tennessee,cir,vacated on other grounds,d,reinstated on other grounds,cir.such a petitioner must prove both deficient performance on the part of his counsel and that,but for his counsel advice,there is a reasonable probability that he would have pleaded guilty turner,at see also paters,at requiring defendant to show that there is a reasonable probability that he would have accepted the alleged proposed plea agreement absent defense counsel advice gordon,at applying reasonable probability standard to claim that defense counsel gross misadvice regarding potential sentencing exposure violated defendant sixth amendment rights united states day,cir noting that defendant who claims that his counsel gross underestimation of his sentence led him to reject state plea offer must meet the reasonable probability standard to prove prejudice.
state court decisions 
after the ginther hearing,the state trial court concluded that wartella had informed magana that,in exchange for magana guilty plea,the state would recommend a minimum sentence of years.appellee br.at.according to the trial court,wartella also believed any sentences defendant would receive following a trial would run concurrent not consecutive and did believe defendant would receive any benefit by pleading guilty.id.the court then found the following as to magana 
he confirmed counsel had apprised him of the plea offer.he was also aware the people had offered to dismiss two charges and recommend a sentence of years on the charge of delivery of cocaine.further,defendant testified he was aware the cocaine charges carried penalties of up to years incarceration.defendant stated he believed the offer was a good offer but he felt he could win at trial since he had some good issues 
id.the trial court then concluded 
defendant knowingly rejected the plea offer.he was aware it was a good offer in light of the potential penalties he was facing.however,he believed he would not be convicted or,at the least,he would be convicted of a lesser offense receive lesser sentences.even assuming defendant believed he would receive concurrent sentences for his convictions,by defendant own testimony he knew that,if convicted,he could receive sentences of up to years.it is clear from defendant testimony that he chose to take a chance by going to trial.
id.at.based on these determinations,the trial court concluded,as a matter of law,that magana counsel was not ineffective.the trial court stated that defendant would not have accepted the plea offer so that he was not prejudiced by counsel representation.therefore,defendant is not entitled to relief id.
on appeal,the michigan court of appeals stated that,under relevant michigan law,if the defendant can prove that he would have accepted the plea offer,then the defendant was prejudiced and he would be entitled to relief.if,however,the trial court determined that the defendant would not have accepted the offer,then the defendant was not prejudiced and is not entitled to relief on his ineffective assistance claim.people magana,at.april.the court of appeals then deferred to the trial court finding.the court of appeals stated w e conclude that the trial court finding that defendant would not have accepted the plea offer is supported by the record.defendant testified that he felt that he could win at trial or that he would be convicted of a lesser offense.he also testified that he was aware that the maximum sentence he could get would be twenty years imprisonment.id.because it concluded that the trial court finding that magana would not have accepted the plea was not clearly erroneous,the michigan court of appeals held that magana was not prejudiced and was not,therefore,entitled to relief.see id.
both the state trial court and michigan court of appeals concluded that,even if trial counsel performance was constitutionally deficient,magana could not prove prejudice because he did not establish that,but for his trial counsel erroneous advice,he would have accepted the plea.because the state courts did not discuss the question of deficient performance,we will assume that they concluded that wartella performance was objectively deficient under strickland.indeed,it would be hard to imagine how wartella advice during the plea negotiation process could have been more inadequate.at the ginther hearing,he testified as to his understanding of the state plea offer as follows m y understanding of the plea agreement was,if he pled on the nose,he get ten years,and that the information that i am imparting to magana.ginther hr g tr.at.he then stated that he advised magana,either immediately before or on the day of trial,that he had nothing to lose,since they were going to do anything.they were going to offer him anything,so he might just as well go to trial.id.at.the following exchange then occurred 
q why was it your impression that he had nothing to lose 
a well,my impression,and my impression is still,that you ca stack concurrent offenses.you ca make them run consecutively 
a obviously i wrong,but i still feel that you ca stack sentences for the same offense,even though there is a conspiracy involved.and i understand conspiracy law is kind of convoluted,but that still my impression.
q so,to clarify,did you ever tell magana that a conviction for delivery and a conviction for conspiracy in his drug delivery could run consecutive 
a no,i never told him that.
id.emphasis added.on by the state,the prosecutor asked 
q had you advised him of what the maximum penalty would be in this case 
a if you were convicted on all three charges 
a yeah,i advised him it would be ten years.
q that what you told him 
q sir,did you advise your client that in each case there was a mandatory minimum of ten years if convicted 
q you did tell him that 
a no,i did.
q were you aware of that 
a no,i was aware of that.my impression,and it still is,that the maximum that he could get for one transaction was ten years.
id.at emphasis added.to dispel any doubt as to whether wartella did not understand the relevant statute,the prosecutor asked 
q did you tell magana what the could be in this case 
a yes.i told him,i did.i
