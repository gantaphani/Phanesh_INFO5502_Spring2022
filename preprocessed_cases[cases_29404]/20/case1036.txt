background 
factual and procedural background 
maldonado,a mexican national,was tried and convicted of capital murder in texas state court in for the november robbery and murder of cruz saucedo.saucedo was found shot twice in the head with a caliber weapon,his hands bound with the electric cord of a black decker iron.the murder went unsolved until several months later,when maldonado confessed to the murder after being arrested for an unrelated bank robbery.according to maldonado confession,he entered saucedo house with another man while a third accomplice waited in a car.maldonado companion wanted to borrow an from saucedo.when saucedo refused the loan,they bound him and demanded to know where the weapon and some marijuana were kept.maldonado companion retrieved these items and told maldonado to kill saucedo.maldonado did so,using a pillow to muffle the sound of the gunshots.the state of texas charged and tried maldonado for murder in the course of a robbery.the jury convicted maldonado of capital murder and determined that he should receive a death sentence.
maldonado filed an automatic direct appeal of his conviction with the texas court of criminal appeals tcca,which affirmed his conviction and sentence after considering his points of error on the merits.see maldonado state.while that appeal was pending,he filed his first application for a writ of habeas corpus,which the tcca denied.ex parte maldonado.after the supreme court concluded,in atkins virginia,d,that the eighth amendment precludes the execution of mentally retarded persons,maldonado filed a subsequent state habeas application in the tcca in which he claimed that he was mentally retarded and therefore ineligible for the death penalty.ex parte maldonado.the tcca remanded to the state habeas trial court to take evidence and enter findings of fact and conclusions of law on the atkins claim.ex parte maldonado.
after a live evidentiary hearing,the state habeas trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law recommending that relief be denied on maldonado atkins claim.the tcca adopted the state habeas trial court findings of fact and conclusions of law and denied relief.see ex parte maldonado,wl,at.maldonado challenged this ruling and others in a federal habeas petition under.the district court denied all of maldonado claims and sua sponte denied a coa.maldonado thaler,d.we granted a coa only as to the atkins subject of the instant appeal.maldonado thaler,wl cir.
b.the atkins decision and briseno framework 
in atkins virginia,d,the supreme court held that the eighth amendment forbids the execution of mentally retarded persons.the atkins court,however,le ft to the state s the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences.id.at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.the relevant standard in texas was set out by the tcca in ex parte briseno.the briseno court held that mental retardation claims should be adjudicated under the framework established by the american association on mental retardation aamr,in conjunction with the standard supplied by the texas persons with mental retardation act.health safety code mental retardation means significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning that is concurrent with deficits in adaptive behavior and originates during the developmental period.as quoted in atkins,the aamr supplies the following definition of mental retardation 
mental retardation refers to substantial limitations in present functioning.it is characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning,existing concurrently with related limitations in two or more of the following applicable adaptive skill areas communication,home living,social skills,community use,health and safety,functional academics,leisure,and work.mental retardation manifests before age.
atkins,at quoting aamr,mental retardation definition,classification,and systems of supports ed.briefly stated,briseno requires three elements for a finding of mental retardation significantly subaverage intellectual functioning generally,a iq score of or below deficits in adaptive functioning and onset before age.see briseno,at.
in briseno,the tcca made clear that although the determination of whether an applicant meets this standard requires careful consideration of the relevant psychological expert testimony obviously assists with this ultimate determination as to mental retardation must be made by the court,based on what the constitution requires.the tcca explained 
although experts may offer insightful opinions on the question of whether a particular person meets the psychological diagnostic criteria for mental retardation,the ultimate issue of whether this person is,in fact,mentally retarded for purposes of the eighth amendment ban on excessive punishment is one for the finder of fact,based upon all of the evidence and determinations of credibility.
maldonado atkins claim 
maldonado atkins claim received extensive consideration in the state habeas court.maldonado submitted to psychological testing by the state expert,george denkowski,a clinical psychologist,and by two of his own experts,ricardo weinstein,a forensic neuropsychologist,and antonio puente,a professor of psychiatry and neuropsychologist.each of these experts submitted an affidavit to the state habeas trial court.to supplement these affidavits with live testimony,and to provide an opportunity for,the state habeas trial court conducted an extensive,evidentiary hearing on the atkins issue on september,and and november,and.denkowski testified for the state and puente testified on behalf of maldonado.weinstein did not testify.maldonado called an additional expert,jack fletcher,who had not examined maldonado but who provided additional testimony intended to rebut denkowski testimony.both sides also called lay witnesses to testify as to maldonado adaptive behavior.
after considering the expert affidavits and testimony,the lay testimony,and numerous exhibits,the state habeas trial court concluded that maldonado had not met his burden of presenting evidence sufficient to satisfy any of the three prongs of the briseno test.accordingly,it entered findings of fact and conclusions of law recommending that maldonado be found not mentally retarded.although these findings credited and cited extensively to denkowski testimony,they were also structured such that the result would not change if the results of the tests administered by denkowski were disregarded.the findings and conclusions did,however,rely on denkowski critiques of other experts evidence,and were not specifically structured to stand if denkowski critiques were discounted.the tcca adopted the state habeas trial court findings and conclusions in their entirety and accordingly denied maldonado subsequent habeas application.see ex parte maldonado,wl,at.maldonado then filed the instant federal habeas petition.
while maldonado federal habeas application was pending,the tcca issued an opinion,ex parte plata,no,wl,at,in which it refused to credit denkowski testimony in connection with another habeas case.the state habeas trial court,whose recommendations the tcca adopted in full,concluded that there were fatal errors in denkowski administration and scoring of plata iq and adaptive deficit tests.see ex parte plata,dist.the texas state board of examiners of psychologists state board subsequently filed a complaint against denkowski with the state office of administrative hearings soah,attaching the state habeas trial court findings in plata and seeking to sanction him for intentionally misapplying psychiatric testing methods in that case.see soah docket.the board complaint also alleges that denkowski intentionally misused or abused psychological testing in connection with his forensic assessments of maldonado.it contends,in relevant part,that 
the respondent failed to properly address language and cultural issues with maldonado,a native of mexico.
respondent administered the portion of the adaptive behavior assessment system abas to maldonado using a interpreter from the court system to translate questions due to the subject limited ability to speak english and respondent inability to speak spanish.
respondent deviated from established testing protocols in the evaluation and scoring of maldonado intellectual functioning.
the adjustments respondent made to maldonado adaptive behavior scores were not scientifically valid.
respondent used maladaptive behavior to assess adaptive behavior.
respondent also used the interpreter as a translator to administer the weschler adult intelligence scale ed.to maldonado and doing so rendered the test scores invalid.
first amended complaint,soah docket.the complaint has not yet been resolved.proceedings before the soah are pending discovery is ongoing and counsel represented at oral argument that a hearing is not to occur before may maldonado timely notified the federal district court about the plata case and about the state board proceedings against denkowski.
the district court conducted a careful and detailed review of the record,and in particular considered whether the new revelations about denkowski work in the plata case and the pending state board complaint against him in the soah provided a basis to question or reject the state habeas court analysis.the district court noted that many of the errors that denkowski apparently committed in the plata case did not appear to have been repeated in his assessment of maldonado,but allowed that the plata errors might raise issues as to denkowski credibility.maldonado thaler,d at.the district court also noted,however,that t he state court adjudication denied relief independent of denkowski testing,possibly in recognition of the concerns raised by maldonado experts.id.at.the district court concluded,in agreement with the state habeas court,that even if the results of denkowski testing of maldonado were disregarded completely,maldonado could not meet his burden of establishing mental retardation.id.at.like the state habeas court,however,the district court did rely on criticisms supplied by denkowski in reaching this conclusion.the district court held that the state habeas court was not unreasonable in finding that maldonado was not mentally retarded as understood by atkins.id.at.
this appeal followed.maldonado contends that the district court erred in concluding that denkowski alleged administrative and scoring errors,particularly in light of the plata case and the state board proceedings against denkowski,did not provide a basis for disregarding denkowski testimony in its entirety.maldonado argues in particular that the court assessment of the other experts testimony relied too heavily on criticisms by denkowski.
ii.standard of review 
this habeas proceeding is subject to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,because maldonado filed his federal petition on may,well after aedpa effective date.see lindh murphy,d.under aedpa,if a state court has adjudicated a habeas petitioner claims on the merits,he may receive relief in the federal courts only where the state court decision resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.rivera quarterman,cir quoting d.
a state court decision is deemed contrary to clearly established federal law if it reaches a legal conclusion in direct conflict with a prior decision of the supreme court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the supreme court based on materially indistinguishable facts.gray epps,cir citing williams taylor,d.to merit habeas relief,a state habeas court application of federal law must be not only incorrect but objectively unreasonable.renico lett,d.a state court factual findings are presumed to be correct,although a habeas petitioner may rebut this presumption by clear and convincing evidence.e.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo,applying the same standard of review that the district court applied to the state court decision.jones cain,cir.
the question of whether a defendant suffers from mental retardation involves issues of fact,and thus is subject to a presumption of correctness that must be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence under e.clark quarterman,cir.on appeal,as in the district court,maldonado bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that he is mentally retarded.briseno,at woods quarterman,cir.
iii.discussion 
maldonado chief contention on appeal is that denkowski testing and scoring methodologies were egregiously and fatally flawed.although maldonado does not dispute that the state habeas court structured its opinion so as not to rely on denkowski test results,he argues that denkowski methodology in administering and scoring those tests was so flawed that all of denkowski his critiques of other evidence in the be disregarded in its entirety as.as discussed below,we do not agree that the specific challenges that maldonado has raised regarding denkowski methodology in calculating the raw score provide a basis for concluding that the state habeas court was unreasonable in considering that score.more troubling,however,are the scoring enhancements that denkowski applied to maldonado and abas that are presently a subject of the state board complaint against denkowski,and that are similar to those that the tcca declined to credit in plata.as discussed below,however,assuming without deciding that this evidence rebuts the presumption of correctness that attaches to the state habeas court decision to credit denkowski testimony,maldonado is not entitled to habeas relief because even disregarding that testimony,he can not meet his burden of showing that the state court finding that he is not mentally retarded was either an unreasonable application of atkins or an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in state court.
denkowski results 
denkowski examined maldonado on may and.along with a number of other tests,he administered the wechsler adult intelligence scale,third edition to measure maldonado intellectual functioning and the adaptive behavior assessment scale abas to measure maldonado adaptive functioning.the parties agreed that,when administered under proper conditions,the is the gold standard for evaluating intellectual functioning.both tests were administered with the assistance of an interpreter who,though state licensed in spanishenglish translation,did not have a background in psychology and had never translated a written psychological instrument before maldonado examination.denkowski concluded,based on that examination and relying in particular on the results of the and abas,that maldonado was not mentally retarded.maldonado challenges both his raw score and the upward enhancements that applied to both the and abas scores.
the raw score 
denkowski administration of the yielded a raw score of on the verbal portion,on the performance portion,and a iq of above the threshold of typically required to establish a showing of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning,although the low end of the confidence band for these scores could potentially qualify.maldonado contends that denkowski use of an interpreter invalidates these raw scores because the use of a translator renders data and conclusions generated from an examination per se unreliable.this argument is not persuasive.as the district court noted,the manual states that administering the test with the assistance of a translator is one useful approach employed by experienced examiners when testing individuals who are not fluent in english.maldonado thaler,d at internal quotation marks omitted quoting david wechsler,administration and scoring manual ed.furthermore,the evidence at the state evidentiary hearing showed that two of maldonado own experts,puente and fletcher,have endorsed the use of translators in psychological testing at least in certain contexts.maldonado arguments do not demonstrate unreasonableness in the state habeas court conclusion that denkowski use of a translator did not render the results per se invalid.
maldonado urges,however,that the particular way in which denkowski used the interpreter rendered the test results unreliable,because the interpreter was required to translate the test contemporaneously and informally,without advance preparation,and because the interpreter did not have a background in psychology.at the evidentiary hearing,maldonado experts testified that the interpreter lack of advance preparation and lack of psychological expertise in maldonado case,in significant translation errors.but maldonado own experts disagreed as to whether these problems could have artificially increased his score.puente testified,in agreement with denkowski,that translation problems would only tend to lower the resulting score.fletcher,however,opined that errors could also raise the score.the state habeas court discounted fletcher testimony,concluding that to the extent that the use of a translator might have affected maldonado score,such impact would most likely interfere with his optimal performance and suppress his iq scores.the state habeas court concluded that because translation errors would have had,if anything,a suppressive effect,they did not provide a basis for concluding that denkowski administration of the resulted in an artificially high raw score.particularly because maldonado own experts conflicted as to the effect or significance of translation errors,we agree with the district court that maldonado arguments do not rebut the presumptive correctness of the state habeas court conclusion.moore quarterman,cir declining to find the state habeas court even arguably unreasonable in crediting one side of conflicting expert testimony,when that testimony was sufficient to sustain the state habeas court finding 
maldonado also argues that this court should not credit denkowski testimony because he failed to take account of the flynn effect,which posits that,over time the iq scores of a population rise without corresponding increases in intelligence and thus the test must be over time.in re mathis,cir.as the district and state habeas courts recognized,however,neither this court nor the tcca has recognized the flynn effect as scientifically valid.see see also in re salazar,cir neal state,we have previously refrained from applying the flynn effect,noting that it is an unexamined scientific concept that does not provide a reliable basis for concluding that an appellant has significant general intellectual functioning.quoting ex parte blue.maldonado arguments do not show that the state habeas court unreasonably applied federal law,nor do they rebut the presumption of correctness that attaches to the state habeas court decision to credit the raw score.
the adjusted and abas scores 
of different and greater concern,however,are the upward adjustments that denkowski made to maldonado and abas scores.in both cases,denkowski opined that cultural and educational factors,as well as mild anxiety and depression,could have artificially suppressed maldonado raw score.applying these factors,denkowski estimated that maldonado true score was between and.although the manual instructs that an artificially low score may result from,among other factors,c ultural or linguistic discrepancy from the test standardization table,distractability,anxiety,deafness,poor motivation or inadequate persistence,maldonado contends,as his experts urged at the hearing,that denkowski proposed adjustments were fatally flawed because they did not result from any statistical formula or established methodology,and because denkowski lacked the cultural knowledge that would allow him to properly and accurately adjust for the effects of maldonado impoverished upbringing in rural mexico.denkowski applied similar factors when scoring the abas,relying upon his clinical judgment and his purported knowledge of mexican cultural norms to revise maldonado raw abas score significantly upward to.the abas is based upon a examination.as the district court explained 
the abas asks the subject whether he can perform certain tasks or skills.he rates his own abilities from the skill can not be performed to the skill is almost always performed correctly on skills in skill areas.the examiner then tabulates the answers into a composite score that,if below,shows deficits in adaptive behavior.
maldonado thaler,d at.denkowski adjusted maldonado scores upward on approximately of the questions and did not adjust any of the scores downward.maldonado argues that the problems with denkowski methodology in scoring the abas were compounded by the facts that denkowski administered the test using an interpreter and failed to verify maldonado responses by interviewing maldonado teachers,relatives,or associates.
the challenges that maldonado experts raised to these scoring enhancements at the state evidentiary hearing are echoed in the state board complaint against denkowski and in plata,in which the tcca rejected denkowski testimony in its entirety as because he employed similar methodology.maldonado urges that these authorities show that the state habeas court was unreasonable in failing to disregard denkowski testimony in its entirety,and further urges that if denkowski testimony is completely disregarded,he can meet his burden of establishing mental retardation.we need not decide whether these authorities are sufficient to rebut the presumption of correctness that attaches to the state habeas court decision,however,because assuming without deciding they are,we conclude that maldonado could not,with the evidence that would remain,meet his burden for obtaining federal habeas relief.
upon federal habeas review of a state court adjudication,we ultimately review only a state court decision,and not the written opinion explaining that decision.neal puckett,cir en banc see also santellan cockrell,cir the statute compels federal courts to review for reasonableness the state court ultimate decision,not every jot of its reasoning.the state court determination here was that maldonado failed to meet the briseno test for showing that he is mentally retarded.even if we disregard denkowski testimony,we conclude that maldonado fails to show the state habeas court decision was an unreasonable application of federal law or an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the remaining evidence.see d.an analysis of this remaining evidence,and the reasons for this conclusion,are set out below.
b.the remaining evidence 
intellectual functioning 
two of maldonado experts,weinstein and puente,administered tests of intellectual functioning to him.weinstein administered two such tests.the first was the verbal portion of a spanish version of the,called the escala inteligencia wechsler para adultos.maldonado scored an on the verbal portion and scored a on the comprehension,similarities,and vocabulary subsections of that verbal well above the score of that roughly forms the upper bound for a finding of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.weinstein did not disclose in his expert report that he had administered this results were only brought to the state habeas court attention because denkowski discovered the administration while researching weinstein testing protocols.we are troubled,as were the district and state habeas courts,that weinstein never explained why he chose to administer that test,why he did not perform the entire test,or why he did not report his partial conclusions.maldonado thaler,d at.
maldonado experts at the evidentiary hearing,puente and fletcher,urged that the state habeas court should not credit the score.puente testified that weinstein use of the was problematic because it was normed for spanish speakers from puerto rico,who may have linguistic differences from maldonado native mexico.fletcher urged that the was likely to yield scores substantially higher than those you would get on the wais iii,but did not quantify the amount by which the result might overstate maldonado iq.puente and fletcher,however,made no effort to explain why,given these shortcomings,maldonado own expert had decided to administer a portion of the.we agree with the district court,therefore,that maldonado fails to show that the state habeas court reliance on the partial administration of the was unreasonable.this reliance was one basis upon which the state court determined that maldonado had not met his burden of demonstrating significantly subaverage intellectual functioning,and maldonado has not presented evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption of correctness in that conclusion.
weinstein also administered the,the spanish language version of the test of cognitive abilities,revised.that administration,which weinstein did report,yielded an iq score of.as the state habeas court noted,and maldonado does not dispute,the aamr has not cited the as an appropriate test for assessing the intellectual functioning aspect of a mental retardation diagnosis.because the aamr has not specifically cited the test as appropriate,and because weinstein never attempted to explain the discrepancy between the result and the why the latter should be credited over the can not conclude that the state habeas court decision to accord little weight to the result was unreasonable.see woods,at state habeas court was not unreasonable in deciding to accord less weight to certain test results,where testimony supported the conclusion that those results were less reliable.
puente also administered two tests,the and the comprehensive test of nonverbal intelligence ctoni.puente testified that both are neuropsychological tests that measure nonverbal ability.as with the,the state habeas court noted and maldonado does not dispute that the aamr does not cite these tests as providing a basis for assessing intellectual functioning.another of maldonado experts,fletcher,testified on that neither of these testing instruments could be used to produce a iq score.in a recent decision,the tcca has indicated that a iq score should provide the basis for any assessment of intellectual functioning.see ex parte hearn,n europsychological measures may not wholly replace iq scores in measuring intellectual functioning.see also moore quarterman,app x,cir noting the standard professional view that the ctoni is not a measure of general intelligence.puente administration of the yielded an iq score of puente agreed did not,by itself,qualify maldonado for a diagnosis of mental retardation.puente administration of the ctoni yielded an iq score of.because the aamr has not cited either test as providing a basis for assessing intellectual functioning because maldonado own expert,fletcher,opined that neither of these tests was an appropriate method of calculating a iq score and because puente conceded that the results would not support a diagnosis of mental retardation,maldonado has not shown that the state habeas court unreasonably determined that he lacked subaverage intellectual functioning.this is particularly true in light of the tcca recent pronouncement in hearn,at.
in sum,the state habeas court decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of atkins,and maldonado did not rebut the presumption of correctness that attaches to the state habeas court conclusion that maldonado did not meet his burden of showing significantly subaverage intellectual functioning under the first prong of the briseno mental retardation standard.he therefore can not show that the state habeas court factual determination was unreasonable.see woods,at t o the extent woods argues that the state court decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented,d,he has failed to rebut,by clear and convincing evidence,the presumption that the state court factual findings are correct.and because fulfillment of each prong is necessary to a finding of mental retardation,this conclusion ends the inquiry.as discussed below,however,we also find that maldonado did not present evidence sufficient to rebut the presumed correctness of the state habeas court decision that maldonado did not meet the second briseno prong.
adaptive deficits 
maldonado experts extensively criticized denkowski methodology in administering and scoring the abas.they did not,however,themselves administer to maldonado the abas or any other formal testing instrument for adaptive deficits.weinstein affidavit did not discuss the adaptive behavior prong at all.fletcher addressed adaptive behavior only to the extent of criticizing denkowski administration of the abas.the only testimony as to maldonado adaptive deficits came from puente,who testified,based on affidavits prepared by maldonado father and others who knew him,that maldonado had exhibited some adaptive deficits,particularly in his formative years.puente found deficits in functional academics maldonado was slow in school banking when maldonado and his wife finally opened a checking account after immigrating to the united states,it was not clear that he knew how to use it public transportation before age,maldonado use of public transportation apparently was limited leisure maldonado did not report any hobbies beyond recreational drug use and social relationships before age,his romantic relationships with females were unsuccessful and his closest relationship was with his stepfather,with whom he lived only briefly.puente explained that he had not conducted any standardized testing for adaptive deficits because there were no standardized tests written in spanish and he believed translating would be inappropriate.the state habeas court relied primarily on lay testimony provided by witnesses for both parties in concluding that maldonado had not shown adaptive deficits sufficient to satisfy the second briseno prong.
although the aamr contemplates that adaptive deficits,defined as significant limitations in an individual effectiveness in meeting the standards of maturation,learning,personal independence,social responsibility that are expected for his or her age level and cultural group,will be determined by clinical assessment and,usually,standardized scales,briseno,at,briseno does not require that an assessment of adaptive deficits be premised upon the results of standardized tests or expert opinion,id.at see also hearn,at s tandardized tests are not the sole measure of adaptive functioning,but they may be helpful to the factfinder,who has the ultimate responsibility for determining mental retardation.indeed,the briseno court emphasized that a lthough experts may offer insightful opinions the ultimate issue of whether a person is,in fact,mentally retarded for purposes of the eighth amendment ban on excessive punishment is one for the finder of fact.at.briseno cites the following considerations as being particularly important to determining whether the adaptive deficit prong has been met 
did those who knew the person best during the developmental family,friends,teachers,employers,he was mentally retarded at that time,and if so,act in accordance with that determination 
has the person formulated plans and carried them through or is his conduct impulsive 
does his conduct show leadership or does it show that he is led around by others 
is his conduct in response to external stimuli rational and appropriate,regardless of whether it is socially acceptable 
does he respond coherently,rationally,and on point to oral or written questions or do his responses wander from subject to subject 
can the person hide facts or lie effectively in his own or others interests 
putting aside any heinousness or gruesomeness surrounding the capital offense,did the commission of that offense require forethought,planning and com
