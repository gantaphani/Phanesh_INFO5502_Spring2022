the appellant,lee wilson,wilson appeals the district court decision to dismiss his action against the virginia department of corrections.wilson claims that he is entitled to monetary damages for unconstitutional imprisonment because virginia improperly extended the length of his prison sentence.the district court,citing to the supreme court decision in heck humphrey,d,dismissed wilson wrongful incarceration claim sua sponte stating that a damages claim for unconstitutional imprisonment is not appropriate unless and until plaintiff conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal,expunged by executive order,declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination,or called into question by a federal court issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.this mandate is referred to as the favorable termination requirement.
wilson contends that his action is proper because success on that claim will not impugn his underlying conviction or sentence.assuming,as we must,that wilson allegations are true,we agree that his claim is viable and as such,the district court decision is reversed and remanded.
wilson was arrested on march,for grand larceny of a motor vehicle.on july,he pled guilty to the lesser charge of being an accessory after the fact.consistent with wilson plea agreement,the virginia state court sentenced him to twelve months imprisonment,six months of which was suspended due to time served.according to the virginia department of corrections vdoc uniform commitment report,wilson release date was april.however,on march,the vdoc changed wilson release date to july.wilson filed grievances with the prison administration disputing his additional imprisonment.the vdoc did not initiate any formal administrative proceedings to resolve wilson complaint.after wilson was released from prison he sued,seeking monetary damages of for wrongful imprisonment.the district court dismissed wilson claim without prejudice,holding that heck favorable termination requirement barred his claim and stating that wilson may resubmit his claims to this court in a habeas petition.wilson appeals.
the vdoc contends that wilson claim is not cognizable because wilson failed to satisfy heck favorable termination requirement prior to filing his claim,and even if heck did not bar wilson claim,because the vdoc properly calculated his sentence,wilson claim is moot wilson argues that a action is the proper vehicle to bring his wrongful imprisonment claim because a habeas action would have been inappropriate as he does not seek release from custody.thus,whether wilson claim for wrongful imprisonment,filed after his sentence expired,is cognizable,is the sole issue before this court.we review the district court decision to dismiss wilson claim due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction,a question of law,de novo,see,church attorney general of com.of,cir,taking all of his allegations in the light most favorable to him.giarratano johnson,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
although the convergence of habeas and actions has been addressed by the supreme court on several occasions,as the vdoc admits,it has sent mixed signals as to when an inmate or former inmate can pursue a claim.appellee br.in preiser rodriguez,d,a group of state prisoners filed a action alleging that the new york state department of correctional services denial of credits violated their constitutional right to due process.the prisoners sought an injunction to force the prison to restore the credits,a remedy which would have reduced the prisoners sentences.despite the literal applicability of,the supreme court affirmed the district court dismissal of the claim because the prisoners challenge is just as close to the core of habeas corpus as an attack on the prisoner conviction,for it goes directly to the constitutionality of his physical confinement itself and seeks either immediate release from that confinement or the shortening of its duration.id.at.because the plaintiffs sought no monetary damages,but only equitable of their credits,id.at,the supreme court expressly limited its holding to the equitable relief sought by the prisoners.
subsequently,in wolff mcdonnell,d,an inmate filed a class action on behalf of himself and other inmates,alleging inter alia,that the disciplinary proceedings at the nebraska penal and correctional complex violated their due process rights.like the plaintiffs in preiser,the prisoners complained that the prison had improperly denied them credits and sought injunctive relief.the wolff inmates,however,also sought damages.in holding that preiser precluded injunctive,the restoration of credits,the supreme court confirmed the propriety of the plaintiffs claim 
habeas corpus is not an appropriate or available remedy for damages claims,which,if not frivolous and of sufficient substance to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal court,could be pressed under along with suits challenging the conditions of confinement rather than the fact or length of custody.
id.at.thus,the supreme court concluded that the district court erred by not determining the validity of the procedures employed for imposing sanctions,including loss of good because a declaratory judgment as a predicate to a damages award would not be barred by preiser.id.at.
two decades after wolff,the supreme court,in heck,considered a prisoner claim seeking monetary damages from the state because state officers participated in an unlawful,unreasonable,and arbitrary investigation leading to his arrest,state officers knowingly destroyed exculpatory evidence,and an illegal and unlawful voice identification procedure was relied upon at trial.heck,at.internal quotation marks omitted.recognizing that preiser provided an unreliable,if not an unintelligible,guide,id.at,as to whether a claim for monetary damages is proper when it fails to challenge the lawfulness of conviction or confinement,id.at,and concluding that wolff recognized a claim for using the wrong procedures,not for reaching the wrong result,denying credits,id.at,the court analyzed the issue as a matter of first impression.after reiterating that claims,unlike petitions for habeas corpus,do not require administrative exhaustion,the court held that when a plaintiff claims challenge the lawfulness of conviction or confinement,id.at,they are simply not cognizable as claims,because 
w e think the hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments applies to damages actions that necessarily require the plaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of his conviction or confinement,just as it has always applied to actions for malicious prosecution.
id.at.emphasis added.heck holding precludes a prisoner from a collateral attack that may result in two inconsistent example,a valid criminal conviction and a valid civil judgment under for monetary damages due to unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment although not essential to its holding,the supreme court extended its analysis a step further by concluding that the principle barring collateral attacks is not rendered inapplicable by the fortuity that a convicted criminal is no longer incarcerated.id.at.
justice souter concurrence in heck,joined by three justices,recognized that the majority opinion could be interpreted to risk the rights of those outside the intersection of and the habeas statute,individuals not in custody for habeas purposes,id.at,thus preventing them from accessing a federal forum.
if these individuals people who were merely fined,for example,or who have completed short terms of imprisonment,probation,or parole,or who discover through no fault of their own a constitutional violation after full expiration of their sentences,like state prisoners,were required to show the prior invalidation of their convictions or sentences in order to obtain damages for unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment,the result would be to deny any federal forum for claiming a deprivation of federal rights to those who can not first obtain a favorable state ruling.the reason,of course,is that individuals not in custody can not invoke federal ha
