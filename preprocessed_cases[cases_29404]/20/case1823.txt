on may,a lake county,illinois jury found lorenzo ellison guilty of murder in the death of quincy king,a infant.he was sentenced to years in prison.after unsuccessfully appealing his conviction and the denial of a subsequent motion for relief in the illinois appellate courts,ellison filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.the district court denied ellison petition but issued a certificate of appealability on several issues,two of which have been briefed for appeal whether the failure of his trial attorney to consult with or call an expert witness on shaken infant syndrome constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and whether the prosecutor closing argument deprived ellison of due process we find no deprivation of federal rights and affirm the district court decision denying the petition.
background 
on november,at approximately,paramedics from the waukegan fire department were dispatched to ellison apartment in response to a call that a baby later identified as quincy king was not breathing.quincy mother,jacqueline king,was involved in a romantic relationship with ellison and had moved into his apartment with quincy and her other two children on october.a third adult,roberto smith,was also staying with ellison at the time.upon their arrival,paramedics found quincy lying motionless on a bed in the apartment with his eyes closed.ellison told paramedics that he had been playing with the baby by throwing him up in the air when he stopped breathing.
the paramedics transported quincy to the hospital where he was examined by thomas glimp.glimp noted that quincy was not breathing,had no pulse,and had a bruise on his left cheek.the soft spot on quincy skull was firm and bulging,indicating pressure or fluid in the skull.glimp asked ellison what happened,and he again stated he had been tossing the baby in the air when the baby stopped breathing.thinking that the explanation did not square with quincy injuries and that the child was the victim of shaken infant syndrome,glimp notified hospital staff who contacted the department of children and family services.quincy was then transported to another hospital where he was pronounced dead the next day.a subsequent autopsy confirmed that the cause of death was blunt force injury to the brain associated with shaken infant syndrome.
ellison was interviewed by sergeant fernando shipley and detective donald meadie of the waukegan police department the night after quincy was taken to the hospital.ellison gave two statements one in his own handwriting,and a second that detective meadie typed and ellison signed.in both statements,ellison admitted that he was bouncing quincy on the bed before he stopped breathing,but added that he had also shaken him when he started crying.in his handwritten statement,ellison wrote 
i started to play with quincy and throw him up in the air and bounced him on the bed and he started to cry and i shook his face to keep him from crying and do know how hard i shook his face and bounced him on the bed and bob roberto smith gave him cpr and i called emergency and i do see him breathing.
the typewritten statement ellison signed likewise describes shaking the child,as well as bouncing him on the bed 
the last time i bounced quincy on the bed,he fell away from me,and that was when i grabbed him with both hands around his head to prevent him from falling off the other side.i was trying to get quincy to stop crying,so i started shaking him,but i guess i shook him too hard.
according to the detectives,ellison also demonstrated for them how he had shaken quincy by moving both hands back and forth in a vigorous motion.
ellison was thereafter charged with one count of murder and arraigned on december.at an early pretrial conference on january,ellison retained counsel,attorney seymour vishny,indicated he was in the process of obtaining an expert but would need three to four weeks to do so.it appears,however,that attorney vishny was under the impression that either ellison or his family would have to pay for an expert,and he reported at a pretrial conference on february that he was having difficulty getting the family to cooperate.the trial court explained that there were other options that were not dependent on family resources and continued the case for the following week.by that time,ellison family had retained attorney robert pantoga to replace attorney vishny,and the case was again continued for another week.
on february,the court set the matter for trial on april.on march,attorney pantoga asked the court to continue the trial date for another week so that he could review the resumes of the state experts and obtain his own.the trial court granted the request,and at the final pretrial conference on april,attorney pantoga made no mention of an expert.no further requests for a continuance were made,and the trial commenced,as scheduled,on may.
at trial,glimp testified to his observations when quincy arrived at the emergency room,and sergeant shipley and detective meadie told of their interview with ellison and recounted his statements to them.jeffrey jentzen,the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy on quincy,also described his findings.
jentzen noted there were bruises on the right and left cheeks,and a laceration on the back of quincy head.four of quincy right ribs showed healing fractures that were three to four weeks old.he also noted that there were recent rib fractures on both the left and right sides,with the fractures on the back.he opined that the recent fractures occurred within a few days of quincy death.quincy also had a depressed skull fracture and multiple blood clots in his skull.the corpus callosum,which is the band of tissue connecting the right and left halves of the brain,had been lacerated,and each of quincy eyes had multiple hemorrhages.quincy had a large blood clot near his spinal cord,corresponding to the fractured ribs on his left side.with the exception of the old rib fractures and the scalp laceration,jentzen opined that all of quincy injuries occurred at the same time.
based on his examination,jentzen concluded that quincy died as a result of shaken infant syndrome.jentzen explained that shaken infant syndrome refers to a group of findings or injuries that occur when a child is violently shaken.according to jentzen,the child is typically grasped in the chest area and the ribs next to the spine fracture from the pressure of squeezing the child.because an infant bones are more elastic than those of an adult,a large amount of force was needed to fracture them.the blood clots in the skull are the result of the child brain violently striking the inside of his skull as he is shaken back and forth,a sort of whiplash phenomenon that occurs because the child neck muscles are not sufficiently developed to support his head while he is being shaken.the corpus callosum,ruptures when the brain twists and turns,and the supporting structures can no longer support the brain.jentzen testified that this type of rupture typically also occurs in motor vehicle accidents and falls from great heights.hemorrhages in the eyes occur when the shaking causes the blood vessels in the eyes to separate.death occurs when the injured brain tissue swells.
according to jentzen,quincy would have had to have been violently shaken to cause the injuries he observed.based on his experience in such cases and discussions with colleagues,jentzen stated that individuals who cause such injuries typically shake a child until they describe their arms as being tired.given the nature and extent of the more recent injuries he observed,jentzen also thought that the person who caused them would have had to have known that the child was severely injured.the child would most probably have been comatose or,there would have been irritability,there would have been evidence of injury.
in addition to these witnesses,each of the adults who were present in the apartment when quincy stopped breathing testified to the events leading up to his death.jacqueline king,quincy mother,testified that the night before her son died she was sleeping with ellison in his bedroom,while quincy slept on a pallet on the floor next to ellison.between three and four in the morning,quincy began to holler and would not go back to sleep.ellison offered him a bottle and pacifier,but the child would take them.in king words,ellison turned over and he did a little shove like,shut up,boy.i got to go to sleep.quincy quieted down,but started up again as soon as lorenzo stopped shaking him at that point,king testified that she got out of bed and sat on the floor with quincy until he went to sleep.
when quincy woke up the following morning,king testified that he appeared normal to her.sometime around ellison and smith began tossing quincy in the air and letting him fall onto the bed.quincy looked scared and was whining,and king asked them to stop,but they did not.king then went into the bathroom to change her daughter clothes because she had wet herself.while she was in the bathroom,king,who was deaf in one ear and had the water running,was unable to hear what was going on in the bedroom.when she returned to the bedroom,smith told her quincy was not breathing.smith began performing cpr,and ellison called the rescue squad.
king also testified that she had previously observed ellison and smith tossing quincy and had told them to stop because they could hurt him.ellison,on one occasion,replied that he would not hurt quincy because he cared for him like he his own.about two weeks prior to quincy death,king stated she saw ellison shaking and punching quincy in the chest with his fists.king testified that when she asked ellison to stop,he replied that he was not hitting quincy hard enough to hurt him,and that he was hitting the baby to make him tough.
smith,who was called by the defense,also denied he was in the bedroom when quincy stopped breathing.smith testified that he left the apartment earlier that morning and arrived back at approximately.he admitted that he was bouncing the child on the bed with ellison when he first entered the apartment,but then left the bedroom to take off his coat.when he left the room,smith stated that quincy seemed fine.when he came back about five minutes later,quincy was not breathing.on,smith added that after he left the bedroom,he heard the baby crying and ellison say shut up a few times.then it got silent.
finally,ellison testified on his own behalf.at one point,he said that all three of the adults were in the bedroom when quincy suddenly blacked out.yet,he also said that smith told king that quincy stopped breathing when she returned from the bathroom.notwithstanding his two statements to police,ellison also denied that he had ever shaken quincy.he claimed police had pressured him into signing the typewritten statement and then into writing the other statement,using the first as a model.ellison also claimed that while he was present,no one shook the baby.
the jury was instructed on both murder and the offense of involuntary manslaughter.toward the end of his closing argument,the prosecutor addressed the question of ellison mental state,stating 
the issue is the mental state of the defendant at the time the acts were performed that killed the child,not the mental states in the past by jacqueline king,not by roberto smith.these people are not on trial here today.what we have here is one defendant on trial.if those other people had caused the death of this child,if they had shaken this child so hard that he died,they would be on trial with the defendant.
counsel for ellison objected,and the trial court sustained the objection.the prosecutor continued they did not commit any acts to kill this child.they did not do any acts to cause the death of this child.he did.counsel again objected,but this time the trial court overruled the objection.
no request was made either for a mistrial or a curative instruction.the attorneys completed their closing arguments,and the jury retired for its deliberations.upon completion of its deliberations,the jury returned a verdict finding ellison guilty of murder.ellison was sentenced to sixty years in prison on june.
ellison appealed his conviction claiming,inter alia,that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and obtain an expert witness to testify on shaken infant syndrome.the illinois appellate court,second district,rejected the claim because ellison had made no showing that an expert could have offered any testimony that would have helped the defense.the illinois supreme court denied ellison petition for leave to appeal on june.
ellison next filed a pro se state petition for relief in which he claimed that he had been denied due process and a fair trial by the prosecutor allegedly prejudicial and inflammatory statements during closing arguments.the court appointed counsel to represent ellison,and counsel filed an amended petition that incorporated this ground,and additionally repeated the argument that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present expert testimony on the issue of shaken infant syndrome.the amended petition was supported by an affidavit of stephen lazoritz,which states in relevant part 
it is my opinion,within reasonable medical certainty,that the exact force needed to injure or kill an infant by shaking,though very great,is not exactly known.the statement that the perpetrator would have had to shake the infant until his arms were exhausted is purely speculative.the exact number of shakes required or the time required has not been determined,only the fact it requires a great force.
the court held an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective assistance of counsel issue on march,but ellison was the only witness neither lazoritz nor attorney pantoga testified.ellison testified that both attorney vishny and attorney pantoga told him it would be necessary to hire an expert witness and asked his family for money to hire an expert.he testified that attorney pantoga never consulted with or hired an expert,but claimed that attorney pantoga did ask the trial court for additional time to retain one.according to ellison,the court refused his request.
the court denied ellison petition for relief in a written decision issued on december.as to the claim that his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to retain and call an expert,the court found that ellison had still not offered any evidence that an expert would have helped the defense.the court recognized that,according to his affidavit,lazoritz thought jentzen statement that the perpetrator shook the child until his arms were tired was purely speculative.the court noted,however,that this testimony came at the end of jentzen direct examination.jentzen had stated that based on his experience and discussions with his colleagues,it seemed to him that individuals will typically shake a child until they describe their arms being tired.he was then asked the following leading question so what you are telling us,doctor,is that this baby was shaken until the person who was shaking him,his arms hurt,and that what stopped him from shaking this baby defense counsel did not object,and jentzen responded,probably.
in denying the petition,the court concluded that lazoritz affidavit in no way refutes jentzen opinion that the child was violently shaken.in fact,the court concluded that lazoritz affidavit actually supports the state case further with his opinion that it requires great force to kill or injure an infant by shaking.the court also concluded that even if an objection had been made and sustained to the challenged testimony,or an expert had been called to refute it,it would not have changed the result.that testimony did not alter the underlying testimony of jentzen as to his opinion concerning the cause of death,the observable injuries,the nature of shaken baby syndrome,and the force necessary to kill or injure an infant by shaking.
as to ellison claim that his due process rights were violated by the prosecutor improper statements during closing argument,the court held that the closing argument comments were adequately dealt with by the trial judge and even if some of them were improper,they would not have affected the result or prejudiced the defendant to such an extent that a new trial would be required.
a new attorney was appointed to represent ellison on the state appeal,but moved to withdraw pursuant to anders.california,on the ground that there was no claim that merited review.as to the ineffective assistance claim,counsel noted that lazoritz affidavit did not state that he would have been available to testify at ellison trial,and in any event,lazoritz did not dispute jentzen testimony that it took great force to kill an infant by shaking him,only the length of time it would take.as to the due process claim,counsel stated that the prosecutor statements during closing argument were fair comments.the illinois appellate court granted the motion to withdraw,stating there were no meritorious issues that would support an appeal,and affirmed the order denying ellison petition for relief.the illinois supreme court denied his petition for leave to appeal.
ellison then filed his petition for federal habeas relief under,in which he raised numerous issues in addition to those certified to this court for appeal.by decision dated june,the district court denied the petition.in denying his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,the district court concluded that ellison had failed to show that an expert would have been available at the time of the trial who would contradict the prosecution expert testimony,or at least the state court finding to that effect was not unreasonable.as to the due process claim,the district court held that ellison had failed to provide specific reasons or to cite any precedent as to why these remarks were so improper and the illinois courts rulings on them so unreasonable as to deny him due process.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
aedpa standard of review 
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa governs review of state court convictions in federal habeas corpus proceedings.under aedpa,a federal court may grant habeas relief only if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.d williams taylor.a state court decision is contrary to federal law if the state court either incorrectly laid out governing united states supreme court precedent,or,having identified the correct rule of law,decided a case differently than a materially factually indistinguishable supreme court case.d calloway montgomery,cir.an unreasonable application of united states supreme court precedent occurs when a state court identifies the correct governing legal rule but unreasonably applies it to the facts of a case or if the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from the supreme court precedent to a new context in which it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context in which it should apply.d muth frank,cir.we review de novo the district court denial of a habeas petition.southerland gaetz,f d,cir citing buss,cir.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
ellison claim that the assistance provided by his trial counsel fell below sixth amendment standards is governed by the familiar test clearly established by the supreme court in strickland washington 
first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.unless a defendant makes both showings,it can not be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.
even before aedpa was enacted,the court cautioned that,in applying this test,j udicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential.id.at.a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.id.post aedpa,the bar is even higher.see holman gilmore,cir strickland builds in an element of deference to counsel choices in conducting the litigation d adds a layer of respect for a state court application of the legal standard.
likewise with respect to the prejudice prong of the strickland analysis,on direct review a defendant must show that he was prejudiced by counsel deficient performance,he must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.on federal habeas review,however,the question is whether the state court determination that such a probability does not exist is reasonable.barrow uchtman,cir.
ellison argues that the state court misapplied strickland in denying his motion for relief.his attorney failed to call an expert to rebut key testimony at his trial,he contends,not because he did not believe one was necessary or because one was not available,but because,in an overly rushed process,he failed to make an investigation,and he misunderstood his ability to rebut the state expert in alternative ways.brief of at.expert testimony as to the force needed to kill a child by shaking him was essential to his defense,ellison maintains.the state court decision to the contrary was an unreasonable application of clearly established law.id.
the record does not support ellison contention that attorney pantoga failed to call an expert because he did not understand the potential benefit of a defense expert or how to go about retaining one for an indigent client nor does it support the suggestion that he was prevented from doing so by an overly rushed process.ellison did not call attorney pantoga as a witness at the hearing on his petition for relief,so the record does not contain his explanation.what the record does reflect is that attorney pantoga said he intended to retain an expert and even requested a brief adjournment of the trial to allow time for him to do so.the trial court granted his request,and attorney pantoga never raised the issue again.this is hardly evidence that he failed to investigate or did not understand how an expert might help.
of course,even if the failure to call an expert was not due to the attorney ignorance or the trial court insistence on an early trial,such failure may still constitute ineffective assistance.if the need for an expert was clear and one was reasonably available,counsel should at least consult with one.see miller anderson,cir i n the circumstances an essential qualification,there was also no excuse for the lawyer failure to consult experts on hair,dna,treadmarks,and footprints.by itself,however,the absence of a defense expert is not sufficient to establish that counsel performance was deficient.for counsel performance to be found deficient,the defendant must demonstrate that an expert capable of supporting the defense was reasonably available at the time of trial.the state court concluded that ellison had failed to make such a showing.the question we must decide is whether the state court conclusion was unreasonable.
the only evidence ellison offered in support of his claim that such an expert was available was the affidavit of lazoritz,signed more than six years after the trial,which disputed jentzen testimony that ellison had probably shaken quincy until his arms were tired.ellison amended petition for relief states that jentzen testimony in this regard is contrary to the opinions of the medical community in the area of shaken baby syndrome today as expressed in lazoritz affidavit.italics added.on its face,this evidence is insufficient to show that an expert capable of refuting jentzen testimony was available in may.even aside from the date of the affidavit,however,the state court concluded that the proffered evidence did not show that attorney pantoga failure to call an expert amounted to ineffective assistance.the plain fact recognized by the court is that on the central question of the degree of forc
