these habeas corpus proceedings on behalf of justin michael wolfe are before us for the third time,and they arrive saddled with a protracted and eventful history.most recently,in,we affirmed the judgment entered in the eastern district of virginia vacating wolfe state court convictions for capital murder and other crimes,and we remanded for further proceedings,leaving in place the district court remedial edict that wolfe be retried or released.
in this appeal,respondent harold clarke,as director of the virginia department of corrections hereinafter the commonwealth,seeks relief from the district court order enforcing judgment.wolfe clarke,cv,the court entered the challenged order upon ascertaining that the commonwealth had not complied with the operative directive.as a consequence of the commonwealth noncompliance,it was instructed to release wolfe unconditionally,free of all criminal proceedings on the charge of murder for hire of danny petrole and the drug charges that were previously tried in state court by the commonwealth,within ten days of the entry of this order.id.at.
beyond mere release,however,the district court further proscribed the commonwealth from reprosecuting wolfe on the charges originally tried herein in state court or any other charges stemming from the death of danny petrole which requires the testimony of owen barber in any form.order enforcing judgment.in support of its chosen remedy,the court concluded that the commonwealth prosecutors had,on remand,improperly conducted themselves with respect to their key witness,owen barber.as a result,the prosecutors had permanently crystalized constitutional violations previously found to have tainted wolfe trial,id.at,which in turn constituted extraordinary circumstances justifying a federal bar to his proposed retrial.
on january,we stayed,pending resolution of this appeal,the district court order.as explained below,the court accurately determined that the commonwealth neglected to timely observe the directive.though the court was correct to order wolfe immediate release,it fashioned an overbroad remedy and thereby abused its discretion by precluding the commonwealth from retrying wolfe in a new proceeding.we therefore vacate the order enforcing judgment and remand for the district court to enter a substitute order directing that wolfe simply be released from the custody imposed as the result of his convictions.
as described in our earlier decisions,a jury in prince william county,virginia,found wolfe guilty in of the capital murder of danny petrole,of using a firearm in the commission of a felony,and of conspiring to distribute marijuana.see wolfe johnson,cir wolfe i wolfe.clarke,cir wolfe ii.the theory of the prosecution was that,as a marijuana dealer,wolfe hired his friend and fellow drug dealer,owen barber,to murder petrole,who was a drug supplier.barber,the admitted triggerman,was the only witness to testify concerning the for hire element of the scheme.in exchange for barber testimony,the commonwealth dismissed its capital murder charge against him.barber thus pleaded guilty and was sentenced to sixty years on a murder conviction,of which years were suspended.on the basis of his murder conviction,wolfe was sentenced to death.for his firearm and drug convictions,wolfe received consecutive prison terms of three and thirty years,respectively.
in november,after failing to obtain relief on direct appeal and in state proceedings,wolfe filed his petition in the eastern district of virginia.the district court promptly referred wolfe petition to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.on december,while wolfe petition was pending,barber executed an affidavit repudiating his trial testimony and exculpating wolfe from the scheme.barber affidavit prompted wolfe to file an amended petition,which is the operative petition in these proceedings.the petition maintained,inter alia,that the prosecution had curtailed wolfe entitlement to due process by concealing material exculpatory evidence that should have been disclosed to his defense attorneys.the petition also alleged that barber affidavit had sufficiently demonstrated wolfe actual innocence to excuse any procedural default of his constitutional claims.
in april,five months after executing the repudiatory affidavit,barber sought to recant the statements he had made therein.in an unsworn handwritten letter,barber insisted that he had testified truthfully in the trial,and that he had falsified his affidavit.in august,the magistrate judge issued his report recommending dismissal of wolfe petition,in that the claims alleged therein were meritless and had been procedurally defaulted.on february,over wolfe objections,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation and dismissed the petition.wolfe timely appealed that dismissal,and,by our decision of may,see wolfe i,we vacated in part and remanded for further proceedings.
on remand,the district court determined at the outset that wolfe was entitled to an evidentiary hearing,and that,pursuant to schlup delo,he had made a sufficient showing of actual innocence to bypass any procedural defenses that might be interposed to foreclose substantive consideration of his constitutional claims.during the evidentiary hearing conducted in november,barber testified,exculpated wolfe,and his evidence was credited by the court.on july,the court ruled that the prosecutors in wolfe trial had contravened his fourteenth amendment due process rights by failing to disclose favorable and material evidence,contrary to brady maryland,allowing barber to testify,despite having information indicating that his testimony was false,in violation of napue illinois,and striking a qualified venireman,as proscribed by supreme court precedent.the court therefore granted habeas corpus relief to wolfe and specified that wolfe conviction and sentence were vacated.wolfe clarke,d.on august,the commonwealth filed a timely notice of appeal.
thereafter,wolfe moved the district court,pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,to clarify whether the relief granted on his capital murder conviction also encompassed his firearm and drug convictions.on august,the court granted wolfe clarification motion and entered one of the orders relevant to this appeal.see wolfe clarke,cv,the relief order the relief order explained that wolfe was entitled to a new trial on all of the original charges,and it accorded the commonwealth the option of either provid ing wolfe with a new trial,or releas ing him unconditionally from custody within days.id.at.on september,the commonwealth filed a second notice of appeal,from the relief order and the amended judgment.eleven days later,the commonwealth moved the district court for a stay pending appeal,which the court granted on november.see wolfe clarke,d the stay order wolfe,asserting that the district court erred in denying him relief on an additional,unadjudicated claim.by our wolfe ii decision,we affirmed the judgment of the district court 
our mandate in wolfe ii issued on september.that same day,wolfe was transferred from the sussex state prison to the prince william county adult detention center,for a status hearing to be conducted in the state circuit court on september.at that hearing,two of wolfe federal habeas lawyers were appointed to represent him on the original state charges,and a bond hearing was set for september,the next day,the commonwealth attorney and his assistant,along with one of the primary investigating officers,detective sam newsome,interviewed barber at the augusta correctional center.during the interview,which was recorded without barber knowledge,those three officials sought to ascertain how barber would testify at wolfe retrial.they suggested to barber that,because his testimony in the federal habeas proceedings was inconsistent with his trial testimony,he had breached his plea agreement with the commonwealth.the prosecutors then advised barber that he could face prosecution for perjury,plus reinstatement of his original capital murder charge,which potentially carried the death penalty.
not long thereafter,the commonwealth attorney and his assistant recused themselves from wolfe retrial and requested the appointment of raymond morrogh,the commonwealth attorney for fairfax county,as special prosecutor.morrogh was appointed,and he represented the commonwealth at the september,hearing,where wolfe was denied bond.on that occasion,the defense lawyers asserted that only days remained for the commonwealth to retry wolfe.the commonwealth agreed to a retrial beginning on october.on the heels of the bond hearing,wolfe requested the circuit court to disqualify the special prosecutor.
in the meantime,on october,a prince william county grand jury returned new indictments against wolfe,charging him with six additional offenses arising from the events underlying wolfe original charges.the retrial,then,was to encompass the original charges plus the following 
capital murder by order of a person engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise cce 
use of a firearm in the commission of a murder 
leading a cce to distribute between and worth of marijuana in a period 
leading a cce to distribute more than of marijuana in a period 
first degree felony murder of danny petrole during commission of a robbery or attempted robbery and 
use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery or attempted robbery.
see.on that same date,the commonwealth moved in state court for a continuance of the october retrial,asserting that the day period had not begun to run until our mandate issued on september,and,thus,that the days would not expire until january.consistent with that view,the commonwealth requested that the retrial commence the first week of january.the continuance motion was granted on october,but a retrial date was not set.
on october,the circuit court conducted a hearing on,inter alia,wolfe motion to disqualify the special prosecutor.barber was called to testify at that hearing,and he invoked his fifth amendment privilege against.the court accepted barber assertion of the privilege and did not seek to compel his testimony.thereafter,the court scheduled wolfe retrial for january,
meanwhile,beginning in november,proceedings commenced in federal court that overlapped to some extent with the pretrial litigation in the circuit court.specifically,on november,wolfe filed a motion to enforce judgment,asserting that the commonwealth had neither released him unconditionally nor provided him with a new trial within days of the relief order.the commonwealth opposed the motion,contending that wolfe had already been released unconditionally,and that,by conducting the bond hearing on september,the commonwealth had effectively commenced his retrial within the day period.that period,the commonwealth maintained,had in any event been reset to days by the november,stay order,and had not begun to elapse until september,upon issuance of our mandate.
on december,based primarily on the barber interview,wolfe filed a motion to dismiss in the circuit court,contending that,by threatening barber with the death penalty,the prosecutors had engaged in gross prosecutorial misconduct sufficiently severe and violative of due process to fatally undermine all the state criminal charges lodged against wolfe see.two days later,wolfe brought the barber interview to the district court attention,by way of his written reply on the motion to enforce judgment.wolfe also offered to provide a transcript of the barber interview to the court at its request.id.at.the following day,the district court directed wolfe counsel to file any additional information or transcripts concerning the meeting between the original prosecutors in this case and barber on september.id.at.acting on its own initiative,the court also ordered the commonwealth to show cause why the barber interview does not constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting the court to order wolfe s immediate release and bar current and future prosecutions of wolfe on all charges related to the death of danny petrole and drug conspiracy crimes.id.at.the commonwealth responded to the show cause order on december,asserting that the district court possessed no authority to prohibit any current or future state prosecutions of wolfe,and that,even were the situation otherwise,nothing had occurred in the barber interview to justify any such action.
the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on december,concerning the show cause order.on that occasion,barber lawyer advised that barber would not testify in wolfe retrial,instead relying on his fifth amendment privilege.the court itself called barber as a witness at the hearing,for the purpose of establishing that the september,interview had been recorded without his knowledge.barber responded to the court questions,confirming that he had been unaware that the encounter was recorded.
on december,the district court entered its order enforcing judgment,concluding that the commonwealth had not satisfied either compliance option specified in the relief order,that is,wolfe had not been released unconditionally,and he had not been retried within days of the relief order.in discussing the appropriate remedy for the violation,the court surmised that had the content of wolfe motion to enforce judgment been strictly limited to the commonwealth violation of the deadline set in this case,t he court would order wolfe release,but he would be subject to rearrest and reprosecution by the commonwealth.order enforcing judgment.moving on to the matter of the barber interview,the court determined that extraordinary circumstances had been shown warranting a bar to wolfe retrial.more specifically,the court found that the barber interview incurably frustrated the entire purpose of the federal habeas corpus proceedings,and permanently crystalized the constitutional violations infecting wolfe trial,causing barber to be legally unavailable to testify in a retrial.id.at.
consequently,the district court ordered wolfe release within ten days and barred the commonwealth from reprosecuting wolfe on the original charges or any other charges stemming from the death of danny petrole which requires the testimony of owen barber in any form.order enforcing judgment.the commonwealth immediately appealed,moving to stay the order enforcing judgment.on january,the district court denied the commonwealth request for a stay pending appeal.later that same day,however,on the commonwealth motion,we entered our own stay and expedited this appeal.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to and a 
we potentially face two rather significant issues.first,we must assess whether the commonwealth complied with the relief order.if the commonwealth failed to do so,we must then decide whether the district court abused its discretion in barring wolfe retrial.
on the first issue,we review a district court interpretation of its own orders for abuse of discretion.home port rentals,ruben,cir.in that regard,we are obliged to accord substantial deference to a district court interpretation of its own judgment.abt.prods.union fire ins,cir.indeed,to sustain appellate review,district courts need only adopt a reasonable construction of the terms contained in their orders.jth tax,h r block tax,cir.
if the commonwealth falls short on the compliance issue,our review of the district court bar to wolfe retrial is also for abuse of discretion.bagley,cir.where applicable,congress has directed the courts to dispose of habeas corpus petitions as law and justice require.congress directive constitutes,in a proper case,an authorization to adjust the scope of the writ in accordance with equitable and prudential considerations.danforth minnesota.because habeas corpus is,at its core,an equitable remedy,a district court is vested with substantial discretion to appropriately redress any violation of an order granting habeas corpus relief.schlup.delo.
in view of the foregoing recitation,we turn first to the commonwealth assertion that it complied with the district court relief order,which required that wolfe be retried or released within days.those contentions that wolfe was both released and retried were considered and rejected in the order enforcing judgment.the court rulings were predicated primarily on its explanation of its intentions with respect to the relief order and the stay order.as explained below,the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the commonwealth neglected to satisfy either compliance option.
at the threshold,the commonwealth position that wolfe has been both released and retried fails to pass muster.by specifying the compliance options in the disjunctive,the district court presented the commonwealth with a choice it could either provide wolfe with a new trial or unconditionally release him from custody.the commonwealth asserts on appeal,rather counterintuitively,that it has satisfied both options.
first,the commonwealth maintains that,at least since wolfe september,bond hearing,his status is that of a pretrial defendant who has been denied bond.the commonwealth thus posits that wolfe was unconditionally released.the commonwealth theory fails to take into account the purpose of a contingency in the habeas setting,which is to delay actual release of the successful petitioner,thus permitting the state authorities to remedy the constitutional defects and retain the petitioner in confinement.see hilton braunskill,t his court has repeatedly stated that federal courts may delay the release of a successful habeas petitioner in order to provide the state an opportunity to correct the constitutional violation found by the court.
by its relief order,the district court did not direct wolfe immediate release.it instead accorded the commonwealth the options of retrying wolfe within days or unconditionally releasing him.an evaluation of whether the commonwealth has complied with either directive requires an interpretation of the court prior orders,the best source for which is the court itself.as it explained,
i n presenting the option of releasing the petitioner unconditionally from custody,the court used the word unconditionally in its traditional and widely underst ood context not limited by a condition not depending on an uncertain event or contingency absolute.black law dictionary ed.under this meaning of the word unconditional,it is that releasing petitioner from the custody of the virginia department of corrections to prince william county for the purposes of retrial did not constitute releasing petitioner unconditionally from custody.
order enforcing judgment.
the foregoing explanation is not an unreasonable one,and we are unable to disturb it.a commonsense reading of the relief order is that it obliged the commonwealth to either release or retry wolfe within days.because wolfe has not been unconditionally released,we turn to the second compliance option and gauge whether wolfe has been retried 
the commonwealth other option for compliance with the relief order was to provide wolfe with a new trial within onehundred and twenty days of the date of the order.relief order.the commonwealth insists that it was not obliged to actually complete a retrial within days.that is,it was not necessary for a verdict to be returned in the state court,or even that a jury be selected,so long as proceedings leading to a retrial had commenced in the circuit court.in this regard,the commonwealth emphasizes that the circuit court had conducted a bond hearing on september,and that other pretrial proceedings such as motions to dismiss the indictments and disqualify the prosecutor were ongoing until the order enforcing judgment was entered.the commonwealth thus maintains that its obligation to provide wolfe with a new trial was thereby satisfied.in the alternative,the commonwealth suggests that the day retrial period did not begin to run until the issuance of our mandate in wolfe ii,on september.
each of the foregoing contentions were considered and rejected by the district court,predicated on its interpretations of the orders on appeal.with regard to whether the day retrial period ran from the issuance of our mandate,the court explained that 
the stay entered on november,pending the commonwealth appeal of the court amended judgment paused or halted the day deadline imposed by the court to provide wolfe a new trial.when that stay was lifted on september,the deadline clock resumed where it left off when the stay was granted and there were days remaining.on saturday,october,the days given to the commonwealth to provide wolfe with a new trial expired.because the deadline fell on a weekend,the deadline for retrial moved to monday,october.
order enforcing judgment in response to the second contention,that the obligation to provide wolfe with a new trial was satisfied by the commencement and conduct of pretrial proceedings in the circuit court,the order enforcing judgment specified that the retrial had to be completed and not merely commenced within the prescribed period.more precisely,the court explained that 
it was certainly the objective of the court in issuing the relief order that wolfe would be either promptly retried or relieved of the strictures imposed by his constitutionally flawed conviction and it was certainly the intention of the court that in providing wolfe a new trial within days,said trial actually occur within that period of time.
id.at quotation marks and alterations omitted.
the commonwealth complains that,evaluated together,the district court interpretation of its prior directives left the prosecution,after the wolfe ii mandate,with only days to complete a capital murder trial.according to the commonwealth,the order enforcing judgment was a prejudicial,revisionist rewording of the judgment.br.of appellant.that characterization fails to recognize that,in the referenced order,the district court explained the meaning of its earlier orders as intended upon entry,without regard for events.it was the commonwealth that sought and now seeks from this court a recasting of the district court rulings on the basis of subsequent procedural developments.see capps sullivan,cir remanding for district court to give effect to its original understanding of the order granting habeas relief emphasis added.
notwithstanding the foregoing,the commonwealth may well be correct that completing a retrial of a complex death penalty case within days was a practical impossibility.indeed,that fact alone may have been sufficient to justify an extension of the retrial period.the commonwealth did not,however,return to court seeking either a clarification or an extension.
we also recognize that the district court explanation of its day period was a highly restrictive one,and that,in the absence of a thorough explanation,the court construction of that directive could be viewed as erroneous.by way of example,the court counted against the commonwealth an aggregate of days during the pendency of the wolfe ii appeal.that is,the period from the august,relief order through the november,stay order was counted against the day retrial period,notwithstanding the commonwealth timely filing,on september,of its second notice of appeal.furthermore,the district court did not consider that the circuit court,subsequent to the wolfe ii mandate,spent a substantial period of time addressing motions interposed by wolfe.even the federal speedy trial act,which the district court administers on a regular basis,excludes such periods of time.see h excluding from speedy trial calculations,inter alia,delay resulting from any pretrial motion.
additionally,before concluding that the commonwealth had failed to comply with the relief order,the district court acknowledged that there is a lack of clear controlling case law on a number of issues.order enforcing judgment.in these circumstances,we are obliged to provide a modicum of clarity when a district court awards habeas relief,it is preferable that its order include language ensuring that the respondent will suffer no prejudice by exercising its right of appeal.see,tice johnson,cv,the writ of habeas corpus will be granted if the commonwealth of virginia does not commence the retrial within days of the date of entry of this judgment should appeal not be taken,or within days after the final resolution of any appeal including a petition for a writ of certiorari if an appeal is taken.
at this stage of these proceedings,however,with the commonwealth having foregone any opportunity to obtain clarification from this court or the district court,it can hardly claim surprise furthermore,the district court has explained its intentions with respect to the relief order and the stay order,and we are inclined to credit those explanations.because the commonwealth failed to either retry or release wolfe within days,we turn to the remedy for that transgression.
the commonwealth contends that the district court abused its discretion in barring wolfe retrial.though we reiterate that a federal habeas court possesses substantial discretion in fashioning an appropriate remedy,preventing the retrial of a state criminal case is the strongest of medicine.and it is a measure that should be utilized with the utmost restraint,only in the most extraordinary of circumstances.see gilliam foster,cir en banc equitable federal court interference with ongoing state criminal proceedings should be undertaken in only the most limited,narrow,and circumscribed situations.such limited and narrow circumstances are simply not present here.we are therefore constrained to conclude,as explained below,that the district court abused its discretion in barring wolfe retrial.
in support of its chosen remedy,the district court correctly recognized that the award of an unconditional writ does not,in and of itself,preclude the authorities from rearresting and retrying a successful habeas petitioner.as the court acknowledged,
i t is generally recognized that a violation of a court directive to retry a habeas petitioner within a certain amount of time would permit the court to order the prisoner release,however,the granting of an unconditional writ in this circumstance will not,itself,generally preclude the government from rearresting and retrying the prisoner.
order enforcing judgment quoting federal habeas manual may.the court,however,identified an exception to the general rule,namely,that in extraordinary circumstances a habeas court may forbid reprosecution.id.citing satterlee wolfenbarger,cir.
in detecting the presence of extraordinary circumstances here,the district court explained that the conduct of the prosecutors in particular,their conduct during the september,barber interview sp oke to a continuing pattern of violating wolfe right to use brady and giglio evidence,which the court attempted to remedy through its habeas decree.order enforcing judgment.at the core of the court analysis was its belief that the prosecutors had incurably frustrated the entire purpose of habeas corpus and had permanently crystalized the constitutional violations by scar ing barber into invoking his fifth amendment right to avoid.id.at.
the district court conclusion concerning the availability of barber testimony at a retrial,however,is speculative.as an initial matter,barber could decide on his own to testify,and based on his track record such evidence might provide support for either side and,under a proper grant of immunity,barber testimony may well be compelled.see kastigar united states,holding that fifth amendment privilege may be supplanted and witness compelled to testify by proper grant of immunity.alternatively,the state trial court,by way of example,could determine that a waiver of barber fifth amendment privilege has already been made it could authorize the evidentiary use of barber prior statements in one form or another or it might craft any number of other remedies.put simply,the task of conducting wolfe retrial is for the state trial court,and it is not for us to express a view on how that court should manage its affairs.we are confident that the retrial will be properly handled,and,if convictions result,that the appellate courts will perform their duties.
the district court also speculated that the barber interview served to deprive wolfe defense of a credible trial witness,and thereby abridged wolfe due process rights.see order enforcing judgment citing united states saunders,cir improper intimidation of a witness may violate a defendant due process right to present his defense witnesses freely if the intimidation amounts to substantial government interference with a defense witness free and unhampered choice to testify.internal quotation marks omitted.like other constitutional issues that may arise in a retrial,however,contentions relating to barber alleged intimidation by the prosecutors are yet to be exhausted in the state court system.see pitchess davis,alleged brady violation subject to state court exhaustion.indeed,wolfe has already raised that precise issue before the circuit court in his ii motion to dismiss the indictments.by barring wolfe retrial,the district court has deprived the circuit court of the opportunity to address that motion.notably,in the event wolfe is acquitted,any such issues would be moot.and,should wolfe be again convicted,the state court system might vindicate him on appeal.failing that,wolfe due process claim with respect to the barber interview could,at the proper time,constitute a separate ground for federal habeas corpus relief.
at the end of the day,any scenario presenting circumstances sufficiently extraordinary to warrant federal interference with a state reprosecution of a successful petitioner will be extremely rare,and will ordinarily be limited to situations where a recognized constitutional error can not be remedied by a new trial.see,blackledge perry,holding that vindictive prosecution could contravene due process and justify bar to retrial barker wingo,concluding that dismissal may be appropriate remedy for sixth amendment speedy trial violation gilliam,at barring state retrial on double jeopardy grounds 
put succinctly,the constitutional claims for which wolfe was awarded habeas corpus relief are readily capable of being remedied in a new trial.our resolution of the wolfe ii appeal never contemplated the possibility of a retrial bar,and we expected a trial if that option were pursued to occur within a reasonable time.the resolution of criminal proceedings on their merits,before the public eye,is of critical importance to our system of justice.and it has long been settled that a n indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury,if valid on its face,is enough to call for trial of the charge s on the ir merits.costello united states,footnote omitted.we emphasize,however,that wolfe,like any accused as well as the commonwealth is entitled to a fair trial.that very proposition is what the wolfe ii decision is all about.as has been emphasized,a murder trial indeed any criminal proceeding is not a sporting event.giles maryland,fortas,concurring.
the district court,in its order enforcing judgment,relied on decisions where a bar to retrial was approved even though the constitutional errors could have been thereby remedied.see satterlee,at barring retrial deemed appropriate when the state inexcusably,repeatedly,or otherwise abusively fails to act within the prescribed time period or if the state delay is likely to prejudice the petitioner ability to mount a defense at trial internal quotation marks omitted capps,at barring retrial appropriate where state neither retried petitioner nor sought stay of habeas writ.although we do not exclude the possibility that a federal habeas court in an extremely rare and unique circumstance might proscribe a state court retrial even though the constitutional violation could be thereby remedied,we are unwilling to embrace the principles of capps or satterlee.in the absence of extraordinary circumstances,the proper disposition is generally,as the district court recognized,the release of a successful habeas petitioner,subject to rearrest and retrial 
here,of course,the district court was correct to order wolfe release on the original charges,though such action did not actually free him from custody.as we have explained,wolfe is facing multiple indictments in prince william county,and he has been rearrested and denied bail.all that remains to effect wolfe release in compliance with the alternatives contemplated by our wolfe ii decision and by the district court in its grant of relief is for the commonwealth to expunge wolfe criminal convictions and to take any and all additional steps necessary to nullify any material adverse legal consequences attendant to those convictions.subsequent to or contemporaneously therewith,the commonwealth may retry wolfe on the original charges together with the new charges,in accordance with such plan and schedule that the state circuit court may devise.
pursuant to the foregoing,we vacate the district court order enforcing judgment and remand with instructions that the court enter a substitute order directing that wolfe be released from the custody imposed as the result of his convictions,and,further,that those convictions be expunged and their legal effects nullified consistently with wolfe ii and this opinion.the order on remand shall be without prejudice to a retrial of the original charges against wolfe,and it shall not preclude the conduct of such other and further proceedings in the state or federal courts as may be appropriate.
vacated and remanded 
i agree with the majority conclusion that the commonwealth failed to satisfy the terms of the district court conditional writ in this case,as set forth in part.of the majority opinion.i can not,however,agree with its conclusion that the district court abused its discretion in barring of justin wolfe an appropriate remedy in my view,in light of the commonwealth continued misconduct and resulting threat to justin wolfe constitutional right to a fair trial.
the majority does not exclude the possibility that a federal habeas court in an extremely rare and unique circumstance might proscribe a state court retrial even though the constitutional violation could be thereby remedied,but it is unwilling to embrace that principle in this case.ante at emphasis added.i am willing to do so in fact,for the reasons that follow,the extremely rare and unique circumstances of this case command a bar on.the commonwealth misconduct has continued far too long,and the cumulative misconduct permeating this case has tainted it in such a way that it is doubtful wolfe will receive a fair and just trial.enough is enough.
accordingly,and for the reasons set forth herein,i dissent as to part.
the supreme court of the united states has stated,simply and repeatedly,t he role of a prosecutor is to see that justice is done.connick thompson.it is as much a prosecutor duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.berger united states.
mindful of this court admonishment,federal court equitable interference with state criminal proceedings should not be undertaken except in the most narrow and extraordinary of circumstances,gilliam foster,cir en banc citing younger harris,i nonetheless can not ignore the ways in which the commonwealth misconduct has hindered rather than fostered justice throughout the course of this case.although the extraordinary circumstances exception is narrow,this case wherein the commonwealth conduct has been appalling fits squarely into that narrow space.
i begin with the elementary propositions that habeas corpus is,at its core,an equitable remedy,schlup delo,and a district court has broad discretion to dispose of habeas corpus matters as law and justice require,hilton braunskill,quoting.see also irvin dowd.for these reasons,our review of a district court decision to bar is circumscribed.see bagley,cir stating that a district court decision to bar would be reviewed for abuse of discretion.

as the majority notes,see ante at,the extraordinary circumstances exception has traditionally surfaced in cases in which a constitutional violation can not be remedied by a new trial.see,gilliam,at would contravene the double jeopardy clause solem bartlett,state court lacked jurisdiction over the prosecution smith goguen,petitioner was convicted under an unconstitutional statute strunk united states,would violate petitioner right to a speedy trial.
but some courts have also found the remedy appropriate in cases in which other exceptional circumstances exist such that the holding of a new trial would be unjust.capps sullivan,cir.these courts have relied on circumstances that demand equitable relief,even if those circumstances present constitutional violations that could be remedied upon retrial.for example,in satterlee wolfenbarger,the sixth circuit held that a district court may forbid reprosecution where the state inexcusably,repeatedly,or otherwise abusively fails to act within the prescribed time period,or the state delay is likely to prejudice the petitioner ability to mount a defense at trial,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.see also wiggins estelle,cir suggesting petitioner should forever be set free if delay denied petitioner due process,rev on other grounds,mckaskle wiggins,united states ex rel.schuster vincent,cir ordering a habeas petitioner immediate release and absolute discharge where he had been confined in a state hospital for over years without the opportunity for a commitment hearing and had been in prison for a total of years garcia portuondo,d,a court may bar retrial,even if the constitutional violation is capable of correction,where the petitioner has served an extended and potentially unjustifiable period of incarceration before the writ was granted.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted morales portuondo,d.barring retrial where the evidence strongly suggests that the petitioners are innocent,their ability to defend against the charges in any new trial has been hampered by unavailability of witnesses because of the state delay,and they have served extended and potentially unjustified periods of incarceration internal quotation marks omitted.
whether circumstances are extraordinary enough to bar reprosecution is a determination,left to the sound discretion of the district court.see foster lockhart,cir a district court has authority to preclude a state from retrying a successful habeas petitioner when the court deems that remedy appropriate.in this case,i do not agree that the district court abused that discretion i am not as confident as the majority that the commonwealth brady and giglio violations and subsequent misconduct can be remedied in a new trial.but even assuming they can be,the circumstances at hand are extraordinary enough to demand equitable relief in the form of a bar on.
the district court remedy was set forth in the order enforcing judgment as follows 
the commonwealth,having violated the court conditional writ of habeas corpus by failing to within and twenty days of the date of this order,provide petitioner with a new trial,or release him unconditionally from custody,it is ordered that the commonwealth of virginia release petitioner unconditionally,free of all criminal proceedings on the charge of murder for hire of danny petrole and the drug charges that were previously tried in state court by the commonwealth,within ten days of the entry of this order.
it is further ordered that the commonwealth of virginia is hereby barred from reprosecuting the petitioner on the charges originally tried herein in state court or any other charges stemming from death of danny petrole which requires the testimony of owen barber in any form.
the district court explained,
as a starting point,the court fully concedes that had the content of the petitioner motion to enforce judgment been strictly limited to the commonwealth violation of the deadline set in this case,the question of the appropriate remedy would be an easy one.the court would order wolfe release,but he would be subject to rearrest and reprosecution by the commonwealth.however,the reality of this case is very different than that of the ordinary case which constrains the court to extraordinary remedies.

the commonwealth withheld impeachment evidence,including information relating to a deal the commonwealth made with its witness martin in exchange for his cooperation,see id.at 
the commonwealth withheld a recorded statement made by its witness chad hough that conflicted with his trial testimony,see id.at 
the commonwealth withheld evidence which could have allowed wolfe to present an alternate theory of the petrole murder various reports and witness statements relating to a parallel drug investigation that indicated conflict in petrole drug business unrelated to wolfe purported motive for having petrole murdered evidence that petrole was rumored to be a government informant,constituting yet another possible motive for his murder and the statements of three witnesses that they saw a second car at the crime scene shortly after the petrole murder,see id.at,
when questioned why his office does not have an policy,a commonwealth prosecutor offered the flabbergasting explanation that he has found in the past when you have information that is given to certain counsel and certain defendants,they are able to fabricate a defense around what is provided.wolfe ii,at.thus,in wolfe ii,we found that the suppression of the newsome report as well as other apparent brady materials,was entirely intentional,
the district court found,t he prosecutors choreographed and coordinated witness testimony through a series of joint meetings with owen barber and martin,owen barber and jennifer pascquierllo and jason coleman and chad hough.wolfe,d at.further,the prosecutors did not provide any reference to or information regarding the joint meetings with witnesses in their written brady disclosure,see 
sergeant pass,lead officer of the drug investigation relating to wolfe and petrole,submitted reports outlining the investigation of petrole and others drug activities to both the prosecutors and homicide investigators.conway did not review all of the reports dealing with the drug investigation and he did not provide them to petitioner,id.citation omitted 
the commonwealth used owen barber trial testimony despite being on notice that it contained falsities,id.at emphasis supplied 
in attempting to circumvent the district court mandate that the retrial occur within days or wolfe be released unconditionally,the commonwealth assured the state court that the federal court expressly allows the commonwealth days from september,in which to institute retrial proceedings,see also ante at.
the gravity of this list is startling,but the pattern of misconduct does not end there it reached its pinnacle on september,when detective newsome and prince william county prosecutors richard conway and paul ebert the original prosecuting team visited barber in jail the september jail visit and attempted to coerce barber to repeat his trial testimony upon retrial the same testimony that the district court found contained falsities.wolfe,d at not only was the commonwealth in possession of information that would have revealed falsities in barber testimony at the time of the trial,it also knew that suppressing that information would result in denying petitioner an opportunity to craft a defense based on the information.
this time,however,barber had enough.the district court explained,
as barber counsel testimony indicated during this court december,hearing,barber,under advice of counsel and in consideration of the original prosecuting team,conversation,has now invoked his fifth amendment privilege,which the prince william county circuit judge authorized.as indicated by barber counsel,barber intends to continue to invoke his fifth amendment privilege at wolfe retrial,absent the granting of immunity.
citations omitted.thus,by threatening and intimidating barber whose most recent and credited testimony was that wolfe had nothing to do with petrole murder into invoking the fifth amendment,the commonwealth has once again deprived wolfe of potentially exculpatory evidence.this is a circumstance that,even if somehow the constitutional violations can be remedied upon retrial,is extraordinary enough such that the holding of a new trial would be unjust.capps,at.
in fashioning its remedy to bar,the district court relied heavily upon the actions of the original prosecuting team during the september jail visit,so it is important to put the visit in context.this court wolfe ii opinion was published on august,and the mandate issued on friday,september.our wolfe ii opinion roundly chastised the original prosecuting team for its failure to disclose exculpatory evidence and for taint ing evidence by its prosecutorial misconduct.wolfe ii,at.at that point,the commonwealth was well on notice that a change in the prosecution team would be necessary to avoid any continued improprieties.
yet,the day before a meeting with wolfe counsel scheduled for wednesday,september,the original prosecuting team traveled to the augusta correctional center and met with barber,who was unassisted by counsel.the encounter was recorded without barber knowledge.the commonwealth states that the original prosecuting team visited barber in preparation for the retrial,and maintains,ebert was permitted,even required,to talk to barber to see which of his many stories he intended to tell at the retrial.resp t br.
ebert received his answer within the first five minutes of the interview ebert what might be your testimony if we were to call you this time upon retrial barber i guess it have to be what was in the federal court.barber was referring to the testimony he gave at the district court evidentiary hearing in november,where he reconfirmed that wolfe was not involved in the murder of danny petrole,did not hire barber to kill danny petrole and did not have anything to do with the murder of danny petrole.wolfe johnson,cv,docket at tr,see also wolfe,d at.crucially,the district court found barber demeanor and candor persuasive at the federal evidentiary hearing.wolfe,d at.
nonetheless,the questioning did not stop there.instead,because this was not the answer the commonwealth wanted,they proceeded to interrogate,intimidate,and threaten barber for over an hour,but at no point did barber relent.
i am compelled to repeat some of the tactics used by the commonwealth and statements made to barber at the september jail visit 
conway paraphrased the holding in the supreme court case ricketts adamson,explaining that a government witness who breached a plea agreement by failing to testify truthfully against other parties was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death.conway asked,nobody,none of these people,wolfe attorneys ever told you that by breaching the plea agreement you could be tried again also for the murder i had thought it was pretty deceptive really for these people to be coming here and talking to you as if perjury was the only thing you had to worry about.
detective newsome you know,sometimes you may feel like well,if i going down,there no need to take wolfe with me.so i just tell this lie to make it easier on him.and i saying this may come from the heart in an effort to do good,to try and do good,and say well even though you may know he guilty,i just going to say this because it will make his life easier.why should somebody else suffer also i will take the brunt of this.but justice does work like that.and nor does god work like that.we are held accountable for our actions.scripture tells us to obey the laws of the land.we have an obligation to do that.and our obligation before anything else is to be righteous and truthful in our practices and in what we do.and we told in scripture also that those with authority over us are put there by holy mandate.so we have an obligation to respect the courts,to respect the process and to do what right.and we do not have the moral ability to arbitrarily protect those who are guilty,who are held accountable.id.at emphasis supplied.
conway it does matter what the victim family thinks about now because we gotten somebody off of death row so it a victory and the lord will forgive us for that.but let me tell you something,i do know i do know if the lord all that forgiving or not.id.at.
conway i not trying to trick you or anything,but do you remember what you answered when you were asked why you killed petrole barber no.what did i say conway do you know why you do remember because it was the truth.id.at.
detective newsome you know,what conway said about do you think if you told the truth that you could convince somebody that it the truth but this is something that you and you alone can have an impact on and it has to come from in there.and that is a plausible and truthful explanation for those multitude of changes.a plausible and truthful explanation of why you told the truth in the initial trial,you told the truth in letters,but in these affidavits,why you changed.it has to be truthful and plausible.id.at.
conway you know what the truth is,owen.it something that we should have ingrained in you more,i guess,back then.we thought we had.id.at.
conway so you need to really search your sole sic and if we full of shit and justin wolfe did have anything to do with all this,you should tell us that right this minute and tell us to get out because you did it all on your own and he never had a thing to do with it.but if you you believe in yourself and you believe in the truth and that you believe that from now on nothing but the truth will ever escape your lips,then i think that different.id.at.
ebert one more thing i want you to think about,what do you think your mother would want you to do id.at.barber mother died of cancer a year before barber killed petrole,and the original prosecuting team knew this fact because they read aloud a previous statement of barber,which said,i had just lost my mother the year before petrole death after cancer was slowly eating her away,id.at.
the very next day,on september,conway and ebert filed an ex parte motion to recuse themselves and were replaced on september by a fairfax county commonwealth prosecutor.the timing of this action is highly suspect,as it suggests that,rather than working diligently to comply with the district court mandate that wolfe be released or retried within days,the original prosecuting team made a effort to intimidate barber into implicating wolfe once and for all,and then,when their plans failed,the prosecutors immediately filed a motion to recuse themselves 
considering this cumulative evidence of misconduct,culminating in the commonwealth urging barber to reiterate testimony that contained falsities,and his resulting intention to invoke his fifth amendment privilege,i simply can not join the majority independent finding that this is not an extremely rare situation worthy of a bar on.ante at.woe is the state of justice in the commonwealth if this behavior is not extremely rare.
the majority makes the point that barber may very well not end up invoking his fifth amendment privilege,and if he does testify,his testimony could benefit either side.see ante at.however,in my opinion,this misses the point.the september jail visit,resulting in barber threat of silence,was not an anomaly it permanently crystalized the misconduct of the original prosecuting team,as the district court explained,
in the absence of the discovery violations in the state trial,the original prosecuting team actions on september,might appear to be benign.however,in context,they speak to a continuing pattern of violating petitioner sic right to use brady and giglio evidence,which the court attempted to remedy through its habeas decree.
as it stands,the only witness directly linking wolfe to the death of petrole barber has now recanted and,as a result,has been sought out and harassed by the commonwealth attorneys to the extent he is now chilled from testifying.in fact,in december,barber attorney testified in district court that,upon his advice,barber has already invoked his fifth amendment privilege in state court,and based on the contents of th e tape from the september jail visit,my advice will not change about whether barber should testify at trial unless there a new development.
but even if barber decides to forego the privilege,his testimony will be forever shadowed by the manipulative actions of the original prosecuting team the commonwealth threatened barber with being charged with capital murder for breaching his plea agreement and raised the specters of god and barber deceased mother in attempt to coerce him into testifying to the truth,the commonwealth moniker for its version of the facts.see.it is the commonwealth alone that now holds the fate of the crucial barber testimony and thus,wolfe fate in its grip.they alone can grant immunity or not in order to compel barber testimony yet,it is clear from the actions and statements of the commonwealth prosecutors that the only testimony they are interested in compelling is that which would implicate wolfe.
the misconduct of the original prosecuting team has tainted this case to the extent that wolfe due process rights are all but obliterated.in this case,with its protracted and eventful history,ante at,not only do we have inexcusable delay as set forth in satterlee,garcia,and morales caused by the commonwealth withholding of brady and giglio evidence and its with the district court day deadline but we also have the grievous instances of prosecutorial misconduct to boot.wolfe has been in prison for twelve years,despite the fact that the evidence linking him to petrole murder is weak,and he will now likely be deprived of live testimony from the only direct witness to the crime for which he is sitting on death row testimony that may very well exculpate him.thus,the district court was not arbitrary or irrational,did not ignore constraints on its discretion,and did not commit factual or legal error in stopping this loathsome spectacle once and for all.see united states wilson,cir 
in sum,the district court possessing jurisdiction to remedy the constitutional violations that occurred over the past twelve years and armed with the authority to enforc e its conditional grant of a writ of habeas corpus,gentry deuth,cir disposed of this matter as law and justice require d,and did not abuse its discretion in barring of justin wolfe.i would affirm the district court remedy and thus,respectfully dissent as to part.of the majority opinion.
i repeat the words of our supreme court,it is as much a prosecutor duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.berger united states.even detective newsome recognized that the commonwealth ha s an obligation to respect the courts,to respect the process and to do what right.if only the commonwealth had practiced what it preached.
