monroe testified at trial to the details of the crimes pursuant to a plea agreement with the prosecutor.he stated that he,hubbard,and banks met at his residence where they discussed robbing,that he assumed hubbard had a gun because he observed a bulge in hubbard front,that hubbard showed him a gold watch to sell to,and that,at hubbard direction,banks drove to.when they arrived,hubbard handed the gold watch,pulled his revolver and,when reached for his own gun,hubbard shot in his face.hubbard and banks returned to their vehicle and monroe ran home.

the jury found hubbard guilty of felony murder and robbery,and not guilty of the handgun possession charges.on july,the state court sentenced hubbard to life imprisonment with a parole ineligibility on the felony murder charge,and a concurrent term on the robbery count.
there was no testimony linking any gun,putatively the murder weapon,to hubbard and no forensic evidence linking him to the victim or the scene of the crime.hubbard had filed a bill of alibi particulars before the grand jury charged him in which he stated he was in atlantic city,new jersey on the night of the crime,which took place in camden,new jersey.
procedural history 
this matter has traveled up and down the state courts of new jersey,and it is unnecessary to recount the full details here.we will limit the facts to the proceedings necessary to decide this appeal from the district court order denying hubbard petition for a writ of habeas corpus.hubbard filed two separate petitions for relief pcr in the state first in august,and the second in may.both were dismissed as untimely,and therefore were procedurally barred by new jersey state law.although the appellate division of the new jersey superior court agreed that the claims raised in hubbard second pcr petition were time barred,it nevertheless stated that it carefully reviewed each of the seven claims and is satisfied that there is no basis to grant hubbard relief.at.
on july,hubbard filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus relief in the district court,raising seven claims that he had set forth in his second pcr petition.they are 
that the indictment against him was based on the perjurious testimony of the arresting detective before the grand jury that his sentence does not comply with new jersey sentencing criteria that the trial court improperly deprived him of his right to one of the state witnesses that the police violated his fifth amendment right to counsel by ignoring his request for an attorney during custodial interrogation that the trial court gave a prejudicial supplemental jury instruction on the law of accomplices that the trial court improperly admitted certain photographs into evidence and that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance.
the district court dismissed two of the grounds raised by hubbard for substantive reasons and they are not at issue in this appeal.the district court denied the requested writ of habeas corpus on the five other claims because of hubbard procedural default,stating,petitioner has not argued that he is innocent of the crime for which the jury convicted him,at,and concluded,not having shown cause for his procedural default below or actual innocence of the crimes for which he was convicted,grounds one,three,four,six and seven of petitioner habeas corpus petition are not cognizable in this court.at.
hubbard then filed a pro se motion of reconsideration of the district court denial of habeas relief.in response to this motion,the district court held that although the motion for reconsideration was timely filed,
petitioner does not raise any factual or legal point overlooked by this court.petitioner challenges this court statement that he did not raise actual innocence as an issue in his petition,but offers no evidence that he did raise such an issue without procedural default,and also offers no evidence that he is actually innocent for the charges he is presently incarcerated for.hubbard petition was denied on the five relevant grounds due to procedural default,so even if he had demonstrated some issue of actual innocence here,it would not have changed this court earlier denial of his application.
at emphasis added.
we issued a certificate of appealability on the issue whether the district court properly rejected appellant attempt to overcome the procedural default of claims,and by asserting his actual innocence.appellant br.at.we have jurisdiction to review the denial of the habeas writ under.
discussion 
the state contends that hubbard allegation of actual innocence is not properly before this court because it appeared f or the first time in his motion for reconsideration of the d istrict c ourt opinion.appellee br.at 
hubbard motion for reconsideration as well as his habeas petition were filed pro se.we have previously stated that a petitioner 
failure to specifically articulate his claim as one of actual innocence should not preclude review of the merits of his claim.the petitioner clearly argued that the government could not satisfy the factual prerequisites of a conviction.when properly viewed through the more forgiving lens used to construe pro se habeas petitions,we conclude that the claim of actual innocence was properly before the district court.

this case presents a similar situation.among the grounds hubbard raised in his habeas petition were ineffective trial counsel who did nothing in his defense and that the whole trial was a mockery.at.in response to the state claim of the procedural bars,hubbard stated that f ederal review is necessary to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice,and that there was a reasonable probability that but for counsel unprofessional errors the results of the proceedings would have been different.at.
when viewed through a more forgiving lens that does not require petitioners to specifically articulate claims of actual innocence,garth,at,this language in the pro se petition and traverse was sufficient to preserve hubbard actual innocence claim.in fact,he pled not guilty,and he filed a bill of alibi particulars placing him in atlantic city at the moment of the crime,which occurred
