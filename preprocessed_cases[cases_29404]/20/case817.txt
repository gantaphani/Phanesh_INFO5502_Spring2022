opinion of the court 
petitioner edward duncan appeals from the order of the district court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.he argues that the court should have granted the writ because trial counsel had a conflict of interest and was otherwise ineffective.he also contends the trial court gave an erroneous accomplice charge which infected the entire trial.the issues raised and the procedural posture in which they reach us can be placed in context following a brief review of the facts.
duncan,anthony norman,douglas sherman,caldwell moody caldwell,and clarence moody clarence were at the moody brothers apartment in newark,new jersey on february,when robert henderson and norris holmes arrived outside the building and honked the automobile horn.duncan asked caldwell to go out and send henderson,with whom norman apparently had a monetary dispute,up to the apartment.when henderson arrived at the apartment,accompanied by holmes,they sensed a threat and fled,jumping through the building glass door to escape.duncan and norman pursued them,holding guns.shots were fired,henderson sustained a hand injury,and holmes was killed by a single bullet shot.duncan and norman fled.
duncan was arrested on march.after waiving his miranda rights,he gave a voluntary statement in which he admitted that he was present at the moodys apartment on the night of february.he placed the responsibility of the shooting on norman,describing the events as follows norman had identified henderson as having previously robbed him,and when henderson drove up,accompanied by holmes,duncan directed caldwell to get him and told norman not to do anything.however,when henderson and holmes reached the apartment,norman jumped at them with a gun and chased them down the stairs.duncan then grabbed his gun and followed but the three others were already outside when he arrived downstairs and heard two gunshots.norman told duncan that he had shot holmes in the leg.seeing holmes on the ground,duncan led norman inside and they left through the building rear exit.later,duncan returned the gun to cully,who had given him the gun because duncan watched over cully drug money.
norman was arrested on march,and he also made a voluntary statement.he claimed that both he and duncan collected money for cully,a drug dealer,and had been looking for henderson on the night of february to avenge a robbery.when henderson and holmes drove up outside the apartment,duncan sent caldwell to get them.then,norman stated,both he and duncan waited for them with guns,chased them down the stairs,and shot at them.when they saw holmes injured on the ground,they fled through the building back exit,and duncan got rid of the guns by returning them to cully who had provided them to duncan.his version did not identify which shooter actually killed holmes.
state court proceedings 
duncan,norman,sherman,and caldwell were indicted for the purposeful or knowing murder of holmes,aggravated assault on henderson,and two offenses.duncan hired attorney richard roberts to represent him,agreeing to pay the lawyer from his bail.duncan told roberts that norman also needed an attorney,and roberts recommended michael pedicini.although roberts and pedicini and two other lawyers shared office space at the time,they were not officially partners and each had his own secretary,phone,and trust and expense accounts.when norman retained pedicini,the two attorneys agreed to split duncan bail money evenly.
the trial court severed the defendants cases for trial.norman was tried from february to,represented by pedicini,and was convicted of holmes murder,aggravated assault on henderson,and the two counts of gun possession.on april,duncan went to trial represented by roberts,who introduced himself to the jury as richard roberts,from the firm of roberts,pedicini and fielo.at.
at duncan trial,the prosecution called five witnesses,none of whom testified to witnessing the shooting.clarence,the only witness present when holmes was killed,recounted a confrontation between norman and henderson hours before holmes death and detailed the events in the moody apartment before and after the shooting.clarence testimony portrayed duncan as having a certain amount of authority over the group at the apartment.for example,he stated that duncan had sent norman to summon the moody brothers back to their apartment after norman confrontation with henderson,instructed caldwell to bring henderson up to the apartment after norman identified henderson for duncan,and told sherman to get out guns while waiting for henderson to arrive.clarence also testified that duncan took a gun himself,gave a gun to norman,hid behind the apartment door,confronted henderson when he arrived,and,with norman,chased henderson and holmes.
detective jack eutsey,who had interviewed duncan after his arrest,described the encounter and read duncan statement to the jury.phito,the forensic pathologist who had performed holmes autopsy,described the cause of death internal bleeding from a single gunshot wound.officer robert purcell,who had responded to the shooting,described the scene and identified two bullets found there.finally,detective frank racioppi,the county investigator,detailed his efforts to find henderson,a subpoenaed witness who failed to appear at the trial.after the state case,the trial judge dismissed the assault charge because the state had not met its burden of proof,but denied roberts motion for acquittal of the murder charge.
although duncan statement was admitted into evidence and read as part of detective eutsey testimony,duncan himself did not testify at trial.nor did roberts call any witnesses on behalf of the defense.in his closing,roberts acknowledged that duncan possessed a gun on the night in question and told the jury it should return a guilty verdict as to gun possession,but kept emphasizing that the state had not met its burden of proof on the other charges.he attacked clarence credibility,and urged the jury to acquit duncan of the murder charge.the prosecutor,in turn,conceded he did not know whether duncan or norman had fired the fatal shot,but insisted that clarence testimony was credible,asserted that duncan was guilty of purposeful murder either as a principal or as an accomplice,and emphasized that duncan had orchestrated the incident that culminated in holmes death.
in charging the jury,the court gave detailed instructions on the murder and weapons counts,and on the lesser included offenses of aggravated and reckless manslaughter.the court also described the doctrine of transferred intent and gave a lengthy instruction on accomplice liability.during deliberations,the jury asked the court to explain the definition sic between murder and aggravated manslaughter and to explain guilty by association.at.in response,the court again read the murder,aggravated manslaughter,and accomplice liability charges to the jury.the jury found duncan guilty of murder and the offenses.on may,the court sentenced duncan to a lengthy prison term for the murder,imposed a concurrent sentence for the first offense but vacated the second verdict as having merged with the murder conviction.
roberts,by then officially pedicini partner,filed an appeal of duncan conviction with the appellate division of the superior court of new jersey appellate division,challenging only the trial court substitution of a deliberating juror and its admission of duncan allegedly involuntary statement.on july,in an unpublished per curiam opinion,the appellate division affirmed duncan conviction.thereafter,roberts ceased his representation of duncan.the supreme court of new jersey denied duncan petition for certification on september.in a separate proceeding,norman conviction was also affirmed by the appellate division,and his petition for certification was denied.
state court collateral proceedings 
on may,duncan filed a pro se relief pcr petition.attorney connie bentley mcghee filed a supplemental letter brief in support of the petition on january,and represented duncan at his pcr hearing on january.the primary bases of duncan petition were ineffective assistance of counsel and his attorney conflict of interest.duncan,roberts,and alvin norman alvin,norman brother,all testified at the hearing.
roberts stated that he was a sole practitioner when duncan hired him and during duncan trial.however,he acknowledged that he had entered into a partnership with pedicini by the time he began preparing duncan appeal.as to fees,he testified that his division of duncan bail with pedicini was not contingent on either attorney performance.roberts also claimed he had made a full disclosure to duncan regarding his impending partnership and that duncan had not objected to it,although roberts conceded that he had not obtained a written or waiver of conflict from duncan.
as to his trial strategy,roberts said that it was to portray norman as the killer,stated that pedicini never asked him to alter his defense of duncan,and asserted that he did not change his tactics to benefit himself,pedicini,or norman.roberts acknowledged that he had considered calling as a witness alvin norman,who had heard norman confess to shooting holmes.roberts explained that he decided not to call alvin because he believed alvin testimony constituted inadmissible hearsay and because alvin could put an uzi in duncan hands at the scene.even after duncan pcr lawyer pointed out that roberts had conceded at trial that duncan had a gun,roberts maintained that his judgment at the time of trial was that alvin testimony would be more hurtful than helpful to duncan case.
alvin then testified,and stated that although he had not been present when holmes was shot,both norman and duncan had told him about the incident shortly there after.alvin reportedly learned from norman that duncan had hidden behind the apartment door with a gun,but that norman had shot holmes.duncan,on the other hand,told alvin that he had been talking to henderson and holmes when norman burst out from behind the door and chased the two down the stairs,and then duncan had decided to follow them.alvin asserted that he passed his information on to roberts because he wanted to set the record straight when norman did not tell the truth.alvin stated that he was subpoenaed as a witness and sat in the hall during duncan trial,expecting to testify,but that roberts eventually decided not to use him,telling him that he would not be a credible witness because the jury would think that duncan had put him up to testifying.
duncan then testified at the pcr hearing,and disavowed any intent to kill either henderson or holmes.he reported that roberts had initially stated that alvin would be vital to his defense,at,but informed him later that alvin testimony was not necessary.duncan also asserted that he had asked roberts to call douglas sherman as a witness but did not recall why roberts failed to do so.he denied any knowledge of roberts and pedicini fee agreement but claimed that he had no problem with some of his bail being used to pay norman lawyer and that he had intended for any of the money left over after his own defense to be used for this purpose.duncan insisted he had no knowledge of the attorneys partnership until seeing roberts affiliation on his appeal brief.
the trial court denied duncan pcr petition on january.the court concluded there was no actual conflict because it credited roberts testimony and found that pedicini and roberts had not become partners until after duncan trial.the appellate division reversed.in an unpublished per curiam opinion,it held that roberts had been,or had held himself out to be,pedicini partner at the time of duncan trial,and also found roberts reasons for failing to call alvin as a witness were not supportable.app.div.op.at.while the court acknowledged that roberts may have declined to use alvin testimony pursuant to some reasonable strategy,it held that it was constrained by new jersey supreme court precedent to resolve all doubts in favor of giving duncan a new trial.id.at.however,a different panel of the appellate division affirmed the denial of norman pcr petition,finding that pedicini was not roberts partner and had no conflict of interest at the time of norman trial.
the new jersey supreme court granted and consolidated its consideration of the state petition for certification regarding the reversal of duncan conviction,duncan,norman petition concerning the denial of pcr relief in his case,and the new jersey public defender motion to enter the case as amicus curiae.on july,the court reversed the appellate division judgments in both duncan and norman cases.see state norman,
the court noted that its rulings provide for broader protection against conflicts of interest as a matter of new jersey constitutional law than is provided under the federal constitution.under the new jersey constitution,a per se conflict arises if a private attorney,or one associated with that attorney,is involved in simultaneous dual representations of prejudice will be presumed unless there has been a valid waiver.absent such joint representation,defendant must show a great likelihood of prejudice to establish constitutionally defective representation.id.at,at.
the new jersey supreme court held that the trial court finding that pedicini and roberts were not partners prior to or during the respective trials of norman and duncan was supported by substantial credible evidence and was entitled to deference.the court noted that roberts had represented norman at his arraignment only because pedicini was trying a case in federal court,but stated that norman arraignment was pro forma,lasted no more than a minute or two,and involved no discussion of the case other than an acknowledgment that norman received a copy of the indictment and discovery,waiver of reading of the indictment,and entry of a plea of not guilty.the court held that roberts was merely filling in at the arraignment and did not engage in the type of representation of norman that gives rise to a per se conflict.see id.at,at.
the court also held it would not expand its per se conflict rule to cases where attorneys represent while the attorneys are conducting partnership negotiations.see id.at,at.the court then found that roberts representation of duncan was not impaired by either a potential or an actual conflict of interest that prejudiced duncan.the court further held that because duncan failed to object to the trial court jury instructions at trial or on direct appeal,he could only challenge them in the context of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.it then found that roberts failure to object to the erroneous instruction was not unreasonable and did not prejudice duncan trial.it remanded the case to the appellate division for consideration of duncan remaining ineffective assistance of counsel claims.
on remand,the appellate division considered and rejected duncan remaining claims.duncan again petitioned the new jersey supreme court for certification,which the court denied on may.see state duncan.
federal habeas corpus proceedings 
duncan petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the district of new jersey on august,which the district court denied.the court did not certify it for appeal.after duncan filed a timely notice of appeal,this court granted a certificate of appealability pursuant to c with respect to his claims that his right to counsel was violated by a conflict of interest counsel was ineffective for failing to call or interview witnesses favorable to the defense the accomplice liability and transferred intent jury instructions were erroneous and counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge those instructions 
the district court had jurisdiction over this case under and this court has appellate jurisdiction under and.this court applies a plenary standard of review when a district court dismisses a habeas petition based on a review of the state court record and does not hold an evidentiary hearing,as in this case.see zilich reid,cir.
under,as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,federal courts must give considerable deference to the determinations of state courts.section d precludes federal habeas relief as to 
any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
the supreme court has interpreted this standard as follows 
under the contrary to clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.
williams taylor,d.the court further explained that whether a state court application of federal law is unreasonable is judged objectively and that an application may be incorrect but still not unreasonable.id.at.
in conducting a habeas analysis,we must afford state courts factual findings a presumption of correctness,which the petitioner can overcome only by clear and convincing evidence.see e.this presumption applies to the factual determinations of both state trial and appellate courts.see dickerson vaughn,cir.
conflict of interest 
duncan argues that roberts actual conflict of interest was evidenced by the facts that the attorney appeared at norman arraignment,introduced himself at trial as pedicini partner,split duncan bail money with pedicini as each attorney fee for representing duncan and norman,failed to call a key witness in duncan defense,and continued to represent duncan on appeal after the finalization of his partnership with pedicini.duncan contends that this conflict deprived him of his sixth amendment right to counsel and prejudiced his defense.he also asserts that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a conflict inquiry.
actual conflict 
the determination whether an attorney engaged in multiple representation is a mixed question of law and fact and therefore not subject to the presumption of correctness.see cuyler sullivan,d.however,we can only grant duncan habeas petition if we find that the new jersey courts determination in this case is contrary to or constitutes an unreasonable application of,governing supreme court precedent.see williams,at.because he raised no conflict objection at trial,duncan must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance to prevail on his sixth amendment claim.cuyler,at.
actual conflict is more likely to occur in cases of joint representation of at the same trial than in cases of multiple representation of at separate trials.see united states morelli,cir,cert.denied,d see also burger kemp,d a s we noted in cuyler,the provision of separate murder trials for the three coindictees significantly reduced the potential for a divergence in their interests.actual conflict is also more easily established when the attorney has taken a positive step benefitting another client than when the attorney was passive and failed to act on behalf of the petitioner.see morelli,at citing united states gambino,cir.
this case presents at most a case of multiple representation,and duncan cites only passive lapses in representation by roberts,not positive acts.therefore,to establish a violation of his sixth amendment right to counsel,duncan must 
f irst demonstrate that some plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic might have been pursued.he need not show that the defense would necessarily have been successful if it had been used,but that it possessed sufficient substance to be a viable alternative.second,he must establish that the alternative defense was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney other loyalties or interests.
id.quoting gambino,at.
the new jersey supreme court found no multiple representation in this case,either by roberts individually or through his association with pedicini.regarding norman arraignment,the court noted that roberts clearly stated he was temporarily filling in for pedicini,norman counsel,who could not attend due to a federal court appearance,and he entered norman plea.given roberts minimal role and the fact that norman arraignment did not last more than a couple minutes or entail any exchange of confidential information,the court found roberts had not represented norman.see norman,at,at.
duncan argues that arraignments may involve confidential exchanges of information when defendants and their lawyers determine pleas and possible defenses and request bail,but he does not challenge the new jersey supreme court factual description of norman arraignment or provide any evidence that it entailed any confidential communications.instead,duncan argues that the court characterization of roberts appearance as a mere formality was an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent because arraignments are a crucial part of criminal cases,citing kirby illinois,d.the kirby court did describe the time from a defendant arraignment to the beginning of his trial as perhaps the most critical period of the proceedings,id.at.quotation omitted,and noted that t he initiation of judicial criminal proceedings is far from a mere formalism,id.at.however,the context of these statements was an opinion holding that the sixth amendment right to counsel does not attach until adversary judicial proceedings are initiated against a defendant.see id.at.kirby does not preclude,or render unreasonable,the new jersey supreme court conclusion that roberts appearance at the arraignment did not constitute a representation of norman for purposes of an analysis under cuyler.
as to the attorneys fee agreement,the new jersey supreme court held that pedicini compensation from duncan bail money created a conflict for pedicini,with a significant likelihood of prejudice to norman,but no corresponding risk of prejudice to duncan.see norman,at,at.the court further noted that because pedicini no longer represented norman at the time he joined the partnership,roberts subsequent representation of duncan on direct appeal merely constituted successive representation.although the court acknowledged roberts as pedicini partner at duncan trial,it deferred to the pcr court finding that the attorneys partnership was not official until may,after the trial,and it held that substantial credible evidence both attorneys testimony and corroborating documentary evidence supported this finding.see id.at,at.
the finding that the attorneys were not technically partners during duncan trial is both and subject to a presumption of correctness.the determination that they were not partners for the purposes of multiple representation is not an unreasonable one.in fact,we have found lawyers with similarly entwined,but not officially combined,practices not to be associated within the meaning of federal rule of criminal procedure c.see united states pungitore,cir citing cuyler,at,for the proposition that a court may reasonably rely on attorneys own description of the nature and extent of their professional associations.
finally,the new jersey supreme court held that even if roberts decision not to call alvin norman as a witness was motivated by a conflict of interest,
alvin testimony would not have affected the overwhelming evidence that duncan was at least an accomplice to the murder it simply would have suggested that it was norman and not duncan who actually hit holmes.whose shot felled holmes,however,was not dispositive of the murder charge if duncan,as all of the credible evidence indicated,shared the murderous intent.
norman,at,at.the court also pointed out that if alvin had testified regarding norman statement,the state could have introduced into evidence norman statement to the police,which further implicated duncan as an accomplice.
in fact,duncan has not shown that the use of alvin testimony constituted a viable alternate defense strategy.he argues that alvin testimony would have lent his own account of the shooting more credibility and that if the jury had heard evidence that duncan did not fire the fatal shot,it may have analyzed his other conduct in a less culpable light,such that he did not share his murderous intent.br.for appellant at.however,the identity of the actual shooter is not particularly relevant to duncan liability,given the state reliance on the accomplice theory of liability.
nothing in alvin proposed testimony contradicted clarence account,or the evidence tending to show duncan complicity in the shooting.nor would it have provided a basis for distinguishing duncan from norman at the time of the shooting.even alvin would have placed duncan waiting for henderson with a gun in the moody apartment,possibly hidden behind the door.moreover,as noted by the new jersey supreme court,the use of alvin testimony would have rendered admissible norman potentially damaging statement to the police.norman,at,at.
duncan has also failed to provide any evidence that roberts decision not to call alvin was undertaken due to the attorney other loyalties,or even that roberts had other relevant loyalties.the facts that roberts erroneously believed that alvin testimony would have been inadmissible hearsay and that roberts had no reason to be concerned that alvin testimony would have shown duncan had a gun do not prove that roberts motives were tainted by conflict.on the contrary,there is no reason to reject the state courts characterization of his decision as a strategic one.this is particularly plausible inasmuch as alvin testimony was at least as likely to have hurt duncan case by corroborating his complicity in the shooting as to have helped it by identifying norman as the shooter.
for the above stated reasons,we can not find that the new jersey supreme court determination in this case is contrary to,or that its careful analysis constitutes an unreasonable application of,governing united states supreme court precedent.
conflict inquiry 
duncan argues that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a sua sponte hearing into roberts apparent conflict of interest when the attorney introduced himself at duncan trial as pedicini partner.duncan cites cuyler,at,for the proposition that a trial court must make such an inquiry if it knows or reasonably suspects that a conflict of interest exists.the relevant quotation from the cuyler opinion makes clear that no such sua sponte inquiry was called for in this case 
holloway requires state trial courts to investigate timely objections to multiple representation.but nothing in our precedents suggests that the sixth amendment requires state courts themselves to initiate inquiries into the propriety of multiple representation in every case.defense counsel have an ethical obligation to avoid conflicting representations and to advise the court promptly when a conflict of interest arises during the course of trial.absent special circumstances,therefore,trial courts may assume either that multiple representation entails no conflict or that the lawyer and his clients knowingly accept such risk of conflict as may exist.indeed,trial courts necessarily rely in large measure upon the good faith and good judgment of defense counsel unless the trial court knows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists,the court need not initiate an inquiry.
at.citations and footnotes omitted.
in cuyler,the court found nothing to indicate the trial court had a duty to inquire into potential conflicts of interest where the trials were severed no participant in the petitioner trial made any objection to the multiple representation and the attorney outline of his defense strategy both appeared compatible with the view that none of the defendants was connected with the crime and suggested that the petitioner attorney was not afraid to call witnesses whom he might need in later trials although the attorney ultimately made a strategic decision to rest on the government case.id.at.
roberts and pedicini association was much more tenuous than that of the lawyers in cuyler who worked together on three cases.here,pedicini never appeared at duncan trial or vice versa,and the only evidence linking roberts and pedicini was roberts single statement of affiliation.duncan has not shown that roberts written submissions to the trial court indicated this affiliation or that any other evidence before the court would have pointed to it.
therefore,duncan trial judge may not have suspected any multiple representation in duncan case,much less the type of special circumstances that would trigger a conflict inquiry into an otherwise presumptively permissible multiple representation.moreover,the trial court had every reason to believe roberts intended to pursue duncan defense zealously.for example,roberts had identified alvin as a witness and subpoenaed him,even though he decided not to call him.it follows that there was no basis for the trial court to initiate an inquiry into the possibility of a conflict of interest on roberts part.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
duncan argues roberts representation of him was ineffective because the attorney failed to call alvin as a defense witness at trial,declined to interview douglas sherman or call him as a witness,and failed to object to the trial court defective jury instructions.in order to show ineffective assistance of counsel,the petitioner must establish both that his counsel performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced his trial to the extent that it undermined confidence in the trial outcome.see strickland washington,d.the standard by which we judge deficient performance is an objective standard of reasonableness,viewed to the extent possible from the attorney perspective at the time,without the distorting effects of hindsight.id.at.b oth the performance and prejudice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of law and fact,at,so this court applies a plenary standard of review,see hess mazurkiewicz,cir.
failure to call alvin norman 
duncan principal ineffectiveness claim relates to roberts failure to call alvin as a witness,an issue we have already discussed.the appellate division,on remand from the new jersey supreme court,rejected this claim based on that court finding,in the context of its conflict analysis,that the failure to call alvin did not prejudice duncan defense.roberts interviewed alvin and considered using his testimony,but ultimately decided not to call him as a witness.given our acceptance of the finding that the use of alvin testimony would have been more harmful than helpful to duncan defense,we can not find roberts failure to call alvin was an unreasonable lapse amounting to constitutionally deficient performance.
rather,the failure to use alvin testimony amounted to a tactical decision within the parameters of reasonable professional judgment.strickland,at.s trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.sistrunk vaughn,cir i n a criminal defense,certain litigation decisions are considered fundamental and are for the client to make a ll other decisions fall within the professional responsibility of counsel.because we find that roberts failure to call alvin did not rise to the level of deficient performance,we can not find that the appellate division rejection of duncan ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on this failure was an unreasonable application of strickland.
failure to interview or call as a witness douglas sherman 
the appellate division rejected duncan contention that roberts failure to interview or call sherman as a witness was an unreasonable lapse and prejudiced his trial.under strickland,a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances,applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgments.at.however,even assuming that roberts failure to investigate sherman potential testimony rose to the level of deficient performance we can not find the appellate division application of strickland unreasonable becau
