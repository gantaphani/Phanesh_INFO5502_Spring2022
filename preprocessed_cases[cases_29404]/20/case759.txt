opinion of the court 
this appeal raises an interesting question under the recent enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa pertaining to the failure of a state judge to recuse himself because his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.a grand jury in delaware indicted ronald johnson for the theft of property valued in excess of,possession of a deadly weapon by a person prohibited,and several other related crimes.after a trial to a jury,he was convicted of the weapon charge and the lesser included charge of aggravated menacing.he was acquitted of all other charges.he was sentenced to eighteen years imprisonment as a habitual offender.the state supreme court affirmed his conviction and sentence.johnson state,table,wl.april.
without filing any motion in the state court,johnson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of delaware under d the district court conditionally granted johnson petition for habeas relief as to his sentence,concluding that there existed an appearance of bias on the part of the sentencing judge.johnson carroll,d.the district court ordered the state to grant johnson a new sentencing hearing.the state timely appealed.in light of the stringent provisions of aedpa,we reverse and direct the district court to dismiss johnson habeas petition.
the relevant facts regarding johnson conviction and sentence are undisputed.the charges set forth in the indictment stemmed from the alleged kidnaping of his estranged daughter,karen vincent,on october.
immediately before sentencing johnson following his conviction,the state court trial judge held a conference with both the prosecutor and defense counsel in his chambers.the judge voluntarily disclosed that he had an conversation with james liguori,a delaware attorney and former state prosecutor,at a social function at liguori home.as you both know jim liguori,if you see him,he talks about cases all the time.the judge informed counsel that liguori made a comment about johnson during their conversation.as related by the judge,liguori commented that johnson was a bad guy,that he had threatened liguori and his family,and that liguori wanted to see that justice was done.the judge assured counsel that he believed that liguori comment would not have any impact on his view of the case or his pending sentencing decision.
defense counsel at the time,sandra dean,a public defender,who had become johnson trial counsel through trial,voluntarily informed the judge of the background information regarding johnson alleged threat to liguori eighteen years before,in.liguori,then a state prosecutor,prosecuted johnson in an unrelated matter.johnson,having been convicted and imprisoned,sent a christmas card to liguori in.the christmas card read you had fun in and will be free in.johnson escaped from prison,and it was debated then whether he posed a threat,presumably to liguori and his family.the judge told dean that he had no knowledge of the background information that she had just related and commented that it perhaps explained why liguori made the comments about johnson.
dean then informed the judge that the local newspapers had reported the purported threat at that time and that the public defender office had included the newspaper clippings among the documents submitted to the court in relation to johnson present trial.dean assured the judge that johnson christmas card was part of public record.the judge and dean both agreed that the purported threat was well documented and that the documents were all in the whole file earlier submitted to the court.
the state prosecutor,robert,in turn mentioned his own recollection of johnson purported threat to liguori and his family.he then told the judge that liguori comment about johnson character was relevant to the court in meting out the sentence to him because he was charged as a habitual offender under state law.he informed the judge further that the court should consider johnson propensity for violence and his entire criminal history in determining the term of sentence.he also told the judge that liguori arguably could be presented as a witness at johnson sentencing hearing.
finally,in response to question as to whether she intended to file any motion regarding the ex parte communication disclosed by the judge,dean told the judge she had no such intention because the alleged incident was nothing new,a matter of record,happened a long time ago,and the judge had indicated that he would not give it any undue weight.dean told the judge also that she would discuss the matter with johnson and expressed doubt that he would request a different judge for the pending sentencing.the judge concluded the conference by stating that he would not allow liguori to be a witness at johnson sentencing hearing.
johnson obtained new counsel and appealed his conviction and sentence.as to johnson sentence,the delaware supreme court rejected his claim that the trial judge had erroneously failed to recuse himself sua sponte.the court analyzed the issue first under the delaware judges code of judicial conduct and found the situation was not one of those enumerated in the code that would mandate recusal.johnson state,wl,at.the court analyzed the issue then under a test set forth under its prior decisions.id.citing stevenson state,los los.under the subjective prong,the court noted the trial judge statement that i do view the contact to have any impact on my view of the case or my decision with regard to sentencing,and found it sufficient.under the objective prong,the court did not find any appearance of bias sufficient to cause doubt as to the judge impartiality.specifically,the court observed that the trial judge did not engage in any active conduct demonstrating the appearance of impropriety.id.emphasis added distinguishing this case from stevenson,at,finding appearance of impropriety when a judge who had previous contact with a victim affirmatively requested that the case be assigned to him.the court observed additionally that johnson previous counsel at trial admitted,and his new counsel on appeal did not deny,that the record in his case available to the trial court had already contained a more detailed account of his alleged threat to liguori.id.
the district court issued an order and opinion ruling against johnson as to his conviction but in favor of him as to his sentence.johnson carroll,d at.specifically,the court agreed with johnson that the trial court judge erroneously failed to recuse himself sua sponte from sentencing johnson following his voluntary disclosure that he had received an ex parte communication from a former prosecutor regarding johnson.the court agreed that the failure to do so created an appearance of bias on the part of the judge in violation of johnson due process rights under the united states constitution.
it is not disputed that johnson had exhausted his state remedy prior to his initiation of the underlying federal habeas action.it is also not disputed that aedpa governs a federal court review of johnson habeas action.the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under.we have appellate jurisdiction under and.the question of whether the district court appropriately applied the aedpa standard of review is a question of law subject to review by this court de novo.chadwick janecka,cir.
aedpa severely circumscribes a federal habeas court review of a state court decision.aedpa provides in relevant part 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d emphasis added.the determination of what constitutes clearly established federal law is a threshold question in cases.lockyer andrade,d.
the statutory phrase clearly established is defined as follows 
section d clearly established phrase refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision in other words,clearly established federal law under d is the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the supreme court at the time the state court renders its decision.
id.at.citations omitted emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
the statutory phrase contrary to is defined as follows 
a state court decision is contrary to the supreme court clearly established precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases or if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from the court precedent.
id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
the statutory phrase unreasonable application is defined as follows 
u nder the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.the unreasonable application clause requires the state court decision to be more than incorrect or erroneous.the state court application of clearly established law must be objectively unreasonable it is not enough that a federal habeas court,in its independent review of the legal question,is left with a firm conviction that the state court was erroneous.the supreme court has held precisely the opposite under d unreasonable application clause,then,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must be objectively unreasonable.

the district court acknowledged that it was bound by aedpa stringent standard in reviewing the merits of johnson habeas claims.the court agreed with johnson that the delaware supreme court decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law and an unreasonable application of the facts in light of the evidence.johnson carroll,d at.
the district court and johnson relied on three united states supreme court decisions,in re murchison,liljeberg health services acquisition,d,and liteky united states,d the court agreed with johnson that the trial judge failure to recuse himself sua sponte gave rise to an appearance of bias and that the appearance of bias violated his due process rights.the court wrote 
in this case,it appears to the court that the delaware supreme court limited its analysis to the active conduct of the trial judge,an analysis which is inconsistent with the concept of an appearance of bias.in addition,the court did not consider the impact of liguori comments that he wanted to see that justice was done.in these circumstances,liguori ex parte sentencing recommendation could well create a situation in which a reasonable observer would question the trial judge impartiality.because the delaware supreme court limited its analysis to the active conduct of the judge,it did not consider the reaction of the reasonable observer and the related risks of injustice to the parties and undermining the public confidence in the judicial process that result from the continued participation of a judge in a proceeding despite the judge appearance of bias.see stevenson state,en banc.thus,the court concludes that the delaware supreme court decision was not entirely consistent with federal law and was not a reasonable application of the facts in light of the evidence.
johnson carroll,d at emphases added.
johnson has not asserted,and there is no evidence,that the trial judge harbored any actual bias toward him.he argued,and the district court agreed,that the ex parte communication created an appearance of bias and that the appearance of bias violated his due process rights under the united states constitution.
under the plain language of d,as well as the united states supreme court case law,we are presented only with one narrow issue whether the supreme court has ever held in any of its decisions existing at the time of the district court judgment,including the three cases relied on by johnson and the district court,that an appearance of bias on the part of a state court judge,without more,violates the due process clause of the united states constitution.we are not,and can not be,concerned with the issues of whether the trial judge should have recused himself sua sponte or whether the ex parte communication at issue was sufficient to constitute an appearance of bias.we assume that there was an appearance of bias.
we note first that the district court has significantly changed the statutory language of d in its presentation of the issue before it.the phrase clearly established was noticeably absent in the court presentation of the d prong,and the court substituted the statutory phrase unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence with the phrase unreasonable application of the facts in light of the evidence in its presentation of the d prong.see johnson carroll,d at.because the aedpa standard is strict,the court omission and deviation were erroneous and distorted its analysis.
we note also that despite its presentation of the d prong,the district court did not analyze the delaware supreme court decision under that prong.the reason is obvious the decision of the state appellate court did not,and could not,involve any determination of facts regarding the undisputed ex parte communication at issue.nor did the state court decision involve any unreasonable application of the facts,as expressed by the district court.the state court adjudicated johnson appeal of his sentence under the delaware judges code of judicial conduct and its own case law regarding the recusal standard for delaware judges.
as conceded by the district court in its later decision to grant the state motion for an enlargement of the stay of its judgment pending the resolution of this appeal,its earlier decision granting habeas relief was based on an analogy to supreme court cases related to the issue of recusal under for federal judges and not on direct precedent related to the trial judge appearance of bias under the due process clause.johnson carroll,wl at.emphases added.this belated realization was tantamount to an admission that none of the supreme court decisions relied on by the district court in its earlier decision clearly established that mere appearance of bias,without more,violates the due process clause.our own reading of the cases shows that they do not stand for any such holding,and we are not aware of any other supreme court decision that has so held.
the supreme court held in in re murchison,that it was unconstitutional for the same state judge,after a full hearing in open court,to punish contempt,previously committed before him while acting as a jury permitted under then michigan laws.it would be very strange if our system of law permitted a judge to act as grand jury and then try the very persons accused as a result of his investigations.at.the court concluded that no man can be a judge in his own case and no man is permitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome.id.at.that conclusion was based on the basic requirement of due process that the defendant receive a fair trial in a fair tribunal.id.the court commented that although fairness certainly required an absence of actual bias,our system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability of unfairness.id.the court acknowledged that its stringent rule may sometimes bar trial by judges who have no actual bias and who would do their very best to weigh the scales of justice equally between contending parties.id.however,to perform its high function in the best way justice must sa
