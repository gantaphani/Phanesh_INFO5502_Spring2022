robert campbell appeals from the district court denial of his motion to vacate his sentence.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
after two mistrials as a result of hung juries,a third grand jury indicted campbell on the following three counts conspiracy to possess controlled substances with the intent to distribute and conspiracy to actually distribute the controlled substances,all in violation of a and aiding and abetting the possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute,in violation of a and and aiding and abetting the possession of heroin with the intent to distribute,in violation of a and.in july of,a jury found campbell guilty on all counts.the district court sentenced campbell to months of imprisonment and years of supervised release.
campbell appealed,alleging numerous errors.in october of,this court issued an amended opinion that affirmed his conviction and sentence by a to vote,with the dissent favoring a new trial because of the alleged prosecutorial misconduct that occurred during closing argument.
campbell petitioned to vacate his sentence pursuant to in august of.the case was referred to a magistrate judge,who issued a report and recommendation r r concluding that the motion should be denied.over campbell objections,the district court adopted the r campbell then applied for a certificate of appealability as to nine issues,all of which the district court certified.in january of,campbell filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
campbell asserts numerous claims on appeal.to prevail on these claims,he must establish that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and there is a reasonable probability that,but for the deficiency,the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.griffin united states,cir.the objective standard of reasonableness is a highly deferential one and includes a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.mason mitchell,cir quotation marks omitted.a reasonable probability has been defined by the supreme court as a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland washington,d.
when deciding claims,courts need not address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.id.at.if it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice,which we expect will often be so,that course should be followed.id.these claims,as part of campbell motion to vacate his sentence under,are reviewed de novo.griffin,at.
ineffectiveness based upon alleged speedy trial act violation 
campbell first argues that the district court erred in denying his claim that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not moving for a dismissal of the indictment based upon alleged violations of the speedy trial act.the act requires that a criminal defendant be brought to trial within days after the filing of an indictment or an arraignment,whichever is later.c.a retrial that follows a mistrial must start within days from the date the action occasioning the retrial becomes final e.if a defendant is not brought to trial within days,taking into account excludable time periods under the act,the district court is obligated to dismiss the indictment on the defendant motion.a united states jenkins,cir.the dismissal may be either with or without prejudice.id.
campbell alleges the following three violations of the speedy trial act days elapsed between the end of his first trial and the start of his second,approximately days elapsed between the second mistrial and the dismissal of the second indictment,and days elapsed between the dismissal of the second indictment and campbell arraignment on the third superseding indictment.the magistrate judge r r concludes that even if violations of the speedy trial act did occur,campbell can not demonstrate that he was prejudiced as required by strickland.for the reasons that follow,we agree.
in his brief,campbell asserts that the alleged violations of the speedy trial act prejudiced him,but he provides little explanation and no authority to support his contentions.campbell says that the prejudice is obvious and that there clearly was prejudice suffered by campbell.but he does not allege any specific prejudice,such as a witness becoming unavailable.
under the speedy trial act,courts must consider the following three factors when determining whether to dismiss an indictment with or without prejudice the seriousness of the offense the facts and circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of the act and on the administration of justice.a.as explained in the r r,e ach of these factors would have counseled a dismissal without prejudice in campbell case 
defendant was charged with involvement in an extensive,serious drug distribution conspiracy,for which he was sentenced to nearly years imprisonment.as to the second factor,the delays in defendant case were not extensive and were occasioned in part by the complexity of the procedural issues involved,including two previous hung juries and a reindictment because of an improperly constituted grand jury.further,there is no evidence of bad faith or any attempt to take advantage of the delay on the part of the prosecution.finally,as to the third factor,defendant does not allege that he suffered any actual prejudice as a result of the delay,and there is no allegation that the government engaged in any improper behavior which must be deterred in order to insure compliance with the act.in these circumstances,any dismissal under the act would have been without prejudice.
we have no basis to fault the magistrate judge analysis.because campbell can not show that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel failure to request dismissal for the alleged violations of the speedy trial act,we affirm the district court denial of relief to campbell on this claim.
ineffectiveness based upon failure to request a downward departure 
campbell next argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to request a downward departure at sentencing based upon campbell conduct and based upon the disproportionality between his sentence and those of his codefendants.neither behavior nor disproportionality,however,is mentioned in the sentencing guidelines as a basis for departure.sentencing guidelines see koon united states,d noting that a sentencing court must bear in mind the sentencing commission expectation that departures based on grounds not mentioned in the guidelines will be highly infrequent.
under the sentencing guidelines,the sentencing court may impose a sentence below the guideline range where a mitigating circumstance exists of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.sentencing guidelines manual quotation marks omitted.the r r and the government both note that neither behavior nor disproportionality is mentioned in the sentencing guidelines as a basis for departure.see sentencing guidelines manual listing certain offender characteristics relevant to the determination of whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.
campbell argues,however,that his lack of involvement in drug activity or other criminal conduct since his arrest rises to the level of extraordinary behavior.but as this court noted in united states biehl,
s ome degree of presentence rehabilitation is to be expected from a penitent defendant,whether due to a true acceptance of responsibility or from one who simply wants to put his best foot forward at sentencing with hopes of receiving leniency from the sentencing court.furthermore,in order to keep the temporary liberty defendant was given by delaying his sentence for almost three years,abiding by the fairly typical terms of his presentence release is not unexpected.as the first circuit stated,such predictable reactions,while laudable,fall shy of what we believe is necessary to take cases out of the heartland.
wl,at cir,unpublished opinion quoting united states sklar,cir.because campbell failed to show that he was prejudiced by his counsel failure to move for a downward departure based upon either disproportionality or behavior,we affirm the district court denial of relief to campbell on this ground.
ineffective assistance based upon trial proceedings 
campbell also argues that the following errors occurred during the trial that deprived him of his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel 
failure to object to government witness reference to organized crime 
campbell contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object and move for a mistrial after government witness richard carroll,a new york city police officer,testified that he was assigned to the organized crime control bureau at the time of his testimony.this testimony,according to campbell,implicitly linked campbell to this criminal group which has strongly negative connotations in the minds of most citizen jurors.the r r thorough analysis of this issue explains why campbell is not entitled to relief on this basis 
although defendant contends that this remark was irrelevant,inflammatory and prejudicial,he does not state how he was prejudiced by this single reference to organized crime.notably,the comment was in no way connected to his case,but was simply part of background testimony concerning the witness current employment.nowhere in his testimony did carroll relate any of the allegations against defendant to organized crime,and he also testified that he was assigned to the street unit,not the organized crime control bureau,at the time he arrested campbell coconspirator carol bayless.thus,there is not a reasonable probability that the comment influenced the jury verdict in any manner.see,united states catalano,wl,at cir,per curiam defendant not denied a fair trial by prosecutor comments concerning organized crime where references were isolated and not inflammatory united states thirion,cir defendant not denied a fair trial by question relating to whether defendant,an attorney,had represented an organized crime figure the matter came up only once during the course of a lengthy trial and defendant answer linked the client,and not the defendant,to organized crime 
because campbell fails to show that this comment prejudiced him,we affirm the district court denial of relief to campbell on this issue.
prejudicial remarks to the jury 
campbell argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by making prejudicial remarks to the jury during his opening and closing statements.in his opening statement,for example,campbell counsel stated 
perform the duties that your oath says that you will do.and whatever your verdict is,it is.if your verdict ultimately is guilty,so be it it guilty.that what our system is about 
campbell contends that his counsel comments evidenced a lack of concern for the verdict and that his counsel should have instead argued that a reasonable doubt,or doubts,should arise from the evidence 
as noted in the r r,these comments do not amount to constitutionally ineffective assistance 
on the contrary,counsel repeatedly emphasized the burden of proof,requiring the prosecutor to prove the charges against petitioner beyond a reasonable doubt.he also repeatedly stated that,in his view and for the reasons he explained at length to the jury,the prosecutor had not met this burden.while counsel discussion of the burden of proof was perhaps not as eloquent as it could have been,counsel at all times acted as an advocate for defendant and pressed defendant case.in these circumstances,the comments of counsel do not amount to constitutionally ineffective assistance.
we agree,and accordingly affirm the district court denial of relief to campbell on this ground.
failure to propose instruction 
campbell argues that his counsel failure to request a jury instruction explaining his theory of the case amounted to the ineffective assistance of counsel.in his argument,however,campbell does not demonstrate how he was prejudiced by this omission.the r r explains that campbell 
can not show that he was prejudiced by counsel failure because his theory was adequately conveyed to the jury by the court instructions on the elements of the government charges and the burden of proof.defendant theory of the case was a simple denial of involvement in the conspiracy.
the r r reasoning is persuasive and we therefore affirm the district court denial of relief to campbell on this claim.
failure to call character witnesses 
campbell contends that his case presented the jury with a classic credibility question because the government asserted that he was involved in drug activity and campbell denied those allegations.he argues that character witnesses testifying to his reputation for truthfulness and veracity would have been significant.according to campbell,character witnesses were available to testify on his behalf,but his trial counsel failed to call them.campbell concludes that this failure amounts to the ineffective assistance of counsel.
both the r r and the government note,however,that campbell failed to provide any information regarding what witnesses should have been examined more fully or what additional witnesses should have been called.consequently,campbell can not rebut the strong presumption that his attorney actions were the product of sound trial strategy.strickland washington,d t he court should recognize that counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.we accordingly affirm the district court denial of relief to campbell on this basis.
eliciting of prejudicial testimony 
campbell argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by eliciting prejudicial testimony from three government witnesses on.during the of a drug enforcement agency dea agent,campbell trial counsel asked whether the agent felt that campbell may have been somehow with or involved with the other members of the alleged conspiracy.campbell contends that such testimony indicating a connection between campbell and admitted drug traffickers could only have inured to campbell detriment.with regard to this testimony,the r r notes that the questions preceding and following the challenged question show that campbell trial counsel was attempting to cast doubt upon the dea agent belief 
counsel was trying to show that the agent belief was not credible given that he did not have the car that campbell was traveling in followed by another agent when it left the motel parking lot where the other coconspirators were.counsel asked a number of questions establishing this fact,as well as the fact that the agent did not see defendant carrying anything either to or from the room in which the other conspirators were apparently conducting the transaction.
campbell next argues that his counsel of a police officer was improper because an inquiry as to where the police officer had previously seen a picture of campbell led the officer to respond that he had seen a picture on a prior narcotic raid.this answer is most likely not what counsel expected,but,as the r r notes,the question was part of a legitimate strategy on the part of campbell attorney to question the officer about his observations and identification of campbell.
finally,campbell argues that his defense counsel question to a dea agent about whether he was relying on the word of government witnesses carol bayless,orlando bayless,larry anderson,and christopher owens was improper given that the dea agent answered not solely the fact of the people that you were discussing.campbell contends that this answer implied that there were other witnesses and other evidence that had not been presented at trial and that such evidence would have been deemed improper had it been elicited by the prosecution.again,we agree with the r r analysis,which is as follows 
this isolated statement came after counsel elicited repeatedly from the agent that he was,in fact,relying primarily on the word of the government wi
