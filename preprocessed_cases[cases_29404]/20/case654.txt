the principal issue presented on this appeal is whether a court may consider the factors listed in a a the seriousness of the offense,respect for the law,and just punishment for the offense when imposing a sentence for the violation of the conditions of supervised release.concluding that a court is not prohibited from considering the a a factors in the supervised release revocation context,we will affirm the district court judgment.
from december,to september,appellant joseph young went on a spree,enlisting the assistance of several individuals to present bogus checks in exchange for a share of the proceeds.on september,he was sentenced in the cambria county court of common pleas on twenty separate charging instruments.the sentence on one of the charging instruments included a prison term of thirty to sixty months,which was later reduced to days to months,less one day.he was released on parole on february.
undeterred by the criminal justice sanctions imposed and the fact that he was under the supervision of state parole and probation authorities,young quickly reverted to passing counterfeit checks.on july,young,with the aid of jeanne hooter,unsuccessfully attempted to pass a counterfeit check at a jc penney department store at the pittsburgh mills mall.this incident garnered the attention of federal law enforcement authorities.on april,young and hooter were indicted on a charge of conspiracy to make,utter,and possess counterfeit securities of an organization involved in interstate commerce,in violation of.on october,young entered a plea of guilty to the conspiracy count pursuant to a written agreement.the plea agreement included several stipulations concerning such matters as the amount of loss and acceptance of responsibility.the parties further stipulated that no other enhancements or reductions in the offense level apply.the plea agreement also included an appeal and collateral challenge waiver.
as a result of the parties stipulations,young conduct resulted in an offense level of eight.young prior criminal history netted sixteen points,placing him in criminal history category vi.young resulting advisory guideline range for imprisonment was eighteen to months 
young sentencing proceeding convened on february.young did not object to any of the factual findings presented in the psr.after considering all the pertinent factors,the district court imposed a prison term of months,restitution in the amount of,and a supervised release term of three years.among the conditions of supervised release,young was not to commit another federal,state,or local crime,and was to refrain from the possession or use of any controlled substance.
young commenced his supervised release term at the end of september.he made his initial report to the probation office in the western district of pennsylvania on october.at that time,he tested positive for use of cocaine and acknowledged having used cocaine the prior day.the probation office recommended that no action be taken based upon the admitted use of cocaine,and the district court concurred with the recommendation.
on november,less than one month after supervision commenced,young was arrested in blair county,pennsylvania,on charges of forgery,escape,resisting arrest,false reports to law enforcement,and false identification to law enforcement.on november,the district court ordered that a bench warrant be issued for young arrest for violation of the terms of supervised release,with the warrant to be lodged as a detainer at the blair county prison.
disposition of the supervised release violations was deferred pending the outcome of the state charges in blair county.young was sentenced by the state court to a prison term of ten to and months.upon his parole from the state sentence,young was taken into federal custody to answer for the violation of the terms and conditions of supervised release.
young supervised release revocation proceeding convened on january.young acknowledged violating the terms and conditions of supervised release based upon the state court conviction.finding that young conduct constituted a grade b violation,the district court,in accordance with a,revoked young supervised release.young advisory guideline imprisonment range was determined to be to months.see id.a.because,however,young original federal conviction was classified as a class d felony,the statutory maximum term of imprisonment was months.see e.
acknowledging that the guideline range was advisory only,the district court afforded defense counsel ample opportunity to substantiate young request for a prison term well below the advisory guideline range.defense counsel urged that young latest encounter with the criminal justice system was the product of his substance abuse problems.young also presented evidence that four persons in the local community,including a magisterial district judge,were willing to provide assistance to him.
the government recommended a prison term of months,without any period of supervised release to follow.the government argued that such a sentence was necessary in view of young recidivism and continued drug use.the government also asserted that restitution had been made by his,jeanne hooter,and not by young.in conclusion,the government argued that a sentence of months would at least safeguard the public for that period of time.
in rebuttal,defense counsel argued that a prison term of months would not advance any of the applicable sentencing factors and would ignore the substantial role that young substance abuse problems played in his criminal history.defense counsel also emphasized that young had the support of four prominent members of the community,and argued that young and society would be better served by placing young on supervision.
ultimately,the district court decided to impose a prison term of months,to be followed by a term of supervised release.in explaining its rationale for the sentence,the district court stated 
now,in making the factual findings relevant to your sentence,i did give meaningful consideration to the factors set out under title,united states code,section a.and here,you clearly violated the terms of your supervised release,there no question about that.you committed these crimes not more than six weeks after your release from custody.and once again,you were back using cocaine.
and as you and i well know,you have a very long history,despite the fact that it does go back that many years in terms of chronology.and you been involved with forging documents,and bad checks,and altering id.and a lot of this stems from cocaine and alcohol addiction.
but the other thing that bothered me when i sentenced you initially was it was my sense,and it still my sense,that you preyed on others relative to cocaine and alcohol addictions.and so that was something else that was troubling to this court.
i also have to try to deter you from future criminal conduct,and i concerned that even with these four friends of yours who stood up and tried to cover your back,and your mom and your brother,you had some of these resources available to you when you got out the last time,and within six weeks you were out doing crimes again.and you tell me,and everyone else tells me,you need drug and alcohol counseling treatment 
as also has been pointed out,the restitution has been paid,but it was the codefendant who made the payment 
so,considering all of these factors,young,and considering the fact that you sic criminal history was remarkable,and usually it was the same behavior,and it was spread over various counts,despite the fact that you had a college education,the job skills,at one time you owned your own business,that you went right back out and broke the law again.so,i not sure,you know,whether supervision in and of itself,or probation in and of itself,or anything else would stop you from doing what you done in the past,unless you have been,in my estimation,treated and corrected.
so,i believe that the sentence of months imprisonment meets the sentencing objectives by reflecting the seriousness of the violations,promoting respect for the law,and providing just punishment.
after the sentence was pronounced,young,through his counsel,objected on the grounds that the district court a had improperly taken into consideration the a a factors b did not have a proper evidentiary foundation for its finding that young had preyed on other people c had erred in finding that hooter had paid restitution,when,in fact,it was young mother who had given the money to hooter to make restitution and d failed to give adequate weight to mitigation factors and rehabilitation needs.the district court rejected young renewed entreaty for a lesser sentence.this appeal followed.
the district court had jurisdiction by virtue of,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to and u.a.our standard of review in the context presented here was recently articulated as follows 
this court reviews the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a district court sentence upon revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion.procedurally,the sentencing court must give rational and meaningful consideration to the relevant a factors.where procedural reasonableness turns on a question of statutory interpretation,we conduct plenary review of the meaning of the statute.if a sentencing court followed the appropriate procedures in imposing the sentence,we then look to whether the sentence itself was substantively reasonable.substantive reasonableness inquires into whether the final sentence,wherever it may lie within the permissible statutory range,was premised upon appropriate and judicious consideration of the relevant factors.absent procedural error,we will affirm the sentencing 
court unless no reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence on that particular defendant for the reasons the district court provided.

young argues that the district court committed three procedural errors that combined to result in a substantively unreasonable sentence.specifically,young contends that the district court was precluded from imposing a sentence that,in the district court words,meets the sentencing objectives by reflecting the seriousness of the violations,promoting respect for the law,and providing just punishment.the second procedural error posited by young concerns the district court findings that young appeared to have a proclivity to prey on alcoholics and drug addicts to facilitate the negotiation of bogus checks and had not satisfied his restitution obligation.the final asserted procedural error is the district court purported failure to give meaningful consideration to defense arguments and a proposal for rehabilitation.appellant br.at.each alleged procedural error will be considered in turn.
young contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because congress has precluded consideration of the a a factors in the context of a supervised release revocation proceeding.young argument presents a question of statutory interpretation,over which our review is plenary.see doe,at.
revocation of supervised release is governed by e,which,in pertinent part,provides 
the court may,after considering the factors set forth in section a,a b,a c,a d,a,a,a,and a 
revoke a term of supervised release,and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision,if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release 
young argues that because a a is not one of the sentencing factors listed in e,the district court committed reversible error by mentioning the seriousness of the violation,along with the need to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment,in the rationale for its sentence.
we have not previously addressed the precise question presented here.we have,however,suggested that consideration of the gravity of the violation of supervised a a not prohibited.see united states bungar,cir sentence is imposed for violations of supervised release primarily to sanction the defendant breach of trust while taking into account,to a limited degree,the seriousness of the underlying violation and the criminal history of the violator.emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.in bungar,we also acknowledged that the court of appeals for the second circuit has held that the omission of a a from e does not foreclose a court from considering other pertinent factors,such as the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense.id.at quoting united states williams,cir.the sixth circuit subsequently agreed with the holding in williams.see united states lewis,cir.we now confront directly the question of whether consideration of the a a factors in the revocation context is prohibited,and join the courts of appeals for the second and sixth circuits in holding that a district court does not commit procedural error in taking into account those factors when imposing a sentence for the violation of supervised release.
as the second circuit explained in williams,the enumeration in e of specified subsections of a that a court must consider in revoking supervised release does not mean that it may not take into account any other pertinent factor.at.furthermore,because a court,in revoking supervised release,must take into consideration the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,a,as well as the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,id.a b,and to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,id.a c,e can not reasonably be interpreted to exclude consideration of the seriousness of the releasee violation,williams,at.indeed,the nature and circumstances of the offense,a mandatory revocation consideration under e,necessarily encompasses the seriousness of the violation of supervised release.
in lewis,the sixth circuit agreed that the omission of a a from e does not foreclose consideration of the factors listed in the former section,and that the a a factors are essentially redundant with matters courts are already permitted to take into consideration when imposing sentences for violation of supervised release.at.the sixth circuit found additional support for its conclusion in united states sentencing commission policy statements.writing for the court,judge mckeague explained 
i n the official introduction to the policy statements regarding supervised release,the sentencing commission explains that the sentence imposed upon revocation is intended to sanction the violator for failing to abide by the conditions of the supervision.thus,although violations of supervised release generally do not entail conduct as serious as crimes punishable under the a regime,revocation sentences are similarly intended to sanction,or,analogously,to provide just punishment for the offense of violating supervised release.given that the three considerations in a a are consistent with considerations already permissible for revocation sentences,the fact that e does not require that courts consider a a does not mean that courts are forbidden to consider that factor,and the fact that a sentencing court does consider a a is not error.

young relies upon case law from the ninth circuit to support his contention that the district court in his case was prohibited from taking into account the a a factors.appellant br.at citing united states hammons,cir.in hammons,which involved a district court complete failure to provide any reasons for the defendant sentence upon revocation of supervised release,the ninth circuit observed that a district court is not to consider the a a factors,citing united states miqbel,cir,and united states simtob,cir.hammons,at.miqbel reasoned that because a a is a factor that congress deliberately omitted from the list applicable to revocation sentencing,relying on that factor when imposing a revocation sentence would be improper.at.significantly,however,the court in miqbel went on to state that it would be unreasonable for a district court to place primary reliance upon a a a factor,stating that
