opinion of the court 
in,steven shelton was convicted by a delaware jury of murder and sentenced to death.after exhausting his state court remedies,shelton filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.the united states district court for the district of delaware denied relief,and shelton now appeals.shelton argues first that trial counsel was ineffective in investigating and presenting mitigating evidence at the penalty phase of his trial.second,shelton asserts that his right to a fair sentencing hearing was violated by the trial court limitation on the scope of his allocution.for the reasons that follow,we agree with the district court ruling that shelton counsel was not ineffective in his investigation and presentation of mitigating evidence and that shelton right to a fair hearing was not violated by the trial judge limitation of shelton statement called allocution to the sentencing jury.
factual and procedural background 
a.the murder 
on january,appellant steven shelton shelton,his brother nelson shelton,his cousin jack outten,and nelson shelton girlfriend,christine gibbons,spent the afternoon drinking approximately one and cases of beer at gibbons home in newark,delaware.at some point,the group discussed going to a bar where gibbons would pose as a prostitute in order to lure men outside of the bar where outten and the sheltons could rob them.after stopping at several establishments in the area,the group eventually convened at a bar in new castle known as fat boys or green door.there,gibbons met and talked with a stranger,wilson mannon,who bought her drinks.after last call,mannon left with gibbons,outten,and the sheltons in nelson shelton car.the next day,january,police discovered mannon body on a deserted street in east wilmington.mannon skull was completely shattered,his pockets were turned inside out,and his empty wallet was lying on the ground nearby.see shelton iv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
b.the trial 
on january,outten and the two shelton brothers were indicted for murder,felony murder,conspiracy,robbery,and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony.the three men were tried together by a jury in the superior court of delaware over a period of one month.
gibbons served as the prosecution principal witness at trial she ultimately testified that all three men beat mannon and that shelton kicked and punched mannon in the face.according to gibbons,nelson shelton hit mannon with a hammer on the back of the head,causing mannon to fall to the ground.outten then struck mannon in the face and head approximately ten times with a large object gibbons described as a sink.shelton ii,wl,at.the medical examiner testified that mannon died of wounds to the face and head and blows to the brain.none of the defendants testified at trial.
on february,following two days of deliberations,the jury found the defendants guilty of all charges.
the first discussions between the trial court and counsel concerning the penalty phase of the proceedings took place at a conference on february,during the jury second day of deliberations.id.at.outten counsel briefly mentioned his plans for the penalty hearing to the trial court.shelton counsel indicated that while he had begun interviewing witnesses,he was anticipating a potential dilemma about what he could present at the hearing.nelson shelton counsel stated that he had twelve witnesses,but that his client might not want to present any mitigating evidence.id.
later that day,after the jury returned its guilty verdict,the trial court asked counsel,in the presence of the defendants,what each of their clients intended to present at the penalty hearing.outten counsel stated that they planned to present mitigating evidence at the hearing,but shelton and his brother stated that they would not be presenting such evidence.shelton also stated that he wanted to proceed without counsel.id.
shelton counsel explained to the court 
your honor,my client has advised me that he has maintained his innocence throughout this trial,and that if he was found guilty,he has no wish to bring any family members or anyone else in his behalf into this courtroom to plea for him.he does not wish to plea for mercy.he does not wish to plea for mercy in any way.he does not wish to put in any mitigating circumstances whatsoever.he prepared to take whatever faces him.he instructed me that i am not to put on mitigating factors in his behalf,and he just now told me that he does not wish me to represent him any further that he giving notice to the court that he wishes to represent himself and that i am not to say much more than that for him at this point.
the trial court then asked shelton counsel what he had done in preparation for the penalty phase of the trial 
counsel well,your honor,i just spent the last three and a half hours with his family,his mother and his sister.they were my original plan.they are two witnesses that i originally intended to call in his behalf.
the court what were they going to say 
counsel your honor,they were going to talk about his life,what kind of kid he was,what kind of upbringing he had,all the difficulties in his life,what kind of a family 
shelton it none of your business what my family has to say in my behalf.
the court i have to make a record.numerous court opinions have made that quite clear.what they would have gone into,counselor.
counsel your honor,his childhood,his upbringing,his life,their relationship with him.
the court based on your discussion with them,were there any other witnesses or areas that you might have wanted to explore such as schooling or things like that 
counsel nothing like that,your honor,no.there would be a real strong possibility that if i had my way,if my client would have so allowed me,i would be calling also his nieces.
the court for what purpose 
counsel and perhaps his for the same reason,your honor,to show the family relationship and their love for him.
next the trial court inquired about counsel discussions with shelton concerning counsel preparation for the penalty phase of the proceedings 
the court how much of this have you discussed with shelton,particularly apparently because you were in your office a little while ago discussing these matters with 
counsel your honor,shelton has from very early on told me his position in this regard,and i told him what my intentions were.he,in fact,instructed me not to talk to his mother and not to talk to his sister,and to absolutely 
the court when did he tell you that 
counsel just in the past couple of days when i told him of the dilemma your honor,i told him that as an officer of the court i felt that i had to at least prepare because your honor could very possibly rule against me and him on his position in this regard so that therefore i was to this court to prepare something.he advised me that it was his strongest wishes that i not do that and,if i may,for the record,your honor,shelton has advised sic will not now allow his mother even to visit him in prison because he does not want to cause anyone more pain or hurt in his family.he wants to remove himself from those people.he does not wish to have them be put in here and be put through this.that his sincere and honest wishes,your honor.
the court asked counsel for his views on shelton decision not to present mitigating evidence 
the court as his counsel,are you indicating that you disagree with his decision to not present mitigating evidence 
counsel your honor,because i could possibly save him from the death penalty,i do.however,your honor,i believe that his dignity as a human being comes first,and my duty to him as an attorney goes to that issue first,and i also believe,your honor,as my client has said to me in this case,i have maintained my innocence throughout,but this case is so horrible there nothing i can say that would make any difference to this jury and as a strategic matter,he feels that the jury would hold him in a higher regard,in a higher respect,if he said nothing,and in that regard,your honor,i believe that its possible that the jury could say and feel that if we presented no mitigating circumstances,that they could feel by the man silence and acceptance of his position that that is a more honorable,better thing that he doing than to parade witnesses in here in his behalf,and they could,in fact,find that that single silence overweighed the aggravating factors.so i think there a distinct possibility,i have to say,your i agree with my client that he entitled to the human dignity to go to his death if need be without fighting it and without having to come into this courtroom.as he said,i will not crawl,i will not be part of begging for mercy from anyone,and i believe that he is absolutely entitled to that dignity.that perhaps,your honor,may be his last opportunity.
the trial court then addressed shelton directly 
the court y ou asked for some time to collect your thoughts and maybe talk to trial counsel.i do know whether you spoke to trial counsel.have you had enough time as of the moment to collect your thoughts about this 
shelton yes,i have,your honor.
the court go a head.
shelton in light of the decision of the jury,i wish to dismiss my lawyer.i wish to further represent myself in this penalty phase.i feel that trial counsel has made his application to me.i paid him.he made his application to me as far as representing me through this trial even though i felt that he was insufficient in representing me through the trial,that the court has denied me my right,i feel,since i paid for him,my right or decision to dismiss him during the trial.during this penalty phase i wish to represent myself.in respect to the victim family,i do not wish to have my family in here in front of the jurors.the court has found me guilty or the jurors has sic found me guilty of the evidence that the state has presented to them.i wish or i plead with the court to use the evidence that the state has presented them with in the penalty hearing.i still retain my innocence in this matter,and what i doing is asking the court to use the evidence which they convicted me on.
the court they do.that almost automatic if you will.
shelton then what i asking the court is not to allow me or my attorney which i do want him to do anyway,to flaunt my family in front of the jurors and in front of the victim family.i accept the decision,and i am asking the court that i do wish to flaunt any 
the court how long have you been thinking about this shelton 
shelton quite sometime.
the court can you tell me or put some time frame on that are you talking about days,hours or what 
shelton months.
the court that if it got to this stage,you did want to have anything said at the penalty phase 
shelton yes,sir.
the court when did you and trial counsel ever first talk about that or when did you ever first tell him in relation to this trial that that was your wish 
shelton months ago.
the court he mentioned before we recessed the fact that these were your wishes from early on i think were his words.you expressed to him some months ago that you desired that if you were found guilty of first degree murder,you did not want any mitigating evidence presented to the jury at the penalty phase 
shelton that is true.
the court do you understand that you have the right to call witnesses to come in here and testify in front of this jury about why a life sentence should be appropriate that mitigating evidence.
shelton i understand that completely.
the court you sure 
shelton yeah.yes,i understand that completely,and i do not want it.
counsel explained his own position on the matter 
your honor,as i have discussed,as we have discussed this and was first mentioned many,many months ago.it was my sincere hope that shelton would not pursue this avenue and that he would allow me to speak in his behalf,and in fact,i urged him,if not for him,for the other two gentlemen or for anybody whoever may come down after him that there may be something said against capital punishment and in behalf of a sentence of life rather than death.he has throughout our discussions maintained a very straightforward and competent attitude to me that it was a sincere,honest,firm desire that he did not wish to be part of any sort of a plea or a request for mercy that it not his way,it not in him that the jury has found him guilty and he ready to take his medicine.
concerned that shelton had not fully considered the implications of his decision,the trial court instructed shelton to spend additional time thinking about his request.id.at.the following day,february,in accordance with state procedural rules,shelton counsel submitted to the court and the prosecution a letter setting forth potential mitigating factors id.the full text of the letter reads as follows

counsel now,your honor,one other point.you have asked shelton about what i explained yesterday,and i not sure if i am expressing his words.i would say that we initially talked maybe it answers your honor question,shelton said to me at one point,my feeling is that this was such a grievous,horrible murder,that there is nothing i could put in front of the jury that would make them have enough mercy on me to give me life rather than death,and in fact,begging for mercy in front of this jury may have an adverse effect.they may feel that because,after being found guilty of this crime,if i come in here and plead for mercy,that may turn them off,and make them want to give me death.they may think less of me as a man if i plead for mercy.so as a strategic matter,there is the potential that he would be better off in getting a life sentence by saying to the jury,i have nothing to say.i will not will not put on mitigating circumstances and i will allow you to make your decision on the evidence the state has put forward,and that a jury may very well look at that and say,here is a man who has been found guilty and is not going to plead for mercy,and we respect him for that that was the discussion that steve and i have had.i hope i not saying something he does want me to say because when you asked him that question,he did respond that way.
shelton that pretty close.
the trial court then engaged shelton in a lengthy discussion.the court reviewed with shelton several of the mitigating factors set forth in counsel february letter,which shelton said he had already reviewed with counsel.id.at.the trial court explained to shelton that if he did not present any evidence to the jury at the penalty hearing,the jury would not hear about any of these potentially mitigating circumstances.shelton repeated that he understood the consequences of his decision.id.the trial court thereafter ruled that shelton could proceed pro se and his attorney was appointed as standby counsel.id.at.

with respect to the scope of the mitigating evidence that would be presented,counsel explained 
counsel i submitted a list to your honor of mitigating circumstances.i intended to call several witnesses to produce that.already in our discussions,shelton has advised me that i will not be able to call those witnesses.there possibly one witness who will be called for three or four very brief questions.and in fact,my list of questions that i prepared for that witness,i have this morning reviewed with shelton,and he advised me that he will not allow me to even ask some of those questions.and he tells me that sometime later today,we will meet and will hone down those questions to the one witness to his liking.and i would be permitted to ask only those questions,and then give my closing arguments.there may be more than one witness.
the court you just want to keep your options open 
counsel yes,your honor.
the court is that correct,shelton 
shelton that is correct.
the court again questioned shelton directly about his decision 
the court trial counsel has indicated there are some matters of the he listed in his letter of potential mitigating circumstances here,mitigating factors,that you do not want some of them presented to the jury.is that correct 
shelton that correct.
the court and you would like him to stay in this case as y our attorney,and have him represent you,but on the condition that you be able to decide to present certain of those matters but to not present other matters.is that correct 
shelton that is correct.only what i instruct him to bring up is basically all that i would want him to bring out.i understand trial counsel position against the death penalty,and i respect that decision,as he respects my decision,and i feel that i not doing nothing unethical in his belief as far as his representation of me.
the court how,if you retain the right to not present some or any,shall we say,of the items he listed in the letter,okay,do you understand that you may or you be or you are keeping from the jury and from me certain mitigating factors 
shelton i understand that completely.
the joint penalty hearing for outten and the shelton brothers commenced with opening statements by the prosecution and the defense.shelton counsel stated to the jury my client has instructed me to advise you that he will not be begging for his life in this case.id.at.
the prosecution then presented evidence relating to shelton prior criminal history,including testimony about shelton conviction for rape,his conviction for assault,his assault of a fellow inmate while incarcerated for the rape,and his arrests in and for robbery and driving under the influence.id.at.
the defense then presented its mitigation case to the jury.shelton older,edward,and two older,dorothy and louise,were the only witnesses to testify on his behalf.edward explained that there were eleven children in the shelton household.five children were from their father previous marriage and four were from shelton mother previous marriage.shelton and his brother nelson were the only two biological children of both parents.id.at.edward stated that their father had lost both of his legs in a work accident,drank a lot,beat his children regularly while rarely,if ever,expressing affection.edward said that shelton was very upset when their father died in.id.with respect to his own life,edward testified that when he was twelve years old,he contacted a social worker to help him get out of the house.he described his own problems with violence and substance abuse,explaining that he had only recently managed to straighten himself out.id.
shelton,dorothy,testified that she had moved out of the house when she was a teenager because of the anger and violence there.dorothy explained that her parents 
were incapable of handling the task they took on.and the task was a blended family,which developed into nine children,which developed into eleven.there was a lot of pressure in raising that number of children in such a small environment.my father had suffered many hardships.and i think through those hardships,he resorted to alcohol.he lost his legs.he was in a coma for encephalitis,and they thought he would never come out of it,but he did.he developed cancer.he developed diabetes.he eventually lost his voice.
id.at.dorothy went on to describe the abuse 
there were times when they would come home at night after being out drinking,and we would be called downstairs.sometimes we were beaten with a leather strap,which left welts on our legs,blood welts.and when i was a child,we were not allowed to wear pants to school,and we did go to school because of the marks.they were embarrassing.
id.at.dorothy stated that after she moved out of the house,she was not surprised to learn that shelton,who was seven or eight at the time,was having trouble in school and getting into a lot of fights.id.
louise,seven years older than shelton,testified that she saw shelton change from a happy child to an upset one around the third or fourth grade.according to louise,their father would call the children belittling names and curse them.louise stated that when shelton was ten or eleven,he was forced,even on school nights,to go to bars and bring his drunk father home in his wheelchair.louise testified that,around this time,shelton started becoming truant in school,eventually resulting in his incarceration at the ferris school.louise also said that because their father was often drunk,he did not notice that shelton had begun drinking at an early age.id.at.
according to louise,because they were one of the few white families in a predominantly community,shelton got into a lot of fights with other kids in the neighborhood,which added to his difficulties in school.id.at.louise stated that she too missed a lot of school and spent at least one year during high school in a juvenile home.id.at.
louise testified that despite his many problems,shelton was a loving and caring brother.she explained that after shelton was released from prison after his rape conviction,he visited her and her family quite frequently.she also noted that,around this time,shelton worked for her and her family during the day,and held a job at night.finally,louise testified that shelton helped another one of their sisters repair her home and that,when shelton earned money he helped his mother pay her bills.id.no other mitigating evidence was presented to the jury.
after the jury was excused,the trial court again questioned shelton directly about his mitigation case.shelton stated that he and counsel had consulted and agreed not to present additional witnesses,and that he was satisfied with the questions already asked of the witnesses.when the jury returned,shelton made the following brief statement to the jury 
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,i stand before you not to plead for my life.i feel that wrong and improper and basically disrespectful to the victim family and to mine.the state has painted a picture,and that picture is not very pretty,pertaining to me and my.and i would just like to present to the jury a different side or a different meaning to steven shelton.the state has pictured me as being a monster,as being a rapist,as being a violent individual,that not so.the state only presents one side of the picture.there two sides to every story.and the state just presents a negative side.the jury has found me guilty of these allegations,and now it the jury turn to render a verdict.and that verdict is either life or death.again,i not here to plead for my life,but just ask the jury to be fair in their decisions.that all i have to say.
two days later,the jury unanimously decided that the evidence showed beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of three statutory aggravating circumstances the murder was committed during a robbery the murder was committed for pecuniary gain and the victim was more than years old.shelton iv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.by a vote of eight to four,the jury found by a preponderance of the evidence that the statutory and aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances presented by the defense.accordingly,the jury recommended that shelton receive a death sentence.id.the trial court agreed and,on april,shelton was sentenced to death by lethal injection id.at,dist.lexis,at.
direct appeal 
shelton raised six principal arguments on appeal to the delaware supreme court the state negligently failed to secure and preserve certain key physical evidence introduced by the prosecution the trial court erred in finding gibbons to be a competent witness the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the burden of proof for aggravating circumstances the trial court improperly excluded certain defense witness testimony the trials should have been severed and the prosecution exercised at least one of its peremptory challenges in violation of batson kentucky,d.finding that shelton failed to show that the trial court committed any errors of law or abused its discretion,the delaware supreme court affirmed his sentence.shelton i,at.
state relief proceedings 
after the denial of his direct appeal,shelton filed a motion for relief in the delaware superior court.shelton asserted a number of errors arising out of the penalty phase of the proceedings the trial court erred in conducting a joint penalty hearing trial counsel was ineffective for not requesting a separate hearing appellate counsel failed to raise the severance issue on direct appeal the trial court impermissibly restricted his right to allocution trial and appellate counsel were ineffective in not raising the allocution issue trial counsel was ineffective in his preparation and presentation of mitigating evidence the prosecutor made an improper statement concerning shelton allocution and trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for not raising the issue of prosecutorial misconduct.shelton ii,wl,at.
the delaware superior court rejected each of these arguments.id.at.the decision was subsequently affirmed by the delaware supreme court.shelton iii,at.
federal habeas petition 
having exhausted his state court remedies,shelton filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of delaware on february.after the district court appointed counsel,shelton filed an amended petition,asserting six grounds for relief his right to a fair trial was violated by the trial court admission of testimony about his prior criminal history the trial court improperly limited the scope of his allocution the prosecutor closing remarks regarding shelton lack of remorse violated his fifth amendment right against he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel in violation of the sixth and fourteenth amendments the delaware death penalty statute under which he was convicted and sentenced to death was unconstitutional the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury regarding the burden of proof for aggravating circumstances.shelton iv,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
the district court rejected each of these arguments,but granted a certificate of appealability with respect to the two claims raised in this appeal.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over shelton habeas petition under.we have appellate jurisdiction under and.because the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing on these claims,our review of the district court legal conclusions is plenary.jacobs horn,cir.
provides that an application for a writ of habeas corpus can not be granted on a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in the state court unless the adjudication resulted in a decision that was either contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
a state court decision is contrary to supreme court precedent under d,if the state court reached a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.jacobs,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the state court decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established law,under d if the state court unreasonably applies the correct supreme court precedent to the facts of a case or unreasonably extends or refuses to extend that precedent to a new context where it should or should not apply.id.the unreasonable application test is an objective federal court may not grant habeas relief merely because it concludes that the state court applied federal law erroneously or incorrectly.id.
we have previously held that our analysis under is a two step process.matteo superintendent,sci albion,cir en banc.first,we identify the applicable supreme court precedent and determine whether it resolves the petitioner claim.id.at.if we determine that the state court decision was not contrary to the applicable body of supreme court because the state court decision complies with the supreme court rule governing the claim,or because no such rule has been we should undertake the second step of analyzing whether the decision was based on an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.id.at.
iii.discussion 
shelton argues on appeal that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance at the penalty phase,and the trial court improperly limited his right of allocution.we address each argument in turn.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
mitigation evidence at the penalty hearing 
on the day the jury returned its verdict,shelton counsel informed the trial court that he had interviewed shelton mother and sister for approximately three and hours the previous day and intended to call both women as witnesses at the penalty hearing.counsel also stated that he was considering calling other family members as witnesses to testify on shelton behalf,including shelton brother edward and two of shelton nieces.counsel explained that he planned to focus on what kind of kid shelton was,what kind of upbringing he had,all the difficulties in his life,and to show the family relationship and their love for him.shelton ii,wl,at.the trial court asked counsel whether there were any other areas that he might have wanted to explore such as schooling or things like that counsel responded in the negative.id.counsel submitted a letter to the court the following day that identified mitigating factors which largely echoed the themes identified to the court the previous day.id.at.
as noted,at the penalty hearing,three witnesses testified on shelton,dorothy and louise,and his,edward.shelton siblings recounted their parents abuse,difficulties that shelton faced in school and in their neighborhood,and his otherwise dysfunctional upbringing.the siblings also described shelton close relationship with several members of his family.no other as family court records,social service agency records,or expert reports or presented to the jury.
reports prepared for proceedings for relief 
in his state court proceedings for relief,shelton submitted two lengthy reports prepared by pamela taylor,a licensed clinical social worker.taylor reports were the product of her detailed interviews with shelton,shelton mother,several of shelton sisters,and a number of individuals who knew shelton during his childhood and adolescence.taylor also reviewed various other records,including records from the family court and shelton schools,as well as reports prepared by jeffrey janofsky,a psychiatrist who examined shelton in late,and by david schretlen,a psychologist who evaluated shelton around the same time.id.at.
in her initial,page report,taylor opined 
based upon my evaluation of shelton and review of the penalty phase transcript of his trial,it is my opinion in relation to this trial that the defense council sic investigation and ensuing presentation of available mitigating evidence in this case were seriously deficient.as a result,mitigating factors were not adequately supported,nor fairly represented for the court consideration.
id.at.in this regard,taylor listed fourteen factors that she identified as mitigating 
mother alcohol consumption during pregnancy with shelton.
dysfunctional rearing by alcoholic parents.
physical abuse during formative years.
emotional abuse during formative years.
stressful home environment during early development.
additional childhood experiences of physical and emotional victimization by peer group,as minority member of a predominantly neighborhood.
prevailing negative family reputation and associated negative expectations,which preceded shelton in the school and court systems.
