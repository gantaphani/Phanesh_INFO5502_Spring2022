the petition for panel rehearing is denied.the prior opinion,brewer dretke,cir,is withdrawn,and the following opinion is substituted 
before jolly,smith and garza,circuit judges.
jerry smith,circuit judge 
the district court conditionally granted,pursuant to,death row inmate brent brewer petition for writ of habeas corpus,holding that the special issues submitted during his punishment phase were a constitutionally inadequate vehicle for the jury to give effect to his mitigating evidence.the state appeals on the grounds that the court failed properly to assess the reasonableness of the state court adjudication as required by d and correctly to apply valid supreme court and fifth circuit precedent.we reverse and render judgment denying the habeas petition.
brewer was sentenced to death for a murder committed during a robbery.at trial,he introduced a variety of mitigating evidence,including the following facts that he had a bout with depression three months before the murder that he was briefly hospitalized for that depression that his,a woman with whom he was apparently obsessed,dominated and manipulated him that he had been abused by his father that he had witnessed his father abuse his mother and that he had abused drugs brewer did not secure expert psychological or psychiatric evidence because of a decision,made in consultation with his attorney,that such material would not be in his best interest.brewer submitted at least seven proposed instructions designed to give effect to the mitigating evidence that he did present,but the trial court denied all of those instructions and,instead,required only that the jury answer two special questions relating to deliberateness and potential for future dangerousness.
the conviction was affirmed on direct appeal after which brewer initiated what were ultimately unsuccessful state habeas proceedings he then filed the instant federal habeas petition.after requesting supplemental briefing concerning tennard dretke,d,the district court,as we have said,granted conditional relief.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,at d,sets forth the conditions under which a court shall grant a petition for a writ of habeas corpus 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
section d addresses pure questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact.see martin cain,cir.under the first contrary to clause,a federal district court may grant habeas relief if the state court decided a case differently from how the united states supreme court decided a case on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.under the second unreasonable application clause,a court may grant habeas relief if the state court correctly divined a legal principle from the supreme court jurisprudence but misapplied that principle to the facts.see id.
section d addresses pure questions of fact.see moore johnson,cir.under this subsection,federal courts must give deference to state court findings of fact unless they are based on an unreasonable interpretation of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding 
we review the federal district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.see martinez johnson,cir.the legal conclusion at issue is the holding that r eviewing the evidence in light of the special issues,a jury would be very hard pressed to see the evidence presented as anything but aggravating.failure to submit an instruction on mitigation evidence was an unreasonable application of federal law and supreme court precedent.section d therefore controls our review,and we conduct a de novo inquiry to determine whether the state court decision is contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established supreme court precedent we do so here by analyzing de novo the federal district court decision to see whether it properly decided that the state court did not satisfy d.
the trial court instructed the jury,pursuant to article of the texas code of criminal procedure vernon,as follows 
special issue 
do you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct of the defendant,brent ray brewer,that caused the death of the deceased,robert doyle laminack,was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased would result 
special issue 
do you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that the defendant,brent ray brewer,would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society 
we consider it appropriate to devote significant space to discussing the jurisprudence associated with article.in jurek texas,d,the court upheld the texas statutory special issues approach in the punishment phase of capital trials,but did so on the explicit premise that the special issues were capable of an expansive construction to capture proper mitigation evidence.in franklin lynaugh,d,the court made plain that,at least with respect to some mitigation evidence,deviating from the special issues approach is not necessary.specifically,it found the dangerousness special issue was capable of capturing evidence of the petitioner good behavior while incarcerated.
in penry lynaugh,d penry i,the court held that the two special issues were not sufficient to give mitigating effect to penry evidence of mental retardation and a history of abuse.it stated that each of those factors represents a sword each may diminish the petitioner blameworthiness for his crime even as it indicates there is a probability that he will be dangerous in the future.id.at.
four years after penry i,the court decided johnson texas,d,in which the defendant invoked penry i in an attempt to invalidate his death sentence imposed despite his evidence of youth.see id.at.the future dangerousness issue alone,the court concluded,gave the jurors a constitutionally sufficient vehicle for considering johnson youth in making its reasoned moral response it strains credulity to suppose that the jury would have viewed the evidence of petitioner youth as outside its effective reach in answering the second special issue.id.
after johnson,therefore,it was indisputable that jurek remained good law and that,although some relevant evidence may receive constitutionally insufficient mitigating effect under the standard texas special issues,evidence of mental retardation,other evidence is quite capable of being given mitigating effect through that methodology.when mitigating evidence falls into that latter category,the imposition of the death penalty under the i scheme does not offend the eighth amendment.
in following penry i,this court developed a test for determining whether the defendant evidence requires a special mitigation instruction whether the proffered material was constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence and whether the proffered evidence was beyond the effective reach of the jurors we in turn defined constitutionally relevant evidence as that which was due to the uniquely severe permanent handicaps with which the defendant was burdened through no fault of his own in tennard,however,the supreme court flatly rejected that test of constitutional relevance and instructed us instead that the definition of relevance in this context is no different from the definition of relevance in most others any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence 
for the mitigating evidence to be within the effective reach of the jury in answering the special issues,the special interrog
