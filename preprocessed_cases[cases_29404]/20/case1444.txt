robert scuba was convicted in geauga county,ohio,on one count of aggravated robbery and one count of felonious assault.after a lengthy appeals process,scuba filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.the district court dismissed scuba petition,finding that he had procedurally defaulted his state court claims.because we agree,the dismissal of scuba habeas petition is affirmed.
background 
for the purposes of this appeal,the parties agree to the facts that unfolded on september.on that day,scuba and two others,brandishing weapons,entered the home of gordon faith.during a struggle,scuba grabbed faith by his hair and threw him down.he then bound faith arms and legs with duct tape,beat him,and threatened to shoot him.while the others were searching the house,a smoke alarm sounded,causing all three intruders to flee.eventually,faith managed to summon help and was taken to the hospital where he was treated for fractures to his eye socket and skull,broken ribs and nose,and numerous lacerations.upon scuba conviction in,the trial court sentenced scuba to ten years on the first count aggravated robbery,seven years on the second count felonious assault,and three years for the firearms violation,all to be served consecutively.
with the assistance of his trial counsel,scuba appealed his conviction and sentence on five grounds.relevant to the current appeal,scuba raised the following arguments as his fourth and fifth grounds respectively the trial judge abused his discretion by sentencing the appellant to consecutive terms of incarceration when the factual findings relied on were against the manifest weight of the evidence and the trial court committed reversible error when sentencing appellant to the maximum prison term allowed under the sentencing guidelines for aggravated robbery because such sentence was not supported by the record.the appellate court affirmed scuba conviction and the consecutive nature of his sentences but remanded the case because t he trial court must and failed to adequately state its reasons for imposing the maximum sentence pursuant to ohio statutory law.
prior to his and with the assistance of new counsel,scuba filed a notice of appeal along with a motion for delayed appeal in the supreme court of ohio.the supreme court granted the motion but ultimately dismissed the appeal as not involving any substantial constitutional question.none of scuba assignments of error to the supreme court invoked federal constitutional issues.additionally,scuba only claim related to his sentence was that t he trial court abused its discretion in sentencing to consecutive terms when the trial court merely recites the statutory provisions and the evidence was against the manifest weight of the evidence.
at his,the trial court permitted scuba to represent himself pro se but appointed a standby legal advisor.the trial court imposed the same sentence,with the exception that scuba received nine years for aggravated robbery,rather than his initial ten.his sentences were again to be served consecutively.
scuba appealed this sentence as well,raising three claims of error.the appellate court concluded that two issues were barred as res judicata.that court noted that it had already addressed the issue of consecutive sentences in scuba first appeal,and scuba failed to raise the issue that he was issued excessive prison terms as a punishment for failing to enter a plea agreement in his initial appeal.scuba third assignment of error,based on the denial of his motion for the trial judge to recuse for,was dismissed as moot because the ohio supreme court had already denied an affidavit of disqualification from scuba.
next,after nearly four years of legal challenges,scuba appealed pro se to the supreme court,alleging two assignments of error 
whether the appellant was denied due process of law under article i,of the ohio constitution and the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution,when the appellate court failed to adjudicate and reach the merit of appointed appellate counsels sic motion for leave to appeal consecutive sentences as allied offenses of sic similar import alternatively,application for reopening.
whether appellant was deprived of his rights under the fifth amendment of the united states constitution from double jeopardy because the trial and appellate court s failed to apply the allied offenses of similar import to appellant convictions 
the supreme court dismissed the appeal as not involving any substantial constitutional question on august.
scuba long litigation project also produced several collateral motions including an untimely application to reopen appellant original direct appeal pursuant to ohio rule of appellate procedure b.scuba filed the application while his appeal was still pending with the appellate court.under rule b,a defendant has ninety days to file an application for reopening.
the appellate court issued its judgment triggering the deadline on or about november.in his application,scuba alleged that all three attorneys who acted as his counsel at various times were ineffective.specifically,he contended that his counsel were collectively ineffective for failing to file an application to reopen within the deadline.scuba further argued that he had been denied due process of law for a variety of reasons and that he was deprived of his fifth amendment protection from double jeopardy,regarding his consecutive sentences for aggravated robbery and felonious assault.the eleventh district court of appeals dismissed the application on april,based upon scuba failure to show cause why he waited over two and years to file an application for reopening.
scuba original petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to was filed on july.the district court dismissed that petition without prejudice,as scuba appeal was still pending in state court.scuba then filed his current pro se petition on august,raising eight grounds for relief.because scuba only contested the state of writ with regard to three of his claims for relief,only those three grounds remain relevant to this appeal.the grounds are as follows 
ground one petitioner was deprived of his fourteenth amendment rights because the district court of appeals failed to properly adjudicate,barred by the doctrine of res judicata,appellate counsel motion to leave to appeal consecutive sentences as allied offenses of similar import,alternatively,application for reopening 
ground two petitioner was deprived of his rights under the fifth amendment from double jeopardy as applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment because the trial court failed to apply allied offenses of similar import to petitioner s convictions,and by the appellate court dismissal of the issue on appeal,barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
ground five petitioner was deprived of his fourteenth amendment rights because the district court of appeals dismissed,failed to adjudicate petitioner s application for reopening raising a viable issue petitioner was denied choice of counsel prior to trial depriving him of his sixth and fourteenth amendment rights.
the magistrate judge concluded that scuba claims were procedurally defaulted and,therefore,recommended that his petition be dismissed.the district court adopted the report and recommendation r r on the same grounds pursuant to.
ii.analysis 
the state argues that scuba waived his right to appeal the dismissal of his habeas petition by failing to file objections,or move for an extension of time to object,to the magistrate judge r r within the prescribed time period.the r r contained the following notice any objections to this report and recommendation must be filed with the clerk of courts within ten days of receipt of this notice.failure to file objections within the specified time waives the right to appeal the district court order.the r r was dated and entered on may.the district court entered an order adopting the r r on june.the next day,scuba motion to extend time for filing objections to magistrate judge report and recommendation was entered on the docket.
scuba contends that he received the r r,and first notice thereof,on or about may,as he was an incarcerated pro se petitioner.nothing in the record suggests to the contrary.according to fed.civ.a,w hen the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than days,intermediate saturdays,sundays,and legal holidays shall be excluded from the computation.as such,excluding may,june,and as weekend days and may,as memorial day,the deadline for scuba to file objections was june.although scuba motion was not entered on the docket until june,the certificate of service indicates that it was sent via mail on may.therefore,pursuant to the federal pro se prisoner mailbox rule,scuba motion was filed at the time petitioner delivered it to the prison authorities for forwarding to the court clerk.houston lack,d see also pennell,app cir pro se prisoner mailbox rule applied to response to motion to dismiss civil complaint.accordingly,scuba timely moved the district court for additional time to object to the magistrate judge r because the district court improperly denied scuba motion for being out of time to object,this court exercises jurisdiction over the instant appeal.
procedural default 
the sixth circuit employs a test to determine whether procedural default is a bar to a petitioner claims.maupin smith,cir.first,the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner claim and that the petitioner failed to comply with the rule.id.at citations omitted.second,the court must decide whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction.id.citations omitted see also coleman thompson,d.third,the state procedural forfeiture must be an adequate and independent state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim.maupin,at.finally,if these three prerequisites are met,the petitioner must demonstrate under sykes that there was cause for him to not follow the procedural rule and that he was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.id.citing in part wainwright sykes,d.
scuba first two grounds for relief in his habeas petition are procedurally distinct from his final ground for relief.his first two grounds are based upon his direct appeals in state court and pertain to his challenge of the consecutive nature of his sentences.scuba final ground for relief labeled as his fifth ground is based on the state court of appeals denial of his application to reopen appellant original direct appeal as untimely.this court has ruled that an application to reopen a direct appeal in ohio under rule b is a collateral attack to a defendant conviction and is not part of a direct appeal.lopez wilson,cir.therefore,the issues of procedural default on direct appeal are considered separately from issues of default on collateral attack,as set forth below.
consecutive sentences 
in his first appeal,scuba argued that the trial judge abused his discretion by sentencing the appellant to consecutive terms of incarceration when the factual findings relied on were against the manifest weight of the evidence.the court of appeals affirmed the lower court on this issue but remanded for on scuba conviction for aggravated robbery.on appeal from his,scuba argued that the trial court committed error by imposing consecutive sentences on convictions that clearly arose from allied offenses of similar import.the court of appeals affirmed the lower court,finding that it had already considered the nature of scuba sentences as consecutive in scuba first appeal and that his assignment of error was barred as res judicata.
as a matter of comity for the states capacity and duty to enforce federal law,a habeas petitioner is first required to fairly present his federal claims in state court before seeking relief in the federal court.whiting burt,cir citing baldwin reese,d.the sixth circuit employs a test in determining whether a petitioner has properly asserted both the factual and legal basis in state court for his constitutional claim.id.at.the court examines the petitioner claims in state court for 
reliance upon federal cases employing constitutional analysis reliance upon state cases employing federal constitutional analysis phrasing the claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms sufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional right or alleging facts well within the mainstream of constitutional law.
id.quoting mcmeans brigano,cir.
in his first direct appeal,scuba challenged his consecutive sentences for aggravated robbery and felonious assault on purely state law grounds.he contended that the trial judge factual findings were not supported by the record.thus,scuba claimed,the trial judge failed to lay a proper factual foundation for the imposition of consecutive sentences under ohio statutory law.ohio ann.e.
on appeal from his,scuba argued that because his aggravated robbery and felonious assault charges were allied offenses of similar import under ohio revised code a,it was error to sentence him consecutively for the violation of these counts.pursuant to a,if multiple offenses are of similar import,the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses,but the defendant may be convicted of only one.ohio code ann.a.had scuba presented this issue in his original appeal,he would have satisfied the fair presentation criteria for asserting a fifth amendment,double jeopardy clause,challenge to his consecutive sentencing.ohio allied offense statute compliments federal double jeopardy jurisprudence,and the state courts consult federal jurisprudence as informative of what does and does not constitute an allied offense of similar import.see supra.furthermore,scuba brief specifically cited the double jeopardy clause and discussed the seminal federal constitutional case on double jeopardy,blockburger united states.id.nevertheless,the court of appeals properly found that scuba had already presented and lost an appeal on the consecutive nature of his sentences,thereby precluding his claim.scuba,therefore,had a full and fair opportunity to litigate his constitutional claim in his original direct appeal and failed to do so.
a review of the maupin factors supports the conclusion that scuba procedurally defaulted his allied jeopardy claims.ohio has a rule that claims must be raised on direct appeal if possible otherwise,res judicata bars their litigation in subsequent state proceedings.this rule was consistently applied in scuba case.seymour walker,cir see jacobs mohr,cir ohio doctrine of res judicata is an independent and adequate state ground under maupin.
because the state court had an adequate basis for determining that scuba defaulted his fifth offense claim for purposes of his second direct appeal,scuba is left with the burden of demonstrating both cause for not raising his constitutional claim in his original direct appeal and prejudice resulting from the alleged constitutional error.maupin,at.scuba contends that his counsels ineffective assistance supplies the requisite cause.
discussing that very proposition,this court has held that 
while ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute cause,the mere fact that counsel failed to recognize the factual or legal basis for a claim,or failed to raise the claim despite recognizing it,does not constitute cause for a procedural default.in fact,the existence of cause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel efforts to comply with the state procedural rule.
rust zent,cir citation omitted.the court can not find here that the failure of scuba counsel to raise an allied by implication,double on his first appeal amounted to cause sufficient to excuse procedural default.regardless,such failure resulted in no actual prejudice to scuba.
the court will also not ignore the obvious conviction and consecutive sentencing for both aggravated robbery and felonious assault is constitutionally sufficient under the fifth amendment pursuant to blockburger.while felonious assault requires proof that the defendant c ause d or attempt ed to cause physical harm to another,ohio ann
