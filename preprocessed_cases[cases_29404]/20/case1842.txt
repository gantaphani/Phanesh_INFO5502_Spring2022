appellant james smith is currently serving a sentence for a armed robbery conviction in the circuit court of milwaukee county,wisconsin.in,smith petitioned the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.in his petition,smith claimed,inter alia,that he was denied his sixth amendment right to counsel during his state jury trial.the district court dismissed the petition.we find merit in smith claims and remand to the district court with orders to issue the writ.
background 
smith was arrested in early on a charge of armed robbery.following his arrest,wisconsin office of the state public defender appointed smith first counsel,assistant public defender steven sargent.at a status hearing held march,sargent informed the court that smith desired a new attorney.smith,who was present at the hearing,told the court that he was not interested in another lawyer from the public defender office.smith said that he wanted the public defender to appoint thomas marola,an attorney in private practice,to handle his case.marola had defended smith at a recent trial in which a jury acquitted smith of both sexual assault and armed robbery.
if the public defender office would not appoint marola,smith insisted that he would represent himself.the court conducted a cursory examination of smith,inquiring about his education and experience with the judicial system.the court then concluded the hearing,leaving both representation options open w e can work it out with the public defender office,however they want to do it.you can represent yourself,or they appoint a lawyer for you.at the march hearing,smith also reiterated a previous request for a speedy trial.
a week later,on march,the court held a status hearing in smith absence at which thomas wilmouth,smith second appointed counsel,entered his appearance.the court set the trial date for may,which it later changed to may.
the next status hearing occurred on may,with both smith and wilmouth present.at that hearing,wilmouth moved to withdraw as smith attorney,a sentiment echoed by smith,who also requested new representation.wilmouth said that he had spoken with the wisconsin public defender office and they indicated at this point that they have a mind to appoint a third lawyer.the court granted the motion.the court then allowed smith to be heard pro se on a motion related to his bond,but it continued to indicate its expectation that smith would be represented by counsel at trial i grant the motion wilmouth on the condition that a new attorney should be appointed as quickly as possible w e can see who the new lawyer is and when he be ready to go to trial.
the court held its final pretrial hearing on may.smith appeared without counsel,and the court informed him that the public defender office had refused to appoint a third attorney.smith claimed this was the first he had heard of this development,but a letter to this effect was apparently sent to wilmouth,his former lawyer.smith reiterated his desire for legal counsel.after more discussion,smith inquired about his options,to which the court responded,well,you can represent yourself.smith reminded the court that at the may hearing,wilmouth had said that the public defender office would appoint smith another lawyer.
later in the hearing,the court conducted another brief examination of smith,asking essentially the same questions that it had at the march hearing.the court learned that smith had graduated from high school and received some vocational training.smith also informed the court that he had been through at least one criminal trial,the aforementioned proceeding during which attorney marola had represented him.smith noted that he had required the help of other inmates to prepare various motions in the present case.near the end of the hearing,smith again expressed his desire for representation,saying,i would like an attorney,but if i ca hire one,i guess i will be representing myself.
the first day of smith trial came on may.from the beginning,smith made it clear that he wished to be represented by counsel.after the court called the case,smith immediately said,the court can appoint me an attorney.the court declined smith request and gave smith an option.he could waive his right to a speedy demand smith had made on march and renewed during his march adjourn that day proceedings,or he could continue in a pro se fashion.smith declined to waive his speedy trial right,and the court said,okay,we go to trial.
smith continued to assert his desire for counsel in the minutes preceding voir dire,saying i do think it right.i asked for an attorney before,the court ignored me no way i can defend myself because i do know anything about the law.
immediately prior to opening statements,smith made a motion to dismiss based on the denial of his right to counsel.in support of his motion,smith said the following the defendant ca possibly defend hisself sic in a court of law defendant is unable to employ counsel and is unable and incapable of making his own defense because of ignorance,feeblemindedness,illiteracy,or the lack thereof.despite smith protestations,the court conducted the trial with smith acting pro se.
on june,the jury found smith guilty of armed robbery in violation of.stat.a.six weeks later,on july,the court sentenced smith to fifteen years in prison.in the years since,smith has traveled a long and twisted road through the wisconsin court system,the details of which are largely irrelevant to the present appeal 
in a decision dated august,the wisconsin court of appeals denied smith direct appeal.the court recounted smith inconsistent behavior during the series of hearings we discussed above,where smith sometimes requested appointed counsel and at other times asserted his right to defend himself.the court highlighted the choice presented to smith by the trial waive his right to trial counsel and proceed pro se or waive his right to a speedy trial and adjourn the smith decision to proceed with the trial.the result,said the court,was that smith,by asserting mutually exclusive constitutional rights one of which was clearly more important to him than the other,waived his right to counsel by operation of law.the court summarized its conclusions as follows by knowingly choosing the frequently inconsistent courses of action he did by repeatedly requesting to discharge counsel and appoint successor counsel at the eleventh hour,by seeking to proceed pro se,and by refusing to waive his speedy trial demand,smith essentially elected to defend himself at his jury trial.
smith journey has now crossed over into the federal court system,where he filed a petition in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin seeking a writ of habeas corpus.see.in the portion of his petition at issue in this appeal,smith argued that he was denied his sixth amendment right to counsel at trial and was therefore being held in violation of the united states constitution.
in an order issued on march,the district court dismissed the petition after concluding that the wisconsin court of appeals did not base its decision on an unreasonable determination of the facts or an unreasonable application of united states law.this appeal follows from that order.
ii.analysis 
we are presented with two issues.first,the state contests the time and manner in which smith filed his notice of appeal and claims that we are left without jurisdiction.second,if we have jurisdiction,we must decide,under our deferential standard of review,whether smith was denied his right to counsel at trial.
a.this court jurisdiction on appeal 
the first issue that we must address is whether we possess jurisdiction to hear this appeal.the state contends that smith did not appeal the district court order of march,in a timely manner.for the following reasons,we disagree and conclude that we have jurisdiction.
the federal rules of appellate procedure dictate that a party wishing to appeal an adverse judgment or order must file a notice of appeal with the clerk of the district court within thirty days of the entry of the contested judgment or order.fed.a a.smith made three filings in that are potentially relevant to our analysis,one on each of the following dates april,april,and june.neither smith nor the state disputes that the notice of appeal filed by smith on june,was untimely.if that were smith only filing,we would have no choice but to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.see remer burlington area sch,cir t he timely filing of a notice of appeal is both mandatory and jurisdictional,and a notice filed too late will preclude appellate jurisdiction.quotations omitted united states ex rel.burton greer,cir.smith two additional filings,however,both came within rule window,and smith now contends that one or both of these served as notices of his appeal,a position the wisconsin attorney general contests.
acting pro se,smith made the first of these filings with the western district of wisconsin on april.in his letter,smith sought to appeal the district court march order directly to the supreme court of the united states.in support,smith cited supreme court rule,which governs the appropriate procedure w hen a direct appeal from a decision of a united states district court is authorized by law.in a letter dated may,the supreme court returned the notice of appeal to the district court,stating that direct appeal of a district court order is permitted only when issued by a district court panel.see.it was after receiving the supreme court response that smith filed his untimely notice of appeal to this court on june.
in the interim period between filing his notice of appeal to the supreme court and receiving the court response,smith,again acting pro se,made a second filing.he filed a document,captioned circuit rule certification of question of state law,with our court on april.this submission,spanning handwritten pages,appears to detail every perceived wrong he endured in the years since the date of the armed robbery.
the question we must answer is one with which we are familiar,particularly when confronted with a pro se party whether either of the filings made within the deadline is sufficient to serve as a valid notice of appeal.generally,a notice of appeal must contain the name of the party or parties taking the appeal designate the judgment or order,or part thereof,being appealed and name the court to which the appeal is being taken.fed.c.
when a party proceeds pro se,however,we will,if possible,liberally construe his actions to find rule requirements satisfied.smith barry,d see,listenbee city of milwaukee,cir recognizing a party motion for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal as the necessary notice of appeal scherer kelley,cir noting that pro se notices of appeal are entitled to a liberal construction where the intent of the appellant is apparent and the adverse party is not prejudiced.our obligation to construe liberally rule dictates,however,does not excuse true noncompliance,which remains fatal to any appeal.barry,at.
in barry,d,the supreme court held that a pro se party appellate brief functioned as his notice of appeal.the court stated that when a filing is technically at variance with rule requirements,a court should construe the filing as a valid notice of appeal if it is the functional equivalent of what the rule requires.id.at.quoting torres oakland scavenger,d.the court then focused its discussion on the purpose of rule,which it said was to provide sufficient notice to other parties and the courts.see also torres,at.united states musa,cir.the court said that i f a document filed within the time specified by rule gives the notice required by rule,it is effective as a notice of appeal.barry,at.
with these general principles in mind,we turn first to smith april filing with the district court,in which he sought direct review by the supreme court of the district court march order.this filing contained both the name of the party taking the appeal and designated the order being appealed,thus satisfying rule c first two requirements.see fed.c a b.the only variance from rule was in the name of the court to which the appeal was being taken.see id.c c.instead of seeking appeal to this court as he should have,smith sought to appeal directly to the supreme court.this was a error.
when a party may appeal only to a certain court,we have recognized the validity of a notice of appeal that contains no mention whatsoever of the court to which the case is being taken we infer that the party intended to appeal to the only available forum.see ortiz john butler,cir here,as in ortiz,smith had only one available appellate forum.the fact that he did not understand this constraint,as evidenced by his erroneous attempt to appeal to the supreme court,is of little consequence.
further,we have held that a notice of appeal was valid even when,as here,it designated the wrong court for appeal.see musa,at.in musa,the appellant,acting with the assistance of counsel,filed a timely notice of appeal,but incorrectly designated as the appellate court the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit.id.we found that this flaw did not prevent the notice of appeal from fairly notifying both the opposing party and district court of the appellant intent to appeal,and we held that the notice of appeal was therefore sufficient.id.
the state attempts to distinguish the two cases.it argues that,unlike in ortiz,smith intent to seek review in the supreme court was obvious,making it unnecessary to infer the court to which smith intended to appeal.and unlike in musa,the state contends,smith made no mistake in deciding the court to which he appealed he intentionally attempted to bypass this court,thus rendering his notice of appeal invalid.
the state arguments,which hinge largely on smith subjective intentions,are unconvincing.in barry,the supreme court,when discussing whether the petitioner appellate brief was the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal,downplayed the petitioner intentions t he notice afforded by a document,not the litigant motivation in filing it,determines the document sufficiency as a notice of appeal.at.we find the court sentiments applicable in this case as well,and we decline to delve into smith subjective intentions when he filed his april notice of appeal to the supreme court.in musa,we excused a mistaken appeal to the eighth circuit,even though that mistake was made by a practicing attorney,not a pro se party.at.it would be incongruous not to provide at least that same level of deference to a party acting without the benefit of counsel.
as the court instructed in barry,we return to the purpose of a notice of appeal,which is to provide fair notice to both the opposing party and the district court.at.see also musa,at.smith unquestionably provided adequate notice in this case.that smith wished to appeal the district court order was apparent.equally as apparent to a party in the law,such as the wisconsin attorney general,is that this appeal had to be taken in the only court in which such an appeal could united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit.as a result,the state can not claim to have been prejudiced in any regard.given the liberal construction that we generally owe a pro se party filings,we hold,as we did in ortiz and musa,that smith attempted appeal to the supreme court,timely filed with the district court,was the functional equivalent of a proper notice of appeal.it is therefore unnecessary for us to consider whether smith second filing would have also served as a functional notice of appeal under rule.having determined that we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal,we now turn to the merits of smith petition.
smith sixth amendment right to trial counsel 
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,we may grant a petition for habeas relief from a state court judgment only in one of two limited circumstances if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.in conducting this deferential evaluation,we presume that the st
