ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction over habeas petition pursuant to.filed both a direct appeal of his conviction for unlawful reentry and a habeas petition challenging his current detention.typically,a federal prisoner may file a petition contesting the legality of his detention only if his claim is such that he can not obtain effective relief on direct appeal or through a motion.paulino united states,cir bannerman snyder,cir.while an alien may file a petition challenging his removal proceedings,an alien is not in custody for removal purposes if he is detained pursuant to a sentence for a criminal conviction,even if the ins has filed a detainer order with the prison where the petitioner is incarcerated.zolicoffer dep t of justice,cir collecting cases prieto gluch,cir,cert.denied,d.in this case,however,at the time filed his petition,the ins had already reinstated prior final order of removal.the iirira requires the ins to take custody of and commence procedures to execute the removal of an alien who is subject to a final order of removal based upon a conviction for an aggravated felony.simmonds ins,cir see also mustata dep t of justice,cir.this requirement was strong evidence of the dhs intention to take custody of immediately following the conclusion of his sentence,and thus satisfies the custody requirement for a petition.because was in ins custody at the time he filed his habeas petition challenging the constitutionality of his confinement,the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to

iii.analysis 
argues that the bia erred by concluding that his kentucky drug conviction was an aggravated felony,making him both deportable and ineligible for relief from.although concedes that his drug conviction is a felony under kentucky law,he argues that it does not constitute an aggravated felony within the meaning of a b because the offense to which he pleaded guilty did not contain a trading or dealing element nor would it have been punishable as a felony under federal law.
the bia correctly determined that kentucky drug conviction constitutes an aggravated felony within the meaning of the ina.the term aggravated felony is defined through a list of qualifying offenses,which includes illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in section of title,including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title.a b.in c,the term drug trafficking crime means any felony punishable under the controlled substances act et,or one of two other federal acts not relevant here.c.
there is some conflict regarding what elements must be present in order for a state offense to constitute a crime within the meaning of a b.united states sentencing guideline requires a sentencing enhancement to be imposed for the crime of unlawful reentry,if the alien was deported after having committed a crime.several circuits have held that in the sentencing context,the phrase drug trafficking crime includes offenses that would be punishable under the controlled substances act or two other federal acts not relevant here,so long as the offense is punishable as a felony under either state or federal law.gerbier holmes,cir.under this interpretation,a drug offense that is punishable as a felony under state law could be considered an aggravated felony,for purposes of applying the enhancement contained in,even if the conduct would have only been punishable as a misdemeanor under federal law.id.
the third circuit has defined a b differently for deportation purposes.id.according to the third circuit,
the bia has interpreted c to require that,for deportation purposes,a state drug conviction,whether it be a felony or a misdemeanor,must either contain a trafficking component or be punishable as a felony under federal law in order for it to constitute an aggravated felony.in contrast,several courts of appeals have interpreted the same language in c,albeit in the sentencing guidelines context,to require that the state drug conviction need only be a felony under state law and that the state crime be punishable under the federal controlled substances act,either as a felony or a misdemeanor.
gerbier,at emphases in original.the third circuit has held that for deportation purposes,the bia interpretation of c is correct.id.
under the bia approach,a state drug conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under either of two routes.under the first route,a felony state drug conviction is an aggravated felony under c if it contains a trafficking element.und
