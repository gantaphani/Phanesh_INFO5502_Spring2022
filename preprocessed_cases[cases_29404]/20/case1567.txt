petitioner troy stuart appeals the december,order of the united states district court for the northern district of ohio granting the motion of respondent julius wilson,warden,to dismiss petitioner habeas application filed pursuant to.petitioner is currently incarcerated in ohio state prison,having been convicted and sentenced for the state crimes of rape of a victim under the age of thirteen and gross sexual imposition of a victim under the age of thirteen.for the following reasons,we affirm the order of the district court.
background 
state proceedings 
on october,an ohio state grand jury indicted petitioner for two counts of rape by force of a victim under the age of thirteen and one count of gross sexual imposition of a victim under the age of thirteen.the alleged child victim in this case was petitioner nephew,the son of petitioner older brother.
on february,the prosecution notified the court of its intention to admit into evidence statements to his mother lisa,father lorin,aunt aunt sue,cousin cousin cindy,and the investigating detective pursuant to ohio evidence rule.under the state rule,the hearsay statement of an alleged victim of a sexual crime under the age of twelve is admissible if the state court finds particularized guarantees of trustworthiness of the hearsay statement the victim testimony is not reasonably obtainable by the party seeking to admit the hearsay statement there is independent proof of the sexual act and at least ten days before the trial or hearing,the party seeking to admit the hearsay statement notifies the other parties of the content of the statement,when and where the statement was made,the identity of the witness to testify as to the statement,and the circumstances surrounding the statement that demonstrate particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.ohio evid.a.the party seeking to admit the hearsay statement may satisfy requirement if t he child refuses to testify concerning the subject matter of the statement or claims a lack of memory of the subject matter of the statement after a person trusted by the child,in the presence of the court,urges the child to both describe the acts described by the statement and to testify.ohio evid.b.
on february,the state trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing in order to determine whether the prosecution met the requirements of rule.was examined for competency.he testified that he was five years old,and he testified that he knew the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie.he promised that he would tell the truth during the hearing.on,admitted that he sometimes lied to his parents.when asked if he lied to his uncle troy,petitioner in this case,said yes,but he did not want to talk about it.he testified that no one had told him what to say and that he was going to tell the truth.the state trial court found that was competent to testify.
the investigating detective on the case then testified at the hearing.she testified that on october,his mother,and his father went to the police station to report a crime.the detective was made aware of some of the factual circumstances surrounding the case,and she then interviewed in the presence of his mother.after some small talk with,the detective asked if he knew the difference between a good touch and a bad touch.he stated that he did know the difference he identified his mother kiss and his father hug as good touches,and he identified being spanked as a bad touch.the detective then asked if being touched on his was a good touch or bad touch,and responded that it was a bad touch.the detective asked if anyone had touched his penis,and responded that petitioner had done so.the detective then asked if petitioner had touched penis,and said yes.the detective then asked if had touched petitioner penis,and said yes.the detective asked where this conduct had occurred,and answered that it had taken place in his parents bed or bed.when asked how many times this conduct had occurred,stated that it had occurred many times.the detective then ended the conversation with and spoke to his parents.the parents informed the detective that had previously told them that and petitioner had engaged in oral sex.after a few minutes,the detective and asked if there was anything did not tell the detective.answered,yes,yeah,uncle troy made me suck his.at.he also stated that petitioner performed oral sex on stated that the oral sex had occurred on many occasions.on,the detective testified that she had not her interview of,but she did take notes.
father,lorin,also testified at the hearing.lorin testified that he and his family moved back to his father grandfather and petitioner father house in september or october of.petitioner also lived at the house.when father and mother were at work,petitioner would often babysit the family children.on october,lorin spoke with aunt sue lorin sister at aunt sue house,and aunt sue stated that in she had observed playing with himself.at.she asked why he was doing that,and he responded,b ecause uncle troy does.at.aunt sue told lorin that she did not know if petitioner was fooling around with,but that lorin should find out.at.after this conversation,lorin returned to his father house,where was at the time.lorin asked if there was anyone who was touching him in the wrong places,and answered,yes,uncle troy.at.lorin asked what petitioner did to,and responded that petitioner made perform oral sex on petitioner,and that petitioner would perform oral sex on lorin testified that after october,he did not ask questions about what had occurred between and petitioner,but twice raised the subject,stating that petitioner would get into bed with and engage in the sexual abuse.
mother,lisa,also testified at the hearing.lisa testified that on october,lorin recounted to lisa the conversation that he had with about petitioner and the sexual conduct between and petitioner.she spoke with about the matter,and stated that the abuse had in fact happened,and that he was sorry for it.it is unclear from lisa testimony whether she used leading questions or the nature of the conversation.lisa testified that she did not remember the exact conversation.she also stated that after that day,would just come up and talk about what had occurred between petitioner and,stating that petitioner should not have done that and asking why daddy did stop it.at.also stated that the abuse would occur when his older brother was at school.lisa testified that she did not ask questions,but rather would just come up and talk about what had occurred.on,lisa admitted that in june,the children services board csb had received information that petitioner had abused.a csb worker went to the family home and interviewed both and his older brother.both boys denied any abuse.lisa did not know who had made the allegations of abuse,but she suspected that aunt sue or cousin cindy had done so as retribution for an altercation between cousin cindy,her brother,and petitioner that had taken place earlier.lisa admitted that aunt sue and cousin cindy did not say anything to her about petitioner abuse of,and that her only basis of knowledge of the abuse was her conversation with 
then testified.petitioner counsel objected to the presence of lorin and lisa,so the court ordered the parents to leave the courtroom.both the prosecution and petitioner counsel asked if he would talk about what had happened between and petitioner,and refused to answer.did testify that he did not lie to his father or to the investigating detective.also testified that no one had told him to refuse to answer questions about petitioner.
aunt,aunt sue,then testified.she stated that in she observed with his hands in his pants.she said to,hey,boy,quit that,and responded,uncle troy does that.at.both lorin and petitioner were present during this occasion.she also testified that she recounted this event to lorin on october.she also testified that her daughter,cousin cindy,had made accusations against petitioner in march or.
cousin,cousin cindy,also testified at the hearing.she stated that on march,her birthday,she saw playing with his penis.she asked what he was doing,and she said that he should not be doing that.replied that uncle troy does.cousin cindy then asked what else petitioner did.he replied that troy kissed his and played with his butt hole.at.she testified that she told her mother what had said that day.about one year later,she told petitioner that he would pay for what he had done to.she testified that on october,she told lorin what had said to her on march.on,cousin cindy admitted that could have meant that petitioner played with his own penis and anus.she also testified that there was some question about whether petitioner had previously stolen marijuana from her.
shelly kekic,a social worker with csb,also testified at the hearing.she testified that in june,she went to the family home in response to an allegation that petitioner was sexually abusing.she interviewed lisa,petitioner,petitioner father,and older brother.denied that he was touched inappropriately by anyone.petitioner denied sexually abusing 
on march,the state trial court ruled that the hearsay statements were admissible under ohio evidence rule.the state trial court found that while was competent to testify,he was not available to testify at trial 
it ultimately became clear that was not,would not,and could not be coaxed,pressured,or cajoled into answering questions in the sexual area and relative to uncle troy.it was clear that,although physically present and competent,was in fact unavailable to testify relative to any substantive matters and issues before the court in this case.there is no reasonable basis for this court to believe or assume that availability in this area will improve or change.thus,is found to be not reasonably available to testify in this case.
at.the state trial court then addressed the issue of indicia of trustworthiness.the court found that statements to aunt sue and cousin cindy,where both asked what he was doing when he was playing with his penis,were spontaneous,clearly not orchestrated or directed.at.the court also found that response to lorin question of whether anyone had touched him in the wrong places was also spontaneous and very specific in light of his father general question.the court also found that response to lisa questioning was spontaneous and responsive,consistent with statements to three others.at.likewise,the court found that response to the investigating detective was consistent.in sum,the court found statements to bear particularized guarantees of trustworthiness 
in this case,considering the totality of the circumstances,the court find sic particularized guarantee sic that statements are trustworthy.these indicia include the spontaneity of the statements to aunts sic,should be aunt and cousin and parents,the internal consistency as to all,the mental state of the child,lack of motive to fabricate,his use of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age,the means by which the statements were elicited,as well as the amount of time between acts and statements and circumstances of this case.in summary,statements consistently referred only to uncle troy and what he did.the terminology of kiss his would not normally be expected of a year old.the fact of the babysitting arrangement offered ample opportunity over a specific period of time.the unprovoked or directed statements to the aunts sic had a particularly high degree of spontaneity and consistency.
the court also found independent proof of sexual acts.the court referred to a letter that lorin and his father found in petitioner bedroom the court ultimately concluded that the hearsay evidence was admissible under ohio evidence rule.
on march,the jury found petitioner guilty on all three counts.the state trial court sentenced petitioner to two life sentence for the rapes and one year imprisonment for the gross sexual imposition,with the sentences to run concurrently.petitioner appealed his conviction and sentence.
the state court of appeals affirmed.petitioner made two claims before the state court of appeals that are relevant to the instant case before this court.in his third assignment of error,petitioner claimed that the admission of the hearsay statements was improper under ohio evidence rule,and he claimed that the admission of the hearsay statements also violated his rights under the fifth,sixth,and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.in his seventh assignment of error,petitioner claimed that the state trial court committed error when it denied his request to call as a witness,in violation of his rights under the fifth,sixth,and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.
the state court of appeals found that the trial court conducted the proper analysis as to the admissibility of the hearsay statements under ohio evidence rule.as to the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness,the court found that the parents had enjoyed a good relationship with petitioner before the discovery of the abuse,so there was no motive to lie.in addition,the explicit nature of the child statements also indicated trustworthiness.finally,the court also agreed with the state trial court that the statements were spontaneous.as to unavailability,the court found that an uncooperative child could be determined to be unavailable under rule.the court also found that the prosecution had met the remaining two requirements,independent evidence of the sexual act and proper notice of the intent to use the hearsay statements.
the court also found that under rule,if the child victim was uncooperative and thus found unavailable,the defendant did not have the right to call the child victim to testify as a witness.the court held that petitioner right to confrontation under the sixth amendment of the constitution had not been violated by the admission of the hearsay statements under rule,as the ohio supreme court had already ruled that rule met the confrontation clause requirements in state storch,ohio.
petitioner appealed the decision to the state supreme court.in his memorandum in support of the appeal,he argued,among other things,that the admission of the hearsay statements did not conform to ohio evidence rule and violated his due process rights and his right to confrontation under the united states constitution.the ohio supreme court denied petitioner leave to appeal.the united states supreme court denied petitioner petition for writ of certiorari.
federal proceedings 
on march,petitioner filed a habeas petition pursuant to in federal district court.on august,petitioner filed a motion to file a corrected memorandum in support of his petition,as the original memorandum was missing several pages.the district court granted the motion.in his corrected memorandum,petitioner argued,among other things,that the admission of the hearsay statements was a violation of his due process rights and his right to confrontation under the united states constitution.petitioner made three arguments the declarant was not unavailable to testify at trial the hearsay statements did not have particularized guarantees of trustworthiness and there was no independent proof of the sexual act 
on march,the magistrate judge recommended that the habeas petition be dismissed.as to the admission of the hearsay statements,the magistrate judge found that to the extent petitioner challenged the admission on failure to conform to the requirements of ohio evidence rule,petitioner did not have a cognizable claim,as the challenge was one solely of state law see note,supra.the magistrate judge found that petitioner argument that his rights under the united states constitution were violated was made only in passing to the state appeals and state supreme court.the magistrate judge also found that the state appeals court and the state supreme court had made their decisions based solely on state law grounds.the magistrate judge therefore concluded that petitioner had failed to fairly present this claim to the state courts.the magistrate judge also concluded that petitioner had procedurally defaulted this claim in state court,as the time limitations for petitions under state law had since expired.this also meant that petitioner had technically exhausted his state court remedies.the magistrate judge found that petitioner failed to show adequate cause and prejudice for the procedural default,and he failed to show a miscarriage of justice.the magistrate judge thus recommended that the district court reject this claim.
petitioner appealed the magistrate judge recommendation only with respect to the claim of improper admission of the hearsay statements.petitioner argued that he properly presented to the state courts his claim under the confrontation clause of the united states constitution.petitioner asserted that he specifically identified the source of federal law underlying his claim.
on december,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation,with modification,and dismissed petitioner habeas petition.the modification dealt with whether petitioner fairly presented his right to confrontation claim to the state courts.the district court found that petitioner had fairly presented this claim,so his claim was not barred by state law and he therefore did not need to show cause and prejudice for his failure to raise the claim in state court.the court cited to baldwin reese,where the supreme court explained 
a litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a petition or brief,for example,by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds,or by simply labeling the claim federal.
at quoting baldwin reese,d.in his appeals to both the state appeals court and the state supreme court,petitioner stated that his claim as to the admission of the hearsay statements was based in part on the united states constitution,so that he in fact fairly presented the claim to the state courts.
while petitioner had presented his right to confrontation claim to the state courts,the district court held that the claim failed under the standards of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.petitioner claimed that the admission of the hearsay statements was predicated on the state trial court finding of the unavailability of the declarant,and that this finding was contrary to the clearly established supreme court precedents found in coy iowa,d,and maryland craig,d.the district court rejected this argument,relying on the supreme court holding in white illinois,d,where the supreme court limited coy and craig to the issue of what requirements were necessary under the confrontation clause when a witness actually testified.the supreme court specifically refused to extend the holdings of coy and craig to the admission of hearsay statements.in petitioner case,did not actually testify,so coy and craig were inapposite.the district court did issue a certificate of appealability with respect to the claim of right to confrontation.
on december,petitioner timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
a.the state court decision to admit hearsay evidence was not contrary to clearly established federal law when the child victim declarant was technically not unavailable to testify but was unwilling to.preservation of the issue 
we agree with the district court holding that petitioner fairly presented his right to confrontation claim to the state courts.
standard of review 
when reviewing a district court habeas decision,this court reviews the legal conclusions de novo and the factual findings for clear error.jones jamrog,cir.because petitioner filed his habeas petition after the effective date of aedpa,aedpa applies.lindh murphy,d.under the strictures of that statute,the federal courts may not grant habeas relief for a state prisoner unless the state court adjudication of his claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.petitioner argues that aedpa is inapplicable in this case and that he is entitled to de novo review because the state courts did not fully address the merits of his right to confrontation claim.we disagree.the state court of appeals specifically held that the admission of the hearsay statements under ohio evidence rule did not violate the confrontation clause,as the ohio supreme court had already held that rule comported with the confrontation clause in state storch,ohio.the state court therefore fully addressed petitioner right to confrontation claim and aedpa applies.
petitioner does not claim that the state court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law he argues only that the state court decision was contrary to clearly established federal law.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a legal doctrine is not clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court unless it is based on holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.jamrog,at quoting williams,at.
no clearly established federal law requires that,in order to satisfy the confrontation clause,a declarant must be unavailable before the hearsay statements of an alleged child victim may be admitted under a rooted hearsay exception thus,petitioner may not attack the state court decision based on the availability of to testify.
legal framework 
the sixth amendment,in part,states in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.while the confrontation clause could be interpreted literally to preclude all hearsay statements,supreme court precedent demonstrates that this is not the case.
in ohio roberts the defendant was arrested for forgery of a check in the name of bernard isaacs,and for possession of stolen credit cards in the names of bernard and his wife amy.at.the defendant contended that the isaacs daughter,anita,with whom he was acquainted,gave him her parents checkbook and credit cards so that he could use them.id.at.at a preliminary hearing,before the defendant was even indicted,defense counsel called anita as a witness.id.at.anita testified that she knew the defendant,and that she had permitted him to stay at her apartment for several days.id.she denied,however,giving the defendant her parents checkbook and credit cards so that he could use them.id.
a state grand jury indicted the defendant for forgery,receiving stolen property,and heroin possession.id.in preparation for trial,the prosecution issued five subpoenas for anita at her parents residence.id.at.she did not respond to these subpoenas and she did not appear at trial.id.at trial,the defendant testified that anita had given him the checkbook and the credit cards so that he could use them.id.the state then offered anita previous testimony in rebuttal.id.relying on the confrontation clause,the defense objected,and the state trial court conducted a voir dire hearing.id.anita mother,amy,testified that anita had gone to tucson,arizona shortly after the preliminary hearing.id.at.she testified that no one knew where anita was.id.at.the state trial court admitted the hearsay statements of anita,and the defendant was convicted on all counts.id.
the supreme court held that the admission of the hearsay evidence was not error.the court first addressed the requirements that the confrontation clause placed on hearsay statements 
the confrontation clause operates in two separate ways to restrict the range of admissible hearsay.first,in conformance with the framers preference for accusation,the sixth amendment establishes a rule of necessity.in the usual case including cases where prior has occurred,the prosecution must either produce,or demonstrate the unavailability of,the declarant whose statement it wishes to use against the defendant 
the second aspect operates once a witness is shown to be unavailable.reflecting its underlying purpose to augment accuracy in the factfinding process by ensuring the defendant an effective means to test adverse evidence,the clause countenances only hearsay marked with such trustworthiness that there is no material departure from the reason of the general rule.
id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.with respect to unavailability,the court noted that a demonstration of unavailability is not always required.in dutton evans,d,for example,the court found that the utility of trial confrontation was so remote that it did not require the prosecution to produce a seemingly available witness.id.at.with respect to trustworthiness,the court stated,reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.in other cases,the evidence must be excluded,at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.id.at.the court found that the circumstances surrounding anita testimony at the preliminary hearing indicated trustworthiness,and that anita was unavailable,so that the admission of the hearsay statements did not violate the confrontation clause.id.at.
in united states inadi,d,the supreme court abrogated the unavailability requirement of roberts.there,the defendant was indicted for conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamines.id.at.at trial,the prosecution sought to introduce evidence of taped conversations of the other,who were not indicted.id.at.the district court found that the hearsay statements of the were admissible under federal rule of evidence,as they were statements made during the course and in the furtherance of the conspiracy.id.the defendant objected on confrontation clause grounds,claiming that the statements were inadmissible absent a showing that the declarants were unavailable.id.the prosecution subpoenaed one of the lazaro,but he failed to appear.id.nonetheless,the district court admitted the statements based on federal rule of evidence.id.at.
the supreme court held that the evidence was properly admitted,despite the prosecution failure to prove that lazaro was unavailable.the court explained that while language in roberts could be read to support the proposition that a party must prove a declarant unavailability as a prerequisite for the admission of any hearsay statement,
roberts should not be read as an abstract answer to questions not presented in that case,but rather as a resolution of the issue the court said it was examining the constitutional propriety of the introduction in evidence of the preliminary hearing testimony of a witness not produced at the defendant subsequent state criminal trial.
roberts must be read consistently with the question it answered,the authority it cited,and its own facts.all of these indicate that roberts simply reaffirmed a longstanding rule that applies unavailability analysis to prior testimony.roberts can not fairly be read to stand for the radical proposition that no statement can be introduced by the government without a showing that the declarant is unavailable.
id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the court found that the unavailability rule,while logical in the context of prior testimony,was inapplicable to the hearsay statement of a.with respect to prior testimony,the court stated that prior testimony was often merely a weaker substitute for live testimony at trial.id.at.when two versions of the same evidence are available,longstanding principles of the law of hearsay,applicable as well to confrontation clause analysis,favor the better evidence.id.the hearsay statements of a,however,could not be adequately replaced by live testimony 
because they are made while the conspiracy is in progress,such statements provide evidence of the conspiracy context that can not be replicated,even if the declarant testifies to the same matters in court conspirators are likely to speak differently when talking to each other in furtherance of their illegal aims than when testifying on the witness stand.
c statements derive much of their value from the fact that they are made in a context very different from trial,and therefore are usually irreplaceable as substantive evidence.under these circumstances,only clear folly would dictate an policy of doing without such statements.
id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the court continued and explained why a universal unavailability rule would have little benefit.first,the rule would not be a better evidence rule,as it would exclude evidence only when the prosecution failed to produce an available declarant.id.at.second,key witnesses at a trial would have already been subpoenaed,thus causing the rule to be relevant only to witnesses with marginal information.id.at.the court then found that the burdens placed on the prosecution by such a rule would be great,as the prosecution would be responsible for keeping abreast of all of the movements of the declarants.id.at.the court concluded that the unavailability rule was inapplicable to hearsay statements.id.at.
in idaho wright,d,the supreme court addressed confrontation clause requirements in the context of the hearsay statements of an alleged child victim of sexual abuse.the defendant was the mother of the two alleged victims of abuse,who were two and years old younger daughter and five and years old older daughter at the time the defendant was charged.id.at.the allegations were that the defendant had held down her daughters while her boyfriend raped them.after allegations of abuse had surfaced,a doctor examined the younger daughter.id.the doctor found strong evidence of sexual abuse of the younger daughter.id.the case revolved around certain statements elicited by the doctor from the younger daughter id.at.over the objection of the defendant,the doctor testified as to the hearsay statements of the younger daughter,as the state trial court found that they fell within the residual hearsay exception of the state.id.at.the state trial court found that the younger daughter was incapable of communicating to the jury.id.at.
the supreme court made no finding as to whether the unavailability rule would apply to the younger daughter hearsay statements 
applying the roberts approach to this case,we first note that this case does not raise the question whether,before a child statements are admitted,the confrontation clause requires the prosecution to show that a child witness is unavailable at,if so,what that showing requires.the trial court in this case found that respondent younger daughter was incapable of communicating with the jury,and defense counsel agreed for purposes of deciding this case,we assume without deciding that,to the extent the unavailability requirement applies in this case,the younger daughter was an unavailable witness within the meaning of the confrontation clause.
id.at.the supreme court thus did not address whether the unavailability rule applied to an alleged child victim hearsay statements when those statements were admitted under a rooted hearsay exception.
in white illinois,d,the supreme court again addressed hearsay statements and the confrontation clause in the context of an alleged child victim of sexual abuse.there the evidence showed that in the early morning hours of april,the defendant sexually attacked,a old girl,in home.id.at.babysitter heard screams and went to her room,where he saw the defendant leave the room.id.the babysitter knew the defendant because the defendant was a friend of mother.id.the babysitter asked what had happened,and stated that the defendant had choked her,threatened her,and had touched her inappropriately.id.mother came home soon thereafter and asked what had happened.repeated what she had told the babysitter earlier.id.the mother called the police,and a police officer questioned id.at.repeated the same story she had told the babysitter and her mother.id.at.was then taken to the hospital,where she was examined by a nurse and then a doctor.id.told the nurse and the doctor the same story she had told to the other individuals.id.
at trial,did not testify.the prosecution twice attempted to call her as a witness,but she experienced emotional difficulty and did not testify.id.over the defendant objection,the state trial court admitted hearsay statements to the babysitter,the mother,and the police officer under the spontaneous declaration exception.id.over the defendant objection,the state trial court admitted hearsay statements to the nurse and the doctor under both the spontaneous declaration exception and the exception for statements made in the course of medical treatment.id.at.
the supreme court affirmed the admission of all of the statements.the defendant,relying on roberts,argued that the confrontation clause required that the declarant be unavailable before the hearsay statements could be admitted.id.at.echoing its analysis in inadi,the supreme court found,roberts stands for the proposition that unavailability analysis is a necessary part of the confrontation clause inquiry only when the challenged statements were made in the course of a prior judicial proceeding.id.at.citation omitted.the supreme court found that the circumstances that support the trustworthiness of a spontaneous declaration or a statement in the course of medical treatment can not be recaptured even by later testimony.id.at.live testimony could not replicate the excitement that causes a spontaneous declaration,nor could it replicate a medical setting,where a false statement could cause misdiagnosis or mistreatment.id.at.
the supreme court concluded that when a hearsay statement has sufficient guarantees of reliability to come within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule,the confrontation clause is satisfied.id.at.the supreme court rejected the defendant reliance on coy iowa,d,and maryland craig,d.the supreme court explained that those cases involved procedures where the alleged child victim actually testified at trial in coy,the witness testified behind a screen,and in craig,the witness testified via closed circuit television.id.at.in those two cases,the supreme court required the prosecution to prove the necessity of the procedure to avert a risk of harm to the child.id.the defendant argued that the hearsay statements of an alleged child victim should be admitted only when the prosecution makes a showing of necessity,testifying would create a risk of harm to the witness.id.the supreme court disagreed,finding coy and craig inapplicable to statements.id.at.
application to this case 
there is no clearly established federal law that requires an alleged child victim to be unavailable before his hearsay statements may be admitted under a hearsay exception that is not firmly rooted.petitioner relies primarily on roberts,claiming that the confrontation clause requires a declarant to be unavailable before the admission of the declarant hearsay statements.petitioner fails to recognize that the supreme court has twice limited the unavailability rule in roberts,in both inadi and white,to hearsay statements made in a prior judicial proceeding.of most significance,the supreme court proclaimed in white that roberts stands for the proposition that unavailability analysis is a necessary part of the confrontation clause inquiry only when the challenged statements were made in the course of a prior judicial proceeding.at.citation omitted emphasis supplied.we acknowledge that in wright,the supreme court seemed to use roberts as a general framework in discussing hearsay statements under the confrontation clause however,the supreme court followed wright with the language in white,which clearly limited the roberts unavailability analysis to hearsay statements made in a prior judicial proceeding.to the extent friction exists between wright,inadi,and white,such friction demonstrates that there is no clearly established federal law as to an unavailability rule for the hearsay statement of an alleged child victim under a hearsay exception that is not firmly rooted.
as explained above,petitioner may rely only on the holdings of supreme court cases to demonstrate clearly established federal law.in our view,the supreme court held the following 
in ohio roberts,the supreme court held that the admission of hearsay statements made in prior judicial proceedings was dependent upon the unavailability of the declarant.
in united states inadi,the supreme court held that the admission of a hearsay statement was not dependent upon the unavailability of the declarant.
in idaho wright,the supreme court made no holding as to whether the unavailability of the declarant was a prerequisite to the admission of hearsay statements of an alleged child victim under a rooted hearsay exception.
in white illinois,the supreme court held that the admission of hearsay statements of an alleged child victim under a firmly rooted hearsay exception was not dependent upon the unavailability of the declarant.
no supreme court holding clearly establishes the applicability of an unavailability rule in this case.this is not a situation where the state court arrive d at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or where the state court decide d a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams,at.the supreme court has not reached a conclusion as to an unavailability rule for the admission of hearsay statements of an alleged child victim under a rooted hearsay exception in fact,the supreme court explicitly left this exact issue open in wright.moreover,white contained unambiguous direction from the supreme court to apply the unavailability analysis only with hearsay statements made in prior judicial proceedings.we therefore hold that the admission of hearsay statements,despite the fact that was technically not unavailable,was not contrary to clearly established federal law.
our decision today is further grounded in a prior decision of this court.in bugh mitchell,this court found,on habeas review,that the roberts unavailability analysis was limited to hearsay statements made in prior judicial proceedings,cir.
to the extent petitioner relies on coy and craig for the proposition that the prosecution must establish necessity before substituting hearsay statements for testimony,we agree with the district court that the supreme court rejected this exact position in white.
b.the state court decision to admit hearsay evidence was not contrary to clearly established federal law when considering the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness of the hearsay evidence 
preservation of the issue 
we agree with the district court holding that petitioner fairly presented his right to confrontation claim to the state courts.
standard of review 
the appropriate standard of review is set out above.
hearsay statements were characterized by particularized guarantees of trustworthiness,as defined by the supreme court.as a result,the admission of hearsay statements was not contrary to clearly established federal law.
legal framework 
as explained above,in ohio roberts,the supreme court set out a confrontation clause analysis for hearsay statements.the first step,the unavailability of the declarant,has been the subject of continued abrogation and qualification.see supra.the second step,the trustworthiness of the hearsay statements,has not been placed into doubt,outside of crawford.in roberts,the court observed that r eliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.in other cases,the evidence must be excluded,at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.at.
in idaho wright,the supreme court explained what the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness encompassed in the context of an alleged child victim declarant.in that case,the alleged child victim was taken to a doctor.at.over the defendant objection,the doctor testified at trial as to statements made by the alleged child victim.id.at.the trial court admitted the hearsay statements under the residual hearsay exception.id.at.the doctor testified that he asked the child the following questions do you play with your daddy does daddy play with you does daddy touch you with his do you touch his id.quotation marks omitted.the doctor testified that the child said yes to the question,does daddy touch you with his,and the child did not respond to the question,do you touch his.
