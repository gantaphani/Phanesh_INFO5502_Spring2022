petitioner samuel king appeals from the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.king pleaded guilty in ohio state court to a number of state charges.king was not accompanied by an attorney during the plea negotiation,plea hearing,or sentencing hearing,and he claims he was unconstitutionally denied his right to counsel.we find that he did execute a valid waiver of his sixth amendment right to counsel,and therefore we affirm.
samuel king was indicted on april,by an ohio grand jury for failing to pay child support,providing a false application for a certificate of registration,making false promises through advertising,fraudulent dealings,passing bad checks,theft by deception,and securing writings by deception.two months later,the ohio grand jury issued another indictment charging king with failing to file state income tax filing a false,incomplete,or fraudulent tax return fraudulent dealings and theft by deception.king pleaded not guilty 
the trial court summarized king attempts to retain counsel as follows 
defendant began this case claiming that he would be represented by a lisbon attorney.were set when the lisbon attorney was not retained and defendant always assured the court that he would retain that attorney.after a great deal of wasted time,defendant eventually declined to retain that counsel and sought new counsel in columbus,ohio.
again,defendant repeatedly assured the court that he would retain columbus counsel and that no further delays would result from his actions.after a considerable time was wasted,defendant again declined to retain that counsel and chose his current counsel third attorney uche mgbaraho.
counsel for defendant appeared on arraignment day for other cases and announced that day that he was being retained in the king case also.while on the record,the court very clearly explained to counsel all the delays that had occurred with the first two attorneys and that the court would not entertain a motion to withdraw even if counsel was not paid.
the court had scheduled king trial for monday,march.about two months before trial,mgbaraho moved to withdraw as counsel for king and king wife,gloria king,a codefendant.king objected.the trial court denied mgbaraho motion because he had been warned that nonpayment would not be grounds for withdrawing on february,mgbaraho once again moved to withdraw as counsel for samuel and gloria king.the basis of mgbaraho motion was that king lacked confidence in mgbaraho and had asked mgbaraho to perform unethical acts,king had accused him of colluding with the state to abuse king rights,king had not paid mgbaraho legal fees,and mgbaraho felt there was a conflict of interest in representing both sam and gloria king.the trial court granted mgbaraho motion as to his representation of gloria king and granted a continuance in her case to allow her time to retain new counsel.the trial court denied the motion as to samuel king,however,because of the numerous delays in the case due to king previous failures to hire counsel the specific warning the court issued to mgbaraho before he entered his appearance on behalf of king regarding the court reluctance to allow him to withdraw and king requests for mgbaraho to perform unethical acts would not be cured by king retaining different counsel.
on march,mgbaraho moved for the court to reconsider its ruling because king had fired him.he also moved for a continuance to allow king time to retain or be appointed new counsel.the trial court held a hearing on mgbaraho motion on friday,march.at that hearing,king told the trial court that he had discharged mgbaraho from the case and asked for time to meet with a new attorney,dennis mcnamara,whom king said he had already met several times.the court stated that it already spoke with mcnamara,and mcnamara told the court that he would not represent king without a large retainer.king told the court that he had recently inherited over,and as proof that he had the money he pointed through the window to a new car in the parking lot,which he claimed he bought with cash.the court clearly did not believe king 
i am firmly convinced that you will never hire and keep a lawyer.that no matter how much time i give you,when the time for trial comes,that lawyer will either be unpaid,inappropriate,fired or whatever and i do believe that giving you a continuance will solve any legitimate problem that you now claim you have because if i give you the time to hire and fire two more lawyers,that what going to happen.if i give you time to hire and not pay and fire ten lawyers,that what going to happen.i had it.
instead of granting king request for a continuance in its entirety,the trial court sua sponte bifurcated king trial.it ordered that the trial on the factually uncomplicated counts would proceed as scheduled,but that the remaining counts would be tried at a later date.as for mgbaraho motion to reconsider his motion to withdraw,the court ordered mgbaraho to serve as standby counsel to king.the court explained mgbaraho new role as follows 
now,that does mean that you have to try the case and that does mean that you have to talk to king and that does mean that king has to talk to you.if you but you need to be available and if he decides he wants to consult with somebody,fine.if he wants you to be fired and he does want to talk with you and he does want you in this case,that his decision.it will not be my decision,nor will it be yours that you have nothing to do with this case.it will only be king decision but i but you are going to have to be here.
after the court identified which counts of the indictments would be tried first and discussed other matters,he asked if king had any questions.king asked so,essentially,i trying this myself correct the court responded,that up to you i mean,you got uche mgbaraho over here that standby.the purpose of standby is if you say go,he goes with what limited stuff he got because bear in mind the two of you whatever that relationship has been you still have the right to go out and hire some other lawyer if you can get somebody to do it on such short notice.king then said,i doubt if i can get someone to do it on short notice but i just like to read into record just for the record itself that essentially i have not i do have effective counsel as granted my right by the constitution of the united states.i just want to bring that forward as a matter of record and i be here monday morning.
immediately after the hearing,king met privately with the prosecutor and they reached a plea agreement.pursuant to the agreement,on march,king pleaded guilty to four of the six counts that were scheduled for trial that day,and all of the remaining counts of both indictments were dismissed.all of the charges against gloria king were also dismissed.king was not accompanied by counsel or standby counsel.during the plea colloquy,king stated he understood that by pleading guilty he was waiving his rights to a jury trial,to confront and his accusers,to compulsory process,to remain silent,and to testify on his own behalf.he stated that he understood the potential penalties the court could impose.the court informed king that he had the right to be represented by counsel and if he could not afford counsel,one would be appointed at no cost.after explaining that right,the court noted that king had recently informed the court that he had inherited more than,implying that king was ineligible for appointed counsel.king responded,i do have it yet,sir.the court did not follow up by asking if king wanted counsel appointed.before accepting the plea,the following exchange took place 
the court now,with respect to counsel,you had counsel which you discharged friday or effective friday.so,now i need for you i assume you want to go forward well,do you want to go forward without counsel 
king yes,sir.
the court okay.and i already explained to you your right to appointed counsel.do you understand that 
king yes,sir.
the court i need for you to sign a separate waiver that indicates that you have been told all that and that you waive counsel but do sign it until you read it and there one for each case.that why you have two of them there.
okay.are there any questions that you have about anything we doing here 
king no,sir.
the court you sure 
king yes,sir.
the court you still want to go through with the plea bargain 
king yes,sir.
at his sentencing hearing later that month,king appeared without new counsel or mgbaraho.the court sentenced him to serve six months,eleven months,and nine months in prison for three of the offenses,to be served consecutively.he was also sentenced to five years of community control on the fourth offense.earlier,king admitted that he did not inherit the money or buy the car as he had told the court.the court held king in contempt for lying about inheriting money and purchasing a new car.he was ordered to serve ten days for each contempt citation,to be served consecutively to one another as well as to those sentences imposed for the main offenses.
king appealed,with the assistance of counsel,arguing that he did not waive his right to receive the assistance of counsel and that the trial court failed to advise him of the dangers inherent in.the seventh district court of appeals of ohio affirmed his conviction by ruling 
relevant to this assignment are the following portions of crim.
a counsel in serious offenses.where a defendant charged with a serious offense is unable to obtain counsel,counsel shall be assigned to represent him at every stage of the proceedings unless the defendant,after being fully advised of his right to assigned counsel,knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily waives his right to counsel.
c waiver of counsel.waiver of counsel shall be in open court and the advice and waiver shall be recorded.
d assignment procedure.the determination of whether a defendant is able or unable to obtain counsel shall be made in a recorded proceeding in open court.
initially,it should be noted that in state kyser,wl,mahoning app,unreported,this court reversed the defendant conviction where he represented himself at a bench trial after the court failed to warn him of the dangers inherent in.that case is distinguishable as that court failed to inquire on the record whether counsel could be obtained.the court also failed to record any waiver of counsel as required by crim.in fact,kyser signed a rights waiver in which he specifically failed to waive his right to counsel.
in the case at bar,the court held a hearing on appellant ability to obtain counsel.the record contains evidence that appellant was not indigent.indeed,appellant told the court that he recently received a inheritance from his uncle.he told the court that he just purchased a car that the court could see in the parking lot.the fact that these were lies and that appellant may have actually been indigent is not chargeable to the court.defendants are prohibited from inviting such errors at trial and then arguing them on appeal.
additionally,the court recorded appellant waiver of counsel.at the change of plea hearing,the court advised appellant of his right to counsel.appellant waived his right to counsel orally in open court and signed a written waiver.
moreover,the court essentially provided appellant with an attorney by failing to release attorney mgbaraho.appellant claimed to have four different lawyers on four different occasions luther,mcnamara,mgbaraho and once again mcnamara.the court indicated that appellant was unreasonably delaying and that his problems with counsel were the product of his stalling tactics.when appellant wished to terminate attorney mgbaraho and be granted a continuance,the court refused such request.although the court failed to grant a continuance as to six charges,the court ordered attorney mgbaraho to remain as counsel.the court desired to order him to remain as actual counsel but appellant refused as he desired to be represented by attorney mcnamara.the court advised appellant that attorney mcnamara could enter his appearance on the day of trial.however,appellant showed up without counsel to plead guilty hours before trial.due to appellant agreement to plead,the state dismissed out of appellant charges and dismissed all charges against appellant wife,resulting in a favorable deal for appellant.
appellant had multiple opportunities to seek new counsel.he continually precipitated his own problems.he had the availability of attorney mgbaraho whom the court refused to release.importantly,although attorney mgbaraho was not actually,the court essentially provided him as counsel to appellant by refusing to release him.if appellant was indigent,as he now argues,then we respond that an indigent defendant does not have the right to his choice of counsel.thurston maxwell,ohio.for the foregoing reasons,appellant argument is without merit.
the ohio supreme court declined to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction over king appeal.on july,king filed a habeas petition pursuant to.the district court accepted and adopted a magistrate judge recommendation to deny king petition.this appeal followed.
we review de novo a district court legal conclusions in a habeas petition.lucas,cir.this court usually reviews finding of fact for clear error,but when the district court decision in a habeas case is based on a transcript from the petitioner state court trial,and the district court thus makes no credibility determination or other apparent finding of fact,the district court factual findings are reviewed de novo.wolfe brigano,cir quoting moore carlton,cir.
in determining whether to issue a writ of habeas corpus,the provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa govern the district court review of a state court decision.pursuant to the aedpa,
a n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
in williams taylor,d,the supreme court held that,in order to justify a grant of habeas relief,a federal court must find a violation of law that is clearly established from the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.the court held that a state court legal decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently that the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.id.at.furthermore,the court held that a state court legal decision will be deemed an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.
a federal court,however,may not find a state adjudication to be unreasonable simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.moreover,a federal court making the unreasonable application inquiry should not transform the inquiry into a subjective one by inquiring whether all reasonable jurists would agree that the application by the state court was unreasonable.rather,the issue is whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.id.at.ordinarily,we presume that a factual determination by a state court is correct unless convincing contrary evidence exists.d harries bell,cir.
