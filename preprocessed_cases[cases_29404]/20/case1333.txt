a michigan jury found petitioner bruce guilmette guilty of home invasion.on state collateral review,guilmette the first his trial counsel had been constitutionally ineffective.the state trial court denied guilmette claim on the merits,and both the state intermediate and supreme courts denied leave to appeal in brief and substantively identical orders.a federal district court granted guilmette a conditional writ of habeas corpus after determining that guilmette trial attorneys were constitutionally ineffective.the state now appeals,arguing that guilmette procedurally defaulted his claim by failing to raise it during his direct appeal,and that the state supreme court brief order enforced that procedural rule.however,because the state supreme court order was unexplained by which we mean the text of the order fails to disclose the reason for the judgment and the last reasoned state court decision was on the merits,the state courts never enforced a procedural bar to guilmette claim.the state is therefore not entitled to appellate relief.
at approximately noon on january,a man forced open the locked front door of joan mccormick home while mccormick sat in her living room.mccormick fell down during her attempt to flee into the interior of her house,and when she looked back at the door after her fall,the man was already fleeing the scene.mccormick identified the petitioner,bruce guilmette,out of two photographic lineups during the following weeks.the state prosecuted guilmette for home invasion.at trial,the prosecution introduced two photographs that were purportedly of the perpetrator footprints in the snow around mccormick home one taken by a police officer who had investigated the crime,and a second taken by mccormick after the police officer had departed.mccormick photograph was of a footprint on the threshold of her door,and the state relied upon that photograph at trial to establish the entry element of the alleged crime.see.comp.laws a.rejecting guilmette arguments that mccormick had misidentified him,a jury found guilmette guilty of home invasion.for a more detailed recitation of the facts of the alleged home invasion and guilmette trial,see guilmette howes,cir vacated pursuant to march,order granting rehearing en banc.
after an unsuccessful direct appeal,guilmette filed for state review,arguing for the first time that his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to investigate differences between the two photographed footprints.guilmette argued that this error was prejudicial because the photographs were the only proof of entry.guilmette also argued that his appellate counsel had been ineffective for failing to argue ineffective assistance of trial counsel.the state trial court denied these claims on the merits,determining that guilmette trial counsel had not been ineffective because focusing on identification at the expense of arguing the elements of the crime was a reasonable trial strategy,and that his appellate counsel had not been ineffective for failing to raise a meritless claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.in the trial court words,guilmette failed to meet his burden in demonstrating that either his trial counsel or appellate counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.both the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal,issuing substantively identical orders stating that guilmette had failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under michigan court rule d.
guilmette petitioned for habeas relief based on the two claims that he raised on state collateral review.the district court granted a conditional habeas writ,finding that guilmette trial counsel were constitutionally ineffective because they failed to investigate the differences between the two photographs.guilmette howes,d.the district court determined that guilmette had not procedurally defaulted this claim,citing abela martin,cir,for the proposition that some orders citing rule d do not invoke a procedural bar.guilmette,d at.
the state appealed,arguing that guilmette procedurally defaulted his claim and that he failed to establish cause and prejudice for that default.a panel of this court reversed the district court judgment.guilmette.over a dissent,the panel held that,given the precise procedural history presented by this case,precedent compelled the conclusion that michigan had applied a procedural bar to guilmette claims for relief,and thus that guilmette claims were procedurally defaulted.id.at.we granted en banc review to determine whether a brief michigan appellate court order citing rule d is an explained order from which federal courts can determine whether the basis of the state court decision was procedural rather than.
brief orders citing michigan court rule d are not explained orders invoking a procedural bar.we reach this result because holdings from the michigan courts indicate that the language used by such summary orders can refer to the petitioner failure to establish entitlement to relief either on the merits or procedurally,and such ambiguity demands a determination that the orders are not explained.a habeas petitioner procedurally defaults a claim if 
the petitioner fails to comply with a state procedural rule the state courts enforce the rule the state procedural rule is an adequate and independent state ground for denying review of a federal constitutional claim and the petitioner can not show cause and prejudice excusing the default.
tolliver sheets,cir citing maupin smith,cir.the second part of this rule requires federal courts to determine the basis on which state courts rejected a given claim,and this court has struggled with this interpretive task in the context of michigan court orders citing rule d.see,alexander smith,app x,cir discussing how an apparent conflict within this circuit precedent has c omplicat ed matters with respect to this question.rule d provides 
entitlement to relief.the defendant has the burden of establishing entitlement to the relief requested.the court may not grant relief to the defendant if the motion 
seeks relief from a judgment of conviction and sentence that still is subject to challenge on direct appeal 
alleges grounds for relief which were decided against the defendant in a prior appeal or proceeding under this subchapter,unless the defendant establishes that a retroactive change in the law has undermined the prior decision 
alleges grounds for relief,other than jurisdictional defects,which could have been raised on appeal from the conviction and sentence or in a prior motion under this subchapter,unless the defendant demonstrates 
a good cause,and 
b actual prejudice 
the court may waive the good cause requirement of subrule d a if it concludes that there is a significant possibility that the defendant is innocent of the crime.
in some cases,the context of a brief order citing rule d clearly indicates that the state appellate court is affirming the lower court determination that a petitioner claims are procedurally defaulted.see,ivory jackson,cir never,at any point in ivory postconviction proceedings,did a michigan court address the merits of his claim.our earliest case directly addressing whether brief orders citing rule d are explained orders was such a case.see simpson jones,cir.
but michigan cases also reveal that some orders citing rule d deny relief on the merits.in people jackson,the michigan supreme court held that rule d applied to convictions handed down before the effective date of that rule.the petitioner in jackson,michael jackson,was sixteen at the time of his offense,and a juvenile court had waived jurisdiction over his case before he had been tried as an adult.id.at.jackson argued that this waiver was improper,and the state trial court on review denied this claim on the merits.id.at.before the michigan supreme court,jackson argued that the exception to rule d for jurisdictional defects applied to his invalid waiver claim.id.at.the state supreme court declined to decide this issue instead,the court reasoned 
regardless of whether this claim is a jurisdictional one within the meaning of rule d,the defendant is not entitled to relief.pursuant to rule d,t he defendant has the burden of establishing entitlement to the relief requested.the circuit judge second opinion discussed the merits of the juvenile court waiver issue and found it to be without merit.accordingly,the defendant failed to establish his entitlement to relief.thus,the defendant has not been deprived of review of that issue by the operation of subrule d.
id.at third alteration in original.under the analysis of this passage,rule d introductory sentence requiring the petitioner to establish his entitlement to relief applies to both the procedural and merits aspects of a petitioner claim.further,the michigan supreme court used the phrase,the defendant failed to establish his entitlement to relief,to refer to the petitioner failure to establish entitlement to relief on the merits of his claim.this supports our precedent that rule d has both a procedural and a substantive component,see ivory,at,and demonstrates that citations to a defendant failure to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief can refer to a defendant failure to meet that burden on the merits.
michigan practice confirms that brief orders citing rule d in some cases refer to a petitioner failure to meet his burden on the merits.the rule stated by rule d applies only to claims that could have been brought on direct appeal,and does not apply to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.in people allen,a michigan petitioner seeking relief argued that the judge in his criminal trial had erroneously excluded evidence and that he had been denied the effective assistance of appellate counsel,wl,at.may.the appellate court denied both of these claims on the merits.id.the michigan supreme court denied review because the defendant failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under rule d.people allen,unpublished table decision.because the petitioner in allen could not have raised his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in an earlier proceeding,the michigan supreme court form order necessarily rejected that claim on the merits.further,the present case involved the same situation.guilmette petition for review in state court included both trial and appellate claims.the form orders used by the state intermediate and supreme courts thus necessarily rejected one of guilmette claims on the merits.this fact refutes the argument that such form orders can only,or do only,refer to procedural default.
because the form orders in this case citing rule d are ambiguous as to whether they refer to procedural default or denial of relief on the merits,the orders are unexplained.we must therefore look to the last reasoned state court opinion to determine the basis for the state court rejection of guilmette claim.in ylst nunnemaker,the supreme court applied a presumption that w here there has been one reasoned state judgment rejecting a federal claim,later unexplained orders upholding that judgment or rejecting the same claim rest upon the same ground.where,as here,an earlier opinion fairly appear s to rest primarily upon federal law,we will presume that no procedural default has been invoked by a subsequent unexplained order that leaves the judgment or its consequences in place.id.citation omitted alteration in original quoting coleman thompson.applying that presumption in this case results in a conclusion that the michigan courts denied guilmette claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on the merits.
michigan primary argument that orders citing rule d can only refer to procedural default is untenable in light of jackson and the procedural history of cases like allen and the present case.the state also suggests that the michigan supreme court necessarily considered and thus determined whether guilmette had procedurally defaulted his claims because michigan courts are required to consider procedural default before considering the merits of a collateral challenge to a criminal judgment.but the cases the state cites do not support this assertion.instead,they stand for the considerably simpler proposition that collateral petitioners can not succeed without establishing entitlement to relief both procedurally and on the merits.see people mcswain,people brown,people watroba.this proposition does not prevent a state court from denying collateral relief to a petitioner on the merits without reaching the issue of procedural default.further,the michigan supreme court has implicitly rejected the state assertion by deciding a case on the merits without considering procedural default.jackson,at.
today holding also does not undermine federalism,and it does not disregard michigan interest in the enforcement of its procedural rules.we are mindful of our duty to to safeguard the states interest in the integrity of their criminal and collateral proceedings.williams taylor.but a duty to protect a state interest in its procedural rules is only applicable once we determine that the state has decided a given case on a procedural basis.the existence of this federalism interest thus depends on the question we are asked to resolve.because we are bound by the supreme court holding in ylst to determine that the state rejected guilmette claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on the merits,there is no state enforcement of a procedural rule in this case to which the federal courts can defer.
we do not reach the merits of guilmette claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel because the state did not appeal that aspect of the district court judgment.our general rule is that a n appellant abandons all issues not raised and argued in its initial brief on appeal.united states johnson,cir quoting united states still,cir.although this court may overlook such forfeiture,we part company with the partial dissent because we do not believe precedent requires us to look past the state default in these circumstances,and we decline to do so.in its initial appellate brief,the state raised two issues did guilmette procedurally default his claim,and had guilmette demonstrated cause and prejudice for his procedural default.in his brief,guilmette noted the state failure to appeal the merits of his claim,and he argued that the state had therefore abandoned this issue.the state did not file a reply brief.the panel opinion concluded that the state had challenged the district court conclusion only with respect to procedural default,guilmette,at,and the state neither contested this premise nor argued the merits of the claim before the en banc court.the state thus did not appeal the merits of the district court decision,did not respond to guilmette argument that such forfeiture precluded review,and did not argue before the en banc court that the panel opinion should be reinstated on the alternative basis that guilmette counsel were not constitutionally ineffective.these circumstances do not warrant an exercise of our discretion to overlook the state forfeiture of its merits argument.
because the state has not established that guilmette procedurally defaulted his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
concurring in part and dissenting in part 
the correctly,in my that the michigan courts summary orders citing guilmette fail ure to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr d are unexplained orders subject to under ylst nunnemaker.while judge griffin notes that these orders,which do cite a code provision,do not literally say nothing,dissent at quoting ylst,at emphasis added,the court clearly did not intend to set the bar for finding an order unexplained quite that high.see ylst,at holding order unexplained where,although it was not utterly silent,neither was it informative with respect to the question of whether a procedural bar was actually applied.because mcr d appears to embrace both a substantive and a procedural component,see ivory jackson,cir,i agree that a bare citation to that provision is simply not informative with respect to the question before us.ylst,at 
i part company with the majority,however,as to the ultimate resolution of this particular appeal.after rejecting the state argument,the majority concludes that the state waived on appeal any objection to the district court merits holding that guilmette received ineffective assistance of counsel,and that the writ must therefore issue.i can not agree.
part i of the state brief on appeal makes the we reject this court lacks jurisdiction over guilmette habeas petition because the michigan courts summary orders establish that guilmette claims are procedurally defaulted.part ii of the state appellate brief then goes on to argue that the cause and prejudice exception to the bar does not apply because guilmette did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.the heading of that portion of the state brief urges us to conclude that b ecause the state court decision that trial and appellate counsel were not constitutionally ineffective is not contrary to established federal law,petitioner has failed to show good cause or prejudice to excuse his procedural default.appellant br.at emphasis added.the body of that section contains a fully developed argument,citing relevant federal case law,that trial counsel was not,a fortiori,that the state review court did not unreasonably apply strickland washington,in so counsel decision to assert a defense rather than dispute the element of entry was a strateg ic choice which could have been successful.appellant br.at.
there is,of course,no separate section in the state appellate brief dedicated to the merits of guilmette underlying habeas claim premised on ineffective assistance of counsel.in other words,the state does not say,in so many words,that even if we do not read the michigan courts summary orders as indicating reliance on procedural default,guilmette still loses on the merits.but this should be irrelevant,as the very same claim serves both as an independent substantive ground for habeas relief and as cause and prejudice to excuse a procedural default becht united states,cir 
in addressing the issue of procedural default,furthermore,the state invoked the standard of review that applies when a federal court reviews a habeas petition on the merits.specifically,it is the law of this circuit that the higher aedpa standard of review applies when we address a habeas petitioner underlying claim on the merits,but not when we address whether ineffective assistance of counsel exists to excuse a procedural default.hall vasbinder,cir.in other words,we do not defer to a state court determination of whether ineffective assistance occurred for purposes of our analysis,although we do defer once we reach the merits of a habeas petitioner sixth amendment claim.ibid.in this case,although the state discussed ineffective assistance only in the portion of its brief dealing with cause and prejudice,it nonetheless correctly addressed guilmette claim under the higher aedpa standard of review.see appellant br.at it can not be said that the state court decision was an unreasonable application of strickland.the state would have had no need to invoke the aedpa unreasonable application standard if it actually intended to waive its merits argument and pin its hopes for reversal entirely on procedural default.this supports the conclusion that the state did not intend to waive its merits argument in this case.
this court precedents further compel that conclusion.in fact,in another recent habeas case,thompkins berghuis,a panel of this court rejected a waiver argument substantially identical to the one the majority accepts today.cir,rev on other grounds.in thompkins,the petitioner appellate brief addressed the merits of his claim,but failed to argue for the existence of cause and prejudice to excuse his procedural default.id.at.the warden submitted that any argument that cause and prejudice existed was therefore waived.ibid.although the panel found the petitioner failure to explicitly address procedural default troubling,it noted that the cause and prejudice inquiry for the procedural default issue merges with an analysis of the merits of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and,given the overlapping analysis,considered the petitioner arguments for both purposes.id.at.this case is the same,except that it is the merits argument,rather than the overlapping argument,which has not been made explicit.
we have invoked this merge r or overlapping analysis rule numerous times to reject waiver arguments asserted against appellants,irrespective of whether those appellants were plaintiffs or defendants below.for example,in stambaugh corrpro companies,the district court had dismissed the plaintiff complaint both because it failed to plead adequately the statutory element of scienter,and because it failed to satisfy the requirement of federal rule of civil procedure b that fraud claims be pleaded with particularity.app x,cir.even though the plaintiff appellate brief took issue with only one of the district court two equally sufficient grounds for dismissal,we declined the defendant invitation to summarily affirm the district court judgment because plaintiff failed to appeal an alternate ground of that decision.id.at.our reasoning resembled the panel reasoning in thompkins 
t he district court ruled both that leviticus had failed to allege particularized facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter,as required by the pslra,and that leviticus failed to plead fraud with particularity as required by.b.corrpro now argues that leviticus,in its appellants brief,failed to dispute the district court decision with respect to fed.civ.p b,that this constitutes a waiver of any argument that the rule b ruling was incorrect,and that therefore the district court decision should be summarily affirmed because one basis of that decision has not been appealed.
if a party does not raise an issue in its appellant brief,then that issue is waived leviticus did not separately argue that its complaint satisfied rule b rather,leviticus only argued that the complaint had adequately pled scienter,as required by the pslra.
in this case,although the issue is close,leviticus arguments regarding scienter are sufficient to preserve its appeal of the rule b dismissal.
we do not generally condone making arguments by inference.however,i n this case,the district court ruling that the complaint failed to satisfy.b revolved entirely around the requirement that a plaintiff allege fraudulent intent.the district court explanation of how the complaint failed to allege fraudulent intent mirrors its explanation of how the complaint failed to plead scienter as required by the pslra.therefore,if leviticus is correct that the complaint satisfies the pslra pleading standard,then the complaint would also satisfy rule b.the inference that appellants also challenge the district court alternative ground is thus sufficiently clear,and this court can consider the merits of leviticus appeal.
id.at internal citations omitted emphasis added.
we relied on stambaugh reasoning in united states goforth,a published decision involving the federal debt collection procedures act.cir.there,the district court held that the defendant spouses had made fraudulent transfers both because the payment of household expenses by the wife in return for the monthly payments from her husband would not constitute reasonably equivalent value under a,and because the payments were made with the intent to hinder,delay,and defraud the government,within the parameters of b a.id.at.on appeal,we rejected a waiver time,asserted against the reasons that should be familiar by now 
the government argues that the gilleys have waived any challenge to the district court alternative holding under b a because they did not argue it in their opening brief.the gilleys counter that their extensive arguments as to reasonably equivalent value under a preserve their challenge to this alternative ground because the fdcpa provides a defense to claims under b for transfers with respect to a person who took in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value or against any transferee or obligee subsequent to such person.a.
we have held that where an argument advanced in an appellant opening brief applies to and essentially subsumes an alternative basis for affirmance or reversal not separately argued therein,the appellant does not waive that alternative basis for affirmance or reversal.stambaugh corrpro,wl,at cir.because the gilleys expressly asserted arguments regarding reasonably equivalent value would apply equally to the defense under a not expressly argued,this authority would negate the government waiver argument.
id.at emphasis added 
we have quoted and applied the rule in goforth in at least two other published and one not.see sunarto mukasey,app x,cir because the analysis of petitioner sunarto immigration claims is largely the same under both reconsideration and reopening,we believe that sunarto arguments with respect to the reopening claims not expressly addressed in his appellate brief are sufficiently subsumed by his arguments on the reconsideration claims and that the goforth exception applies.madden chattanooga city wide serv.dep t,cir fails to make any arguments in its briefs as to plaintiff tennessee human rights act claims,which the district court found meritorious however,b ecause the analysis of plaintiff claims is the same under both title vii and the thra,we believe that latent arguments with respect to the thra claims are sufficiently subsumed within its express arguments on the title vii claims for the goforth exception to apply.
again,i believe that these precedents compel the conclusion that the state did not waive its merits argument,as that argument merges with,shares an overlapping analysis with,mirrors,is essentially subsume d within its argument.accordingly,i would reach the merits of guilmette claim.
in so doing,i would find that guilmette failed to establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel and thus,that appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to argue trial counsel ineffectiveness.as the panel majority compellingly explained,guilmette counsel had a promising defense based upon the victim questionable identification,guilmette plausible alibi,and the inconsistency between the victim description of guilmette actions and the testimony regarding guilmette inoperable door.guilmette howes,cir.further,if guilmette counsel had contested the element of entry,as guilmette now argues they should have done,it might have either removed the focus from or undermined the credibility of the defense misidentification argument.id.at.
indeed,as the panel majority noted,guilmette trial counsel strongly argued to the jury in closing that the jury ought to find the defense more credible because defense counsel,unlike the prosecutor,had refrained from making inconsistent alternative arguments.ibid.the defense began its closing argument by stating bluntly,this is a case about identification.not about whether a burglary occurred.and whether a suspect that has been brought in front of you,bruce guilmette,is the right person.the defense concluded with the following plea do let the only thing worse than what happened to the victim happen to guilmette.because,the evidence shows they got the wrong person.defense counsel underscored the consistency of their single theory,emphasizing that a t no time has anyone on the defense tr ied to persuade you that what the victim said did happen.by contrast,defense counsel characterized the prosecution as want ing it both ways,since the prosecution argued both that guilmette had enlisted another person to impersonate him at a methadone clinic in order to create a false alibi,and that enough time had elapsed between the and guilmette at the methadone clinic for guilmette to have been at both places.this sensible attack would,of course,have been foreclosed had the defense itself advanced inconsistent theories.
trial counsel decision to present one consistent,relatively strong defense to the jury,rather than arguing that guilmette did do if he did do it,he did actually place any part of his body inside the victim house,appears to have been a reasonable strategic choice.an attorney could reasonably choose to avoid confusing the jury with alternative defenses united states smith,cir see also strickland,at a court must indulge a strong presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.internal quotation marks omitted.guilmette,therefore,can not satisfy the strickland standard a fortiori,the state trial court decision on review that counsel was not ineffective was not unreasonable.see knowles mirzayance,the question under aedpa is not whether a federal court believes the state court determination under the strickland standard was incorrect but whether that determination was substantially higher threshold.internal quotation marks omitted.
in conditionally granting the writ on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel,the district court incorrectly applied strickland and aedpa.the state appellate brief explicitly argued just that.i therefore respectfully dissent from this court ultimate decision to affirm the district court judgment.
t he pedestal of the entire doctrine is respect for state procedural rules.franklin hightower,cir.as the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized,
federal habeas corpus principles must inform and shape the historic and still vital relation of mutual respect and common purpose existing between the states and the federal courts.in keeping this delicate balance we have been careful to limit the scope of federal intrusion into state criminal adjudications and to safeguard the states interest in the integrity of their criminal and collateral proceedings.see,coleman thompson,this is a case about federalism.it concerns the respect that federal courts owe the states and the states procedural rules when reviewing the claims of state prisoners in federal habeas corpus mccleskey zant,t he doctrines of procedural default and abuse of the writ are both designed to lessen the injury to a state that results through reexamination of a state conviction on a ground that the state did not have the opportunity to address at a prior,appropriate time and both doctrines seek to vindicate the state interest in the finality of its criminal judgments.
williams taylor.
today en banc decision erodes the fundamental tenets of federalism by voiding,for purposes of federal habeas corpus review,michigan adequate and independent rules of procedure.in my view,our prior panel opinion,guilmette howes,cir guilmette i,rehearing en banc granted,opinion vacated march,was correctly decided and,thus,rehearing en banc was improvidently granted.accordingly,i would reinstate our prior panel decision and reverse the district court.i therefore respectfully dissent.
in wainwright sykes,the supreme court addressed the following issue in what instances will an adequate and independent state ground bar consideration of otherwise cognizable federal issues on federal habeas review at.examining a florida state rule in this context,the supreme court noted that t he area of controversy which has developed has concerned the reviewability of federal claims which the state court has declined to pass on because not presented in the manner prescribed by its procedural rules.id.at emphasis added.in limiting federal habeas review to an analysis of cause and prejudice,the court held that florida rule constituted an independent and adequate state procedural ground,and thus involved contentions of federal law which were not resolved on the merits in the state proceeding due to respondent failure to raise them there as required by state procedure.id.at.
similarly,michigan rules,specifically d,are independent and adequate state procedural grounds that warrant enforcement by our court.see howard bouchard,cir it is in this circuit that the procedural bar set forth in rule d constitutes an adequate and independent ground on which the michigan supreme court may rely in foreclosing review of federal claims.
in guilmette i,judge rogers,writing for the panel majority,held that guilmette claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was procedurally defaulted because,although the state trial court on collateral review addressed the merits of guilmette claim,both the state appellate and supreme courts denied the claim pursuant to.d.guilmette i,at.in so holding,judge rogers cited our unanimous authority on this issue 
guilmette did not raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal,as required by.d.our decision in munson kapture,cir requires the conclusion that the michigan courts enforced rule d in this case and thus that guilmette claim is procedurally defaulted.in munson,as in the present case,the petitioner did not raise certain claims on direct appeal.at.in both cases,the petitioner then raised the claims in a state trial court on collateral review,and the state trial court denied the claims on the merits.id.at.then in both cases,the state appellate and state supreme courts each denied leave to appeal in brief orders,stating that the petitioner had failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr d.id.in munson,we held that rule d constituted an adequate and independent state ground and thus held the claims to be procedurally barred.no relevant fact distinguishes munson from the present case,and thus guilmette claim is similarly procedurally defaulted.
this conclusion is supported by five of this court other cases,all of which hold that habeas claims were procedurally defaulted in situations materially indistinguishable from the present case.see alexander smith,fed.appx.cir spencer booker,fed.appx.cir mccray metrish,fed.appx.cir burroughs v,makowski,cir luberda triplett,cir in each,the state trial court on collateral review denied the petitioner claims on the merits,and then both the state appellate and state supreme courts denied the claims pursuant to.d.we held that the petitioner claims were procedurally defaulted in each case.the binding nature of these precedents is inescapable.
id.at citations and footnotes omitted,emphasis added 
a cornerstone of these cases is our proper categorization of the state court orders at issue as explained unexplained orders that require further explication and,hence,scrutiny by this court to determine whether the state court decision rested primarily upon federal law.in coleman,the supreme court,when confronted with an ambiguous state court habeas order,refined the independent and adequate state ground doctrine and held 
in habeas,if the decision of the last state court to which the petitioner presented his federal claims fairly appeared to rest primarily on resolution of those claims,or to be interwoven with those claims,and did not clearly and expressly rely on an independent and adequate state law ground,a federal court may address the petition.
coleman,at.
in ylst nunnemaker,a companion case to coleman,the supreme court further clarified the doctrine application in cases involving unexplained state court orders and created the following presumption 
where there has been one reasoned state judgment rejecting a federal claim,later unexplained orders upholding that judgment or rejecting the same claim rest upon the same ground.if an earlier opinion fairly appear s to rest primarily upon federal law,coleman,at,we will presume that no procedural default has been invoked by a subsequent unexplained order that leaves the judgment or its consequences in place.similarly where,as here,the last reasoned opinion on the claim explicitly imposes a procedural default,we will presume that a later decision rejecting the claim did not silently disregard that bar and consider the merits.
the maxim is that silence implies consent,not the courts generally behave accordingly,affirming without further discussion when they agree,not when they disagree,with the reasons given below we think that a presumption which gives them no simply looks through them to the last reasoned nearly reflects the role they are ordinarily intended to play.
the court in ylst defined the term unexplained order as an order whose text or accompanying opinion does not disclose the reason for the judgment.id.at.otherwise stated,t he essence of unexplained orders is that they say nothing.id.at.
in the present case,the state appellate court orders are neither ambiguous nor unexplained.in munson,we held that 
f or purposes of procedural default,the state judgment with which we are concerned is the last explained state court judgment.ylst nunnemaker.munson argues that the last explained state court judgment is the trial court opinion denying his motion for relief.in that opinion,the court relied on procedural default in rejecting only one of his claims it denied the other claims on their merits.contrary to munson assertion,however,the last explained state court judgment in this case is the michigan supreme court order denying review of munson claims based upon his failure to comply with rule d.we have held that orders such as that issued by the michigan supreme court constitute explained state court judgments for purposes of procedural default.see,simpson jones,cir holding that an order issued by the michigan supreme court stating that the petitioner had failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr d though brief constituted the last explained state court judgment in the case.
munson,at footnote omitted,second emphasis added.likewise,in yukins,cir,we observed that 
o ur precedents establish that the state supreme court order saying simply that failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr d was based on an independent and adequate state procedural rule.simpson jones,cir burroughs makowski,cir.despite its brevity,the order constituted a reasoned judgment that adequately explained its procedural basis.because the michigan supreme court expressly stated that claim was barred by mcr d,see simpson,at,the federal courts may not review that claim absent cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice.see harris reed,at.
at see also burroughs,at t he michigan court of appeals and michigan supreme court statements that burroughs was not entitled to relief under d presents a sufficient explanation that their rulings were based on procedural default.alexander,app x at the michigan supreme court order denying alexander relief from the judgment under mcr d constitutes an explained order invoking an independent and adequate procedural bar to relief.friedman smith,app x,cir unpublished the michigan supreme court order disclosed the reason for its.d.the judgment,therefore,was not unreasoned or unexplained.consequently,we need not look to prior state court judgments on the petitioner brady claim,correll stewart,cir citing ylst and holding that b y invoking procedural grounds analogous to mcr d for its dismissal of the petitioner claims,the state trial court barred later federal review of these claims on the merits.
in the present case,the orders of the michigan supreme court and the michigan court of denied guilmette petitions because he failed to sustain his burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr d are,as judge rogers notes in guilmette i,materially indistinguishable from the explained orders at the core of our substantial body of case law that requires,under these circumstances,that we honor the state court judgments explicitly denying guilmette claim on independent and adequate state procedural grounds.we should not manufacture ambiguity where there is none,and we need not ignore or look through these unequivocal state court orders,which by their express language preclude collateral review.in my view,guilmette i and its abundant persuasive precedent were correctly decided and therefore should not be overruled.
like most jurisdictions,michigan requires that all claims be brought on direct appeal.see people caston,b ecause defendant failed to pursue an appeal as of right when he had the opportunity to do so,and because the time limitations for filing an application for leave to appeal have expired,defendant convictions are reviewable only in accordance with subchapter of the michigan court rules,dealing with postappeal relief.mcr.see also subchapter of the michigan court rules delineating michigan appellate practice and procedure.
subchapter of the michigan court rules establishes procedural rules for appeals.these rules were promulgated by the michigan supreme court on march,effective october,as part of michigan comprehensive revision of its rules of criminal procedure 
before october,the procedure for collateral review of criminal convictions in michigan did not make any provisions for finality of judgments.as a consequence,defendants could,and did,repeatedly seek relief without limitation.to create a uniform system of procedure,michigan court rules et were enacted.the rules present a carefully balanced scheme that liberally permits the assertion of claims on direct appeal,whether timely or not,while at the same time introducing a concept of finality to discourage repeated trips up and down the appellate ladder.
people reed,see also people jackson.the rules were designed to encourage raising legal issues on initial appeal rather than in postconviction review,recognizing that n either the guarantee of a fair trial nor a direct appeal entitles a defendant to as many attacks on a final conviction as ingenuity may devise.reed,at footnote omitted.
as rules of procedure,not substantive law,the provisions of subchapter were given retroactive effect by the michigan supreme court.jackson,at.in so holding,the michigan supreme court stated that the rules of subchapter are modes of procedure only,and that w e can discern no theory upon which the defendant can be said to have a vested right in the lack bringing challenges to criminal convictions extant before the adoption of mcr subchapter.id.at.
in fact,although the michigan supreme court is constitutionally empowered to promulgate rules of practice and procedure pursuant to article,of the michigan constitution it is not authorized to enact court rules that establish,abrogate,or modify the substantive law.people glass,quoting mcdougall schanz.rather,as is evident from the plain language of,the michigan supreme court constitutional authority extends only to matters of practice and procedure.mcdougall,at.
d,at issue in the present case,provides,in full 
d entitlement to relief.the defendant has the burden of establishing entitlement to the relief requested.the court may not grant relief to the defendant if the motion 
seeks relief from a judgment of conviction and sentence that still is subject to challenge on appeal pursuant to subchapter or subchapter 
alleges grounds for relief which were decided against the defendant in a prior appeal or proceeding under this subchapter,unless the defendant establishes that a retroactive change in the law has undermined the prior decision 
alleges grounds for relief,other than jurisdictional defects,which could have been raised on appeal from the conviction and sentence or in a prior motion under this subchapter,unless the defendant demonstrates 
a good cause for failure to raise such grounds on appeal or in the prior motion,and 
b actual prejudice from the alleged irregularities that support the claim for relief.as used in this subrule,actual prejudice means that,
i in a conviction following a trial,but for the alleged error,the defendant would have had a reasonably likely chance of acquittal 
ii in a conviction entered on a plea of guilty,guilty but mentally ill,or nolo contendere,the defect in the proceedings was such that it renders the plea an involuntary one to a degree that it would be manifestly unjust to allow the conviction to stand 
iii in any case,the irregularity was so offensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process that the conviction should not be allowed to stand regardless of its effect on the outcome of the case 
iv in the case of a challenge to the sentence,the sentence is invalid.
the court may waive the good cause requirement of subrule d a if it concludes that there is a significant possibility that the defendant is innocent of the crime.
as the michigan court of appeals explained in people mcswain,
it is well settled that s ubchapter of the michigan court rules establishes procedures for pursuing postappeal relief from a criminal conviction.the subchapter is the exclusive means to challenge a conviction in michigan once a defendant has exhausted the normal appellate process.relief,however,may not be granted unless the defendant demonstrates a good cause for failure to have raised the grounds for relief on appeal or in a prior motion under the subchapter and b actual prejudice from the alleged irregularities that support the claim for relief.mcr d a and b.
mcr is phrased in the negative and sets out three bars to relief from judgment.the first bar,under mcr d,is that a court may not grant relief from judgment if the criminal defendant motion seeks relief from judgment of conviction and sentence that still is subject to challenge on appeal under mcr or mcr.this bar is not applicable here mcswain judgment of conviction and sentence is not now subject to challenge on appeal pursuant to mcr or.
the second bar,under mcr d,is that a court may not grant relief from judgment if the criminal defendant motion alleges grounds for relief that were decided against the defendant in a prior appeal or proceeding under mcr,unless the defendant establishes that a retroactive change in the law has undermined the prior decision.this bar is also not applicable here mcswain motion did not allege grounds that were decided against her in a prior appeal or proceeding under mcr.
the third bar,under mcr d,is that a court may not grant relief from judgment if the criminal defendant motion alleges grounds for relief,other than jurisdictional defects,which could have been raised on appeal from the conviction and sentence or in a prior motion under mcr.this bar clearly applies here as mcswain could have,but did not,raise the issue of her alleged mental incapacity in her prior appeal from her conviction and sentence.however,a criminal defendant can avoid the application of this bar if that defendant demonstrates 
a good cause for failure to raise such grounds on appeal or in the prior motion and 
b actual prejudice from the alleged irregularities that support the claim for relief.
the court rule also provides that the criminal defendant has the burden of establishing entitlement to the relief requested and that the court may waive the good cause requirement of mcr d a if it concludes that there is a significant possibility that the defendant is innocent of the crime.
mcswain,at emphasis added.
the michigan court of appeals explanation that the petitioner bears the burden to demonstrate good cause and actual prejudice,id.at,is consistent with the introductory sentence of d,which provides the defendant has the burden of establishing entitlement to the relief requested.thus,unless the petitioner sustains his burdens of production and persuasion,he may not be granted relief because he has not demonstrated actual prejudice and good cause.
in the present case,our en banc court has been influenced by judge martin panel dissent,in which he opined,in part,as follows 
although d,and list specific procedural grounds for denying a defendant relief from judgment,these procedural grounds are not the exclusive grounds for which a court may deny relief pursuant to d.a court may deny relief from judgment under d for the substantive,reason that the defendant simply failed to meet his burden of establishing entitlement to the relief requested.as such,the michigan courts bare citation to d in orders denying guilmette leave to appeal does not demonstrate that the courts denied him leave to appeal on the basis of a procedural default,much less on the procedural ground described in d,which the warden urges on this court.
guilmette i,at martin,dissenting.
regarding the three subsections that are part and parcel of the rule,judge martin correctly recognizes that mcr d,and list specific procedural grounds for denying a defendant relief from judgment id.emphasis added.however,contrary to the dissent assertion,there is no subsection d.judge martin is presumably referring to d introductory sentence.
in any event,we have already rejected the precise argument advanced by judge martin.in friedman,we stated 
we must next determine whether the michigan supreme court utilized.d to bar friedman claim.the court o
