christopher strong,a virginia prisoner,petitioned the supreme court of virginia the supreme court,under its original jurisdiction,for a writ of habeas corpus on the claim that his lawyer ignored his instruction to appeal his state convictions,thereby violating his sixth amendment right to assistance of counsel.the supreme court,after considering strong conclusory sworn statement and his lawyer more detailed affidavit,found that strong had not objectively demonstrated an intent to appeal.the supreme court therefore dismissed his petition.strong then filed a federal habeas petition,raising the same claim,that was also dismissed by the district court.we,like the district court,conclude that the supreme court of virginia decision to dismiss was not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.see d.accordingly,we affirm the dismissal of strong federal habeas petition.
after a bench trial on december,the circuit court of hanover county,virginia circuit court,found strong guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.sentencing was delayed pending a second bench trial on march,in which strong was convicted of one count of marijuana distribution.thereafter,he was sentenced to five years imprisonment with three years suspended on the firearm conviction and five years imprisonment with four years and six months suspended on the marijuana conviction.the sentencing orders for both convictions were entered by the circuit court on april.
on that same date,april,the clerk of the circuit court received a letter from strong,written two days earlier,that read 
my name is christopher danton strong,and i am writing to request a copy of my sentencing order if my lawyer has not noted my ap p eal for,possession of a firearm after being a convicted felon,and distribution of marijuana over ounce,but under pounds,then i would like to do so.
the clerk office,by letter dated april,informed strong that his sentencing orders would be sent to him after they were entered.although no mention of appeal was made in the clerk response to strong,it appears that strong letter was treated as a notice of appeal.indeed,on may,a court reporter filed a transcript of the proceedings in strong cases with the clerk of the court and sent copies to the prosecutor and to eddie vaughn,strong lawyer.in her cover letter the court reporter said that she had prepared the transcript pursuant to notice of appeal.strong was not sent a copy of this letter.neither strong nor his lawyer took further action,and on august,the court of appeals of virginia dismissed strong case,explaining that no petition for appeal had been filed and that the time for filing had expired.
in december strong attempted to file a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the supreme court of virginia.this first petition apparently never reached the court,but strong was successful in filing a verified petition on april.in it,strong asserted a claim for insufficient counsel and explained that i asked my lawyer to appeal,but he refused after leading me to believe that he would do so.strong provided no additional details,and he attached no supporting documentation.moreover,he did not request an evidentiary hearing.
the supreme court entered an order on may,directing the respondent,the director of the virginia department of corrections the commonwealth,to respond to strong petition.on june,the commonwealth moved to dismiss the petition,arguing that although strong had initially wanted to appeal his convictions,strong lawyer,vaughn,explained to strong that he had no grounds on which to appeal.according to the commonwealth,strong ultimately agreed that no appeal would be filed.in support of this version of the facts,the commonwealth attached a letter,dated april,from vaughn to the virginia state bar counsel.the letter was in response to a bar complaint that strong had filed.vaughn said in his letter 
i did represent strong on the cases set out in his letter of april.he was convicted of selling marijuana and had a show cause hearing on a previously suspended sentence.
after the hearing i visited strong twice at the pamunkey regional jail.his letter is correct in that he had indicated a wish to appeal.his letter is also correct in that i advised him he had no grounds upon which to b ase an appeal.he understood and agreed that an appeal would serve no purpose.we revisited this issue on my second visit with the same results.strong knew no appeal would be filed and understood there was no basis upon which to file it.he agreed with this and was twice advised in reference to this.
the letter was subscribed and sworn to by vaughn before a notary public as a true and exact copy.id.
strong did not request leave,as required by supreme court of virginia rule e,to file a response to the commonwealth motion to dismiss.nonetheless,strong submitted a response to the supreme court on july.the response was unverified.in this document strong asserted for the first time that a fter the deadline to appeal had passed,vaughn stated to me,i have read over your court transcripts and there is nothing to appeal.strong attached a copy of his april,letter to the hanover county circuit clerk in which he had asked for copies of his sentencing orders and advised the clerk that if his lawyer ha d not noted his appeal he would like to do so.the clerk letter to strong of april,explaining that his sentencing orders would be sent after they were entered,was also attached.
in an order entered october,the supreme court of virginia granted the commonwealth motion to dismiss strong petition,based on the following findings of fact 
the record,including the affidavit of counsel,demonstrates that petitioner initially instructed counsel to appeal his convictions and counsel advised petitioner that he had no grounds upon which to appeal.petitioner told counsel he understood and agreed that an appeal would serve no purpose.counsel revisited this issue during a second visit with petitioner,and petitioner again agreed that his convictions would not be appealed.petitioner has failed to establish that he objectively demonstrated his intent to appeal his conviction.
the supreme court decision did not refer to strong july,response,which strong had submitted without leave of court.
on october,strong filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.in his federal petition strong asserted that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel because m y court appointed attorney told me he would appeal my case,but when it was too late to appeal,he came back and told me there was nothing to appeal.the commonwealth moved to dismiss strong petition on august.on february,the district court granted the commonwealth motion to dismiss,concluding that the supreme court of virginia decision to reject strong claim was not objectively unreasonable in light of the facts and evidence before that court.
strong,now represented by appointed counsel,appeals.
we review de novo a district court decision on a petition for writ of habeas corpus based on a state court record,and we,like the district court,are bound by d.spicer roxbury corr,cir.thus,a federal court may not grant the writ 
with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
strong seeks a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that his sixth amendment right to the assistance of counsel was violated by vaughn failure to appeal his case.f ailure to file a requested appeal is per se ineffective assistance of counsel,irrespective of the possibility of success on the merits.united states foster,cir.in other words,a petitioner whose counsel failed to file a requested appeal does not have to show prejudice in order to obtain relief.see united sta
