james neil tucker was convicted by a south carolina jury of the murder of rosa lee dolly oakley.upon the jury recommendation,the trial court sentenced tucker to death.after his direct appeal and review yielded no relief in the state courts,tucker filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.the district court dismissed the petition.on appeal,tucker claims that he was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to provide the defense expert two documents relating to tucker childhood sexual abuse and failed to discover that one of the state three experts was subject to professional discipline at the time of trial.we issued a certificate of appealability on both of these claims.after further review,we find no error in the denial of habeas relief,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
dolly oakley was in her yard at her sumter county,south carolina residence when tucker pulled into her driveway on june,tucker pulled out a gun and forced oakley into the house and then into her bedroom.just as tucker was preparing to bind oakley with tape,joe black rang the doorbell.black and james howard who waited outside in the car were looking for oakley husband.both tucker and oakley went out into the driveway as black was leaving the house.oakley began screaming,do leave me,he going to kill me,holding black arm as he sat in howard car.howard panicked and drove away.tucker dragged oakley back into the house,took fourteen dollars from her purse,and shot her twice in the head at close range.tucker testified that he shot her the first time when she tried to grab the gun.he shot her a second time to put her out of her misery.
tucker crime spree did not end with the murder of dolly oakley.still in sumter county,he broke into the christian fellowship church and later the mobile home of kenneth parker.tucker moved on to neighboring calhoun county,where he murdered another woman,shannon mellon,and stole her car.tucker then drove north,abandoned the car,and crossed the state line into north carolina.tucker was finally captured in maggie valley,north carolina on july.once in custody,tucker confessed to the murders of both oakley and mellon.
tucker was first tried in calhoun county for the murder of shannon mellon.that jury convicted tucker of murder,armed robbery,burglary,and grand larceny of a vehicle.tucker was sentenced to death.the supreme court of south carolina affirmed the convictions but reversed the death sentence.state tucker.at a subsequent sentencing hearing,tucker again received a death sentence,which the supreme court of south carolina later affirmed.state tucker.
the jury in this case found tucker guilty of murder,kidnapping,burglary,armed robbery,and possession of a weapon during a violent crime for his actions at the oakley residence.the jury also found tucker guilty of burglary for the at christian fellowship church.finally,the jury convicted tucker of burglary and larceny for the at parker mobile home.
at sentencing,tucker counsel argued that tucker should not receive a death sentence because he suffered from an antisocial personality disorder stemming from horrific physical and sexual abuse.robert noelker,an expert in forensic psychology retained by the defense,testified that tucker had suffered from sustained,prolonged,and severe abuse as a abuse from his and sexual abuse from his older.as a result of this abuse,tucker was taught that aggression was a way of getting things,being assertive,being aggressive,being violent was a way of getting something.in sum,noelker concluded that tucker understood the requirements of the law but lacked the ability to conform his behavior to those standards.that inability to conform,in noelker opinion,was a result of tucker life total experiences,but more specifically as a result of his antisocial personality disorder.
the state countered tucker mitigation case with three expert witnesses who testified that antisocial personality disorder is merely a description of behavior,not a mental disease or defect that caused tucker to murder oakley.forensic psychiatrist richard frierson diagnosed tucker as having antisocial personality disorder,but he explained that a ntisocial personality disorder does not affect a person ability to choose his behavior the disorder does not cause criminal behavior.likewise,steven shea,a clinical psychologist,testified that tucker has an antisocial personality disorder but that the disorder does not preclude him from choosing whether or not to act.according to shea,t he personality disorders are a way of describing people who have a certain tendency to act a certain way.it not a mental disease in the sense that it brain disease.finally,john dunlap agreed with the state other experts that antisocial personality disorder is descriptive,not causative actually the diagnosis of antisocial personality is primarily a description of behavior that you have.it not the reason you have the behaviors.
the trial court instructed the jury that it could consider four statutory aggravating factors and four statutory mitigating factors.see ann.c a b.in particular,the jury was instructed that it could consider as mitigating circumstances tucker mental or emotional disturbance,whether he acted under duress,any mental incapacity,and his age or mentality at the time of the crime.see id.c b.at defense counsel request,the trial court submitted the following mitigation factors for consideration as well cooperation with law enforcement officials,circumstances surrounding tucker childhood,circumstances surrounding tucker experience in prison,any mitigating circumstances,and any mitigating circumstances supported by the evidence.
the jury found the existence of three statutory aggravating factors and recommended a death sentence.the trial court then sentenced tucker to death for the murder of dolly oakley,life imprisonment for kidnapping,life imprisonment for burglary,years for armed robbery,five years for possession of a weapon,five years for burglary,and thirty days for larceny.
the supreme court of south carolina affirmed the convictions and the sentence,state tucker,and the supreme court of the united states denied certiorari,tucker south carolina,d.tucker then filed an application for relief pcr in state court after conducting an evidentiary hearing,the pcr court denied relief on the merits of tucker claims.the supreme court of south carolina denied certiorari,as did the supreme court of the united states,tucker maynard,d.tucker then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the district court pursuant to.upon a recommendation from the magistrate judge,the district court denied relief on the merits of tucker claims.this appeal followed.
we review de novo the district court denial of habeas relief based on a state court record.bell ozmint,cir.where a state court resolved the merits of a claim for relief,federal habeas relief is not available unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
the contrary to and unreasonable application clauses of d have independent meanings.bell cone,d.relief is available under the contrary to clause if the state court applies a rule different from the governing law set forth in supreme court cases,or if it decides a case differently than the supreme court has done on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.id.alternatively,relief is available under the unreasonable application clause if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal principles from supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case.id.the focus of this inquiry is whether the state court application of clearly established federal law is objectively unreasonable,not whether it is merely incorrect.id.see also williams taylor,d stating that habeas relief is not warranted under the unreasonable application clause simply because the court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.
to the extent that tucker challenges certain factual findings made by the state court,federal habeas relief is available only if the state court decision to deny relief was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.d.in reviewing a state court ruling on relief,we are mindful that a determination on a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed correct,and the burden is on the petitioner to rebut this presumption by clear and convincing evidence.id.e.
tucker contends that he was denied his sixth amendment right to assistance of counsel during his capital sentencing proceedings.sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claims are governed by the familiar standards of strickland washington,d in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim,the petitioner must prove that counsel performance was deficient and the deficient performance actually prejudiced the defense.id.at.
counsel performance is deficient only if it falls below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.the supreme court has cautioned that i t is all too tempting for a defendant to counsel assistance after conviction or adverse sentence,and it is all too easy for a court,examining counsel defense after it has proved unsuccessful,to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.id.at.thus,in reviewing counsel performance at trial,a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.id.
deficient performance is prejudicial only if there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.strickland,at.where the petitioner challenges a death sentence,the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that,absent the errors,the sentencer would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.id.at.in making this determination,a reviewing court should consider the totality of the evidence presented to the factfinder.id.
tucker claims that his trial counsel were constitutionally inadequate because they failed to provide to noelker two reports relating to tucker childhood sexual abuse.these records were produced by utah authorities in connection with tucker juvenile detention in the.the first report,a document prepared by floyd bradshaw in the bradshaw report,stated that tucker 
admits to homosexual activity with both wayne brother and randy.he has watched them engage in various types of homosexual activity with each other he says the brothers are queers.he thinks something is wrong with him also.he feels extremely guilty about what he has done.he expresses a need to be locked up in detention for awhile.he has said on a couple of occasions that it really does matter what happens to him in c ourt.
the second report,prepared by james marchel in the marchel report,described tucker inability to get along with his stepfather 
he feels that the relationship between himself and his stepfather is beyond repair.if given his choice,he would choose any institution rather than go home.
although tucker background and development reflect a great deal of sic and frightening sexual activity and experience,this does not appear to be the primary motivating factor for his present behavior.rather,all of tucker delinquent behavior,including his sexual behavior,seems more to be a way of insuring that he will not be required to return to his home.
he is unable to relate to his step father,and so is constantly at odds with him.they frequently argue,and often do not speak to each other for several days at a time.
tucker asserts that his counsel unreasonably limited the scope of their investigation into his childhood abuse,failing to provide these utah records to noelker as proof that tucker reported physical and sexual abuse as early as.counsel failure to investigate potential defenses or mitigating circumstances may amount to ineffective assistance.wiggins smith,d byram ozmint,cir.as the supreme court has noted,however,strickland does not require counsel to investigate every conceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely the effort would be to assist the defendant at sentencing.wiggins.at.in the end,a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances,applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgments.id.at.
the petitioner in wiggins claimed that his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to obtain a social history that would have revealed childhood sexual abuse.id.at.in preparing their mitigation case,counsel relied upon reports of psychological tests that revealed nothing about the wiggins social history,a presentence investigation that included a account of wiggins personal history,and department of social services records documenting wiggins placements in foster care.id.at.despite the fact that the department of social services record indicated significant problems in wiggins family life,his counsel put on a halfhearted mitigation case that made no mention of wiggins family background.id.at.as a result,only one significant mitigating lack of a criminal to the jury.id.at.especially in light of the fact that the public defender made funds available for counsel to retain a forensic social worker,the supreme court held that counsel failure to expand their investigation fell short of prevailing professional standards.id.at.
tucker counsel,by contrast,presented a substantial mitigation case at sentencing.they presented five witnesses,including tucker wife,two vocational rehabilitation workers who knew tucker,a widow whose husband tucker had befriended while in prison,and noelker,a clinical psychologist qualified as an expert in forensic psychology.noelker described at length tucker history of abuse as a child and its connection to tucker antisocial personality disorder.noelker testified that in preparation for his testimony,he interviewed tucker on four different occasions,read the voluntary statement made by tucker in this case,reviewed the deposition of the doctor who testified in tucker calhoun county trial,and reviewed a social history prepared by a licensed social worker in advance of the calhoun county trial relying upon these sources,in addition to his years experience as a clinical psychologist,noelker told the jury that tucker had a conduct disorder as a juvenile and more recently was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder.
according to noelker,tucker personality disorder was likely caused by early sexual physical abuse,early and sustained parental indifference the lack of concern or care,the lack of a solid role model as a parent.noelker testified,tucker,at only eighteen months of age,was found abandoned in a locked car with a broken leg that his parents fled the state in order to avoid prosecution and that tucker was the target of sexual and physical abuse from family members until he was about eleven years old.as a result of this abuse,noelker testified that tucker was unable to conform his behavior to common standards.the record leaves no doubt that the jury was offered a clear,coherent mitigation case that focused on tucker history of abuse.
counsel performance in preparing tucker mitigation case far surpassed the inadequate performance described in wiggins counsel attended the previous trial,made reasoned judgments about which witnesses to call,and presented an expert psychologist who gave the jury a full picture of tucker disturbing social history.although counsel should conduct a reasonable investigation into potential defenses,strickland does not impose a constitutional requirement that counsel uncover every scrap of evidence that could conceivably help their client.green french,cir,abrogated on other grounds by williams taylor,d.see also byram,at holding that trial counsel were
