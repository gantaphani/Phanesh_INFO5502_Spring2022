billy williams moves for authorization to file a successive habeas corpus application pursuant to west supp.see b west supp.we deny this motion.
according to his motion for authorization pfa motion,williams is presently serving a year sentence for second degree murder and related offenses,for which he was convicted in in virginia state court.he alleges that the primary evidence against him came from two eyewitnesses,torrey wright and richard teach.these witnesses testified that they were riding in a vehicle with wright daughter when teach saw williams and called out to him williams then began shooting at the vehicle,injuring wright and killing his daughter.two defense witnesses countered that williams was with them in another part of town at the time of the shooting.
the jury,apparently deeming the prosecution evidence more credible than williams alibi witnesses,found williams guilty as charged.after an unsuccessful direct appeal,williams filed a petition in united states district court.the petition was denied on november,and this court dismissed williams ensuing appeal,see williams angelone.cir.per curiam,cert.denied,d.
while his petition was pending in the district court,williams encountered richard teach at the richmond city jail.teach allegedly told williams that his testimony against williams was perjured,that he testified as he did because criminal charges were pending against him at the time of williams trial,and that those charges were later dropped.williams claims that the prosecutor never disclosed any of these facts,even after teach testified that he had no charges pending against him.
acting on this information,williams filed a habeas corpus petition in state court,which was denied.williams then filed his pfa motion in this court.attached to this motion is the application that williams wishes to file proposed application.the proposed application reiterates two claims from williams first assistance of counsel and denial of the right to presents the following new claim 
on june,petitioner learned through prosecutor witness in this case richard teach that his testimony was perjury in that he testified he was charged with any crimes,at petitioner trial,however on june,he admitted to petitioner that prior to his trial he was charged with crimes in order to testify.
proposed application at.
as modified by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,b imposes the following limits on review of successive applications 
a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.
a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless 
a the applicant shows that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable or 
b i the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence and 
ii the facts underlying the claim,if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
in addition,b a provides that a successive application may not be filed in the district court without authorization from the relevant court of appeals.the court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second or successive application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of this subsection.b c.section b d requires the court to grant or deny the authorization to file a second or successive application not later than days after the filing of the motion.
williams contends that his pfa motion must be granted because it has been pending for more than days.in the alternative,williams asserts that his proposed application meets the standard for authorization.we disagree with both of these arguments.
williams initially maintains that the deadline established by b d may not be extended and that the appropriate remedy for a violation of this deadline is to grant the pfa motion.this argument founders on circuit precedent.in in re vial,cir en banc,the deadline passed before the court ruled on a pfa motion,but we indicated that extended consideration was appropriate because the importance of the issue presented justified the delay.id.at.this statement defeats williams claim that this court may not extend the deadline.
the other courts of appeals to consider this question have likewise concluded that the b d deadline is precatory,not mandatory.united states barrett,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord browning united states,cir en banc united states,cir in re siggers,cir galtieri united states,cir.but,at easterbrook,dissenting criticizing allow courts of appeals to extend the deadline.the sixth circuit has offered a particularly persuasive explanation for this position,premised on the general rule that a statutory time period is not mandatory unless it both expressly requires action within a particular time period and specifies a consequence for failure to comply with the provision.siggers,at internal quotation marks omitted accord holland pardee coal,cir noting,with citation to siggers,the recognized canon of construction which instructs against treating statutory timing provisions as jurisdictional,unless such a consequence is clearly indicated,cert.denied,d.the sixth circuit concluded that because congress prescribed no consequence for noncompliance with b d,the provision is merely hortatory or advisory.siggers,at.
williams asserts that these decisions must be reexamined in light of tyler cain,d.in tyler,the supreme court held that a pfa motion may be granted under b a only if the supreme court has held that a particular rule of constitutional law applies retroactively to cases on collateral review.see id.at.in reaching this holding,the court relied in part on b d 
the court of appeals must make a decision on a pfa motion within days it is unlikely that a court of appeals could make the necessary determination in the allotted time if it had to do more than simply rely on supreme court holdings on retroactivity.the stringent time limit thus suggests that the courts of appeals do not have to engage in the difficult legal analysis that can be required to determine questions of retroactivity in the first instance.
nothing in tyler suggests that b d is mandatory let alone that the remedy for failure to comply with the deadline is to grant authorization.in tyler,the supreme court fashioned a rule that would enable courts of appeals to comply with b d in the vast majority of cases.this is not inconsistent,however,with our prior determination that we may exceed the limitation in the exceptional cases that can not be resolved more quickly.galtieri,at stating that pfa motions usually present relatively simple questions but,when they do not,we do not think that congress wanted courts to forgo reasoned adjudication.accordingly,we adhere to our determination in vial that we may consider a pfa motion for longer than days if the importance and complexity of the issues presented justify such extended consideration 
because b d does not compel us to grant williams pfa motion,we must determine whether the motion makes a prima facie showing that williams can satisfy the requirements of b.b c.to make this determination,we will examine each of the claims in the proposed application if any claim meets the statutory threshold,we will grant the pfa motion and allow williams to file the proposed application in its entirety.see united states winestock,wl,slip op.at cir.
at the outset,we consider the meaning of the statutory term prima facie showing.other courts of appeals differ over whether this is an exacting requirement or a relatively lenient one.compare,rodriguez superintendent,cir characterizing the prima facie showing as a high hurdle,with,bell united states,cir per curi
