cockerham also filed a total of three state applications for relief.the first was filed and denied in.the second was filed in and was not considered because,as calculated from his errors patent appeal,it was untimely.the third was filed in january,after his out of time appeal.it was in this third application that cockerham first asserted that the reasonable doubt portion of his jury instruction was constitutionally defective,under cage louisiana,d.this application was denied by the trial court on march.the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeals denied relief in june.the louisiana supreme court denied cockerham writ application in february.state ex rel.cockerham louisiana,so d february.all three denials of relief as to cockerham third application were without explanation 
on april,cockerham filed the present habeas petition pursuant to.one of the proposed bases for relief was the cage claim.on november,the district court ordered the state to produce a transcript or other evidence of the actual jury charge given at cockerham trial as well as any objections thereto.the state contacted the trial court but was informed that the trial transcript of the jury charge could not be found.the minutes of cockerham trial reflect that defense counsel objected to the jury instructions,but do not reveal the nature of the objection.in february,the district court appointed the federal public defender to represent cockerham.in may and june of,cockerham habeas counsel filed the affidavits of judge leon cannizzaro,the judge who presided at cockerham trial,and philip johnson,cockerham trial counsel.judge cannizzaro stated that it was his custom and practice to give the same jury instruction found unconstitutional in cage and that he was not aware of any reason he would not have given this instruction at cockerham trial.johnson stated that it was his general practice to object to the reasonable doubt instruction that was being read to jurors in that court during that time and that he has no reason to believe he did not object thereto at cockerham trial.johnson also referred to a portion of the trial transcript which was found in which he objected to a question by the prosecutor as to whether the witness is positive to a moral certainty that cockerham was the perpetrator.

discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.fairman anderson,cir.as to the level of deference owed the state court rejection of cockerham cage claim,we are willing to assume arguendo that such rejection constituted an adjudication on the merits and that the deferential standards of d apply.these standards dictate that the state denials of relief stand unless they were contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court or were predicated upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented at the state proceeding.
ii.habeas rule a 
the state maintains that the district court erred in failing to dismiss cockerham petition as untimely under habeas rule a.rule a of the rules governing section petitions provides 
delayed petitions.a petition may be dismissed if it appears that the state of which the respondent is an officer has been prejudiced in its ability to respond to the petition by delay in its filing unless the petitioner shows that it is based on grounds of which he could not have had knowledge by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the circumstances prejudicial to the state occurred.
in order to discharge its heavy burden in seeking dismissal under this rule,the state must make a particularized showing of prejudice,show that the prejudice was caused by the petitioner having filed a late petition,and show that the petitioner has not acted with reasonable diligence as a matter of law.walters scott,cir emphasis in original footnote omitted.the district court found that the state could not make any of the showings required by walters.we need only observe that the state can not satisfy walters second element because,as the state admits,there is no evidence as to when,or at or about what stage of any of the proceedings,the transcript or tapes of the jury charge were last available.no reversible error has been demonstrated in the denial of rule a relief 
iii.effect of williams 
the anti terrorism and effective death penalty act of,d,forbids any federal court from granting habeas relief based on a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state adjudication involved,inter alia,a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.emphasis added.in williams cain,cir,we considered the effect of the emphasized language on the applicability of new rules on federal habeas.a new rule is one that was not established until after the petitioner conviction became final on direct appeal.id.at.we held that unless the supreme court has clearly established that the new rule falls within one of the exceptions to the principle of teague lane,d,that new rule could not be considered with regard to petitions governed by the aedpa.id.at.we also observed that the supreme court had not yet held that the cage rule satisfies any teague exception.in tyler cain,d,the supreme court made clear that it has indeed not yet held that the cage rule satisfies any teague exception and that,therefore,cage does not come within the b a exception to aedpa bar of successive petitions.thus,under our decision in williams,we can consider cockerham cage claim only if his conviction became final after cage was decided.
iv.when cockerham conviction became final 
cockerham errors patent appeal was affirmed on october.cockerham was granted an out of time appeal in which he pursued until the louisiana supreme court denied review on february.cage was decided on november.whether cage represents a new rule turns on when cockerham conviction became resolution of his errors patent appeal or after his out of time appeal.because a primary purpose behind the aedpa and teague rule is respect for the finality of state court judgments,we believe consideration of cage is only appropriate if,under loui
