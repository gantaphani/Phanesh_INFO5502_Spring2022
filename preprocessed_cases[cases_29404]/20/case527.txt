factual and procedural background 
the connecticut appellate court,in an earlier proceeding,provided an account of the facts relevant to the instant petition,which sets the stage for this federal habeas claim 
on june,delroy lewis and his fiancee,dawn jones,were riding in lewis car in hartford.at a traffic light,a car with two men in it pulled up to the passenger side of lewis car,and jones saw a gun pointed at her from the vehicle.the car swerved several times in front of and near lewis car.at another traffic light,the driver of the second car exited his vehicle and told lewis he was going to shoot him.
lewis drove away,but the car followed and again swerved into his path.lewis stopped his car and jones got out.the other driver again got out of the car with a gun and threatened to kill lewis.after again attempting to drive away from the two men,lewis eventually got out of his car and was punched in the face by the other driver.the petitioner channer got out of the other car with a gun and lewis fled.the petitioner then drove lewis car from the scene.
after a jury trial,the petitioner was convicted of one count of robbery in the first degree in violation of general statutes a,and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of general statutes a and a.at the criminal trial,the state offered testimony by jones and lewis identifying the petitioner as the perpetrator.jones testified that on the day of the robbery she and lewis went to the police station and were shown approximately ten photographs from which she selected the petitioner as the passenger of the other car involved in the incident.during the criminal trial,jones made an identification of the petitioner.during,jones reiterated that she had identified the petitioner as the passenger in the car.
at trial,lewis testified that he was within six feet of the passenger of the vehicle at the time of the incident.he testified that he was shown a photographic array at the police station on the day of the incident,and that he selected the petitioner as the passenger who drove away with his vehicle.lewis also made an identification of the petitioner at trial.
during,lewis denied that he had ever been approached by anyone after the incident who suggested that the petitioner was involved in the crime.after being questioned about his brother,lewis denied that he had a brother named trey or tred.lewis also denied having been shown any photographs of individuals allegedly involved in the incident other than those shown to him by police.
on february,the petitioner was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment to be served consecutive to a federal sentence the petitioner already was serving.the connecticut appellate court affirmed the judgment of conviction.state channer,cert.denied.on october,the petitioner filed a petition for a new trial.the trial court conducted a hearing on the petition on february and april.the petitioner acted pro se at the hearing 
at the hearing on the petition for a new trial,jones testified that she no longer believed that the petitioner was one of the perpetrators.she declined to give her address when sworn in as a witness,and stated that she still had fears about the incident and was still afraid of the petitioner.jones testified that some time after the criminal trial,she received a letter from the petitioner at her mother home address.jones responded by sending him a letter that she wrote after the trial,but prior to his sentencing.in the letter,jones said that she felt bad for the petitioner and no longer thought he was one of the perpetrators.subsequently,jones signed an affidavit stating that she did not believe that the petitioner was one of the people involved in the robbery.jones testified at the hearing that prior to the criminal trial she was shown some photographs,and she recalled that one of them depicted two people she believed were the perpetrators.jones further noted that one of the men in the photograph looked like the petitioner.
at the hearing,lewis testified,contrary to his earlier testimony,that prior to the criminal trial he had been shown a photograph of two men that he recognized to be the men who stole his car.he testified that these photographs were shown to him by his brother,denzel stewart,who is also known a s trey.lewis explained at the hearing that he conveyed that information to someone at the petitioner criminal trial before he testified,and he further asserted that he told that person that he wanted to drop the case against the petitioner.although lewis testified that he did not recall who that person was,it was his recollection that the person was in a responsible position in regard to the criminal prosecution.further,lewis testified that in he signed a statement in which he stated that he had misidentified the petitioner at trial and that he was willing to testify to that extent.
lewis testified that he lied at the criminal trial when he stated that he did not have a brother named trey.he also claimed that he told police prior to his testimony that the petitioner was not one of the perpetrators.lewis claimed that police threatened him by saying that if he did not testify that the petitioner was the perpetrator,they would instead charge him with the crime.
james looby,an inspector assigned to the state attorney office during the investigation,testified that he met separately with jones and lewis prior to the criminal trial,and that both said they had been contacted by an individual who wanted to know if they were interested in settling the case for money.after the criminal trial,looby again met with jones.looby testified that jones told him about the letter she received from the petitioner and said that she was fearful that the petitioner or one of his friends might do something to her or a member of her family.looby also testified that jones was angry that the petitioner had obtained her mother address.further,jones told looby that the petitioner had sent her a picture,along with his letter,of a person jones thought looked like the person who robbed her and lewis.looby also testified that jones said she was relieved after the trial because she felt that everything was over,and that when the petitioner letter came to her mother house she became very scared about her safety and that of her mother.
james howard,a detective with the hartford police department at the time of the robbery,testified that he was present when lewis and jones selected the petitioner photograph from approximately ten photographs.howard testified that jones and lewis were separated during their interviews,their viewing of the photographs and their ultimate selection of the petitioner as one of the perpetrators.further,howard testified that neither jones nor lewis ever contacted him to say that they had made mistaken identifications and he was not aware of any effort made to contact the police department with such information.
channer state,footnotes omitted.
in a memorandum of decision dated september,the connecticut superior court denied channer motion for a new trial.the court concluded,first,that channer had failed to prove that the testimony they gave at the original criminal trial was false,and second,that recantations by jones and lewis of their trial testimony at the hearing were not credible.see channer state,no.cv,wl,at.jud.dist.of hartford,the court found that jones was clearly afraid of channer and that h er recantation testimony did not diminish the credibility of her criminal trial testimony.id.at.with respect to lewis recantation,the court found that it was uncorroborated and entitled to little credit.id 
based on the corroborating testimony of denzel stewart,however,the court found that lewis testified falsely at the criminal trial about being shown any pictures by individuals other than the police prior to the trial,and that prior to the criminal trial it is likely that lewis was shown at least one photograph by his brother trey,and that trey had received this photograph from channer.id.the court also found that lewis had committed perjury when he failed to acknowledge the existence of his brother trey at the trial.id.nevertheless,the court stated 
the realization of this information does not lead the court to believe that the underlying trial resulted in an injustice,or that the availability of this information would have led to a different result.channer has not demonstrated that lewis direct and identifying evidence would have been eroded by proof that he had seen other photographs before the trial,including one of an individual resembling channer.
on appeal,the connecticut appellate court affirmed the superior court ruling.channer.at,at.the court held that the superior court reasonably determined that the testimony of jones and lewis at the hearing was not credible and that the superior court applied the proper legal standard under connecticut law when it concluded that defendant had to prove that the availability of the newly discovered evidence would have led to a different result rather than merely that it could have led to a different result.channer.at,at.the connecticut supreme court denied certification.channer.
ii.proceedings in the district court 
on august,channer petitioned for a federal writ of habeas corpus in the district court the court denied the petition in an opinion filed on january,channer brooks,cv awt dfm,wl,and affirmed that denial on reconsideration,channer brooks,cv awt dfm.july.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,a n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted,unless the adjudication of the claim in state court 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.in his federal habeas petition,channer asserted the following grounds for habeas relief witness delroy lewis offered false testimony at trial witness dawn jones offered false testimony at trial witness delroy lewis recanted his trial testimony and witness dawn jones recanted her trial testimony.construing channer federal claim to be a general claim that the denial of his motion for a new trial has resulted in his continued incarceration in violation of his right to due process and fundamental fairness under the sixth and fourteenth amendements,channer,wl,at,the district court focused on the second prong of d whether the connecticut superior court had made an unreasonable determination of the facts at channer hearing.the district court also examined,under e,whether channer had rebutted with clear and convincing evidence the presumption that the superior court findings of fact were correct.e the district court noted that it remains an open question in our circuit whether a petitioner must prevail on both the d and the e inquiries in order to obtain relief,see,jackson anderson,cir,or whether satisfaction of either inquiry independently is sufficient to obtain relief,see leka portuondo,d,citing academic commentary advocating the latter interpretation,rev on other grounds,cir.see channer,wl,at.the district court proceeded,as we do in evaluating this petition,under the assumption that satisfaction of either inquiry would be sufficient.id.
with respect to dawn jones testimony,the district court held that the superior court determination that her recantation was not credible was neither unreasonable in light of the evidence presented nor contradicted by clear and convincing evidence.channer,wl,at.because no question of substance was presented for judicial review regarding channer claims with respect to jones,the court denied a certificate of appealability with respect to those claims,id.at,and we have no occasion to consider them here.
with respect to delroy lewis,the district court held that the state court determination that his recantation was not credible was neither unreasonable in light of the evidence presented nor contradicted by clear and convincing evidence.id.at.the district court also held that the state court did not unreasonably interpret the facts when it determined that lewis perjury as to other matters did not likely alter the outcome of the jury trial.id.at.finding that the claims involving lewis presented a closer question than those involving jones,however,the district court issued a certificate of appealability with respect to those claims.id.at.
for substantially the reasons stated by the district court,see id.at,we agree that the superior court determination that lewis testimony was not credible was neither unreasonable nor rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.we must engage in further analysis,however,to determine whether the superior court unreasonably interpreted the facts when it found that lewis perjury as to other matters did not likely alter the outcome of the original jury trial.it is to this question that we now turn.
iii.discussion 
we review the district court denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo,but we also must defer to state court findings of fact,mixed findings of fact and law,and conclusions of law.boyette lefevre,cir see d,e.we address each of channer arguments in turn.
channer first argues that,because the state court completely ignored the impact of lewis perjury on channer defense and completely omitted any consideration of the impact that the revelation of lewis perjury could be expected to have on the jury,this court should order a new trial or an evidentiary hearing to reconsider the impact of lewis perjury on the jury verdict.pet r br.at emphasis in original.it is true that where a state court does not resolve a question of fact,no presumption of correctness can possibly attach with respect to that issue.see,ford wainwright,d galarza keane,cir.
in the circumstances presented here,however,we believe that the superior court implicitly made adverse findings with respect to the impact of lewis perjury on all aspects of channer trial and,therefore,we conclude that its determination that the trial outcome was fair is entitled to deference under d and e.the superior court stated that it did not find the discrepancy in lewis testimony material to the issue of channer culpability,or to the fairness of the underlying criminal trial since there was no credible evidence that either lewis or jones initial identification of channer as one of the perpetrators was tainted.channer,wl,at emphasis added.the superior court concluded that the trial was fair in view of the strength of lewis and jones original eyewitness identifications of channer as the culprit,which it believed sufficient to carry the burden of proof,regardless of whatever new doubts may have been raised by lewis perjury.id.although the superior court could have been more detailed in explaining its factual findings,we do not believe that the factual issues now raised by channer are ones that were not previously presented to the superior court in proceedings or considered by that court.the court broad factual determination that the trial was fair embraced the more detailed factual findings regarding witness credibility and jury impact that served as a predicate for that determination.indeed,in an analogous context,we have held that a state court adjudication of questions of federal law are considered to have been adjudicated on the merits and are entitled to deference on collateral review,even where the state court states only its ultimate conclusion and does not explain its reasoning process.
