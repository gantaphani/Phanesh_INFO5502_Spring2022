robert bintz and his brother,david bintz,were convicted,in separate wisconsin state court proceedings,of murdering a bartender,sandra lison.after failing in his state appellate challenge to his conviction,robert sought habeas corpus relief in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin,asserting that the state courts improperly allowed hearsay statements to be used against him at trial.the eastern district denied the petition for writ of habeas corpus,and robert appeals.we affirm.
sandra lison was last seen alive tending bar at the good times bar good times in green bay,wisconsin on august.her body was later discovered in a forest.
as part of the initial investigation into lison murder in,green bay police detective lawrence pamperin took a statement from david bintz the pamperin statement in which david admitted that he and his brother robert bintz had visited good times the day of lison disappearance.david stated that he had driven robert and a friend to good times to buy a case of beer that evening.david waited in the car while they went inside.after they returned home,david became upset with the price charged for the beer and called good times,threatening to blow it up.david told pamperin that he subsequently passed out.no one was charged at that time with lison murder.
over ten years later,in,david was in prison at the oshkosh correctional institution for an unrelated crime.his cellmate,gary swendby,heard david talk in his sleep about killing someone.in particular,david shouted make sure she dead.swendby asked david about the nocturnal shouts,and david responded that he had been involved in lison murder.david told swendby that he and robert had decided to rob good times for overcharging them on beer,then decided to kill lison after realizing that she could identify them.david further stated that he repeatedly commanded his brother to make sure that lison was dead,confiding to swendby that they disposed of the body up north.
after hearing david story,swendby went to prison officials with news of david involvement in lison murder.prison officials contacted the green bay police department,which interviewed swendby and other inmates regarding david comments about the murder.eventually,green bay police detective robert haglund confronted david with swendby statement,and david confirmed that it was true the haglund admission.david also supplied haglund with additional facts about robert beating and strangling lison.david,however,said that he david did not kill anyone.
both brothers were charged with the murder of lison.a joint preliminary hearing was held,though david and robert were then tried separately.in may,david went to trial,and swendby testified against him.david was convicted of murder.
at robert trial in july,david was called to testify,but invoked his fifth amendment right against.the court concluded that david was unavailable because of his assertion of the fifth amendment,and allowed david statements to swendby,haglund,and pamperin into evidence as statement against penal interest exceptions to the hearsay rule.swendby had been killed in an automobile accident between the trials.the court concluded that swendby,like david,was an unavailable witness and admitted his testimony from david trial and the joint preliminary hearing.other inmates from oshkosh also testified that david had made comments to them about the murder the oshkosh testimony.the court decided that none of this evidence impinged upon robert rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the constitution confrontation clause.in addition,at trial the prosecution offered evidence from joan andrews,a former girlfriend who testified that robert spontaneously spoke to her about the murder.during a car ride with andrews,robert recounted that he and his brother felt lison move in the back of the car while david was driving.like his brother,robert was convicted of murder.
in,robert appealed his conviction to the wisconsin court of appeals,claiming that the introduction of the pamperin statement and swendby testimony,particularly comments from david to swendby,violated robert confrontation clause rights because he had no opportunity to david or swendby.the court of appeals disagreed and affirmed the conviction in,analyzing the challenge under the framework provided by the united states supreme court in ohio roberts,d,and lilly virginia,d plurality opinion.robert then appealed to the wisconsin supreme court.in his petition to the wisconsin supreme court,robert only argued two violations of the confrontation clause the pamperin statement and david statements to swendby introduced through swendby at david trial.the wisconsin supreme court declined review.
in june,robert filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin,pursuant to.before the district court,robert challenged the oshkosh testimony,as well as the previously challenged statements of david and swendby.after the initial briefs were filed,the united states supreme court issued its decision in crawford washington,d,which addressed the continuing validity of the framework for confrontation clause analysis.robert then filed a supplemental brief in the district court regarding the applicability of crawford.the district court denied the habeas petition.it first found that robert had procedurally defaulted on his challenge to the oshkosh testimony.the district court further concluded that crawford did not apply at the time of the state court rulings and that the introduction of the statements from david and swendby did not violate the supreme court precedent regarding the confrontation clause.robert appeals.
before addressing robert confrontation clause argument,we must first determine what statements are actually at issue.in his brief before this court,robert objects to four pieces of evidence offered at trial the pamperin statement swendby previous testimony concerning statements from david to swendby about the murder the haglund admission and the oshkosh testimony the state of wisconsin contends that robert has procedurally defaulted on any challenges to the latter two statements by failing to raise these objections at every level of the state court proceedings.
according to b a,a habeas petition shall not be granted unless the petitioner has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state.the petitioner must establish that he fully and fairly presented his claims to the state appellate courts,thus giving the state courts a meaningful opportunity to consider the substance of the claims that he later presents in his federal challenge.see,harris mcadory,cir.fair presentment requires that the petitioner assert his claims through one complete round of state court review.see,lewis sternes,cir.in the state courts,the petitioner must present both the operative facts and legal principles that control each of his claims.see rittenhouse battles,cir.a habeas petitioner who has exhausted his state court remedies without properly asserting his federal claim at each level of state court review has procedurally defaulted that claim.lewis,at.if a petitioner has procedurally defaulted his claim,
he may obtain federal habeas relief only upon a showing of cause and prejudice for the default or upon a showing that a failure to grant him relief would work a fundamental miscarriage of justice.a fundamental miscarriage of justice occurs when a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.
moore casperson,cir quoting thomas mccaughtry,cir.cause for a default is ordinarily established by showing that some external obstacle prevented the petitioner from presenting his claim to the state courts.see lewis,at.
against this backdrop,we consider whether robert defaulted on his confrontation clause challenges related to the haglund admission and the oshkosh testimony.in robert initial brief on direct appeal to the wisconsin court of appeals,he only referenced the haglund admission once and did not present any argument regarding its admissibility.in its response brief in the direct appeal,wisconsin specifically pointed out that robert did not challenge the haglund admission.robert neither challenged this characterization nor introduced this issue in his reply brief in the state appellate court.likewise,he did not address the haglund admission in his petition for review to the wisconsin supreme court.accordingly,robert failed to fully and fairly present this issue to the wisconsin courts,and so procedurally defaulted on any claim relating to the haglund admission.
robert still could qualify for habeas relief regarding the haglund admission if he could establish cause for the procedural default or a fundamental miscarriage of justice.robert,however,has shown neither an external impediment that led to the procedural default nor that the procedural default would cause a fundamental miscarriage of justice.robert states in his reply brief that failure to consider the constitutionality of the haglund admission would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice,but fails to develop this argument or show that he was actually innocent.his conclusory statement is insufficient to obtain habeas relief.robert can not avoid the effects of the procedural default of his claim relating to the haglund admission 
robert challenge to the oshkosh testimony encounters similar,though not identical,problems.the district court found procedural default regarding the oshkosh testimony,a ruling that we review de novo.see lewis,at.it appears that robert did raise this issue in his initial brief before the wisconsin court of appeals.robert,however,never presented the oshkosh testimony to the wisconsin supreme court in his petition for that court to review the decision of the wisconsin court of appeals.while the wisconsin supreme court denied his petition for review,robert was still required to present the issue to it.see boerckel,d boerckel failure to present three of his federal habeas claims to the illinois supreme court in a timely fashion has resulted in a procedural default of those claims moore,at wisconsin supreme court discretion to grant judicial review is similar to that of the illinois supreme court,and boerckel requires presentation of all issues to that court.robert does not argue either cause for his procedural default or that the procedural default would cause a fundamental miscarriage of justice.as robert failed to properly exhaust his state remedies,he has procedurally defaulted his challenge to the oshkosh testimony.
having removed the underbrush,we now turn to robert remaining two pieces of evidence introduced at trial violated robert rights under the confrontation clause,entitling him to habeas relief.in an appeal from a ruling on a petition for habeas relief,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its rulings on issues of law de novo.denny gudmanson,cir.to qualify for habeas relief,robert must show that the state court proceedings adjudicating his claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
consideration of new supreme court decisions 
as a general matter,we look at the supreme court holdings as of the time of the relevant state court decision to determine clearly established federal law.see lockyer andrade,d.the supreme court prohibits analyzing the reasonableness of a state court determination in light of a new supreme court rule propounded after the state court made its decision.see teague lane,d.
in general,a case announces a new rule when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the states or the federal government to put it differently,a case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant conviction became final.
id.emphasis in original.teague does allow two types of new rules as exceptions to its bar new rules that place certain kinds of primary,private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal authority to proscribe,and rules that define procedure implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.mankarious united states,cir a new rule qualifies for the latter exception and applies retroactively if it is a watershed rule that implicates the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.see spreitzer peters,cir lambert mcbride,cir.
application of teague principles to crawford 
robert contends that we should review his state court conviction in light of the confrontation clause principles regarding hearsay statements of unavailable witnesses announced by the supreme court in crawford washington,d.as the supreme court decided crawford after the wisconsin supreme court denied robert petition for review,we begin by determining whether crawford announced a new rule according to teague and its progeny we first examine the state of supreme court confrontation clause jurisprudence before crawford and decide whether crawford was a departure from the precedent.this is the first time that this issue has been directly presented for ruling in this circuit.see owens frank,cir expressly reserving the question of whether crawford should be applied retroactively.
the confrontation clause guarantees an accused the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi pointer texas,d applying sixth amendment to the states by virtue of the fourteenth amendment.prior to crawford,the supreme court authorized the introduction of hearsay statements against a criminal defendant in certain circumstances.by their nature such statements do not afford the opportunity for of the person who made them.see roberts,at.in roberts,the supreme court noted the framers preference for accusation,but carved an exception to allow the introduction at trial of statements from witnesses who were unavailable to testify.see id.at.the supreme court held that if a hearsay declarant is found to be unavailable at trial,his statement still can be admissible if it bears adequate indicia of reliability by falling within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or it contains particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.id.at.
in,the supreme court confirmed that the general framework of roberts remained valid.see lilly,at.in that case,the supreme court determined that a statement against penal interest,which incriminated both the declarant and the defendant,did not constitute a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay bar under the first prong of roberts.see id.at.the supreme court was concerned about a declarant who,under police interrogation,inculpated himself to a minor extent,while shifting the bulk of the blame to the defendant.see id.at.moving to the second prong of the roberts analysis,the supreme court decided that virginia had not offered sufficient particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.see id.at.therefore,the hearsay statements were inadmissible.see id.at.lilly,however,did not fundamentally disturb either the roberts framework or disrupt its ruling that an unavailable declarant statements could be used at trial in certain circumstances.
in,however,crawford overruled roberts.see crawford.at.the supreme court held that the confrontation clause required that testimonial statements from witnesses absent from trial should be admitted only when the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to.see id.the supreme court concluded that the roberts test departed from this principle by allowing a jury to hear evidence,untested by the adversary process,based on a mere judicial determination of reliability.id.at.the unpardonable vice of the roberts test,however,is its demonstrated capacity to admit core testimonial statements that the confrontation clause plainly meant to exclude.id.at.
it seems clear that crawford was a clean break from the line of precedent established by roberts.crawford considered and rejected the continuing application of roberts.nevertheless,a state court would not have acted unreasonably by failing to anticipate this ruling and applying roberts.see netherland,d at bottom,the teague doctrine validates reasonable interpretations of existing precedents made by state
