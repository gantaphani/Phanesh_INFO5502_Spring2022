in this habeas appeal,petitioner joseph garuti argues that the district court erred in dismissing his petition without an evidentiary hearing.garuti argues that,inter alia,he was entitled to a hearing on his sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claims under strickland washington,d.because garuti can not demonstrate that he has raised a substantial issue that would require additional factual development,we affirm.
on march,garuti was convicted in massachusetts superior court of first degree murder by reason of extreme atrocity or cruelty.garuti was charged with striking and killing his by running her over with an automobile while picking up his two young children from her home.after striking his with the automobile,garuti,a registered nurse,refused to render any assistance.garuti defense was that the death was an accident.on the advice of trial counsel,garuti did not testify on his own behalf at trial.
after garuti conviction,garuti,now represented by new counsel,raised the claims now asserted in his habeas petition,in a motion for a new trial in the massachusetts trial court.in this motion,garuti argued that he was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel under the sixth amendment and that he was prejudiced by his attorney deficient representation.garuti also argued that,because of counsel allegedly deficient performance,he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to testify on his own behalf.garuti relied on his own page affidavit reciting various facts pertinent to his trial counsel performance.garuti sought to obtain an additional affidavit from his trial counsel in support of his motion,furnishing trial counsel with a draft affidavit.trial counsel sent garuti appellate counsel a letter stating that he had refused to sign the draft because it was inaccurate,without specifying the claimed inaccuracies.
on the same day that garuti filed his new trial motion,garuti also moved for an evidentiary hearing in state court in order to more fully develop the record on his ineffective assistance claim by,for example,obtaining testimony from trial counsel.garuti argued that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing because his own affidavit raised serious questions of fact regarding his ineffective assistance claims.the commonwealth argued that no evidentiary hearing was required because garuti sworn affidavit was conclusory and.
on may,the superior court denied both the new trial motion and the motion for an evidentiary hearing,ruling that the defendant motion for a new trial is hereby denied without a hearing.emphasis removed.the court was unpersuaded by garuti ineffective assistance argument,and noted that it would not credit the defendant contentions.the trial court also relied on trial counsel statement to garuti appellate counsel that he would not sign the proposed affidavit because it was inaccurate.though trial counsel had not furnished an affidavit,the trial judge concluded that it is pure speculation that such an affidavit would be helpful to garuti cause.
on may,garuti appealed to the massachusetts supreme judicial court.on june,the supreme judicial court affirmed.see commonwealth garuti,sjc decision.the supreme judicial court concluded that there was no ineffective assistance of counsel that would require a new trial,id.at,and that therefore the trial judge was warranted in not granting garuti motion for an evidentiary hearing on the motion.id.at.based on a colloquy garuti had in open court with the trial judge,the supreme judicial court had held that the record supports the trial judge conclusion that the defendant waiver of his right to testify was knowing and intelligent.id.
on august,pursuant to,garuti filed his habeas petition in the district court.the petition reiterated garuti ineffective assistance claims and argued that the state court denial of an evidentiary hearing on these claims was a violation of due process.the petition also raised another constitutional due process claim alleging that garuti did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to testify at his trial.after filing the petition,garuti moved for an evidentiary hearing in the district court.the magistrate judge denied the motion for an evidentiary hearing,reasoning that the merits of garuti habeas claim had been reasonably addressed by the supreme judicial court on the record before it and that,as a result,cullen pinholster,d,barred such a hearing.garuti roden,rgs,wl,at.
subsequently,on august,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation advising the district judge to dismiss the habeas petition.see garuti roden,fds,wl,report and recommendation.in recommending that the petition be dismissed,the magistrate judge reiterated that the evidence in the record provide d a constitutionally sufficient basis for the trial court to rule on the motion for a new trial without an evidentiary hearing and for the supreme judicial court to affirm that ruling.id.at.
on november,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation,dismissing the petition and holding that the state court record was sufficient to resolve the case.see garuti roden,fds,wl,district court order.the district court issued the certificate of appealability required by c,and garuti timely appealed to this court.
on appeal,garuti argues that the district court should have granted him an evidentiary hearing.he urges that the supreme judicial court decisions were based on an incomplete record and that the rejections of his sixth amendment ineffective assistance and fourteenth amendment due process claims were therefore based on objectively unreasonable determinations of the facts under d and unreasonable applications of supreme court case law under d.
we review the district court denial of habeas relief with respect to the claims raised in state court de novo.lynch ficco,cir citing ellsworth warden,cir.we review the district court refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion.companio,cir citing forsyth spencer,cir.
we first consider the extent to which the supreme court decision in pinholster bars evidentiary hearings under d.that section provides that 
a n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.under this section,habeas corpus relief is only available if the state court conclusion is based upon a factual determination that is objectively unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.miller el cockrell,d.garuti argues that the district court erroneously interpreted pinholster to categorically bar hearings in federal habeas proceedings,except in situations where the state court decision rested exclusively on a finding of procedural default.
pinholster makes clear that review under d is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.at.but garuti argues that the evidentiary hearing bar applies only to review under d.subsequent authority establishes that it applies under d as well.see blue thaler,cir section d expressly instructs that the state court decision must be evaluated in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.quoting d.we agree that the evidentiary hearing bar applies to review under both sections of d.this court has noted specifically that r eview under the fact prong,section d is limited to the record that was before the state court.brown,cir 
the difficult question in this case relates to the scope of pinholster bar on evidentiary hearings under both portions of.garuti first argues that,because the state court held no evidentiary hearing to resolve contested issues of
