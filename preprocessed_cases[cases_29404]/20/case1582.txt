emmett jones appeals the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.see.jones sought to represent himself at his state criminal trial.he explained that he wanted to do so in order to have access to files the state would turn over only to his lawyer.the state courts interpreted this as an involuntary waiver of the right to counsel and denied his request.in our view,this conclusion rests on an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court.
in,jones stood trial in michigan for felonious assault.comp.laws.there were other charges pending against him at the time and in each case jones asked for access to police reports and other materials the state had turned over to his lawyer but refused to give to him.the state had a policy permitting the release of these materials to defendants lawyers,provided the materials remained in the lawyers custody at all times over jones objections,the original trial judge in jones felonious assault case sustained the policy application to him the judge also prohibited jones from speaking in court.the state did not object to jones meeting with his lawyer to review the materials,but jones wanted to spend more time reviewing the materials relevant to his case than his lawyer was willing to provide.he resolved this quandary by deciding to represent himself in his pending cases.his decision to proceed pro se arose in the context of his lawyer motion to withdraw as his counsel.
at a hearing on the motion before a second judge,the judge asked jones whether he was dissatisfied with his lawyer services.jones responded by saying,my request to represent myself was based on other matters,which i could explain to the court jones explained he had no other choice other than because of the court order that he not speak in court and because of its ruling that defense counsel was not to provide him with any copies of discovery materials or police reports or other court documents.in particular,jones continued,for a defendant to be able to assist in his defense he must be able to make informed decisions.if i am denied copies of police reports and other basic discovery materials i can not make informed decision sic.my attorney has refused to provide me copies of police reports and other documents related to my case.counsel explains his refusal is based on a local rule.jones then said if the court insist sic upon upholding the local rule i have no choice but to overcome that by representing myself.
jones remarks to the judge were not brief he expounded on the constitutional right to represent oneself,citing,we imagine the transcript is unclear,faretta california for the proposition that,in jones words,counsel suffers no penalty if he loses the case being that i the one that suffers the penalty that the decision is to be made in this case are left are mine.and,because the decisions are mine i can not make informed decisions,i can not prepare for my defense,without this discovery material.when asked by the judge,jones lawyer confirmed his client motivations the lawyer explained,if the only way he can get copies of the police reports and the other discovery material that come along with the police reports is to be represented sic himself then that what he wishes to do ultimately the judge referred the motion to withdraw to a third judge,who was to preside at jones felonious assault trial.nevertheless,the hearing judge did comment on jones request.citing michigan standard for waiving the right to counsel,the judge ventured that jones request was not unequivocal,as the cases of the michigan supreme court require,because you saying,well,i have no choice but to do this because i disagree with this other ruling,the original judge ruling that jones would not be exempted from the state policy regarding discovery material.the judge also noted it seems to me that in a word your problems are not with counsel but your problems are with his compliance with some rules that he did create.
when the motion to withdraw came before the trial judge,jones again explained his position sir,need to be able to assist my attorney.i need to be able to answer his questions.i need to be able to make informed decisions.and,when i do have access to this material i can neither study it or make those informed decisions,which makes me give my attorney incompetent answers,answers which are not informed.and,so i you know,i not capable of assisting in my own defense.the judge asked jones lawyer for his thoughts on the matter and he argued that the state discovery policy was at odds with brady maryland,d,because it had the effect of limiting a defendant access to materials that might be critical to his defense.according to jones lawyer,the effect of the discovery policy was most severe in a case like jones because he was incarcerated.the lawyer suggested he could not visit the jail frequently enough for his client to have a sufficient opportunity to review the materials.consequently,the only way for jones to circumvent this obstacle to preparing his defense was to represent himself.the judge was unmoved by these arguments he seemed more concerned with whether jones had been afforded at least some opportunity to review the materials and to discuss them with his lawyer.because the lawyer had visited jones at least a few times,the judge was satisfied.
there was then an exchange between the court and jones regarding whether jones request was unequivocal 
the court do you me ask you this are you suggesting that your request to represent yourself is unequivocal 
jones um,if.yes,it will be if the,you know,if the i i if i gon na be denied this material i would make up my request as unequivocal.you know,there is no other way that i could be feel that i be assured of a fair trial,other than for me to represent myself.this is for me to get this material 
the court you tell me in the same breath that if you had the police reports and copies of all the stuff you want you want getting jones lawyer to want the assistance of 
jones i would allow getting to mean,i not would rather not represent myself.
following this exchange,the judge issued his ruling,citing the michigan supreme court cases on the judge observed that the thrust of all of these holdings is that a defendant request to represent himself must be unequivocal.he must assert this right to knowingly,intelligently and voluntarily.the judge concluded that jones request did not meet these criteria.the request was not unequivocal because the only rationale expressed by jones for discharging his attorney,at this time,is to get a copy of the police report and,thereby,to represent himself.that is not,i think,a statement of unequivo cality sic that is required and mandated by the case law.in the judge view,what really this gets down to is a question of the propriety withholding a police report from the custody or possession of a defendant.for two primary reasons,the judge concluded the application of the state discovery policy to jones case was not improper.first,jones had been afforded an opportunity to review the materials which he was not permitted to possess,to discuss them with his attorney,and to contact state witnesses listed.second,there were good reasons for the discovery policy,including the state interest in avoiding the high cost of copying the materials for all criminal defendants and the need to protect the privacy of potential witnesses.an additional factor rounded out the judge analysis of jones request to represent himself the judge observed at multiple points that jones and his lawyer had not had significant disagreements regarding trial strategy.
finally,the judge held as follows 
all things considered,i think that the position that the defendant takes is one which,is unreasonable and,number two,emphasizes equivocality sic of his position in his desire to represent himself o n the record made here today,i can not find that his request was unequivocal,and even if it was that it was voluntarily made there is no dispute concerning strategies.i find that his request to represent himself,while not being made directly,is made indirectly,and in the format of getting motion and,accordingly,i find that that request is not unequivocal,in other words,he is equivocating.and,furthermore,any assertion of the right of in the facts presented here on the record made this morning would not show he was doing so voluntarily.um,therefore,is mean,i think i could stop at the unequivocal issue,but there there really no necessity to get into any off sic the other issues because i denying the motion to withdraw.
the case went to trial and a jury convicted jones of felonious assault.he was sentenced to to years in prison.
jones moved for reconsideration and sought a new trial the trial court denied these requests and jones appealed.the michigan court of appeals affirmed.people jones,wl,unpublished opinion.it held that under michigan law a request to proceed pro se must be unequivocal,knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.jones request met none of these criteria,in the appeals court view,because although he adamantly expressed his desire to represent himself and insistently reminded the court of his right to do so,his desire was clearly contingent on how the court ruled with respect to his requests that counsel supply him with copies of various documents,and that he be allowed to directly address the court at will.id.at.the appeals court further noted that jones himself characterized his request to waive counsel and to represent himself as involuntary,claiming that he had no choice but to take the course of action based on the court refusal to comply with his demands,although he would rather not represent himself.id.jones applied for leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court but the application was denied.people jones.
in a petition he filed pro se in the eastern district of michigan pursuant to,jones raised numerous challenges to his conviction and sentence.the district court denied relief.jones jamrog,unpublished opinion.in the district court view,the state courts reasonably interpreted the fact that jones request was contingent on whether the state discovery policy would remain in effect as an indication that his request was equivocal.accordingly,the court held that the state courts denial of his request to proceed pro se did not involve an unreasonable application of clearly established law.jones appeals the certificate of appealability is confined to whether federal habeas relief is warranted on his claims that he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to represent himself at trial and sentencing 
in a habeas corpus appeal,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error,vincent seabold,cir wolfe brigano,cir.because this case is controlled by the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,we may only overturn the district court and grant a writ of habeas corpus if the state court decision resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.d.
a legal doctrine is not clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court unless it is based on holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.williams taylor,d see also yarborough alvarado,lockyer andrade,d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it arrives at a legal holding that contradicts a supreme court case or involves facts that are materially indistinguishable from a supreme court case but nonetheless arrives at a substantially different result.williams,at.an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law occurs when a decision unreasonably applies the law of the supreme court to the facts of a prisoner case.id.at.
in this case,the universe of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court,d,is narrow.it consists of one decision,faretta california,d,the leading supreme court decision to reach a holding on the sixth amendment right of at trial.at the time of the michigan court of appeals decision in this case there were,to be sure,other supreme court decisions on the periphery of faretta,but they are not clearly implicated in this case.see godinez moran,d the competency standard for representing oneself is the same as for standing trial mckaskle wiggins,d the participation at trial of standby counsel does not necessarily infringe the right to represent oneself.
in faretta,the supreme court held that the right to represent oneself in a criminal trial is an independent and affirmative right that inheres in the structure of the sixth amendment,not merely a corollary of the right to waive the assistance of counsel.id.at.the court explained 
the sixth amendment does not provide merely that a defense shall be made for the accused it grants to the accused personally the right to make his defense.it is the accused,not counsel,who must be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation,who must be confronted with the witnesses against him,and who must be accorded compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.although not stated in the amendment in so many words,the right to make one own defense thus necessarily implied by the structure of the amendment.the right to defend is given directly to the accused for it is he who suffers the consequences if the defense fails.
id.at.footnote omitted quoting const.amend.vi.
the court affirmed the right of at trial in these bold terms even while admitting that the right of an accused to conduct his own defense seems to cut against the grain of this court decisions holding that the constitution requires that no accused can be convicted and imprisoned unless he has been accorded the right to the assistance of counsel.id.at.although on average reasonable people might agree that it is in a criminal defendant best interest to seek representation,ultimately,i t is the defendant who must be free to personally decide whether in his particular case counsel is to his advantage.id.at.this choice is at once a choice to exercise an independent sixth amendment right,the right to represent oneself,and a choice to forgo another sixth amendment right,the right to counsel.the choice,therefore,is in part a waiver and thus must be made knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily.brewer williams,d johnson zerbst.
in this case,jones considered his circumstances and decided that in his particular case counsel was not to his advantage.faretta,supra,at.in accordance with its discovery policy,the state refused to turn over police reports to him,instead providing them only to his attorney.jones was able to review the reports and discuss them with his attorney,but only when his attorney was available to do so and only for as long as the attorney had time.consequently,the state discovery policy presented jones with a obstacle that he had no choice but to negotiate.the approach he selected was to forgo his right to counsel in order that he might have more time to review the police reports and do work in preparation for his defense at trial.the mere fact that this approach had an obvious and significant relinquishment of a lawyer not mean that jones decision to pursue the approach was involuntary.
faretta itself requires this conclusion.in faretta,the defendant was faced with essentially the same obstacle that confronted the attorneys likely to be assigned his case were overloaded with work and therefore not likely to be committed to it.at.observing that faretta did not want to be represented by the public defender because he believed that that office was very loaded down with a heavy case load.he asked the court to assign him a lawyer who was not a public defender,but the court refused.id.at.faretta then announced his intention to represent himself and the trial judge warned him against it.nonetheless,faretta stood his ground.because t he record show ed that faretta was literate,competent,and understanding,and that he was voluntarily exercising his free will,and because he clearly and unequivocally declared to the trial judge that he wanted to represent himself,the supreme court held that it was constitutional error not to honor
