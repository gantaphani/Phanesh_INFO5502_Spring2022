julius robinson challenges his conviction and death sentence on several grounds,the most salient of which is that he was deprived of the fifth amendment right to stand trial only on crimes set forth in an indictment issued by a grand jury.the government concedes that the indictment is constitutionally deficient inasmuch as it fails specifically to charge the aggravating factors that render robinson eligible for the death penalty.the government contends,however,that the error is harmless.
robinson also avers that the federal death penalty act fdpa,et,is facially unconstitutional in three respects,that the district court abused its discretion in admitting evidence under the exception to the hearsay rule,and that his death sentence is predicated on improper aggravating factors.agreeing with the government that the error in the indictment is susceptible to harmless error review,that on the facts of this case the error is harmless,and that none of robinson other claims has merit,we affirm.
proving true to his hollywood namesake,robinson,also known by names such as scarface,entangled himself in a sadistic world of narcotics and violence in which he personally committed at least two senseless murders.in december,wholesale drug dealer then operating in five a man he mistakenly believed responsible for an armed hijacking that cost him.in may,angered by a fraudulent drug transaction in which he paid for a block of wood covered in sheetrock,robinson retaliated by killing a man whose only connection to the fraud was that he was the of the fraudulent seller.
for these murders and his complicity in an ongoing criminal enterprise resulting in the murder of a third man,robinson was convicted and sentenced to death on three separate counts,to life imprisonment on two others,and to a consecutive sentence on another.with one limited exception,robinson challenges neither the sufficiency nor the admissibility of the evidence.
the murder of johnny lee shelton is a case of mistaken identity.shelton was similar in appearance to a man named big friday,whom robinson blamed for a hijacking in a mcdonald restaurant parking lot several months before.on the night he was murdered,shelton and a friend,jerell gardner,spent the evening at a dallas night club,where they were spotted by two of robinson associates who mistook shelton for big friday and called robinson to tell him what they had seen.
robinson quickly arrived at the club,whereupon he and two other men sat in a nearby parking lot,waiting for the man they thought was big friday to leave.they spotted shelton and gardner leaving the club in a car similar to the one big friday drove,and followed them onto a local highway.as they caught up to the car,robinson yelled that him,leaned out the window,and opened fire with an assault rifle.one of robinson companions,britt,also known as capone,did the same.although most of the bullets missed their mark,shelton was struck in the stomach and later died 
juan reyes was shot to death at close range on the driveway in front of his home.he and two companions,isaac rodriguez and nicholas marques,arrived there on the day of the murder,not suspecting that in a car parked across the street were three robinson and angelo were upset that they had been sold a block of wood instead of narcotics.robinson and harris approached reyes carrying automatic weapons,said something to record is unclear whether it was a demand for shot him in the foot.rodriguez,who had been standing nearby,turned to flee and was shot three times,in the back and leg.
reyes fell to the ground and lay there as robinson and harris shot him at least nine times.an autopsy revealed fragments of concrete in several of reyes wounds,suggesting he was shot from a distance of less than five feet,causing the bullets to pass through his body,ricochet off the pavement,and his back.before leaving,robinson and harris also fired several shots at marques,who was still seated behind the wheel in the car in which he,reyes and rodriguez had just arrived.marques managed to drive around the corner to safety,but his car was riddled with bullets 
robinson also was convicted for involvement in a broad conspiracy that led to the murder of rudolfo resendez at the hands of britt and hendrick tunstall.while engaged in this conspiracy,robinson and other conspirators possessed more than five kilograms of cocaine and various firearms robinson was further convicted of possessing three firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime a uzi pistol,a caliber smith wesson pistol,and an sks assault rifle finally,he was convicted on several other drug and weapons charges that the district court treated as lesser included offenses and for which no independent sentence was imposed.
the jury sentencing recommendation was based in part on in addition to the aforementioned convictions robinson criminal history.the jury learned of an incident in in which robinson fired several shots from a handgun at a woman who had failed to pay him for crack cocaine.this was used to show that robinson had a violent record before the events charged in the indictment.the jury also was told of an incident,described in more detail in part iv,in which robinson,acting from his jail cell after his arrest in this case,arranged to have a government informant murdered.this was used to show that robinson had a propensity to commit future acts of violence.
as we have noted,the government concedes the indictment is constitutionally deficient because it fails to allege the statutory aggravating factors that make robinson eligible for the death penalty.the government argues,however,that the error is harmless.robinson responds by pointing to a line of cases that stand for the proposition that a conviction under an indictment constructively amended at trial is per se reversible error.
the conceded error arose only after the supreme court announced ring arizona,d.before ring,our analysis of the use of sentencing factors in a capital case was controlled by walton arizona,d,wherein the court determined that aggravating factors are not independent offenses,but only standards used to help a jury decide between death and life imprisonment.
the fdpa,d,imposes its own obligation on prosecutors to submit aggravating factors to the unanimous review of a petit jury but,consistent with walton,it does not impose a concomitant obligation to have a grand jury first charge those factors in an indictment.rather,the statute requires only that the government file a notice stating its intention to seek the death penalty and setting forth the aggravating factors on which it proposes to justify the death sentence.a.here,the government filed such a notice setting forth several aggravating factors it had not presented to a grand jury.
nineteen days after robinson was sentenced using those factors,ring was issued,expressly overruling walton.the court held that where an aggravating factor renders a defendant eligible for death,it is the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense and therefore must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.ring,at.quoting apprendi new jersey,d.as a new rule of constitutional criminal procedure,that holding applies to all cases pending on direct review,including robinson.griffith kentucky,d.
ring sixth amendment holding applies with equal force in the context of a fifth amendment indictment clause challenge,even though the supreme court has yet to hold as much in a capital case as a result,the government is required to charge,by indictment,the statutory aggravating factors it intends to prove to render a defendant eligible for the death penalty,and its failure to do so in this case is constitutional error 
we must consider whether apprendi the failure of an indictment specifically to charge aggravating factors regarded as elements because they increase the maximum available susceptible to harmless error review.apprendi,at.the supreme court has not yet decided that question.robinson points to a case,stirone united states,d,to argue that the error is per se reversible.
although stirone deals with the marginally different problem of constructive amendments to an indictment,it contains strong language that informs our understanding of the gravity of the error in this case.in particular,stirone specifies the rule that a court can not permit a defendant to be tried on charges that are not made in the indictment against him and adds that d eprivation of such a basic right is far too serious to be treated as nothing more than a variance and then dismissed as harmless error.id.at.
stirone notwithstanding,the error here is susceptible to harmless error review.in cotton,at,the court resolved an analytically similar issue when it held that a defective indictment does not deprive the court of jurisdiction and that plain error review applies if the defendant fails to object.we have interpreted cotton also to require the application of harmless error review where an indictment is defective and the defendant preserves the error by proper objection.united states baptiste,cir per curiam on petition for rehearing,cert.denied,d united states matthews,cir,cert.denied,d.several other circuits likewise have concluded that where a defendant preserves an apprendi indictment error,the claim is reviewed for harmless error 
the conclusion that this type of error is susceptible to harmless error review follows from two considerations.first is neder united states,d,in which the court noted that harmless error review applies in all but a limited class of cases involving structural errors.such cases contain a defect affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds,rather than simply an error in the trial process itself.id.citation omitted.the court illustrated the point by providing a list of cases in which a structural error was found notably,the court failed either to cite stirone or to mention a defective indictment as being a structural error.id.
second,although cotton dealt only with plain error and expressly reserved the question whether a defect in an indictment is structural error the court analysis suggests strongly that such a defect is not the sort of structural error that necessarily escapes harmless error review.
in applying the plain error test of united states olano,d,the court in cotton,at,was called on to consider whether the error affected substantial rights and whether it seriously affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.rather than determine whether the defendant substantial rights were inquiry consisting of determining whether the error affected the outcome of the,whether the error harmed the court held that even assuming respondents substantial rights were affected,the error did not seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.
given that conclusion,it is difficult to accept that the same error simultaneously could be the sort of structural error discussed in neder,one that necessarily deprive s defendants of basic protections without which no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.neder,at.in addition,although cotton acknowledges that the fifth amendment grand jury right serves a vital function in providing for a body of citizens that acts as a check on prosecutorial power,it also recognizes that is surely no less true of the sixth amendment right to a petit jury,which,unlike the grand jury,must find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.cotton,at.
we need not diminish the importance of the fifth amendment right to a grand jury indictment to conclude that the error at issue in failure to include an element of the crime in petit jury difficult to distinguish from the present one,and we find no compelling reason to carve out an exception to neder harmless error rule for such an analytically similar claim as a result,the absence of an indictment on the aggravating factors used to justify a death sentence is not structural error and is susceptible to harmless error review see baptiste,at.
to decide whether the error is harmless on the facts of this case,we use the test announced in chapman california,d,because it is constitutional error.see neder,at.the question is whether the error affects substantial rights.a.that is to say,we inquire whether it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.chapman,at.an otherwise valid conviction will not be set aside if the reviewing court may confidently say,on the whole record,that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.delaware van arsdall,d.
relevant to the inquiry in the present case,the two primary functions of an indictment are that it provides notice of the crime for which the defendant has been charged,allowing him the opportunity to prepare a defense,see russell united states,d and interposes the public into the charging decision,such that a defendant is not subject to jeopardy for a crime alleged only by the prosecution,see stirone,at.robinson received adequate independent notice of the intention to pursue a death sentence using the aggravating factors that were ultimately presented to the jury.the fdpa requires the government 
a reasonable time before the trial to sign and file with the court,and serve on the defendant,a notice stating that the government believes that the circumstances of the offense are such that the government will seek the sentence of death and setting forth the aggravating factor or factors that the government,if the defendant is convicted,proposes to prove as justifying a sentence of death.
a.the government complied by filing notice four months before trial,and robinson does not contend that the content or timing of the notice left him unable to prepare a defense.
more difficult is the question whether robinson was harmed by losing the right to have the public determine whether there existed probable cause to charge the aggravating factors used to sentence him to death.the courts have long recognized the significant value the public adds to our system of justice through its involvement in grand jury proceedings once a trial takes place,however,there is little a court of appeals can do to restore to a defendant that which was lost the right not to face a prosecution initiated solely at the government behest.united states mechanik,d 
as a result,meaningful enforcement of this right always will depend,in the main,on the vigilance of the trial court and on its willingness to require that a defective indictment be amended before trial the error in this case lasted as long as it has only because the district court properly relied on the walton decision.on appeal,our inquiry focuses solely on the question whether,on the basis of the evidence that would have been available to the grand jury,any rational grand jury presented with a proper indictment would have charged that robinson committed the offense in question.matthews,at.
the government asks us to embrace a categorical rule premised on mechanik,to the effect that the petit jury unanimous finding that the aggravating factors applied to robinson beyond a reasonable doubt conclusively establishes that the grand operates ex parte,by majority vote,and without evidentiary have found probable cause to charge the aggravating factors as well.
in mechanik,at,the court provided substantial support for the government rule,inasmuch as it stated that although a procedural error before the grand jury 
had the theoretical potential to affect the grand jury determination whether to indict these particular defendants for the offenses with which they were charged,t he petit jury subsequent guilty verdict means not only that there was probable cause to believe that the defendants were guilty as charged,but also that they are in fact guilty as charged beyond a reasonable doubt.measured by the petit jury verdict,then,any error in the grand jury proceeding connected with the charging decision was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
at oral argument,robinson responded by arguing that the logic of essentially posits that the citizens on the grand jury are interchangeable with those on the petit less force in a capital case,where the petit jury is subject to death qualification 
no categorical rule is needed to convince us that any rational grand jury would find probable cause to charge robinson with at least one of the statutory aggravating factors omitted from his indictment in addition to the petit jury unanimous we consider to be,at a minimum,persuasive evidence of how a grand jury would evidence overwhelmingly shows that there existed probable cause to charge robinson with the aggravating factors used in his sentencing.
all three death sentences involved the aggravating factor that in the killings of shelton and reyes,robinson knowingly created a grave risk of death to one or more persons in addition to the victim.c.robinson killed shelton by firing an assault rifle from the window of a moving vehicle on a public highway,directly endangering shelton passenger and anyone else in range the record also shows that in the course of killing reyes,robinson and his managed to shoot rodriguez three times and to fire enough times at marques car fleeing the scene to leave it riddled with bullets.all this took place in a residential neighborhood in close proximity to at least two adolescent eyewitnesses playing on a nearby porch,and across the street from a barbecue attended by at least ten people.
no rational grand jury would fail to find that this evidence constituted anything less than probable cause to believe that,in the course of committing each murder,robinson created a grave risk of death to someone other than the victim.as a result,and beyond a reasonable doubt,the failure to charge those factors in an indictment did not contribute to robinson conviction or death sentence chapman,at.
robinson challenges the constitutionality of the fdpa on three grounds.first,he argues that the statute is facially unconstitutional under the fifth amendment indictment clause because it does not require prosecutors to charge aggravating factors in an indictment second,he reasons that the fdpa violates the fifth amendment guarantee of due process of law and he contends that the fdpa violates the eighth amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment.none of these claims has merit.
the constitutionality of a federal statute is a question of law reviewed de novo.united states ho,cir.a statute must be construed,if fairly possible,so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score.rust sullivan,d internal quotations omitted.this canon is followed out of respect for congress,which we assume legislates in the light of constitutional limitations.see also united states bird,cir.
a facial challenge to a legislative act is,of course,the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid.united states salerno,d.the fact that a statute might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid,since we have not recognized an overbreadth doctrine outside the limited context of the first amendment.id.
the fdpa is not facially unconstitutional under the indictment clause.although robinson is correct to point out that nothing in the fdpa requires prosecutors to charge aggravating factors in an indictment,he fails to note that there is nothing in that law inhibiting such a charge.the government can easily comply with both its constitutional obligations by first going to the grand jury and its statutory obligations by later filing a a notice of intention to seek the death penalty.as a result,the statute is not facially unconstitutional.
robinson due process claim fails,as well.he argues,citing united states quinones,d,reversed,cir,cert.denied,d,that the fdpa violates the substantive and procedural components of the due process clause.the substantive due process claim is premised on the idea that all capital defendants share a liberty interest in not being executed for crimes they did not commit.this shared liberty interest,it is argued,entitles a guilty defendant facially to invalidate a law that could be used in some other case to execute an innocent man.
this argument has no merit.whatever the risk that another person will be wrongfully convicted,robinson has not even attempted to show,on appeal,that his conviction is erroneous,and he has presented no evidence to suggest that the fdpa is unconstitutional as applied to his case.so,he can not invalidate the statute on the ground that it might conceivably be applied to reach an unconstitutional result in some other defendant case.salerno,at.
robinson does not elaborate on the specific manner in which he believes the fdpa deprives him of procedural due process.we presume,however,from his frequent citations to the district court opinion in quinones,that he agrees with that court that the problem is that execution arbitrarily eliminate s any possibility of exoneration after a certain point in time.quinones,d at.
on that theory,all executions would violate the due process clause,because they render the defendant unable further to challenge his conviction.that argument is belied by the plain text of the fifth amendment,which unambiguously provides that some measure of process is sufficient to permit imposition of the death penalty,and there is nothing arbitrary in choosing,for the execution,a point in time after a full and fair trial,direct appeal,and the opportunity to pursue relief in the form of a petition for a writ of certiorari and petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
robinson asks us to invalidate the fdpa on the ground that the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment,in violation of the eighth amendment.he recognizes that this claim is foreclosed by gregg georgia,d,but he argues that societal standards of decency have evolved to the point at which imposing the death penalty against an adult murderer has become an intolerably cruel act.trop dulles,d.we note,however,that it is uncertain whether this court is even empowered to recognize such an evolution in the law,or must instead reserve that question for the supreme court even assuming we had such a power,robinson presents no evidence of an evolution in societal standards of decency,and we see no reason to believe that there has emerged a national consensus against capital punishment for defendants who commit crimes that are as depraved as robinson.the fdpa is not facially unconstitutional under any of these theories.
robinson challenges,as hearsay,the admission of certain testimony at his sentencing hearing.the government counters that the district court properly admitted the evidence as the testimony of a under rule d e of the federal rules of evidence,and on the ground that the fdpa explicitly provides that the rules of evidence do not apply at sentencing hearings.see c see generally stephen saltzburg,michael martin daniel capra,federal rules of evidence manual,at d lexisnexis.
we review the admission of hearsay evidence under the definition of rule d e for abuse of discretion.united states solis,cir.internal quotations omitted,cert.denied,d,and cert.denied,d.under our precedent,the proponent of admittance under rule d e must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of a conspiracy,the statement was made by a of the party,the statement was made during the course of the conspiracy,and the statement was made in furtherance of the conspiracy.id.
the evidence was admissible as a statement,so we need not consider whether the fdpa blanket exception to the hearsay rule is constitutional under ring see generally saltzburg et,supra,const.amend.vi.the objection was made to a portion of the testimony of michael williams,also known as one love,a government informant whose testimony was used to prove the aggravating factor that robinson posed a future danger to the lives and safety of other persons,as evidenced by a lack of remorse during or soon after the murder of reyes.
at the sentencing hearing,williams testified to the effect that,after aiding the investigation of robinson,he was approached by three men,one of whom was armed with a caliber firearm,who then kidnaped,assaulted,and threatened him with death.over robinson objection,williams testified that one of thes
