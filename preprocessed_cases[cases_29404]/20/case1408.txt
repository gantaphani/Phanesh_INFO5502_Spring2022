this is an appeal from an order denying a petition for writ of habeas corpus.petitioner contends that his conviction is constitutionally infirm because the prosecution suppressed evidence favorable to him,in violation of its duties under brady maryland,d.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
trial proceedings 
in october,ragheed akrawi was tried in oakland county michigan circuit court with one of eight other,charged with conspiring to possess with intent to deliver in excess of grams of cocaine.after the jury found akrawi guilty as charged,he was sentenced to life imprisonment the prosecution case was based in part on the testimony of wissam abood abood had been arrested and detained in neighboring macomb county in february in connection with a similar cocaine trafficking conspiracy charge.in may,abood bond was reduced so he could be released from jail to cooperate with ongoing law enforcement efforts,including the investigation and prosecution of ragheed akrawi.the bond reduction was instigated by abood attorney,sheldon halpern,who advised authorities that abood might be able to help them out.pursuant to an arrangement between the macomb county prosecuting attorney and dea special agent sergeant chuck pappas of the troy police department,who was supervising the akrawi investigation,pappas was to advise the prosecutor of the extent of abood cooperation while released on bond.
abood subsequently testified in akrawi trial that on two occasions,on successive days in the summer of,at the same coffee shop,he purchased a of cocaine from akrawi for a friend.the purchase price for each transaction was.a week later,abood made two more purchases of cocaine from akrawi for the same friend a purchase for and a purchase for.abood testified that no one promised him anything for his testimony and no one had threatened him.on,akrawi attorney,james howarth,tested abood motivation for testifying.abood admitted being concerned about the very serious charges pending against him in macomb county and about the possibility that he,an iraqi national,could be deported.as to whether any deal might be worked out such that his cooperation could result in favorable treatment in macomb county,abood said he did not know what the outcome would be that he was relying on his attorney,in whom he had confidence.abood acknowledged having testified before the grand jury that his motive for testifying against akrawi was to help rid the streets of drugs,a reason apparently stemming from regrets about the prevalence of drugs in his community and the impact drugs had had on his family 
abood testimony was corroborated by special agent pappas,who testified that abood was not promised anything.pappas acknowledged having agreed,in abood counsel presence,that he would report the extent of abood cooperation to macomb county prosecuting attorney carl marlinga.he explained that this was a promise made to marlinga,in connection with the,not to abood or his attorney,sheldon halpern.consistent with this promise,pappas reported abood cooperation to macomb county assistant prosecutor michael suhy,but denied having requested any or.any such decision,he explained,would have to be made by the prosecutor.from his conversations with suhy,however,pappas testified that he understood the macomb county authorities were considering a for abood.
macomb county assistant prosecutor trish fresard also corroborated abood testimony.she was assigned to abood case when the was arranged.she acknowledged that abood was then charged with a offense that carried a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment without parole.she acknowledged that a was a possibility that marlinga would consider,depending on the extent of the assistance afforded by abood.fresard denied ever making a promise that abood would be granted a if he cooperated.
assistant prosecutor suhy later assumed responsibility for the abood case from fresard.he acknowledged that,depending on the extent of abood cooperation with oakland county authorities,a reduction of the charge against abood was a possibility under consideration.however,consideration of any was premature from the perspective of the prosecuting attorney office,because at the time abood testified in the akrawi trial,halpern was still avidly pursuing outright dismissal of the charges against his client based on an entrapment defense.
based on the foregoing summary of relevant trial testimony,the jury was presented with consistent evidence that there was no express agreement between abood and the prosecution team regarding specific consideration for his cooperation.the jury certainly learned,however,that there was an implicit understanding that,depending on the nature and extent of abood assistance in connection with the akrawi prosecution,the charge pending against him in macomb county could be reduced.
indeed,akrawi attorney emphasized this very point in his closing argument.he acknowledged that the jury could reasonably conclude that abood did not have a firm deal,but he suggested they could also find it crystal clear,based on the testimony of the prosecution team itself,that abood was doing everything possible to win favor in macomb county and avoid such consequences as deportation or life imprisonment.howarth challenged the jury to see that abood professed motive,to rid the streets of drugs,was a major league lie.rather,he argued,everybody knew that his real motive was to win favor in macomb county.
nonetheless,akrawi was found guilty as charged.his conviction was affirmed by the michigan court of appeals on october.the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal on november.
proceedings 
in the meantime,abood situation had improved dramatically.on february,halpern wrote to the oakland county prosecutor who had handled akrawi trial,lawrence bunting,explaining that suhy had now consented to reduce the charges against abood,and soliciting a letter detailing the extent of abood assistance.bunting responded with a letter explaining that abood testimony was crucial and that the prosecution would have been much different without it.on march,abood entered into a plea agreement,pleading guilty to delivering less than grams of cocaine.he was sentenced to lifetime probation on the recommendation of prosecutors marlinga and suhy.
on august,abood executed an affidavit purporting to recant or correct his testimony in the akrawi case.in it,he states that he falsely testified that he had no deal.however,he identifies the deal only in amorphous terms chuck pappas told me that he wanted my cooperation and if he got it,he could in turn help me with my situation.
abood attorney,sheldon halpern,also provided an affidavit,dated march,detailing his impressions of the deal.he described it as an agreement with law enforcement for a substantial reduction of the charges pending against abood.halpern affidavit also alludes to a letter he sent to prosecutor fresard on may,purporting to memorialize the understanding.in relevant part,the letter provides 
i am writing to confirm the understanding under which your office has consented to the entry of an order changing the bonds herein to ten percent bonds.in addition,i confirm herewith sic your office to reduce the over grams case to over grams,with further reductions of one or more levels depending on the extent of assistance my client affords.
i believe this letter to be necessary as none of the discussions,including the consent to the change in bonds,was placed on the record for the obvious reasons.
if your understanding differs in any manner than as stated herein,please contact me by return mail.
halpern letter,ja footnote omitted 
armed with these materials,akrawi moved for relief from judgment in the oakland county circuit court in september.akrawi contended that he was denied a fair trial due to the prosecution failure to disclose information regarding its cooperation agreement with abood and due to the prosecution presentation of false testimony regarding the agreement.an evidentiary hearing was conducted on july and.abood refused to testify,asserting his fifth amendment privilege against because he was not granted immunity.the court,nanci grant,received testimony from halpern,pappas,fresard,bunting,suhy and howarth before issuing an opinion and order on may,concluding that akrawi was entitled to a new trial.
halpern testified that pappas had made assurances to him consistent with the terms memorialized in his letter to fresard.halpern understood this to comprise a firm agreement,inasmuch as fresard did not communicate any objection in response to the letter.halpern further testified that some years after the akrawi trial,abood told him that prosecutor bunting had advised abood,before he testified in the akrawi trial,that he had not been given any consideration for his testimony and he was expected to so testify.
pappas remained true to his trial testimony,maintaining that he made no promises to abood,although he agreed with the macomb county authorities to report abood cooperation to them.pappas testified that he lacked authority to make any promise of a.fresard,too,testified that she had made no promise to abood and lacked the authority to do so.fresard denied ever having seen the may letter from halpern,although she did not dispute that it was found in her file.fresard acknowledged that the possibility of a was the benefit that abood hoped or expected to gain by his cooperation.
after summarizing the salient testimony,judge grant opinion sets forth her reasoning in one paragraph 
in light of the foregoing,resolution of this motion turns exclusively on the factual dispute.the court believes the evidence compels a finding in defendant favor.first and foremost,attorney halpern confirming letter must be given great weight,as it describes in detail the consideration that abood was to receive and,in fact,actually ended up receiving.moreover,there can be no dispute that the letter was sent,as it was discovered in the prosecutor file.the allegations in the letter were further corroborated by the telephone message from fresard and the testimony of james howarth reflecting fresard and suhy understanding that abood had been given reason to expect favorable treatment in exchange for his cooperation.in light of this evidence,the court simply can not imagine a plausible scenario under which these events would have occurred in the absence of abood having received a charge reduction deal in exchange for his testimony against defendant.therefore,defendant has established that his due process rights were violated,and is entitled to a new trial.
order and opinion,ja.judge grant thus held that the prosecution failure to disclose to akrawi what it knew about its communications with abood that may have induced him to testify was a failure to disclose material impeachment evidence,contrary to brady maryland,d,giglio united states,d,and united states bagley,d.
before a new trial could be conducted,however,the michigan court of appeals reversed the grant of relief from judgment on december.the court cited three reasons.first,the court held that akrawi had failed to show good cause for his failure to raise this issue in his direct appeal,a prerequisite to relief from judgment under.d.second,the court held that judge grant clearly erred in finding that abood testified pursuant to an existing agreement or deal.the court of appeals construed the record as showing that no agreement was reached until after abood testified.all earlier communications between law enforcement and abood or halpern were deemed to relate only to a future possibility of leniency,something the prosecution was not required to disclose.third,the court held akrawi had failed to show actual prejudice stemming from the asserted nondisclosure 
when we consider all the foregoing circumstances and testimony,further disclosure of a possible deal would not have resulted in a different outcome at trial.as discussed,evidence was presented to the jury that abood would potentially receive consideration for his testimony,and abood was not the most significant witness testifying against defendant.the introduction of more details of abood future deal with the macomb county prosecutor would not have changed the outcome of defendant trial.
unpublished opinion,ja.the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal on december,in a order.
habeas petition 
on november,akrawi filed his petition for writ of habeas corpus in the eastern district of michigan,naming as respondent raymond booker,warden of the ryan correctional facility in detroit.in relevant part,the petition asserts that petitioner was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial when the prosecution and crucial witness not only failed to disclose,but arbitrarily and deliberately acted in covin concert to conceal the fact that the witness was accorded a substantial deal in exchange for his highly suspect testimony.the district court denied the petition in an opinion and order dated june.the district court acknowledged the warden and defenses,but refrained from addressing them because they are not jurisdictional defenses.on the merits,the district court agreed with petitioner that the prosecution had wrongfully suppressed evidence favorable to akrawi 
the record indicates that,although there was no formal deal between wissam abood or his attorney and macomb county officials at the time of petitioner trial,there was at least an informal agreement to reduce the charges against him in return for his testimony against petitioner and others.and because abood and law enforcement officials denied the existence of a deal,it was unreasonable for the state appellate court to conclude that the prosecutor did not withhold favorable evidence from petitioner.
opinion and order,ja however,the district court agreed with the michigan court of appeals that the prosecution nondisclosure of the informal agreement did not result in such actual prejudice to akrawi as to warrant habeas relief.the district court recognized that reasonable jurists could debate the resolution of this question of prejudice and so granted a certificate of appealability on this lone issue.
on appeal,akrawi insists that the prosecution suppressed material exculpatory evidence and then compounded the wrong by concealing it through perjury,resulting in structural error mandating relief to restore the integrity and public reputation of the judicial proceedings.
ii.analysis 
statute of limitations 
warden booker timely raised a defense in his response to the habeas petition.the warden argued,and akrawi has not disputed,that the habeas petition is governed by the period of limitation established by the and effective death penalty act aedpa at d.the warden demonstrated that even though the running of the statute was tolled during the pendency of akrawi pursuit of relief in the michigan courts,the instant petition was not filed until days after his period had expired.the warden has reiterated the defense on appeal.
in response,akrawi has not challenged the warden time calculations,in the district court or on appeal.nor has he attempted to invoke the doctrine of equitable tolling.see keenan bagley,cir petitioner bears the burden of showing entitlement to equitable tolling pace diguglielmo,d petitioner must establish that he has been pursuing his rights diligently,and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.nor has akrawi attempted to avoid the through a showing of actual innocence.see ross berghuis,cir assuming the applicability of the rule to a case,petitioner must demonstrate by presentation of new reliable evidence that he did not commit the acts for which he was convicted.
the district court addressed the merits of the petition without ruling on the statute of limitations defense,observing that the defense is not jurisdictional.yet,though the defense is not jurisdictional,it has been timely asserted by the warden,and per the restrictions on habeas relief prescribed by congress in aedpa,effectively bars relief absent a showing that the petition untimeliness should be excused based on equitable tolling and actual innocence.mccray vasbinder,cir reversing order granting habeas relief because the gateway requirements for excusing a,equitable tolling and actual not been satisfied connolly howes.cir unpublished upholding dismissal of petition and observing that equitable tolling requires credible new evidence of actual innocence.
petitioner akrawi does not deny that his petition is untimely.nor has he even attempted to carry his burden of showing entitlement to equitable tolling.it follows that the petition should have been dismissed.yet,for the reasons that follow,we conclude,like the district court,that even if the merits of the petition were considered,the result would be the same akrawi is not entitled to habeas relief.
procedural default 
the warden also timely asserted procedural default as a defense,in the district court and on appeal.indeed,the michigan court of appeals,as its first reason for reversing the grant of relief,cited akrawi failure to show good cause for his failure to assert this issue in his direct appeal,and that the error resulted in actual prejudice,as required for relief under.d.ja.the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal in a order,stating simply we are not persuaded that the question presented should be reviewed by this court.people akrawi,table.
federal courts ordinarily will not review a question of federal law decided by a state court if the decision of that court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.howard bouchard,cir quoting coleman thompson,d.for purposes of procedural default,the federal court is concerned with the last explained state court judgment.id.at quoting munson kapture,cir.here,the michigan court of appeals ruling is clearly the last explained state court judgment.it expressly relied at least in part on the unmet requirements of.d as a reason for denying relief.it is in this circuit that the procedural bar set forth in rule d constitutes an adequate and independent ground on which the michigan courts may rely in foreclosing review of federal claims.howard,at.
nonetheless,again,the district court opted to ignore the defense in favor of addressing the merits of akrawi claim,in the interest of judicial economy.in defense of this ruling,akrawi argues that even if procedural default is in play,his default is excused by an adequate showing of cause and prejudice.see coleman,at.recognizing that the procedural bar can be avoided if the petitioner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law.akrawi contends the cause and prejudice requirements are satisfied by the same facts that establish his habeas claim,the prosecution active concealment of its brady violation,which deprived him of a fair trial.he correctly argues that evaluating the requirements requires an analysis that mirrors the analysis implicated by the merits of akrawi habeas claim,thus revealing the wisdom in the district court judicial economy rationale.indeed,the sixth circuit adopted this very approach under very similar circumstances in bell bell,cir en banc 
t he cause and prejudice standard tracks the last two elements of a brady claim suppression by the government and materiality we therefore choose to focus our attention on the merits of bell claim with the understanding that our decision on the merits resolves any issues as to procedural default.
id.at citations omitted.
we adopt the same approach in this case,looking past procedural default to address the merits,because akrawi,if he succeeds in showing suppression of favorable evidence material to guilt or innocence,will have necessarily shown cause and prejudice excusing his procedural default.
merits of the brady claim 
standard of review 
there is no dispute about the standard of review.aedpa applies.it follows that although the court reviews the district court legal conclusions de novo and its fact findings for clear error,the court may not grant habeas relief unless the state court decision was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.irick bell,cir quoting d.in applying clearly established supreme court precedent,the court looks to the holdings,as opposed to dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.lockyer andrade,d.
the governing substantive standards are also summarized in irick 
in brady maryland,d,the supreme court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.id.at,d.there are three components of a true brady violation the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the state,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued.owens guida,at cir quoting strickler greene,d.a defendant is prejudiced when there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.kyles whitley,d quoting united states bagley,d.
the extent to which the rule of brady requires disclosure not just of evidence of formal cooperation agreements,but also evidence of informal communications between the prosecution and a witness,has received significant attention in recent sixth circuit case law.in bell bell,the court noted that i t is well established that an express agreement between the prosecution and a witness is possible impeachment material that must be turned over under brady.at.however,t he existence of a less formal,unwritten or tacit agreement is also subject to brady disclosure mandate.id.citing wisehart davis,cir.brady is not limited to formal plea bargains,immunity deals or other notarized commitments.it applies to less formal,unwritten,or tacit agreement s,so long as the prosecution offers the witness a benefit in exchange for his cooperation,so long in other words as the evidence is favorable to the accused.harris lafler,cir quoting bell,at,and bagley,at.
yet,the mere fact that a witness desires or expects favorable treatment in return for his testimony is insufficient there must be some assurance or promise from the prosecution that gives rise to a mutual understanding or tacit agreement.bell,at.further,the mere fact of favorable treatment received by a witness following cooperation is also insufficient to substantiate the existence of an agreement.i t is not the case that,if the government chooses to provide assistance to a witness following trial,a court must necessarily infer a preexisting deal subject to disclosure under brady.id.at.the government is free to reward witnesses for their cooperation with favorable treatment in pending criminal cases without disclosing to the defendant its intention to do so,provided that it does not promise anything to the witness prior to the testimony.id.quoting shabazz artuz,cir emphasis in original.
mutual understanding 
applying these standards,the question emerges whether the prosecution made assurances or representations to abood suggesting the existence of a mutual understanding or tacit favorable to akrawi because of its impeachment value.the district court,after considering the evidence presented at trial and the later evidentiary hearing,answered this question in the affirmative.it concluded that while there was no formal agreement between abood and macomb county officials,there was an informal agreement to reduce the charges against him in return for his testimony.the court concluded that the michigan appellate court contrary conclusion was based on an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
indeed,the michigan appellate court analysis seems to have been based on two fundamental errors of law.first,the appellate court recognized a duty to disclose only formal plea agreements approved by the prosecutor.yet,as bell recognizes,even unspoken,tacit agreements or mutual understandings may constitute evidence favorable to the accused that must be disclosed.secon
