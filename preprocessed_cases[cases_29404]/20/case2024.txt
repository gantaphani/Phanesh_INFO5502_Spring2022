sunny emezuo appeals the denial of his motion pursuant to,in which he claims to have received ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to the proffer requirement of f and.because we conclude that his proffer would have been insufficient even if it had been submitted to the government,emezuo can not show he suffered prejudice,and we therefore affirm.
the facts underlying emezuo arrest and conviction are set out in our opinion on his direct appeal,see united states hamzat,cir,but a brief recap may be useful.emezuo,a nigerian national,was one of fifteen individuals involved in an international heroin distribution ring operating between thailand,nigeria and the united states from to.he acted as a supplier,assisting another supplier titi in procuring and packaging heroin in luggage to be smuggled into the united states,where the heroin was distributed by bola.emezuo received wire transfers from bola on titi behalf that he knew to be payments for heroin,and he was paid in cash for his assistance.he was also paid through partial ownership of some of the heroin shipments,and he accepted in additional payment an expensive watch and automobile.he later began working directly for bola after she had a falling out with titi.emezuo was arrested in thailand on july,and was subsequently voluntarily extradited to the united states,where he was charged with one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin,in violation of.emezuo was unable to reach a plea agreement with the government,but nonetheless,on the day of trial he entered a blind plea of guilty to the conspiracy charge.
it is at this point that events become relevant to this appeal.during emezuo plea colloquy,which took place on february,he admitted to most of the above acts though,presumably due to language difficulties,it apparently took several rounds of questioning before he understood what he was being asked to admit and before the court and the government understood what he was admitting.he admitted to receiving wire transfers representing payment for drugs and to getting a commission for doing so.pld g tr.at,to owning portions of heroin shipments pld g tr.at,to helping put heroin in secret compartments in suitcases for shipment pld g tr.at,and to receiving an expensive watch,a toyota automobile and money for his assistance with the conspiracy pld g tr.at.he claimed that he had initially been duped by titi into receiving wire transfers,thinking that they were payments for the clothing she was shipping to bola in the united states pld g tr.at,but his claimed ignorance was disputed by the government.emezuo dealings with titi and subsequently bola were not during the plea colloquy.thus,emezuo trial counsel said that he would file a defendant version that would be full and complete.pld g tr.at.
the defendant version was prepared by emezuo and his trial counsel and was submitted on may,to the probation officer reviewing his case.of pet r,tab,app.it is this written statement which emezuo now contends contains the information that,if it had been proffered to the government,would have rendered him eligible for a safety valve reduction pursuant to b in his written statement,emezuo again claimed to have been initially duped by titi,but after several months of receiving wire transfers on her behalf,he began to suspect that she may have been smuggling drugs because the payment amounts were too frequent and large to have been for clothing.he subsequently learned that titi sister in the united states was actually bola and,shortly thereafter,that titi was definitely sending drugs to her.he then began regularly assisting titi with dealing drugs and helping her package drugs inside suitcases containing clothing.on one occasion,he was promised the profits from grams of the kilo of heroin that titi had packaged in a suitcase.titi paid him before he returned to nigeria in late and also sent an automobile and expensive watch to him in nigeria.in nigeria,he met bola,who told him that she had problems with titi lying to her and asked him to help her deal drugs in when she planned to return to america and he to bangkok.
the statement discusses in some detail emezuo dealings with bola in and the ways in which he assisted her,and that he owned grams of a shipment of heroin.the statement also mentions the names of several associates and the roles they played and admits that bola wired funds directly to emezuo,some of which he was to disburse to bola source in bangkok.emezuo admitted to acting as an intermediary between bola and her bangkok source during another transaction in involving grams of heroin and to receiving the money from bola for this transaction.emezuo mentioned an additional transaction,again involving grams of heroin,which was thwarted when the courier destroyed the drugs after her room but,in an oversight,not her person had been searched by drug enforcement administration agents in new york.he mentioned one further transaction in september with which he was not involved,but which resulted in the arrest of bola in possession of drugs which she had imported from nigeria.
apparently believing that this written statement was a truthful and complete proffer to the government,on may,emezuo filed a pro se motion for safety valve with copies to his trial counsel and the probation officer,stating that he had provided the government and his lawyer with the necessary information regarding his involvement in the conspiracy.of pet r,tab,app.however,the sentencing recommendation prepared by the probation officer stated that emezuo does not appear to qualify for the reduction under the safety valve provision because he has not proffered to the government.sentc g recomm.at at sentencing,the district court adopted the factual findings and guideline range set out in the presentence investigation report psr,including the psr recommendations as to emezuo marginal but sufficient acceptance of responsibility,his ineligibility for the safety valve and that no upward adjustment was warranted for obstruction of justice.emezuo was sentenced to months,which included a six month downward departure from the bottom of the applicable range as determined by the district court.
emezuo was unsuccessful on a direct appeal of his ineligibility for the safety valve reduction,see united states hamzat,cir,and he filed the present motion pro se on november.in his motion,he claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to secure him a proffer session with the government that he argues would have resulted in his eligibility for the safety valve reduction.the district court denied emezuo motion and denied an evidentiary hearing,both of which decisions are appealed.
it is clear from the district court opinion that it did not interpret emezuo pro se motion as a claim that his lawyer failed to effectively proffer emezuo written statement independently of a plea bargain,but rather as in essence claiming that his lawyer was ineffective because he failed to facilitate a plea agreement that would have allowed him to give a proffer to the government and to be eligible for a reduction under the safety valve provision.pet r br.at emphasis added.as emezuo appellate counsel now makes clear,it is the former to mention his trial counsel failure to indicate emezuo willingness to submit to a safety valve is truly the essence of emezuo claim.this is borne out in the government opposition to emezuo pro se motion,in which it argued that emezuo lawyer had decided not to proffer for strategic reasons,particularly because the parties disagreed over the quantity of drugs for which emezuo was disagreement that the government claimed could have exposed him to an enhancement for obstruction of justice.gov t resp.to def.pet.for relief pursuant to at.it therefore appears from a review of the record that emezuo ineligibility for the safety valve at the time of sentencing was based on his failure to provide any information to the government.because the district court apparently misconstrued emezuo ineffective assistance claim,it did not discuss his written submission to the probation officer in deciding to deny emezuo a hearing,let alo
