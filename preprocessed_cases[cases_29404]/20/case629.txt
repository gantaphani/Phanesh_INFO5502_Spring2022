opinion of the court 
james mcbride appeals an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania denying his under for habeas corpus relief from a state murder conviction.mcbride argues that his petition should have been granted because his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel was violated when his counsel failed to object to various references the prosecutor made at trial to what mcbride alleges were matters implicating his constitutional right to remain silent.for the following reasons,we will affirm.
background and procedural history 
background 
mcbride and his wife,kelly mcbride kelly hosted a party at their apartment on february.according to mcbride,kelly left their home the next morning and he did not see her again.she was reported missing in march by her parents and was never found.on may,judith seagraves,a neighbor of the mcbrides,observed mcbride father and mcbride landlord removing a bloody mattress from the mcbrides apartment,so she called the police.when the police arrived,they searched the apartment and found a bureau which had been nailed shut.when they opened the bureau,they found that the inside had been removed,and they identified traces of blood and hair.in,through the use of dna technology,police were able to connect kelly to the blood found on the mattress and the bureau seized from the mcbrides residence.on november,a grand jury convened to investigate kelly disappearance,and subsequently recommended charging mcbride for kelly murder.sixteen years after kelly disappearance,mcbride was arrested in florida and charged with criminal homicide.
procedural history 
at mcbride trial in the court of common pleas of northampton county in pennsylvania in may,the district attorney made comments before the jury that arguably implicated mcbride constitutional right to remain silent.the district attorney made those comments,with no objection from mcbride counsel,when referring to interviews that mcbride had had with richard fritz,an fbi agent,and stephen abbey,a corporal in the rockledge,florida police department.
a agent fritz interviews 
agent fritz testified that he interviewed mcbride twice during may,and he read to the jury from notes that he made during those interviews.before agent fritz read his notes from the second interview defense counsel objected on hearsay grounds.the judge overruled that objection and gave a limiting instruction directing the jury to focus on mcbride reactions to agent fritz questions 
this information is being submitted to you for a limited purpose i t being offered to you,and may be considered by you,only so that you can evaluate the effect on mcbride when he hears these things.it offered to show the effect on the listener,on the hearer.so when there is a reference in the upcoming interview about things other people said,you not to focus on whether or not they actually said those things or whether or not those things are true.rather,you to focus on how,if at all,mcbride reacts to that information.
agent fritz then read his notes from a may,interview with mcbride at the lehigh county prison,where mcbride was incarcerated on an unrelated matter.those notes indicated that,after miranda warnings were given mcbride answered certain questions that agent fritz posed to him,but he did not respond to others 
when specifically asked whether he had been in the company of name redacted the day following his wife disappearance,mcbride would not answer.
mcbride was asked if he was aware of the fact that what appeared to be a large amount of blood had been found on a mattress in his apartment.mcbride would not respond.
mcbride was asked whether he had any knowledge of a foot locker or a trunk previously located in his attic,and mcbride stated he had no such knowledge.he was asked whether he knew where a sleeping bag of his was located,and he would not answer.
mcbride was asked whether he had ever been involved in the assault or murder of his wife.mcbride denied any such knowledge,indicated that he loved his wife.mcbride was asked whether the blood located in his apartment could have been caused by the death of his wife or an assault on her person.mcbride did not respond.
mcbride then sat in complete silence for several moments and then indicated that he did not wish to continue the interview.mcbride abruptly left the interview space,and the interview was terminated.
id.at.defense counsel did not object to that testimony 
b officer abbey interview 
when mcbride testified at trial,the district attorney him regarding an interview with officer abbey that occurred after mcbride arrest in.having heard his miranda rights,mcbride had been willing to answer some of officer abbey questions but not others.the district attorney and mcbride sparred during over just how much mcbride had been willing to say in that interview 
well,mcbride,you agreed to talk to officer abbey,did you 
no,i agreed to listen to him.
q.you answered his questions 
a.a couple.
q.what do you mean,a couple,do you want me to go through every question and answer in this tape 
a.if you like to,i do really mind.
q.you answered every one of his questions,did you 
not every one,no.
id.at.defense counsel did not object to that testimony.
mcbride was ultimately convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment,and that judgment was affirmed by the superior court of pennsylvania.mcbride petition for allowance of appeal to the pennsylvania supreme court was denied.
pcra appeal 
mcbride filed a pro se petition for relief,and,following the appointment of counsel,filed an amended petition pursuant to pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.const.stat,in the court of common pleas in the context of the pcra claim,the pcra trial court.he asserted that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the district attorney references to his silence.mcbride trial counsel testified at a hearing before the pcra trial court and was asked whether the direct examination of agent fritz regarding the may,interview with mcbride implicated mcbride constitutional right to remain silent.he answered 
no,i disagree.first of all,mcbride did not elect to remain silent.mcbride had given a very extensive interview on may,in which he had explained in detail to the same fbi agent,agent fritz,what he knew about it.
in the second interview with agent fritz,mcbride did not assert his fifth amendment right to remain silent,mcbride answered questions.what i gathered from that and what i felt that the jury would gather from that is that when it shifted from asking questions to becoming essentially accusatory towards mcbride,that mcbride wisely first of all,had no response and eventually said this interview is over and stopped speaking.
i did not believe that to be an improper comment on his assertion of a fifth amendment assertion.rather,i felt it to be an example of how this investigation had proceeded or more to the point,not proceeded.
they were always looking at mcbride,as best i could see,no matter what he said or did and i thought it was a perfect example of how this had been badly investigated.
so i in answer to your question,i sure that one could say that by not responding,as i recall the testimony to have been,or by not answering,he may have been asserting a fifth amendment right,although he does specifically say that.
but it also,in my view,was a rather dramatic way to point out to the jury exactly what was happening here namely,that within a matter of months,they were focusing on him,even though they had no reason to.
mcbride pcra counsel immediately asked mcbride trial counsel whether he would agree,that the testimony,at the least,refers to post miranda silence.id.at.mcbride trial counsel answered,i believe it is a reference to post miranda silence,clearly.id.at.he then noted 
obviously,in retrospect,i wish that many things had gone differently in this case.the reference to silence may not have been as beneficial as i thought it was at the time.i would have to say,though,that at the time,this was a conscious decision to let agent fritz say what he was saying 
mcbride pcra counsel then asked mcbride trial counsel whether he believed the district attorney line of questioning regarding officer abbey interview during the of mcbride implicated silence,although perhaps less directly.id.at.he answered to the contrary.i think it a question seeking to elicit a response from mcbride that he had answered the questions put to him by officer abbey,that the way that i understood that testimony.id.
after the hearing,the pcra trial court denied mcbride petition.regarding the challenged references made during agent fritz testimony,the pcra trial court concluded that mcbride had failed to prove that trial counsel was ineffective.although the pcra trial court found that mcbride claim ha d arguable merit id.at,the court said that,a fter a review of the testimony and trial strategy,it could not conclude that trial counsel actions were without a reasonable basis to effectuate his client interests id.at the court went on to note that trial counsel was a well known and very experienced criminal defense attorney in the county and had made some strategic choices in furtherance of the defense theme.the mere fact that trial counsel trial strategy was ultimately unsuccessful does not render it unreasonable.id.
concerning the line of questioning that arose during of mcbride about his interview with officer abbey,the pcra trial court concluded that the exchange d id not implicate any silence.id.at.rather,t he record show ed that mcbride knowingly and voluntarily waived his miranda rights and agreed to answer the questions of abbey.the prosecution was merely conducting a of mcbride as to his voluntary responses to those questions.id.
mcbride appealed to the superior court in the context of the pcra claim,the pcra appellate court,which affirmed the pcra trial court order.although the pcra appellate court found that mcbride raised an issue of arguable merit regarding trial counsel failure to object during agent fritz testimony id.at,and noted that the reasonableness of counsel choice not to object present ed a difficult question id.at,it concluded that mcbride suffered no prejudice from the testimonial references to his silence app.at.because it rested its conclusion on lack of prejudice,the pcra appellate court did not analyze whether trial counsel decision not to object during the direct examination of agent fritz was reasonable in concluding that there was no reasonable possibility that the outcome of the trial would have been different absent agent fritz testimonial references to mcbride silence id,the pcra appellate court cited to what it thought were factual recitations from three witnesses at mcbride trial 
in may,judith seagraves,a neighbor of the mcbrides,called the northampton police to report that mcbride,mcbride father robert mcbride,and mcbride landlord were removing a bloody mattress from mcbride apartment 
at mcbride trial,dawn delong testified that she was at the mcbride home one night in early and observed the couple play fighting.at one point,mcbride struck kelly mcbride,who fell and hit her head against a coffee table.delong stated that she saw no blood at the time,and that mcbride carried kelly upstairs.when delong went upstairs approximately one hour later to use the bathroom,she passed a bedroom where she saw mcbride holding kelly.she observed that kelly appeared unconscious,and that there was blood all over the mattress and kelly hair.delong testified that mcbride seemed nervous and upset,and appeared to be trying to stuff kelly body into a dresser from which the drawers had been removed.mcbride then asked delong to retrieve a knife from the kitchen,and she complied.delong testified that she also saw mcbride retrieve a handsaw from the basement and return with it to the bedroom.delong testified that the last time she saw kelly was when she saw mcbride holding kelly in the bedroom.
another witness,annette beck,testified at trial that she had conversations with mcbride regarding his marital status in and.she stated that while mcbride originally told her that his wife had left him and filed for divorce,he subsequently told her,on numerous occasions,that he had killed his wife.when beck asked mcbride where his wife body was,he replied where a back hoe would fit,use a shovel.
id.at internal citation omitted.
each of those recitations,however,contained significant mischaracterizations or omissions.first,seagraves testified that only mcbride father and landlord were disposing of a bloody mattress on may,not mcbride himself.in fact,it had been stipulated that mcbride was incarcerated on unrelated charges on that date.second,delong never even testified at trial,but rather only at a preliminary hearing.indeed,the commonwealth did not call her as a witness at trial because it believed she had fabricated her preliminary hearing testimony.finally,the pcra appellate court failed to note that beck said she understood mcbride alleged confession to be a joke.
following the pcra appellate court decision,mcbride filed a petition for allowance of appeal to the supreme court of pennsylvania,which was denied.
post conviction relief in federal court 
mcbride subsequently filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania a timely pro se petition for habeas relief pursuant to.a magistrate judge recommended denial of the petition.after being appointed counsel,mcbride was given the opportunity to file an amended petition,which he did.
the district court denied mcbride petition for habeas relief.the court first addressed the references to silence that arose during direct examination of agent fritz,concluding that the state courts ruling was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law.app.at.although the court found it troubling that trial counsel appear ed ambivalent about whether the testimonial references were improper or may have been the subject of a successful constitutional challenge,the court d id not believe that such a conclusion constitute d ineffectiveness per se in light of counsel stated strategy of not challenging references to mcbride silence because that testimony was consistent with his defense theory.id.at.
the district court then turned to the line of questioning that arose during the of mcbride regarding his interview with officer abbey.the court found that the context of mcbride statement was not one in which jurors would equate invocation of fifth amendment rights with an implicit admission of guilt.id.at.therefore,the court concluded that counsel failure to object did not fall outside of the wide range of professionally competent assistance.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the court issued an order denying the petition and refusing to grant a certificate of appealability coa.we granted a coa limited to the following issue whether trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance when he failed to object to references at trial to mcbride constitutionally protected silence.app.at.
as already noted,mcbride claims that his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to object to various references at trial that he alleges implicated his constitutional right to remain silent.he argues that those failures were not a result of any conscious decision or strategy,but because his trial counsel erroneously believed the testimony to be permissible.appellant br.at.mcbride asserts that because the state court incorrectly found that his t rial c ounsel unconscious,uninformed and unreasonable decision was not deficient and prejudicial,we should grant him habeas relief.id.at.before we can opine on that argument,we must first consider the analytical context provided by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,by strickland washington,d,and by the fifth amendment.
the parties agree that we are bound by the standards of aedpa,under which a federal court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus with respect to a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the state courts adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.also,under the aedpa standard,the s tate court s relevant factual determinations are presumed to be correct unless the petitioner rebuts that presumption by clear and convincing evidence.han tak lee glunt,cir citing e.
since mcbride does not assert that the state courts adjudication was contrary to supreme court precedent,but rather contends only that the state courts unreasonably applied that precedent,we will focus only on the unreasonable application prong of d.in other words,to obtain habeas relief,mcbride must show that the state court s ruling on the claims being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification under supreme court precedent that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington richter,d.e valuating whether a rule application was unreasonable requires considering the rule specificity.the more general the rule,the more leeway state courts have in reaching outcomes in determinations.id.at alteration in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted.i t is not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law for a state court to decline to apply a specific legal rule that has not been squarely established by the supreme court.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in the end,i f this standard is difficult to meet,that is because it was meant to be.id.
strickland and aedpa 
mcbride specifically asserts that the state courts unreasonably applied strickland washington to the facts of his case.in strickland,the supreme court held that every criminal defendant has a sixth amendment right to reasonably effective legal assistance.at.to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,mcbride must show that his counsel performance was deficient,that is,he must prove that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,id.at.in scrutinizing counsel performance,we must be highly deferential,and refrain from ing counsel assistance after conviction or adverse sentence,as it is all too easy for a court,examining counsel defense after it has proved unsuccessful,to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.id.at.we must eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,and indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.id.deficient performance can only be found when counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment.id.at.
the supreme court in richter discussed how to assess a strickland claim in the aedpa context 
the pivotal question is whether the state court application of the strickland standard was unreasonable.this is different from asking whether defense counsel performance fell below strickland standard.were that the inquiry,the analysis would be no different than if,for example,this court were adjudicating a strickland claim on direct review of a criminal conviction in a united states district court.under aedpa,though,it is a necessary premise that the two questions are different.for purposes of d,an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.a state court must be granted a deference and latitude that are not in operation when the case involves review under the strickland standard itself.
richter.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the richter court noted that even under a de novo review of strickland,counsel representation should be judged under a most deferential standard because,u nlike a later reviewing court,trial counsel observed the relevant proceedings,knew of materials outside the record,and interacted with the client,with opposing counsel,and with the judge.id.at.in that light,the richter court held that,under aedpa,strickland high bar becomes even more difficult to surmount 
establishing that a state court application of strickland was unreasonable under d is all the more difficult.the standards created by strickland and d are both highly deferential,and when the two apply in tandem,review is doubly so.the strickland standard is a general one,so the range of reasonable applications is substantial.federal habeas courts must guard against the danger of equating unreasonableness under strickland with unreasonableness under d.when d applies,the question is not whether counsel actions were reasonable.the question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied strickland deferential standard.

constitutional right to silence 
because mcbride asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to object to certain references to his silence references that he alleges were in violation of his constitutional right to remain silent we must consider as a threshold matter when the constitutional right to silence is implicated.the fifth amendment,which applies to the states by virtue of the fourteenth amendment provides that n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.maryland shatzer,d alteration in original quoting const.amend.v.warnings provided by law enforcement officials pursuant to miranda arizona,d,provide a prophylactic means of safeguarding fifth amendment rights.doyle ohio,d see id.at concluding that the use of a defendant silence to impeach that defendant exculpatory testimony violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.we have explained that 
once a criminal defendant receives the prophylactic warnings required by miranda,it is improper under doyle for a prosecutor to cause the jury to draw an impermissible inference of guilt from a defendant silence.this is so because miranda warnings carry the government implicit assurance that an arrestee invocation of the fifth amendment right to remain silent will not later be used against him.because a defendant warning silence could be nothing more than an invocation of his right to silence,it would be fundamentally unfair to permit a breach of that assurance by allowing impeaching questions as to why he failed to give an exculpatory account to the police after receiving the warnings.
virgin islands martinez,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted 
not every reference to a defendant silence,however,results in a doyle violation.id.here,mcbride answered some of the questions posed to him subsequent to receiving miranda warnings,but selectively chose not to answer others.many courts characterize this issue as partial or selective silence and have differing views on whether such silence should be admissible at trial against a defendant.while we have never considered the issue,some of our sister circuits have held that miranda and doyle protect a defendant partial or selective silence from being used against him at trial.see hurd terhune,cir a suspect may remain selectively silent by answering some questions and then refusing to answer others without taking the risk that his silence may be used against him at trial.united states may,cir r ecogniz ing that when a defendant is partially silent by answering some questions and refusing to answer others,this partial silence does not preclude him from claiming a violation of his due process rights under doyle.united states scott,cir a suspect may speak to the agents,reassert his right to remain silent or refuse to answer certain questions,and still be confident that doyle will prevent the prosecution from using his silence against him.other circuit courts,however,have held that a defendant has no constitutional right to prevent his selective silence from being used against him at trial.see united states pando franco,cir c onclud ing that,by answering questions after having knowingly received proper miranda warnings,the defendant waived his right to prevent the entire conversation,including the implicit references to his silence contained therein,from being used against him as substantive evidence of guilt.united states burns,cir t he admission of the defendant silence in response to one question
