in november,brandon leon basham and chadrick evan fulks engaged in a multistate crime spree,for which they were both prosecuted.basham was convicted in the district of south carolina of multiple crimes and sentenced to death for two of them,carjacking resulting in death,in contravention of,and kidnapping resulting in death,as proscribed by.after we upheld basham convictions and death sentences on direct appeal,see united states basham,cir,cert.denied,he moved for habeas corpus relief pursuant to.by its opinion of june,the district court denied basham motion.see united states basham,cr june,ecf the opinion.the court subsequently denied basham motion to alter or amend the judgment,made under federal rule of civil procedure e,by way of its august,order.see united states basham,cr,ecf the reconsideration order basham now appeals from those decisions.as explained below,we reject basham assignments of error and affirm the judgment of the district court.
our opinion disposing of basham direct appeal,authored by our distinguished former chief judge karen williams,detailed the pertinent facts of basham crime spree as follows 
in,basham,a lifelong kentucky resident,was serving the final years of a felony forgery conviction sentence at the hopkins county detention center in kentucky.in october of that year,chadrick evan fulks became basham new cellmate.in early november,fulks was charged with an additional and serious state offense,first degree abuse of a child aged twelve years or younger.on november,basham and fulks escaped the detention center together by scaling a wall in the recreation area and leaving the area on foot.
by the evening of november,basham and fulks reached the home of james hawkins in nearby hanson,kentucky.basham approached the dwelling,knocked on the door,and asked to use the telephone.basham told hawkins that his car had broken down and,after basham made two calls,hawkins agreed to drive him to a nearby convenience store.when basham and hawkins left the residence,fulks joined them and the three men left in hawkins truck.the two men then told hawkins that their vehicle was disabled in robards,kentucky,and they asked for a ride.during the drive,fulks told hawkins that the disabled vehicle was actually in indiana and directed hawkins to drive there.fulks later changed the directions again by this point,basham was pointing a knife at hawkins to keep him driving to their preferred destination.at some point,fulks took the wheel,drove the truck into a field,and ordered basham to tie hawkins to a tree.fulks became dissatisfied with basham speed in tying and eventually completed the job himself.they left hawkins clothed in shorts,and a vest.fifteen hours later,hawkins freed himself and flagged a passing motorist.when interviewed by police officers later that day,hawkins identified basham and fulks as the individuals who kidnapped him.
after abandoning hawkins,fulks and basham drove to portage,indiana,to visit one of fulks former girlfriends,tina severance.they abandoned hawkins vehicle at a hotel and walked to a trailer shared by severance and her friend andrea roddy.the four then drove to a hotel in northern indiana and stayed there for the next few days.at some point,basham and roddy began a consensual sexual relationship.
during their time in indiana,fulks asked severance if she knew anyone from whom he could obtain firearms.severance informed fulks that a friend of hers,robert talsma,kept several firearms at his home severance and roddy thereafter agreed to lure talsma out of his house by offering to buy him breakfast.while talsma was at breakfast with the women,basham and fulks entered talsma home and stole four firearms,a ring,and several blank checks.they then reunited with severance and roddy,and the four traveled in severance van to sturgis,michigan.that night,november,basham and roddy stayed at a hotel in sturgis while fulks and severance drove to goshen,indiana,to smoke marijuana and methamphetamines with fulks brother,ronnie fulks.
that evening,two police officers began knocking on doors at the hotel where basham and roddy were staying in sturgis.basham opened his room door,saw the officers,closed the door,and cocked a caliber revolver that he had stolen from talsma.the officers ended up leaving before reaching basham door.basham told roddy,however,i was about to shoot me a er cop right.i was going to blow the f ing cop away.the next morning,november,basham and roddy drove to a local kmart to purchase sundries.basham met a group of teenagers in the parking lot,and he reported to roddy that they had some money and he wanted to kill them for it.after purchasing sundries with some of talsma stolen checks,basham invited the teenagers back to the hotel room.severance and fulks arrived back at the hotel shortly thereafter,and the teenagers left.fulks,basham,severance,and roddy then drove severance van to the home of fulks brother,ronnie fulks,in goshen,indiana.
on november,the group of four drove to piketon,ohio,in severance van.basham again used talsma checks to buy sundries,which roddy later returned for cash.basham and fulks also bought two sets of camouflage clothing and fulks stole a purse and cell phone from a wal mart parking lot.on november,they drove to kenova,west virginia,near huntington,and rented a hotel room.fulks and basham,wearing their sets of camouflage clothing,left the hotel room by themselves and did not return until the morning hours of november.
samantha burns,a marshall university student,worked at the penney store in the huntington mall.in addition,burns also participated in a school fundraiser by selling candy boxes,which she kept in her car.on november,burns met her aunt at penney to purchase clothing for one of burns nieces they parked in separate locations at the mall.at that evening,burns called her mother to say she was staying at a friend house that night.burns has never been seen since.
during the early morning hours of november,a local fire department responded to a reported explosion and fire at a rural area three miles outside of huntington.the responding firemen found a car later identified as belonging to burns burned out at a cemetery.
meanwhile,fulks and basham returned to the hotel carrying muddy clothing,and fulks indicated that they had stolen some money.later that morning,the group of four checked out of the motel and drove to south carolina,where fulks had lived for several years in the.several facts emerged linking basham and fulks to burns disappearance.roddy and severance reported seeing mud,as well as one of burns candy boxes,in the van.in addition,basham began wearing a ring around his neck that belonged to samantha burns.basham told the women that he had stolen the candy from a girl selling it and that he had stolen the ring from a car.roddy also found burns photo id discarded with other items linking burns to fulks and basham.moreover,it was later revealed that fulks used burns atm card twice on the evening of november at local banks.
the evening of november,fulks,basham,severance and roddy arrived at a motel in little river,south carolina.the next day was a day of relative rest fulks and basham stole several purses and wallets from unattended vehicles,went shopping,and then returned to the motel room to smoke marijuana,drink,and play cards.on november,the four moved to a motel in myrtle beach,south carolina.fulks and basham left the women and drove to nearby conway,south carolina.hoping to steal firearms,fulks and basham burglarized the conway home of sam jordan.carl jordan,sam father,drove up to the home as fulks and basham were leaving.fulks attempted to ram jordan car with severance van but stopped short basham exited the house and fired a shot at a nearby greenhouse.fulks then fired a shot that shattered the of jordan car.jordan fled the area,with fulks and basham in pursuit,still firing.at some point,fulks and basham ceased their chase,abandoned severance van,and stole a truck,which they drove to the wal mart in conway.
upon arriving at the wal mart,basham approached a blue bmw sedan driven by year old alice donovan.basham entered the car and forced donovan to drive to the back of the parking lot,where fulks waited.there,fulks entered the driver side of the car and drove away at,fulks used donovan atm card to purchase gas from a service station in shallote,north carolina.at,donovan called her daughter to say she was shopping and would be home late.later that day,several men at the bee tree farms hunt club in winnabow,north carolina,saw two men and a woman in a blue bmw drive to the end of a road by the lodge,turn around,and leave the area.donovan,like burns,was never seen again.
basham and fulks returned to their myrtle beach motel later that day and told severance and roddy they had to leave town because basham shot at some police officers and severance van had been seized.basham and fulks took donovan bmw and began driving to west virginia,leaving severance and roddy behind in myrtle beach.donovan atm card was used in little river,myrtle beach,and raleigh,north carolina.meanwhile,severance filed a false police report alleging that her van had been stolen.
on november,fulks and basham arrived at the home of beth mcguffin near huntington,west virginia.mcguffin,a childhood friend of fulks,agreed to let fulks and basham stay at her home.fulks introduced basham to her as tommy blake.later on november,fulks and basham purchased crack cocaine to share.basham and mcguffin also began a sexual relationship and had sexual intercourse three times over the next several days.basham also gave mcguffin burns ring.on november,the three watched a news story about the disappearance of samantha burns.when mcguffin remarked that burns was likely dead,fulks stated,s he is dead.
at the same time,the federal bureau of investigation fbi was investigating the kidnapping of james hawkins,which it believed basham and fulks had committed after escaping from prison.the fbi learned that the two men might be in myrtle beach,south carolina,and that severance had reported her van stolen.on november,the fbi and local authorities interviewed severance and learned that basham and fulks had left the area.the fbi also became aware of the disappearance of alice donovan and suspected that fulks and basham might be involved.
on sunday,november,fulks,basham,and mcguffin smoked marijuana before fulks and basham left mcguffin house,telling her they were headed to arizona.instead,they stopped at the ashland mall in ashland,kentucky,about minutes from huntington.sometime that evening,in a wal mart parking lot,basham approached deanna francis daughter as she entered the passenger side of their vehicle.basham pointed a gun into the teenager side,attempted to enter the car,and asked for directions to greenville,kentucky.when basham realized deanna daughter was talking on her cell phone,he said m y bad,i did mean to scare you and walked away.deanna immediately called the police.
ashland police officer matt davis was approximately four blocks from the ashland mall when he heard the dispatch about the attempted carjacking.davis drove to the mall,where he saw basham,who met the description of the suspected carjacker.davis exited his patrol vehicle and approached basham basham immediately began to flee.as davis chased basham through the mall area,basham drew his weapon and fired a shot in the air.as the chase continued,basham drew his weapon a second time,turned,and fired at davis,who fired three shots of his own in return.basham eventually made his way to a rail yard on the banks of the ohio river where he hid.davis radioed reinforcements,which surrounded the area.more than an hour later,at approximately,basham surrendered to police,identifying himself as josh rittman.police recovered a knife later identified as belonging to alice donovan and a crack cocaine pipe on basham person.basham pistol was recovered from a rail car several days later.
fulks returned to mcguffin home that evening and watched a news report on basham arrest.the morning of november,fulks left mcguffin residence to drive donovan bmw to his brother house in goshen,indiana.fulks stopped at a rest area,where an ohio state trooper,who had ascertained that the bmw was stolen,approached him a chase then ensued at speeds in excess of miles per hour.during this chase,fulks nearly struck another trooper before managing to evade capture.fulks eventually arrived at his brother home in the early morning hours of november.police officers were staking out ronnie home,however,and when fulks,his brother ronnie,and ronnie girlfriend drove to a barn to hide the bmw,fulks was arrested.fulks semen and the bodily fluids from an unidentified female were later found in the back seat of the bmw.
back in west virginia,investigators determined that josh rittman was actually basham,and that he was a recent prison escapee.at on november,basham was interviewed for the first time.basham first told investigators that he and fulks had escaped from prison and committed several crimes along the way.later,he admitted that they had traveled to south carolina and kidnapped a woman in conway,south carolina.basham,however,insisted that the woman was alive and with fulks.
at on november,investigators basham.basham told investigators that he and fulks kidnapped a man after escaping from prison,and carried firearms when kidnapping donovan.he further told investigators that they used her credit cards to obtain cash,that they had driven donovan to ashland,kentucky,and that fulks was waiting for basham when basham was caught.this time,basham said he thought donovan was dead because she was not with basham and fulks at the ashland mall.during this interview,basham also told investigators that fulks got a girl in west virginia as well.
on november,fbi agents interviewed basham for seven hours.on this occasion,basham told investigators that after they kidnapped donovan,fulks dropped basham off at the hotel,drove donovan to a resort area,raped her,tied her up,and left her.basham also claimed that fulks was the one who actually carjacked donovan.basham also clarified that when he said fulks got a girl in west virginia,that he meant they had stolen a girl credit cards,not that they had kidnapped anyone else.at this point,investigators believed donovan may have been still alive.basham drew a map of the places fulks and basham had been with donovan.this map roughly corresponded with the savannah bluff area of horry county,south carolina.a search of the area,however,left investigators no closer to discovering donovan fate.
on november,basham,now represented by counsel,agreed to further aid investigators in finding donovan body.he drew a map,mentioned passing through a cemetery,and informed investigators that donovan body was left covered but unburied in the woods.basham was unable to identify any specific landmarks to aid investigators.
on november,through counsel,basham informed investigators that samantha burns was dead and that he and fulks had rolled her body down an embankment and into the guyandotte river near huntington.
two days later,on november,fbi and state investigators organized a search team to search brunswick county,north carolina,for donovan body.basham,now represented by cameron littlejohn,and william monckton,vi,accompanied the agents.during the ride,basham saw a deer and said,i never could kill a deer and here i have,but was cut off before finishing his sentence.later that day,basham told the investigators that he and fulks had driven past a park,taken donovan body out of the car,dragged it into the woods,and covered it.on two occasions,basham became emotional as he identified landmarks where he and fulks had taken donovan.later,basham told the investigators he had thrown out a liz claiborne purse strap at the bee tree farms cemetery.when they arrived,the local sheriff asked,is this where it happened basham responded,this is it.it is.the cemetery was searched to no avail 
starting in late november,while in jail awaiting trial,basham began writing letters to mcguffin,telling her his real name,claiming that he loved her,that he had not hurt that girl from south carolina,and that fulks was responsible for their crime spree.on this last point,basham wrote that fulks lied to me and told me he had all kinds of money,and a new car,and all of this stuff just waiting on him,and all he needed me to do was to show him the way away from the jail because i was raised in that area.basham was not entirely forthright with mcguffin,however,as he also wrote that burns ring,which he had given to mcguffin,was not stolen or anything like that.basham also confided that he did a lot of bad s t with fulks.
on december,basham called a former teacher in madisonville,kentucky,clifford jay.when jay asked whether basham had killed alice donovan,basham replied,yes,sir.we killed them.jay was surprised by the use of the term them,because he had only heard about the donovan killing.
basham,at alterations in original footnotes and citations omitted.following our opinion,it was confirmed that donovan remains had been found in a wooded area in horry county,south carolina.
on december,basham and fulks were charged in the district of south carolina for their crimes against donovan.the operative superseding indictment was then returned on april.the first two counts carjacking resulting in death,in violation of,and kidnapping resulting in death,in contravention of a carried with them the possibility of a death sentence.on september,the government filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty against basham under a,the federal death penalty act.
basham and fulks cases were severed for trial on january,basham trial commenced on september.the evidence during the guilt phase of the trial proceedings included testimony from witnesses statements made by basham to the fbi,clifford jay,and mcguffin and surveillance videos of donovan abduction in the wal mart parking lot as well as atm withdrawals made by fulks using donovan atm card.during trial,the defense conceded basham culpability in the carjacking and kidnapping.the defense argued,however,that fulks had committed donovan murder and was the instigator throughout the crime spree.to that end,during basham opening statement,defense counsel asserted that the only issue in controversy was basham intent to commit serious bodily harm to donovan at the time of the abduction.after the guilt phase of the trial,the jury convicted basham of all eight counts in the superseding indictment.
the penalty phase of the trial proceedings commenced on october.the prosecution introduced the trial record as its principal evidence.in addition,the prosecution presented testimony from correctional officers and a female nurse regarding basham misconduct,drug use,and sexual misconduct towards female employees in prison testimony from donovan family regarding the impact of her death and a videotape showing a courtroom scuffle between basham and deputy marshals that had occurred during the guilt phase of the trial.in mitigation,basham put forth evidence that his parents encouraged his bad behavior,forced him to steal to support their drug habits,and introduced him to drugs,and that basham was sexually abused by one of his father friends.basham also introduced mitigation evidence regarding his mental condition and ability to adapt to prison life.on november,the jury returned a verdict recommending that basham be sentenced to death on counts and.
basham convictions and death sentences were entered on february.an aggregate sentence of months in prison was imposed on the remaining six counts.
on appeal,we affirmed basham convictions and sentence in all respects.see basham,at.on june,basham timely filed his motion for habeas corpus relief pursuant to.that motion listed claims for relief,two of which basham subsequently withdrew.
after conducting an evidentiary hearing over eight nonconsecutive days in late the hearing,the district court denied basham motion for reasons explained in its thorough and opinion of june.the district court granted basham a certificate of appealability as to claims through,claims through,and claim.the court subsequently denied basham motion to alter or amend the judgment,made under federal rule of civil procedure e,by way of its august,reconsideration order.basham timely noticed this appeal on october,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to,a,and d.
we review de novo a district court legal conclusions in denying a motion.see united states fulks,cir.factual findings adduced from the evidence presented at a hearing are reviewed for clear error.id.
on appeal,basham first pursues four claims relating to an inculpatory statement he made to a law enforcement officer demonstrating how donovan had been strangled with a purse strap.basham asserts that he was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel when his lawyers permitted him to speak with investigators outside of their presence claim of basham motion,and later when his lawyers failed to challenge the admissibility of his inculpatory statement on the ground that it resulted from an unlawful interrogation claim.additionally,basham contends that the prosecution committed misconduct by presenting false testimony at trial to the effect that basham statement admitted that he was donovan killer claim,and that his lawyers were ineffective by not raising the misconduct contention on direct appeal claim.
second,basham mounts two challenges relating to his competency to stand trial.that is,he maintains that he was tried while incompetent,in violation of his due process rights claim.relatedly,basham alleges that his trial lawyers were constitutionally ineffective by not ably litigating his competency claim.
third,basham asserts that his trial lawyers rendered ineffective assistance in their handling of evidence presented by the prosecution relating to the murder of the second victim,samantha burns claim.the burns evidence was presented during the guilt phase of basham trial,and he contends that his lawyers were deficient by failing to challenge the admissibility and scope of that evidence.
fourth,basham raises a final ineffective assistance claim,arguing that his trial counsel file was not properly provided to the lawyers handling his direct appeal claim.that deficiency,he maintains,impeded his appellate lawyers from identifying viable challenges on appeal.
basham first set of claims arises from a statement he made to law enforcement authorities in november,when he demonstrated how donovan had been strangled with a purse strap.to provide context to those claims,we first review the relevant background of the contested statement and how it was used by the prosecution at basham trial.we then address the merits of the claims.
following basham november,arrest,he made several statements to law enforcement officers,after being advised of his miranda rights and on the advice of his counsel,essentially admitting his involvement in the carjacking and kidnapping of alice donovan.cameron littlejohn and william monckton,both death lawyers,were appointed to represent basham on november.the following day thanksgiving day basham participated in a search for donovan body in brunswick county,north carolina the thanksgiving search.littlejohn and monckton had determined that participating in the thanksgiving search could help basham case by possibly finding donovan still alive,or by demonstrating his willingness to assist law enforcement.basham had no proffer agreement from the government,exposing him to the risk that any statements he made during the search might be used against him.littlejohn and monckton therefore sought to limit basham participation to directing the search team in locating donovan body.present during the search were fbi agent jeffrey long,officers from the local conway,south carolina police department,brunswick county sheriff ronald hewett,several sheriff deputies,and approximately twenty local volunteers.
the first several hours of the thanksgiving search were unsuccessful.after consulting privately with basham,littlejohn advised the investigators that,hypothetically,fulks had raped donovan,strangled her with a purse strap,and then slit her throat afterwards,in littlejohn presence,basham told sheriff hewett that the search team should look for a liz claiborne purse strap at the bee tree farms cemetery.the group then drove to that location.
at the cemetery,basham,sheriff hewett,and two of hewett deputies wandered about feet away from the rest of the group,including basham lawyers.basham and hewett remained within the sight of littlejohn and monckton,but the lawyers could not hear basham words.during that encounter,basham made a statement to hewett part oral and part demonstrative the cemetery statement.specifically,basham told hewett that he believed the strap was from a liz claiborne purse and that he had thrown the strap into the woods.although the search team was unable to locate the strap,basham confirmed to hewett several times that he believed they were at the correct location,directing the team where they should search.basham used his hands to estimate the length of the purse strap and to show how he basham had tossed the strap into the woods.he also demonstrated a movement depicting how donovan was strangled with the strap the strangling demonstration.
leading up to trial,basham moved to suppress all of his statements.the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing from february through february,the suppression hearing,to assess whether basham statements were voluntary and admissible under jackson denno,a defendant objecting to the admission of a confession is entitled to a fair hearing in which both the underlying factual issues and the voluntariness of his confession are actually and reliably determined.by the time of the suppression hearing,basham was represented by lawyers jack swerling and gregory harris.they sought to suppress all statements basham made during the thanksgiving search,other than statements providing directions to donovan body and the purse strap.
given that the strangling demonstration was not a directional statement,it was encompassed within the lawyers suppression efforts.they did not,however,focus directly on that demonstration or contend that the broader cemetery statement was the product of an illegal interrogation pursuant to edwards arizona,a n accused,having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel,is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him,unless the accused himself initiates further communication,exchanges,or conversations with the police.the lawyers,rather,focused primarily on suppressing littlejohn hypotheticals.the district court ultimately excluded the hypotheticals,but ruled that the statements basham made during the thanksgiving search including the cemetery statement and the strangling demonstration were admissible.
at trial,during the guilt phase,the prosecution introduced evidence from the thanksgiving search through sheriff hewett.on direct examination,hewett testified to a number of inculpatory statements basham had made during the search in littlejohn presence.hewett also testified regarding the cemetery statement,mimicking basham strangling demonstration for the jury.hewett testimony on direct gave no indication as to whether it was basham or fulks who had strangled donovan with the purse strap.on,attorney harris returned to the cemetery statement.harris was aware that hewett notes from the thanksgiving search contained no indication that basham had suggested that he rather than fulks had strangled donovan.seeking to draw out that point to the jury,harris engaged in the following colloquy with hewett 
now,at the cemetery,and i would like you to refer to your notes if that will help you.
q.there is nothing in your notes,nor is there anything in lieutenant crocker notes that indicate that brandon basham told you that he used the strap,is there 
no,sir.he did not tell me he used the strap.he demonstrated,though.
q.he demonstrated 
your notes,nor lieutenant crocker notes say that he did that is that true 
a.that is true because he did say.he showed.
emphases added basham posits on collateral attack that the underscored portions of the foregoing testimony could suggest that,although basham had not said that he used the strap to strangle and kill donovan,he demonstrated as much.that is,the underscored language might be construed as basham admission that he killed donovan the actual killer suggestion.
neither the defense nor the prosecution followed up with sheriff hewett to clarify his testimony.in closing arguments at each trial phase,the prosecution briefly referenced hewett testimony regarding the strangling demonstration.during the guilt phase,near the end of its lengthy summation,the prosecution recounted that basham had demonstrated that a liz claiborne purse strap was used to kill alice donovan.see.the prosecutor argued that,although basham had not said he killed alice donovan,he demonstrated it.id.a few moments later,the prosecutor urged that after seeing hewett demonstrate how brandon basham demonstrated how alice donovan was strangled and hearing the testimony of clifford jay that basham had admitted we killed them the jury should return guilty verdicts.id.at.according to the prosecutor,that evidence,alone,seals the deal.id.at.thereafter,in its closing,the government again referenced the strangling demonstration in arguing that the statutory intent element had been proved.
the sixth amendment guarantees an accused the effective assistance of counsel,the familiar standards of which were established in strickland washington.under strickland,a movant seeking collateral relief from his conviction or sentence through an ineffective assistance claim must show that his counsel performance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced his defense.id.at.
the deficiency prong turns on whether counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.strickland,at.a reviewing court must apply a strong presumption that counsel representation was within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.harrington richter,quoting strickland,at.the strickland standard is difficult to satisfy,in that the sixth amendment guarantees reasonable competence,not perfect advocacy judged with the benefit of hindsight.see yarborough gentry.
the prejudice prong of strickland inquires into whether counsel deficiency affected the judgment.see at.the movant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.in the context of a death sentence,the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that,absent the errors,the sentencer would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.id.at.the prejudice analysis requires the court deciding the ineffectiveness claim to consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.elmore ozmint,cir quoting strickland,at.in evaluating that evidence,w e are not bound to view the facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution.tice johnson,cir.
by way of his motion,basham advances three ineffective assistance claims relating to his cemetery statement and the resulting testimony offered by sheriff hewett at trial.with respect to the first two of those claims,basham asserts,first,that littlejohn and monckton performed deficiently during the thanksgiving search when they allowed basham to speak to hewett outside of their presence,and,second,that swerling and harris were deficient by not arguing at the suppression hearing that basham cemetery statement was the inadmissible product of an illegal interrogation.
importantly,those two ineffective assistance claims rely on a shared argument as to strickland prejudice prong.had his lawyers performed competently either by remaining with him during the thanksgiving search and preventing him from making the cemetery statement littlejohn and monckton,or by securing the suppression of the cemetery statement through an edwards argument swerling and harris sheriff hewett would not have testified to the cemetery statement at basham trial.in the absence of that testimony,basham contends that there is a reasonable probability that he would not have been sentenced to death.for purposes of establishing prejudice,not all of basham oral and demonstrative cemetery statement is relevant,as most of the statement was cumulative to other,uncontroverted statements basham made.the strangling demonstration is the only noncumulative portion of the cemetery statement.basham argument as to prejudice also homes in on the actual killer suggestion made by hewett while testifying to the strangling demonstration.
the district court determined that basham failed to show that his lawyers alleged deficiencies prejudiced his defense under strickland the court reached that conclusion through an exceedingly thorough analysis of the issue,which we will briefly summarize.see opinion.the court began by examining hewett trial evidence on,which the court acknowledged could be interpreted to suggest that basham had demonstrated how he had used the purse strap to strangle donovan.the court rejected basham contention that prejudice was evident simply from the prosecutor references to hewett testimony.those summations,the court found,repeatedly used passive language to indicate basham had demonstrated how donovan was strangled.from there,the court summarized the overall case against basham,which,viewed in its totality,was overwhelming.id.at.basham had not shown,the court explained,that hewett testimony regarding the strangling demonstration or his actual killer suggestion might have impacted the jury overall analysis of the aggravating and mitigating factors.id.at.given that the controverted testimony had,at most,a less than significant impact only on one nonstatutory mitigating factor,id.at,and in light of the overwhelming support in the record justifying the death sentence,the court was left with the firm conclusion that basham has been unable to show that the decision reached by the jury would reasonably likely have been different absent the error,id.at alterations in original quoting strickland,at.
on appeal,basham urges that his lawyers deficiencies prejudiced his defense at the penalty phase.our task at this stage is to reweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of available mitigating evidence.wiggins smith.basham contends that the mitigating evidence presented to the jury might have carried greater weight had the jury not been told by the government that basham killed donovan with his own hands.see br.of appellant.
the aggravating evidence against basham was strong.the jury unanimously found,beyond a reasonable doubt,six of the seven nonstatutory aggravating factors alleged,including that basham escaped from a detention facility carjacked and kidnapped samantha burns,resulting in her death committed a burglary of carl jordan residence and then attempted to murder him kidnapped and carjacked james hawkins attempted to murder a police officer in ashland,kentucky and impacted donovan families and friends.the jury did not find unanimously the future dangerousness factor.the trial record amply supported the six aggravators that the jury found against basham.because the aggravators do not directly concern donovan death,moreover,omitting the actual killer suggestion and the strangling demonstration would not have affected the aggravating factors.
the defense submitted to the jury five statutory mitigating factors and thirty nonstatutory mitigating factors.on the statutory factors,at least one juror found that basham had impaired capacity and committed the offense while severely disturbed,while no jurors found duress,minor participation,or insignificant prior history.see a.the nonstatutory factors included issues such as basham role in the offense,family background,substance abuse,history of abuse,mental and emotional problems,and low intelligence.the jury findings on the nonstatutory factors differed between its special verdict forms on the kidnapping and the carjacking charges but,in all,most of those factors were found present by at least one juror.relevant here,however,is that no juror found as to either offense that basham had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that brandon leon basham played a lesser role than chadrick evan fulks in the kidnapping and carjacking of alice donovan,and this factor is mitigating.see.the district court determined the foregoing to be the only factor potentially impacted by the actual killer suggestion,and we agree.we also agree with the court conclusion that,considering the totality of the evidence,there is not a reasonable likelihood that the actual killer suggestion would have altered the jury decision to recommend death.
first,the government overarching theory in basham prosecution undermines the significance that basham assigns to the actual killer suggestion.the prosecution took the position that basham and fulks aided and abetted each other in kidnapping,carjacking,and killing donovan neither of their convictions turned on which man killed donovan.rather,the prosecution maintained that,in their crimes against donovan,basham and fulks were acting together in unison as a team,a death squad,if you will.see.as the prosecution explained in its closing argument at the guilt phase of basham trial,t he government does not have to prove,and more importantly,you jurors do not have to find who,specifically,killed alice donovan in order to convict brandon basham.id.that was because,but for the actions of brandon basham,alice donovan would be alive today.but for the actions of chad fulks,alice donovan would be alive today.the two of them are responsible for the death of alice donovan.id.at.the prosecution made no distinction between the hands of basham and fulks if one had strangled her,so had the other.thus,the prosecutor argued in basham summation now,does that mean brandon basham strangling of alice donovan is the only hand that caused alice donovan death the government does submit that.the government submits,and submitted all along,that chad fulks is just as responsible.id.at.that sentiment was repeated on rebuttal,when the prosecutor declared that donovan had died at the hands of these two men.id.at.
second,the record clearly establishes that basham actively participated with fulks in committing the crimes against donovan,and in ultimately ending her life.basham does not suggest otherwise.nor could he credibly make such an argument.basham strangling demonstration was but one piece of the overwhelming case establishing basham involvement in donovan murder.see basham,at.removing sheriff hewett contested testimony,the jury presentation included the following evidence 
videotape footage of basham carjacking donovan in a wal mart parking lot 
a map drawn by basham during a november,interview with law enforcement,where he indicated the location of donovan body 
basham statement to investigators on november,that donovan body should be at a cemetery,which is where he and fulks did their thing,see 
basham participation in the thanksgiving search on november,which indicated that he knew of the crimes committed against donovan and the location of her body 
basham directions to the search team during the thanksgiving search,made with littlejohn express consent you need to be looking for a strap.it is about this long it has liz claiborne on the strap back at the cemetery,you need to go back to the cemetery and look for that strap,see id.at 
basham statements during the thanksgiving search,made in littlejohn presence,that after dragging donovan body out of the car,he and fulks pulled her into the woods and covered the body with leaves and what he described as limbs,see id.at 
basham statement during the thanksgiving search when,while riding in the van with littlejohn,basham saw a doe jump onto the road and remarked,you know,i never could kill a deer and here i have,see id.at 
basham admission to clifford jay on december,yes sir.we killed them,see id.at and 
donovan knife being found in basham possession when he was arrested.
the totality of the evidence leaves no doubt that basham at the very least aided and abetted the crimes committed against donovan.moreover,as the district court aptly noted,
elimination of the strangling demonstration would not have led the jury to the conclusion that fulks was the one who strangled donovan.instead,the jury would have been left with an absence of testimony on the question of who did the strangling and a complete record of basham and fulks cascade of misdeeds,which included two rapes and murders and at least five other attempted or potential murders.
see opinion.the jury thus could have concluded that basham had actually strangled donovan,even without hewett actual killer suggestion.or,the jury could have decided that fulks was the strangler,in which case basham would still be deemed the killer,given the prosecution theory.or,the jury could have chosen the path suggested by the government and simply found that basham and fulks,together,killed donovan.the end result would be the same basham and fulks were equally culpable for all of their acts,meaning basham was responsible for killing donovan.
basham urges that an overly mechanical analysis of prejudice is flawed,in that a reviewing court can not account for the intangible factors at play in each juror evaluation of whether basham was deserving of death.see br.of appellant.nonetheless,to succeed on his ineffective assistance claims,basham is not entitled to satisfy the prejudice requirement through rank speculation,defying calculation of a reasonable probability.see united states fulks,cir.the supreme court observed in strickland that errors might impact the underlying facts and inferences to sharply different degrees,and a verdict or conclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.see at.here,assuming hewett actual killer suggestion and strangling demonstration were erroneously admitted,the totality of the evidence remains unaffected.
subtracting the strangling demonstration and hewett actual killer suggestion from the sum of evidence received by the jury,we are convinced that basham has not established prejudice by a reasonable probability,sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of his proceedings.see strickland,at.we thus agree with the district court that basham ineffective assistance claims must fail,in that he can not satisfy strickland prejudice requirement 
basham advances two additional claims arising from the cemetery statement,and more specifically from sheriff hewett actual killer suggestion.basham contends,first,that his convictions must be reversed because the prosecution committed misconduct when it used that testimony knowing it was false,and,second,that his lawyers were ineffective in failing to raise the misconduct issue on direct appeal.
in prosecuting a criminal trial,the due process clause obliges the government not to knowingly use false evidence,including false testimony,to obtain a tainted conviction.napue illinois.due process is violated regardless of whether the prosecution solicited testimony it knew to be false or simply allowed such testimony to pass uncorrected.boyd french,cir citing giglio united states.testimony by a law enforcement officer that is knowingly false or misleading is imputed to the prosecution.id.on collateral attack,a movant alleging this sort of misconduct must demonstrate three elements that the testimony at issue was false that the prosecution knew or should have known of the falsity and that a reasonable probability exists that the false testimony may have affected the verdict.see united states roane,cir united states kelly,cir.if the movant shows each of those elements,relief must be awarded.see united states bagley.
basham prosecutorial misconduct claim relates to sheriff hewett actual killer suggestion and the related portions of the government closing arguments.basham points to three instances in the record that,he contends,establish the prosecution knew or should have known that the testimony was false.first,fbi agent long prepared a report on december,summarizing the thanksgiving search.in that report,long recounted that basham had informed investigators that a fter fulks raped donovan,fulks used a purse strap,which was approximately inches long,and strangled donovan.see.second,on april,long appeared before a grand jury to obtain the superseding indictment.consistent with his report,long testified that basham had told law enforcement officers during the thanksgiving search that fulks had actually killed donovan.id.at.third,while arguing an evidentiary issue in fulks trial,and outside the presence of the jury,assistant united states attorney johnny gasser stated,brandon basham said that chad fulks took the purse strap and strangled donovan.id.at.
the district court rejected basham misconduct claim.initially,the court determined that the claim failed because it had been procedurally defaulted.alternatively,the court rejected the claim on its merits.first,the court observed that ausa gasser made his statement in the context of an evidentiary argument during fulks trial,outside the presence of the jury.fulks had sought to introduce basham inculpatory statement,you know i have never even killed a deer and here i have see opinion,quoting.citing the rule of completeness set forth in federal rule of evidence,gasser argued that basham deer statement should not be admitted in isolation,considering that basham had on numerous occasions indicated that fulks was the killer.id.at.the court concluded that gasser reliance on the rule of completeness during debate over an evidentiary issue does not,by any means,require a finding that at the fulks trial the government adopted basham statement that fulks was the killer.id.as to agent long,the court noted that his report which was consistent with his grand jury testimony was not introduced as an exhibit at basham trial and merely memorialized basham statement during the investigation.id.at.long statements,the court determined,in no way reveal an inconsistent position or false testimony employed by the government.id.the court thus found that the prosecution had not presented false testimony and denied basham claim.
the district court returned to this claim in denying basham motion to amend or alter judgment.with respect to ausa gasser argument during fulks trial,the court found that the prosecution did not vouch for the accuracy of basham statement,and that the government did not advance an argument to the court or to the jury that basham was the one who used the strap to strangle donovan.see reconsideration order.similarly,although the prosecution presented long testimony to the grand jury,the court found that the government did not in any way adopt long statement that fulks strangled donovan as its theory of the case regarding who actually strangled donovan.id.further,the court observed that basham offered no evidence that sheriff hewett testimony was perjured,compelling the court determination that basham had not demonstrated that hewett gave false testimony.id.at.having found that basham had failed to satisfy the threshold requirement to show that the testimony of which he complains was false,the court determined that no further analysis is required.id.at.
on appeal,basham maintains that he has satisfied his burden of establishing his prosecutorial misconduct claim because,prior to hewett testimony at basham trial,the government understanding from all sources was that basham told hewett that fulks wielded the strap.see br.of appellant.therefore,according to basham,the prosecution engaged in misconduct when it not only failed to investigate and correct hewett actual killer suggestion,but seized upon that testimony in closing arguments to bolster its case in both guilt and penalty phases.id.at.
to succeed on his prosecutorial misconduct claim,basham must show that the district court finding that no false testimony was presented is clearly erroneous.see rosencrantz lafler,cir applying clear error review to district court finding that government knowingly used false testimony pyles johnson,cir same united states boyd,cir same.our task,therefore,is to assess whether the entire evidence creates the definite and firm conviction that a mistake was committed.easley cromartie,internal quotation marks omitted.thus,i f the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record,we may not reverse that finding even if we would have weighed the evidence differently.anderson city of bessemer city.
basham does not suggest that hewett committed perjury,and he therefore must demonstrate that the record compels the conclusion that hewett actual killer suggestion create d a false impression of facts which are known not to be true.united states bartko,cir internal quotation marks omitted.implicitly,basham argues as he must that it was fulks who strangled donovan.but while basham relies on isolated snippets of the record to establish that point,a fuller reading clarifies the uncertainty regarding the identity of donovan killer.for example,a complete reading of long report shows that his statement that fulks strangled donovan derived from littlejohn hypothetical statements,which the government successfully moved to suppress.see.in the grand jury proceedings,long testified not only that basham had blamed fulks for actually killing donovan,but that fulks had blamed basham.id.at.similarly,ausa gasser statements during the evidentiary dispute in fulks trial were not made for the truth of the matter.gasser was simply arguing that basham made both inculpatory and exculpatory statements during the thanksgiving search,and fulks should not be permitted to admit only the favorable statements into evidence.
basham suggests that hewett actual killer suggestion was false because at fulks trial,the prosecution took the position that fulks not basham had strangled donovan.in addressing fulks motion,we considered a similar argument.see fulks,f d at.fulks contended that the prosecutors had violated his due process rights by pursuing mutually inconsistent theories against basham and fulks,and referenced many of the same statements that basham now highlights.we rejected fulks claim because,v iewed in the context of the entirety of both proceedings,the government core theory was that fulks and basham were equally culpable in donovan murder and similarly deserving of the death penalty,regardless of which one physically ended her life.id.at.our reasoning in fulks applies to basham claim here.the government consistent position has remained that basham and fulks shared responsibility for donovan death.
in all,basham has not shown that the district court clearly erred in finding that the prosecution did not present false testimony at his trial.that finding is plausible based on the entire record,and therefore must be affirmed.as the supreme court has recognized,t he trial judge major role is the determination of fact,and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise.anderson,at.as such,basham can not satisfy the first element of his prosecutorial misconduct claim,and we affirm the court ruling 
basham presents a separate ineffective assistance claim that is based on his lawyers failure to raise the misconduct claim on direct appeal.the district court denied that claim in conjunction with its determination that basham had not shown sufficient cause to excuse his procedural default.we affirm the court ruling on this ineffective assistance claim,in that the underlying misconduct claim is plainly without merit.see cooks ward,cir concluding that appellate counsel can not be said to have been ineffective for failing to raise claim on direct appeal where claim determined on collateral attack to lack merit see also united states mchan,cir observing that we are,of course,entitled to affirm on any ground appearing in the record,including theories not relied upon or rejected by the district court alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
basham also maintains that he was tried and convicted while being legally incompetent,and that his lawyers were constitutionally ineffective by failing to raise the competency issue to the district court during trial.his arguments focus on two specific days september and october.
the due process clause of the fifth amendment prohibits the federal government from trying and convicting a mentally incompetent defendant.see pate robinson.the test for determining competency in a federal court is whether the defendant has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and whether he has a rational as well as a factual understanding of the proceedings against him.dusky united states,per curiam.a movant can pursue either substantive or procedural claims on collateral attack.in a substantive competency claim,the movant asserts that he was,in fact,tried and convicted while mentally incompetent.in a procedural claim,on the other hand,the movant contends that the trial court failed to properly ensure that the accused was competent to stand trial,as required by.see beck angelone,cir.in pursuing a substantive competency claim,such as basham raises in his motion,the movant is presumed to have been competent during his trial.see burket angelone,cir.in that situation,the movant bears the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he was incompetent.see united states robinson,cir 
in its opinion,the district court found that basham was legally competent throughout his trial,including during the specific challenged incidents on september and october.as explained below,the court findings are not clearly erroneous,and its denial of basham claims must be affirmed 
basham first maintains that he was incompetent during an incident that occurred on monday,september,while the trial was in its guilt phase.following the lunch break that afternoon,before the jury returned to the courtroom,the district court informed basham that he could not use tobacco,referred to here as dip,during the trial proceedings because the court was informed that basham had previously thrown bodily fluids at deputy marshals.basham then requested to return downstairs to his holding cell,saying i do feel good.see.of note,basham had made previous requests not to attend trial,which the court had declined.the court similarly denied basham request of september,ruled that the trial would proceed,and instructed basham to sit down.basham refused to take his seat,however,and became agitated.soon,a tussle ensued in the courtroom between basham and the marshals,which lasted approximately eight minutes.id.at.six deputies sought to subdue basham,but eight were ultimately required.basham and the deputies maintained a dialogue during the tussle,with basham cursing the officers,suggesting that one of them had lied in telling the court that he had thrown bodily fluids.basham then told the court,prior to being escorted from the courtroom,judge,if i was going to spit,as mad as i am now,i would be spitting now.they just made that up.id.at.
basham was then removed to his holding cell,and his lawyers requested a delay in the trial proceedings so that a psychiatrist could assess his competency.the district court granted that request,and basham was evaluated that afternoon by forensic psychiatrist donna schwartz watts.later that day,watts testified that i t is my opinion right now that because of his mental defect that basham ca assist his attorneys.watts stated that basham mental state fluctuates,and opined that his competency would similarly fluctuate.id.the court then adjourned the trial for the balance of that day.
basham asserts in his motion that he was not competent to stand trial during his scuffle with the deputy marshals.although the events of september,occurred outside the jury presence,the video and audio of the tussle were admitted into evidence during the trial penalty phase on behalf of the prosecution to show future dangerousness.
the district court denied basham competency claim as to september,finding that he had not satisfied his burden,by a preponderance of the evidence,of showing that he was incompetent during the courtroom scuffle.in so ruling,the court recognized that certain evidence supported basham argument that he had been incompetent.for example,immediately following the scuffle,defense attorney harris questioned basham competence and observed that he l ooked like someone who did have the ability to control the simple function of sitting down in a seat.see.similarly,watts opined that,based on her examination of basham following the scuffle,he was not competent.see id.at.
on the other hand,the district court deemed watts testimony unclear as to whether she believed basham was incompetent at the time of the altercation or whether she believed that he got worked up from the altercation and was incompetent as a result.see opinion.the prosecutors also offered evidence that basham had advised a deputy shortly before the incident that he would be coming back down to his holding cell from the courtroom,possibly indicating that basham may have planned to act out in court.id.at quoting.additionally,the court related that basham made statements during the scuffle,prior to being taken from the courtroom,showing that he apparently had the presence of mind to make a argument as to why he should have been allowed dip,even as he was being escorted out of the courtroom.id.assessing all of the evidence,the court found that basham was not incompetent during the september scuffle,and thus his constitutional rights were not violated when the government later showed both videotape and audiotape of the altercation to the jury.id.
basham maintains on appeal that the district court ruling was clearly erroneous because the court misconstrued basham statements prior to and during the september scuffle,and because the court should have accorded greater weight to the opinions of watts and lawyer harris.we disagree,as the record amply supports the court findings.see anderson,at where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.basham statement prior to the scuffle that he would soon be returning to his holding cell supports a finding that he intended to act up in the courtroom,in that the court had previously denied basham requests not to attend his trial.in light of that history,it is reasonable to infer that basham would have known that he would not be permitted to return to his holding cell absent exigent circumstances.basham statements to the court during the scuffle also support the court competency finding,because they show that basham thinking was and motivated.his behavior might have been bizarre,volatile,or irrational,but that does not necessarily render a defendant incompetent.see robinson,at burket,at see also united states lebron,cir i rrational and outrageous behavior in the courtroom may be uncontrolled,manipulative,or even theatrical.it is not determinative of competency.
moreover,the evidence upon which basham relies does not mandate a finding that he was incompetent during the september scuffle.for example,watts testimony that basham was incompetent when she examined him after the scuffle did not have to be accepted even if unimpeached.see maggio fulford.indeed,watts opinion was limited to basham competency when she met with him following the scuffle.although basham suggests that it defies reason that he might have been competent during the scuffle and then incompetent a short while later,see reply br,watts testified that basham mental state and competence fluctuate d,see.similarly,harris testimony does not mandate a finding that basham was incompetent.indeed,swerling testified to the contrary at the hearing,stating that basham was not incompetent during the scuffle.see id.at.
in sum,the district court did not clearly err in finding that basham was competent during the september scuffle.as a result,basham rights were not violated when the video and audio recordings of the scuffle were shown to the jury during the penalty phase.
next,basham asserts that he was also incompetent on tuesday,october,during the trial penalty phase.that morning,before the jury was brought into the courtroom,harris informed the district court that basham is in a very agitated state this morning,because he had not received one of his medications due to an error at the detention center where he was housed overnight.see.the court then granted basham request to delay the trial until the afternoon,so that he could receive the missed dose of medication and allow for the medication to take effect.when the court reconvened that afternoon,however,harris expressed concern that basham is not going to be able to sit in the courtroom and pay attention to the testimony,remain silent.and i am concerned that this jury will not look favorably upon the way he is appearing to me to be acting this afternoon.id.at.the prosecution took the position that the trial should proceed,arguing that the defense lawyers had not contacted watts to evaluate basham that morning,and contending that,if it is a medical problem,she should be here to testify about it.id.at.the following exchange then occurred 
the court harris,i have tried to bend over backwards to do everything possible to keep basham on an even keel and a good frame of mind,and especially so that he wo show out in front of the jury.but the jury is really worn out.they have sent signals indirectly to me.they really want to see this case move along.i think there is a danger to be balanced against what you say.these continued delays are going to be held against basham,i think.i think the jury will figure out that it is basham that is causing these delays.so,i think i have got to weigh in the balance of that aspect of it,versus the danger of going forward with him appearing to be a little bit disheveled over there.
harris judge,i agree with all of those things.those are dangers that we had weighed.and i will point out that as i am addressing the court right now,the record should reflect that my client is discussing over my shoulder,loud enough that i can hear,and certainly loud enough for the jury could sic hear,having discussions with swerling about the fact that he will be good.
id.at.despite harris concerns,the trial proceedings went forward that day.later that afternoon,basham counsel stated to the court that basham was slurring his words and appeared to be groggy and just out of it.id.at.
in his motion,basham claims that he was incompetent during the trial proceedings on the afternoon of october.the district court rejected that contention,finding a lack of evidence supporting basham assertion that he was incompetent.the court pointed out that basham lawyers had expressed concern about basham appearance,but offered no evidence going to competency.the record showed that basham appeared disheveled and sleepy,but those behaviors were consistent with his conduct throughout the trial.see opinion.the court further observed if there had been any indication that he was incompetent,the court would have sought the testimony of a doctor on basham competency,as this court did on other occasions.id.
we are satisfied that the district court finding that basham was competent during the proceedings on the afternoon of october is not clearly erroneous.in arguing that the record compels a finding that he was incompetent,basham relies on evidence that he was groggy and slurring his words.those factors,however,do not necessarily render a defendant incompetent to stand trial.see woods mcbride,cir t here is a big difference between the sort of temporary incompetence stemming from medication induced drowsiness during voir dire and the sort that would render the accused incapable of standing trial altogether.the finding that basham was competent is further supported by the court observations of basham both that day and throughout the trial.the record demonstrates that the court was sensitive to basham mental state throughout the trial proceedings,and made sustained efforts to ensure that his fair trial rights were protected.for example,during the morning of october,the court commented on the importance of ensuring that basham receive his prescribed medication so that he could participate in his defense,anticipating that if the defendant receives the death penalty,there will be a action challenging his competency.see.given the court commendable motivation to ensure basham competency,its decision to proceed with trial on the afternoon of october supports a finding that basham was competent.see united states moussaoui,cir noting that trial court interactions and experience with defendant over several years of proceedings was compelling factor supporting conclusion that defendant was competent.the court finding that basham was competent during the afternoon of october is thus well supported by the record.the court denial of basham substantive competency claim must therefore be affirmed.
basham also argues that his defense lawyers were constitutionally ineffective with respect to his september and october,instances of alleged incompetency.more specifically,with respect to the september scuffle,basham contends that his lawyers acted deficiently not on that day but when they failed to object on competency grounds to the admission of the video and audio footage during the penalty phase.as to the events of october,basham maintains that his lawyers were constitutionally ineffective by failing to contact watts and request that she examine basham competency before the trial proceedings could be resumed.
the foregoing contentions against the defense attorneys lack merit because basham can not satisfy strickland prejudice requirement,which requires that he show counsel errors were so serious as to deprive him of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.strickland,at.put simply,basham was competent during the september and october incidents,foreclosing any suggestion that his trial was rendered unfair by his lawyers decisions during those incidents.see walton angelone,cir ruling that,under strickland,accused was not prejudiced by counsel failure to raise competency issue where record showed defendant had been competent beck angelone,cir same.
basham next claims that his defense lawyers were constitutionally ineffective with regard to the evidence presented during the trial guilt phase about the crimes committed against samantha burns the burns evidence the prosecution notified the defense during a pretrial hearing held on august,of its intention to use the burns evidence during the guilt phase.the prosecution position was that the burns evidence was intrinsic to the crimes on trial,in that basham and fulks crime spree constituted a single criminal episode.basham lawyers swerling and harris raised no objections to the admissibility of the burns evidence during the pretrial hearings,though swerling preserved the right to later object.
the basham defense,however,did not file a motion in limine with respect to the burns evidence as it was presented during the guilt phase.swerling and harris also declined the district court offer to give the jury a cautionary instruction under federal rule of evidence b with respect to that testimony.at the charge conference in the guilt phase,the court again inquired whether the jury should receive an instruction limiting the purposes for which evidence of other acts such as the burns evidence could be considered.swerling objected to such an instruction,and alternatively requested that the court proposed instruction be modified to permit the jury to consider the evidence of other acts to either prove or disprove pertinent facts.see the court overruled that objection,but incorporated the modification proposed by swerling.the burns evidence was not presented to the jury during the sentencing phase.
on direct appeal,basham argued that the prosecution had impermissibly used the burns evidence in its closing argument in the guilt phase to show propensity,contravening rule b.we found no plain error,concluding that the government had tied the burns evidence entirely to a discussion of basham intent,and therefore did not run afoul of rule b.see basham,at.
basham took a different tack on the burns evidence in his motion,maintaining that swerling and harris were constitutionally ineffective by not attempting to limit the scope and extent thereof.the district court rejected that claim.first,the court recognized that the record is unclear as to whether the burns evidence was admitted as being intrinsic to the crimes charged,or was admitted for one of the purposes allowed under rule b.see opinion.the court then relied on our decision rejecting basham direct appeal as foreclosing any challenge that the burns evidence was admissible to show intent.id.at.additionally,given that basham primary,if not sole,defense in this case was that at the time he and fulks kidnapped alive donovan,he basham did not have the requisite intent,the burns evidence was relevant to show intent.id.the court deemed the burns evidence as probative to showing that burns had not voluntarily disappeared.nonetheless,the court found that one piece of the burns evidence constituted impermissible victim impact testimony.id.at.specifically,burns mother testified that burns would never be able to move into the family new home.the court then reasoned,however,that any error with respect to that statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.
in response to basham motion to alter or amend judgment,the district court clarified that basham claim with respect to the burns evidence failed on both prongs of strickland.first,the court determined that basham lawyers did not perform deficiently because their decisions on how to handle the burns evidence were strategic.predicated on the testimony of swerling and harris at the hearing,the court found that they had both concluded that the jury would probably find basham guilty,thereby necessitating a penalty phase.see reconsideration order.counsel therefore adopted the recognized practice of the emotionally charged burns evidence into the guilt phase,so that it would not be fresh in the minds of the jury as they deliberated on basham sentence.id.at.second,the court reasoned that the deficiencies alleged did not prejudice basham because the burns evidence would have been admitted even if his lawyers had mounted the challenges he now maintains were required.id.at.to that end,the court noted that any objection to the admissibility of the burns evidence would have been overruled.id.at.
we agree that basham claim fails strickland scrutiny because he has not shown that his defense lawyers performed deficiently.basham urges that competent counsel would have pursued a number of avenues to exclude or limit the burns evidence,such as arguing that the evidence was not intrinsic,was unfairly prejudicial,or was needlessly cumulative.to succeed on this ineffective assistance claim,of course,basham must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,his lawyers handling of the burns evidence might be considered sound trial strategy.see strickland,at quoting michel louisiana.
swerling and harris each testified during the hearing that,as they prepared for trial,they believed basham would be convicted of the charged offenses.their overarching goal was to save basham life and avoid a death sentence.in line with that goal,as swerling explained,the defense chose to certain evidence into the trial guilt phase.the lawyers purposely let a lot of evidence come in in the guilt or innocence phase in order to desensitize the jury to what we knew was going to be coming in the penalty phase of the trial.see see also humphries ozmint,cir i t is well established that failure to object to inadmissible or objectionable material for tactical reasons can constitute objectively reasonable trial strategy under strickland.
to rebut swerling testimony about trial strategy,basham points out that swerling made no mention of a strategy at the hearing until he returned from a lunch break.even then,basham notes,swerling testified that he probably employed that strategy.see br.of appellant quoting.the district court credited swerling explanation,however,and the credibility determination warrants our deference.see united states abu ali,cir we particularly defer to a district court credibility determinations,for it is the role of the district court to observe witnesses and weigh their credibility.internal quotation marks omitted.
basham position that his lawyers acted unreasonably by not challenging the burns evidence under rule overlooks the probative value of that testimony.see.the court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,misleading the jury,undue
