jimmy evans seeks federal habeas relief under,asserting that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his massachusetts state trial for murder.he also challenges the constitutionality of limitations imposed by d,as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.evans argues that the revised statute violates article iii,the separation of powers,and the supremacy clause of the constitution because it restricts the capacity of federal judges to reach independent decisions and limits the sources of law on which they may rely he also argues that aedpa so narrows the availability of habeas relief for state prisoners as to effectively suspend habeas in violation of the suspension clause.
similar constitutional challenges to the aedpa amendments have been rejected by majority opinions in the fourth,seventh,and ninth circuits,at times over spirited dissents.crater galaza,cir,reh g and reh g en banc denied,cir green french,cir,abrogated in part by williams taylor,d lindh murphy,cir en banc,rev on other grounds,d.we also reject evans constitutional arguments,and we affirm the district court denial of his habeas petition.
the facts underlying this case have been described at greater length by the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc,commonwealth evans,and the district court,evans thompson,d,as well as by this court in reviewing a habeas petition brought by evans brother and,evans verdini,cir.we briefly summarize the facts as described by the sjc.see e in federal habeas proceedings,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.
in the early morning of january,lyle jackson was shot three times inside a small and crowded fast food restaurant,walaikum,in dorchester,massachusetts.petitioner evans,his brother john,and their friends robert brown and ronald tinsley had arrived at walaikum shortly before the shooting.they had previously been at a nightclub,where john had fired a gun at a group of people in the presence of jackson and his friend.according to eyewitnesses at walaikum,brown identified jackson to evans,who then pulled out a silver handgun with a black handle.jackson backed away,falling over some tables and chairs and crawling into a corner,where he begged evans for his life.evans shot at him multiple times.john,who also had a gun,then fired a shot at jackson.evans,john,brown,and tinsley fled the scene in a gold lexus automobile.in the police chase that ensued,two guns were thrown out of the car and were later retrieved by the police.the four men were apprehended after they abandoned the car and tried to flee on foot.evans,at.
shell casings from both guns were recovered at the crime scene,both inside and outside walaikum.there was no gun powder residue on jackson clothes,suggesting that he had been shot from a distance of at least three feet.id.a bloody bullet fragment found inside walaikum was linked to the handgun.id.at.the police were unable to identify any fingerprints off either gun.id.at.
jackson died from his wounds.the four men were indicted and tried together on a theory of murder by joint venture.evans and his brother john were both found guilty,while brown and tinsley were acquitted.id.at.evans moved for a new trial as well as for funds to conduct forensic investigations.his motions were denied,and his appeal of that denial was consolidated with his direct appeal to the sjc.the sjc affirmed his conviction and upheld the denial of his motions.id.at.the supreme court denied his petition for writ of certiorari.evans massachusetts,d.
evans then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the district of massachusetts,challenging the constitutionality of as amended by aedpa and asserting,inter alia,that his counsel provided ineffective assistance when he failed to conduct independent forensic investigations.the district court denied his petition.evans,d at.after the court granted evans a certificate of appealability on both issues,he timely appealed.
the statute at issue,d,as amended by aedpa,provides that 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
petitioner arguments are based not so much on the statutory text of d as on the supreme court binding interpretation of that text in williams taylor as to the meaning of three key terms in the statute clearly established,contrary to,and unreasonable application.as interpreted by the supreme court,clearly established law refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.williams,at.a state court decision is contrary to that clearly established law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.id.at.a state court decision is an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent if it identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.it is not enough that a state court decision erroneously apply clearly established law its application must be not only wrong,but unreasonably so.id.at.
evans constitutional arguments fall into three general categories that by prohibiting the granting of habeas relief unless a state court decision was not merely wrong but was also an unreasonable application of federal law,d violates article iii,the separation of powers,and the supremacy clause that by limiting judges to federal law as clearly established by the supreme court,d unconstitutionally constrains independent judicial decisionmaking,violating article iii and the separation of powers and that d,as amended,so restricts the granting of federal habeas relief for state prisoners as to effectively suspend habeas in violation of the suspension clause.we consider each argument in turn,and begin with some fundamental principles about the constitutional structure of our government.
first,the constitution recognizes that state court judges may interpret the constitution and binds them to compliance with the constitution,notwithstanding contrary state law.const.art.vi,cl.this constitution,and the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.the constitution does not displace state judicial systems,nor does it subject state judicial decisions to direct review by the lower federal courts.rather,from the beginning we have had in this country two essentially separate legal systems.each system proceeds independently of the other with ultimate review in the supreme court of the federal questions raised in either system.atl.coast line of locomotive eng rs,d emphasis added.under this dual system,federal and state courts are equally bound to guard and protect rights secured by the constitution.rose lundy,d alteration in original quoting ex parte royall.congress expects such fealty from the state courts,and the constitution requires it.
based on this expectation,congress did not grant federal question jurisdiction to the lower federal courts for roughly the first century of our country history,instead counting on the state courts to handle such cases when the parties were not diverse.see judiciary act of march,stat.granting general federal question jurisdiction to lower federal courts.nor did congress extend the writ of habeas corpus to all persons in state custody in violation of the constitution,or of any treaty or law of the united states until.act of,stat.see also felker turpin,d.
the writ of habeas corpus does not empower lower federal courts to conduct direct review on appeal from state criminal convictions that authority is reserved for the supreme court.court of appeals feldman,d atl.coast line,at.petitioner here has already received a full trial,appeal,and collateral review before a state court bound by the constitution,and he has exercised his option to seek direct review before the supreme court of his state court conviction.the interests of comity and finality must be considered in determining the proper scope of habeas review.teague lane,d.
we note a second preliminary principle.while the authority of the federal courts comes from article iii of the constitution,the existence of the lower federal courts,including this court,and the extent of our jurisdiction depend entirely on statutory grants from congress,unlike the supreme court.const.art.iii,the judicial power of the united states,shall be vested in one supreme court,and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish.the supreme court has often explained that 
t he judicial power of the united states,although it has its origin in the constitution,is except in enumerated instances,applicable exclusively to the supreme court dependent for its distribution and organization,and for the modes of its exercise,entirely upon the action of congress,who possess the sole power of creating the tribunals inferior to the supreme court for the exercise of judicial power and of withholding jurisdiction from them in the exact degrees and character which to congress may seem proper for the public good.
cary curtis,how.more recently,the court has reiterated 
the decision with respect to inferior federal courts,as well as the task of defining their jurisdiction,was left to the discretion of congress.that body was not constitutionally required to create inferior art.iii courts to hear and decide cases within the judicial power n or,if inferior courts were created,was it required to invest them with all the jurisdiction it was authorized to bestow under art.iii.
palmore united states,d.adherence to this principle has been constant.see,kline burke constr.only the jurisdiction of the supreme court is derived directly from the constitution.every other court created by the general government derives its jurisdiction wholly from the authority of congress.sheldon sill,how.congress,having the power to establish the courts,must define their respective jurisdictions courts created by statute can have no jurisdiction but such as the statute confers.as such,congress has great leeway to expand or restrict the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts.
we take up first evans challenge to d restriction of federal habeas relief to instances where state courts have unreasonably applied supreme court precedent.as a practical matter,this challenge refers to a very small category of decisions.it does not include cases in which the state court failed to address the petitioner constitutional claim in those cases,the federal courts consider the claim de novo.fortini murphy,cir.nor does it include cases where the state courts were obviously wrong or obviously right in applying supreme court precedent.the question only arises where a federal court,in its independent review,finds the state court application of supreme court precedent to be erroneous but not to be unreasonable.mccambridge hall,cir en banc.
despite petitioner depiction to the contrary,the gap between erroneous state court decisions and unreasonable ones is narrow.at least four justices agree that it will be the rare case that will fall into this gap.see williams,at.opinion of stevens.as the statutory language is applied in this circuit,the increment for an erroneous decision to be unreasonable need not necessarily be great.mccambridge,at see also francis stone,cir same.it is not necessary,for example,for a state court decision to be so far off the mark as to suggest judicial incompetence before relief can be granted.francis,at quoting matteo superintendent,cir internal quotation marks omitted.rather,a case will fall into this narrow gap precluding relief only when it is a close question whether the state decision is in error.mccambridge,at emphasis added see also jackson coalter,cir.there is no need for there to be a supreme court case on all fours for a state decision to be unreasonable.white coplan,cir.it is enough if the supreme court general principles can be discerned and if,respectfully but with confidence,the federal court concludes that the state court unreasonably applied federal law.see also ouber guarino,cir affirming grant of habeas relief where state court decision was an unreasonable application of federal law 
still,there will be cases which are in that gap where relief will be denied.this is where the state court decision about a criminal defendant is in constitutional error and a the supreme court has not corrected the error on direct review and b the lower federal courts are precluded from granting relief because any error was not an unreasonable one.first,it is worth emphasizing that even though a state court may have made a constitutional error,that does not mean the defendant is actually innocent of the crime of conviction.the usual remedy on successful habeas petitions is a new trial in the state court,if the state wishes to continue to prosecute.see,foxworth maloney,wl,at cir,dugas coplan,cir henderson frank,cir bowen maynard,cir.sometimes double jeopardy principles mean the habeas petitioner is simply released,as is done when the evidence of guilt is insufficient.foxworth,at,wl,at fagan washington,cir burks united states,d double jeopardy attaches when conviction overturned on direct review due to insufficient evidence.but see lockhart nelson,d recognizing that burks is a narrow exception to the general rule that the government can retry a defendant who succeeds in getting his first conviction set aside.
second,the cases that fall into this gap are cases involving close questions,mccambridge,at,where the issue is painted in shades of grey,rather than in contrasting colors of right or wrong,lindh,at.it does not violate the constitution for the lower federal courts to lack power to grant relief from state court decisions involving such questions 
only the supreme court can finally answer those questions.the judgment of the court of last resort is correct by definition scheidegger,habeas corpus,relitigation,and the legislative power,colum,citing brown allen.jackson,concurring in the result.state courts are not bound by the dictates of the lower federal courts,although they are free to rely on the opinions of such courts when adjudicating federal claims.see lockhart fretwell,d thomas,concurring the supremacy clause demands that state law yield to federal law,but neither federal supremacy nor any other principle of federal law requires that a state court interpretation of federal law give way to a lower federal court interpretation.therefore,a lower federal court application of supreme court precedent is not inherently any more right or correct than that of state courts see,caspari bohlen,d considering both federal appellate and state court resolutions of a constitutional question.the constitution is not offended when lower federal courts are prevented from substituting for that of a state court their judgment as to reasonable application of supreme court precedent 
evans argues that federal courts,having once been empowered under previous statutes allowing collateral relief to review such questions without the reasonableness limitation,may not constitutionally be forbidden from granting relief when they disagree with the state court resolution of a legal issue.as evans acknowledges,congress can shape the contours of federal jurisdiction to except from that jurisdiction very specific types of claims.see,lauf shinner.upholding the constitutionality of the act,which prohibited federal courts from enjoining most union activities arising out of labor disputes.he nonetheless argues that once congress vests the federal courts with jurisdiction to hear a class of cases,it must not limit the discretion of judges to resolve those cases however
