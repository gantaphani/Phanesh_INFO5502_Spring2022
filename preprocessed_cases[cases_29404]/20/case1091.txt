ignacio gomez,a mexican citizen,confessed that he shot and killed three teenagers in texas.he was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.after the texas court of criminal appeals cca affirmed and denied his state application for writ of habeas corpus,he petitioned for federal habeas relief.the district court denied his petition,and he applied to this court for a certificate of appealability coa on the ground,inter alia,that he was unconstitutionally deprived of his rights under the vienna convention on consular relations,the vienna convention,as recognized by a decision of the international court of justice icj.
we granted gomez motion to stay consideration of his coa application pending exhaustion of remedies in state court.in ex parte cardenas,wl,at,per curiam,the court dismissed gomez second state habeas petition,citing ex parte medellin.the supreme court affirmed the cca decision in medellin,holding that although the icj decision regarding the vienna convention created an international obligation,it is without direct domestic effect.medellin texas,d.
that new supreme court decision,in conjunction with oregon,d which held that the vienna convention does not require that evidence obtained in violation of the convention be fatal to gomez argument that a coa should be granted.because no reasonable jurists would find the district court assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong,cockrell,d internal citations and quotations omitted,as to gomez vienna convention claim or his other arguments,we deny a coa.
gomez,a lawful united states resident alien and citizen of mexico,lived outside el paso with members of his extended family.in november,john greer hosted a bonfire at his home,about one block away from the gomez property.greer was at the party with his son jessie and some of jessie teenage friends,including matthew and michael meredity,who were twins,and toby hathaway,an.
for reasons that are not obvious,one of gomez brothers,roberto,and gomez,joel guillen,engaged in a minor scuffle with a guest at the party.later that evening,someone broke a couple of windows at gomez mother home.the next day,according to his confession,gomez mother told gomez about the vandalism and how it frightened her,and he became upset.he wrapped a loaded handgun in a white,hid it in his chevy blazer,and began scouring the neighborhood cruising around,in his the vandals.gomez came across roberto,guillen,and another of gomez brothers,jose luis,all of whom joined gomez in the blazer.
according to guillen testimony at trial,the meredith twins and hathaway were walking along a dirt road.roberto saw and identified them as the guys that broke the windows.the vehicle stopped.jose luis,roberto,and guillen each attacked one of the teenagers.no weapons were used in the fighting,and gomez at first just watched but,about a minute later,started shooting,hitting one of the teenagers in the head.he continued to fire,hitting another the third ran.
gomez returned to the blazer and reloaded.he ordered guillen to capture the escaping teenager,but guillen refused.jose luis did not,and he forced the last victim back to gomez,who proceeded to execute him.in all,about a dozen shots were fired.guillen and roberto,frightened,ran away.when they returned,they saw gomez and jose luis loading the bodies into the back of the blazer,with gomez still holding the gun.he ordered guillen and roberto to help load the bodies.
guillen also testified that gomez and his cohorts drove into the desert and dropped the bodies onto the ground.gomez thought one of the victims was still alive and proceeded to kick him six times in the face.gomez stripped his victims,went home,and burned their clothes.he concealed the in a chicken coop and took shovels back into the desert,where he,jose luis,and guillen dug a shallow grave,buried the bodies,and covered the area with a bush.
when the teenagers did not come home by curfew,their mothers became worried and tried to find them.eventually michael baseball cap was spotted next to two live rounds and some blood.the family called the police.while officers were at the scene,roberto and guillen arrived at the police station,confessed all the information they had,and showed where the bodies were buried.
gomez was arrested and given a miranda warning,his vehicle was impounded,and he was taken to the police station,where he was given another miranda warning.he then confessed and told where the murder weapon was hidden.he also consented to a search of his house and vehicle.
gomez acknowledged that he was upset about what had happened to his mother and that when he was close about six feet from the person that roberto said had broken the windows,he discharged one round from his cal.handgun,hitting him in the forehead.he confessed to shooting the other two teenagers and said that,after they were down,he continued discharging the rest of the rounds at the three bodies,then reloaded his gun with six more rounds and fired them at the three bodies.he recounted how,after the initial gunshots,he made the last guy he killed sit next to his friends,the victims,at which time he shot him i n the head,then shot him some more.he said he just went out of control over his mother broken windows and her just getting scared.
the autopsy indicated that toby was shot four times,including one bullet to the head.michael was shot once,also in the head.matthew was shot six times,including a shot to the forehead,with another discharge to his face.at trial,various experts testified to evidence that corroborated gomez confession,such as whether the found on his property could fire caliber ammunition,which he said he had used,and whether gomez was the weapon that killed two of the victims.the evidence was inconclusive as to whether the gun fired the lone bullet that killed michael.
at sentencing,the government presented evidence that gomez was a dangerous law breaker,that he had physically resisted arrest in the past,that he had been convicted three times for driving while intoxicated,that he had been arrested for unlawfully carrying a weapon,and that he had once tried to run someone down with a truck.gomez offered some mitigating evidence involving his mettle as a father and his participation in community projects.the state argued that the brutality of the slayings justified the death penalty and that even gomez witnesses showed that he was dangerous.gomez was sentenced to death in june.
before trial,gomez filed a motion to suppress his confession and the fruits of the search of his home on the ground that he had not been advised of his rights under the vienna convention.specifically,he argued that the police should have told him of his right to the assistance of a mexican consul.evidence was presented that the officer who took his confession knew that gomez was a resident alien but did not advise him of his vienna convention rights,allegedly because he believed the rights do not apply to resident aliens.the trial court denied the motion.
gomez capital murder conviction was automatically appealed to the cca,where gomez argued that the failure to suppress violated both texas law and the supremacy clause of the united states constitution.the cca affirmed in september.gomez state.
gomez filed a state habeas petition that the cca denied in june.in federal court,he petitioned for habeas relief,arguing,inter alia,that his constitutional rights had been violated because of the denial of his vienna convention privileges.the district court ruled in late september that gomez vienna convention claims were unexhausted,because his briefing to the state court was perfunctory and because he did not reargue his claim to the state court on a motion for rehearing.
gomez applied to this court for a coa,arguing both that his claim was exhausted and that,in any event,there was no independent and adequate state ground,lee kemna,d,precluding the federal courts from considering his argument,because vienna convention claims like his present an exceptional case in which exorbitant application of a generally sound rule renders the state ground inadequate to stop consideration of a federal question.id.at.
before we ruled on the coa application,gomez moved this court to stay consideration of his coa application so that he could pursue his claim further in state court.we granted the motion in august.in march,the cca,in cardenas,denied gomez petition.in june,we advised the attorneys that we were putting this appeal on hold pending a decision by the supreme court in medellin.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,a petitioner must secure a coa to appeal the federal district court denial of habeas relief,and a coa will be granted only if the petitioner makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c.to apply this standard,we conduct a threshold inquiry and must issue a coa if reasonable jurists would find the district court assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong,at.internal citations and quotations omitted.a claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree,after the coa has been granted and the case has received full consideration,that petitioner will not prevail.id.at.nevertheless,issuance of a coa must not be pro forma or a matter of course,and a prisoner seeking a coa must prove something more than the absence of frivolity.id.at.quoting barefoot estelle,d.in death penalty cases,any doubts as to whether the coa should issue are resolved in favor of the petitioner.see lamb johnson,cir.
in a habeas corpus appeal,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and review its conclusions of law de novo,applying the same standard of review to the state court decision as the district court.thompson cain,cir.we do not grant relief on any claim adjudicated on the merits by a state court unless the state decision was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court,or if the state court determination of facts was unreasonable in light of the evidence.id.citing d.a state court decision is contrary to established federal law,where it applies a rule that contradicts governing law set forth in supreme court precedent or if it confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from precedent.williams taylor,d.moreover,a decision that correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case certainly would qualify as a decision involv ing an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.id.at.
the vienna convention,drafted in,was ratified by the united states in.at.article of the convention concerns consular officers access to their nationals detained by authorities in a foreign country,requiring that if the detained national so requests,the competent authorities of the receiving state shall,without delay,inform the consular post of the sending state if,within its consular district,a national of that state is arrested or committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any other manner.id.at quoting vienna convention,b.article b states that t he said authorities shall inform the person concerned,the detainee without delay of his rights under this.id.quoting vienna convention,b.
the united states also ratified the optional protocol concerning the compulsory settlement of disputes,optional protocol,which places the resolution of disputes arising out of the vienna convention within the icj compulsory jurisdiction.id in,the icj ruled that,based on violations of the vienna convention,named mexican nationals were entitled to review and reconsideration of their convictions and sentences in the united states.medellin.at citing case concerning avena other mexican nationals mex,judgment of,avena.the icj decision purported to apply regardless of any gomez was one of those listed mexican nationals.
also in,after avena was decided,we denied a coa in medellin dretke,cir,holding that notwithstanding the icj decision,the doctrine of procedural default applied and that,in any event,article of the vienna convention does not create an individually enforceable right.the supreme court granted certiorari.medellin dretke,d.the president,however,then decided,in a memorandum to the attorney general president memorandum,that the nation would comply with avena.relying on avena and the memorandum,the petitioner in medellin again filed a state petition.the court dismissed the writ as improvidently granted.medellin dretke,d per curiam.
before the cca could rule again in medellin,however,the court in decided,a case raising issues similar to those in medellin.in,the questions were whether the vienna convention requires the suppression of evidence and whether alleged violations of the vienna convention are subject to procedural default.the petitioners in were not named in the avena ruling,but was decided after the icj decision.
chief justice roberts,for the court.at,wrote that,even assuming the vienna convention creates judicially enforceable rights,the suppression of evidence is not an appropriate remedy for a violation of article the court noted that t he exclusionary rule as we know it is an entirely american legal creation and is not accepted elsewhere,so i t is implausible that other signatories to the convention thought it to require a remedy that nearly all refuse to recognize as a matter of domestic law.id.at.under our domestic law,the exclusionary rule is not a remedy we apply lightly,id.at,and it does not apply to violations of the vienna convention,because,inter alia,t he violation of the right to consular notification is at best remotely connected to the gathering of evidence,id.at article does not guarantee defendants any assistance at all from their consulates,and t he failure to inform a defendant of his article rights is unlikely,with any frequency,to produce unreliable confessions,id.consequently,the s uppression would be a vastly disproportionate remedy for an article violation.id.
the court,following breard greene,d,also held that rules apply to violations of article.the court acknowledged the contrary result reached by the icj on the same question but decided that though respectful consideration should be given to the icj interpretation,it does not compel united states courts to reconsider our understanding of the vienna convention in breard.at quoting breard,at.moreover,the court recognized that the icj role is to arbitrate particular disputes between national governments,and its decisions are quintessentially international in character.id.at.
later in,the cca again ruled in medellin,at,holding that the second petition constituted an abuse of the writ,that avena was not binding in domestic courts,and that the president memorandum,when construed as an executive order and not a mere friendly suggestion,violated separation of powers principles.certiorari was again granted.medellin texas,d.
the medellin court,with chief justice roberts once more wielding the pen,recognized that the avena decision constitutes an international law obligation on the part of the united states but that not all international law obligations automatically constitute binding federal law enforceable in united states courts.medellin.at.the court then held that the optional protocol,united nations charter,and icj statute do not create binding federal law in the absence of implementing legislation and that because it is uncontested that no such legislation exists,the avena judgment is not automatically binding domestic law.id.at.these agreements are not,and thus decisions as to judgments will be enforced lie with the political branches 
the medellin court then addressed what effect should be given to the president memorandum,which was an attempt by the executive branch to comply with avena.the court held that t he president has an array of political and diplomatic means available to enforce international obligations,but unilaterally converting a treaty into a one is not among them.id.at.instead,the power to satisfy international obligations stemming from treaties by means of domestic law belongs to congress in the same way as with any other law id.at.
with this supreme court guidance in mind,we deny a coa in regard to the asserted violations of the vienna convention no reasonable jurist could conclude,in light of the explicit pronouncements in medellin and,that gomez constitutional rights were violated when the texas court refused to suppress his confession.establishes the general proposition that violations of the vienna convention do not require the suppression of evidence,and medellin reinforces by holding that the general proposition applies even in the face of a contrary icj decision and presidential order.
these precedents apply with full force to gomez.as in,he argues that his confession should have been suppressed,notwithstanding miranda warnings,because he confessed without first being informed of his rights under article of the vienna convention.the law is straightforward s uppression is not an appropriate remedy for a violation of article.at.
moreover,as in medellin,gomez argues that the icj decision in avena,especially when coupled with the president memorandum,requires that the evidence be suppressed.the court,however,has closed that door as well t he avena judgment is not automatically binding domestic law,medellin.at,and the president memorandum exceeded his constitutional powers,id.at.though we in no way disparage the importance of the vienna convention.at,there is no reasonable debate as to the critical legal infirmities of gomez application.
gomez offers sundry additional reasons why a coa should issue.he asserts that a venireman,susan campos,was improperly excluded based on her attitude toward the death penalty,contrary to witherspoon illinois,d.he contends that four other veniremen were excluded because they were opposed to capital punishment,a categorical exclusion improper under witherspoon,and he avers that his attorney,by failing to oppose the exclusion on witherspoon grounds,was constitutionally ineffective under strickland washington,d.likewise,gomez argues that the sentencing court constitutionally erred in denying his request to inform the jury that if he was not sentenced to death,he would be required to serve a minimum of forty years in prison without parole,and further,and relatedly,that the district court misapplied the principle of teague lane,d,on that point.
the district court got it right,and undebatably so.to explain why,we first state the question we are not called on to answer.the district court ruled that gomez witherspoon claims for everyone but campos were procedurally defaulted because they were not raised on direct appeal and that gomez ha d not shown,or even attempted to show,cause and prejudice for the default.as we review gomez application to this court relative to the four veniremen,we note that he does not mention that ruling,much less explain why it was wrong.instead,he appears to argue only that his counsel failure to oppose the exclusion of the venireman constituted a violation of washington a to their exclusion 
concerning the claim as it relates to campos,under witherspoon a sentence of death can not be carried out if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction.at.but,
nothing we say today bears upon the power of a state to execute a defendant sentenced to death by a jury from which the only veniremen who were in fact excluded for cause were those who made unmistakably clear that they would automatically vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case before them,or that their attitude toward the death penalty would prevent them from making an impartial decision as to the defendant guilt.
in wainwright witt,d internal citations and quotations omitted,the court amplified this reservation by holding that the 
standard is whether the juror views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.we note that,in addition to dispensing with witherspoon reference to automatic decisionmaking,this standard likewise does not require that a juror bias be proved with unmistakable clarity.this is because determinations of juror bias can not be reduced to sessions which obtain results in the manner of a catechism.what common sense should have realized experience has proved many veniremen simply can not be asked enough questions to reach the point where their bias has been made unmistakably clear these veniremen may not know how they will react when faced with imposing the death sentence,or may be unable to articulate,or may wish to hide their true feelings.despite this lack of clarity in the printed record,however,there will be situations where the trial judge is left with the definite impression that a prospective juror would be unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law.and this is why deference must be paid to the trial judge who sees and hears the juror.
in uttecht brown,d,the court reemphasized the importance of deferring to the trial court under witherspoon,explaining that in determining whether the removal of a potential juror would vindicate the state interest without violating the defendant right,the trial court makes a judgment based in part on the demeanor of the juror,a judgment owed deference by reviewing courts where federal courts do not afford this deference,they fail to respect the limited role of federal habeas relief in this area prescribed by congress and by our cases.the court expressly reaffirmed witt,acknowledging that when there is ambiguity in the prospective juror statements,the trial court,aided as it undoubtedly is by its assessment of the venireman demeanor,is entitled to resolve the question in favor of the state.id.at citing witt,at.
campos,along with the other veniremen,was given a questionnaire on which she agreed with statements such as c apital punishment has never been effective in preventing crime,i do not believe in capital punishment under any circumstances,c apital punishment is not necessary in modern civilization,and the death penalty is a disgrace to civilized society.though she did not agree that capital punishment should be abolished,she did agree that c apital punishment is justified only for premeditated murder.she disagreed that c apital punishment is just and necessary and that w e must have it for some crimes.she also checked the statement that i can not vote to assess the death penalty under any circumstances.
as part of her individual voir dire,the trial court tried to make sense of these statements.in a lengthy examination,campos said that i feel like i just not a person to judge anybody,and i believe that i ca accuse somebody of something that i do believe in,and i just do believe in it.the court said that you struck me as having two minds about the issue,and campos said she was j ust confused,and later i confused about that.i mean,i just against all that.then she said i just do believe in the death penalty.i just do feel it right to kill anybody.
the next question was,is your feeling so strong,to which campos interjected,yes,sir.the court finished its question that you would be unable to answer the questions honestly,according to what the evidence showed campos responded,i be honest about it,but i will answer questions,but i just feel very strongly about it.i do believe in the death penalty at all.later,the court asked,c ould you ever matter what the evidence shows,that you could never vote for the death penalty she replied,i would vote for the death penalty.a lawyer asked her,do you think that there is any crime,kind of crime,that deserves the death penalty campos answered,no,i do.the court excused campos for cause.
no reasonable jurist could find that a constitutional error was committed.even on a stale printed page,campos comes across as someone whose personal views would taint her ability fairly to answer questions that might affect whether to impose the death penalty.in fact,she said as much.when asked whether she could ever vote for death no matter what the
