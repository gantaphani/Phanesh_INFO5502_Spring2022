petitioner,lewis williams,was indicted and convicted of first degree murder,and sentenced to death.after unsuccessful direct appeals and several state proceedings,williams filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus.after ruling that the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,governed williams petition,the district court entered judgment dismissing the petition.the district court issued a certificate of appealability only on the question of whether williams petition was governed by the aedpa.on williams appeal,we held that it was.see williams coyle,cir.on his appeal of the denial of a certificate on the other issues he had raised in his petition,we issued a certificate of appealability on four issues.those are,whether the district court erred by denying williams request for an evidentiary hearing,finding that the ohio court ruling on williams ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing stage claim was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of the law,finding that the ohio court ruling on williams brady violation claim as it related to the testimony of anderson and brooks was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of the law,and finding that the ohio court ruling on williams eighth amendment the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury on the ohio death penalty not contrary to or an unreasonable application of the law.in response to the eight amendment and brady claims,the warden,acting on behalf of the state,argues that williams procedurally defaulted these by failing to raise them at the earliest opportunity.and,moreover,on the whole,williams claims,including the ones the warden claims williams defaulted,are without merit.
we agree that the district court judgment should be affirmed.in spite of the warden assertions,however,we reach the merits of williams eighth amendment and brady claims because it is unclear whether williams procedurally defaulted them.on the issue of the evidentiary hearing,we believe williams was in fact provided a federal evidentiary hearing,and is actually requesting a second federal evidentiary hearing.he has offered no argument to persuade us that he is entitled to a second such hearing.we reject williams eighth amendment jury instruction claim because ohio supreme court had ruled that the trial court instruction was a correct interpretation of ohio death penalty statute.likewise,we find the ineffective assistance of counsel claim without merit because williams failed to establish that it was unreasonable for the state courts to find his trial counsel failure to investigate and present further mitigating evidence was below the professional standards of the time.finally,on the brady claim,although the district court should not have applied the aedpa standards to that claim,it was correct to dismiss the claim as williams failed to prove the existence of any exculpatory evidence or that the alleged evidence was material.
a general description of the factual and procedural background precedes our analysis,which will include additional background as necessary.
on february,a cuyahoga county grand jury indicted williams for robbery,theft,aggravated robbery,aggravated burglary,and aggravated murder with specifications in connection with the robbery and murder of leona chmielewski see joint appendix at.williams pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial where he was represented by floyd oliver and arthur lambros.
at trial,the prosecution called as witnesses several of williams friends and relatives who were with him on the night of the murder.they testified they saw williams standing in the doorway of chmielewski house as they were leaving the neighborhood.when they returned,about an hour later,they noticed that chmielewski door was open.upon investigating,they discovered her body on the floor inside the doorway.at that point,they called the police.the police discovered that chmielewski had been beaten around the head and neck and shot through the mouth.additionally,her purse had been overturned and her wallet was missing.the police arrested williams.
the prosecution also introduced evidence that a partial shoe print on the nightgown chmielewski was wearing at the time of her murder matched the print from the shoes williams was wearing at the time of his arrest and the jacket williams was wearing at the time of his arrest contained a trace of lead powder,similar to that discharged from a gun.and,over williams objections,the prosecution called michael anderson and brooks navarro,two informants,to testify.they testified that,while in jail,williams admitted to them he killed chmielewski.according to anderson,williams told anderson that he stuck the gun in her mouth.brooks testified that williams told brooks he was worried about the blood on his shoes.williams attorneys anderson and brooks,inquiring whether they currently had a deal with prosecution to exchange testimony for more lenient sentences or hoped the state would later consider leniency on account of their testimony.each answered that while he did not have a deal with the prosecution,he did hope the state would remember his cooperation.likewise,the prosecutor stated that he would likely take anderson and brooks cooperation into account.on october,the jury found williams guilty of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery,thereby making him eligible for the death penalty.the trial then proceeded to the sentencing stage.
at the sentencing hearing,williams counsel introduced mitigating evidence in the form of testimony from three father,his sister,and a family an unsworn oral statement from williams.williams father and sister testified that williams had a troubled childhood.the friend of the family also spoke of several events in williams childhood that indicated he was raised in a hostile environment.williams made statements to a similar effect and also stated that he had been involved with the law on several occasions.apparently counsel strategy in introducing this evidence was to demonstrate to the jury that because of his upbringing,williams did not have much of a chance in life.a fact which counsel apparently hoped would engender feelings of mercy from the jury.according to the district court,counsel was also attempting to show that the legal system had failed williams.
at the close of the proceeding,the judge instructed the jury that under ohio revised code sections and,it could return one of three sentence or one of two life upon whether it found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances.any of these recommendations,the judge instructed,must be based on a unanimous decision.see at.williams counsel did not object to the instruction.after deliberating,the jury recommended a sentence of death,which the court accepted.on november,the court entered its judgment that williams was sentenced to death.see at.
williams,represented by oliver,appealed the judgment and sentence.on october,an ohio court of appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence.see state williams,wl ohio,unpublished journal entry and opinion.williams then appealed to the ohio supreme court where he was represented by marilyn damelio and richard gideon.finding no merit,the ohio supreme court affirmed his conviction and sentence on march.see state williams,ohio,ohio.williams then applied for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court.the court denied the application.see williams ohio,d.
having exhausted his direct appeals,williams turned his attention to state proceedings for relief.in all,williams filed five state relief pcr petitions and took appeals from four of the five dismissals.additionally,williams filed an application for delayed reconsideration of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in his is required under ohio murnahan rule.see state murnahan,ohio,ohio.
proceeding pro se,williams filed his first petition for pcr on april.there,he alleged ineffective assistance of counsel and what he now argues was a brady violation.the trial court dismissed without opinion and williams did not appeal.he filed a second pcr,related to the robbery,which was also dismissed.again,williams did not appeal.
instead,represented by robert ingersoll,he filed his third petition for pcr on november,in it he alleged,among other things,that he was deprived of effective counsel at the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial as well as on appeal.he did not allege a brady violation.again the trial court dismissed.the ohio court of appeals affirmed on july,see state williams,ohio app d,ohio,and the ohio supreme court dismissed the appeal on november,finding that no substantial constitutional question was presented.state williams ohio,ohio unpublished table decision.
on august,while his third petition was still on appeal,williams filed his fourth petition for pcr.in it he alleged,among other things,that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and suffered a brady violation.the trial court dismissed the brady claim as procedurally barred by the doctrine of res judicata and rejected the ineffective assistance of counsel claims on the merits.that ruling was affirmed by the ohio court of appeals on april,see state williams,wl ohio.april,and the ohio supreme court dismissed on september,without opinion,see state williams,ohio,ohio unpublished opinion.
undeterred by his lack of success,williams filed a fifth petition for pcr on july.again he asserted that his counsel were ineffective and that the prosecution violated his due process rights by failing to disclose exculpatory evidence.and again the trial court dismissed on the grounds of res judicata and the court of appeals affirmed,see state williams,wl ohio,unpublished opinion,and the ohio supreme court dismissed without opinion,see state williams,ohio,ohio unpublished table opinion.
on june,while litigating his fifth pcr,williams filed an application for delayed reconsideration in the court of appeals on his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim,as is required by ohio law.the court dismissed the application because williams filed it in the wrong case.on october,williams filed the application again,this time in the correct case.the court dismissed the application under ohio appellate rule b because williams failed to show good cause to reopen his case.williams appealed that dismissal to the ohio supreme court,which,on february,affirmed the court of appeals on the ground that williams failed to demonstrate good cause for his untimely filing.
coming to the realization that he was not going to obtain any state relief,williams filed a notice of intent to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on april.then on november,williams filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,challenging his conviction and sentence.williams petition raised grounds for relief,including claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial and appellate phases of his case,a brady violation,and a violation of his eighth amendment rights as a result of the trial judge jury instruction regarding ohio death penalty statute,ohio revised code section.in addition,williams requested an evidentiary hearing to present new evidence on the brady and ineffective assistance of counsel claims.the warden responded,arguing in part that williams had procedurally defaulted his brady and eighth amendment claims.
the district court granted williams request for an evidentiary hearing.at the hearing,williams introduced the testimony of a ballistics expert and a mitigation expert to support the ineffective assistance of counsel at the guilt and sentencing stages of his trial claim,and to support his brady claim,an affidavit from anderson stating that he testified against williams as part of a deal with the prosecution.he did not call either anderson or brooks to testify.williams also subpoenaed his former counsel but did not take former counsel deposition or call him to testify.in response,the state called the prosecutors who tried williams case.both denied making a deal with either anderson or brooks.after conducting the hearing,the district court found that although williams filed his notice of intent to file a petition for habeas corpus before the effective date of the aedpa,it nevertheless governed his case because he filed his petition after that date.and because williams had failed to develop the record and could not make the showing required under section e to obtain an evidentiary hearing,the district court concluded,it would rule on the petition without reliance on the evidence presented at the hearing.nevertheless,it did consider the evidence in its ruling.
in ruling on the petition,the district court declined to address whether williams procedurally defaulted on his brady and eighth amendment claims and instead based its decision on the merits of those claims.it found both claims wanting merit,with or without the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing.it also found that williams ineffective assistance of counsel and other claims lacked merit and therefore dismissed the petition.in addition to denying the petition,the court,based upon the reasons stated in its page opinion,declined to issue williams a certificate of appealability.
williams filed a motion to reconsider.upon reconsideration,the court amended its order and issued a certificate of appealability on the question of whether williams petition was governed by the aedpa.williams appealed that issue to this court and requested a certificate of appealability on all issues raised in his petition.we held that the aedpa governed williams case despite the fact that he filed his notice of intent to file a petition prior to its effective date.see williams coyle,cir.we then issued a certificate on the four issues williams raises here.
ii.procedural default 
before we reach the merits of any of williams claims,we must address the warden argument that williams procedurally defaulted his brady and eighth amendment claims by failing to raise them at the earliest opportunity.
when a state prisoner defaults on his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule,federal habeas review of the claim is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman thompson,d citations omitted.in maupin smith,cir,we set forth a test for determining whether a court is procedurally barred from reviewing a state prisoner federal constitutional claims.first,the federal court must determine whether there is a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner claim and whether the petitioner failed to comply with that rule.second,the federal court must determine whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural is,whether the state courts actually based their decisions on the procedural rule.third,the federal court must consider whether the procedural rule is an adequate and independent state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose federal review of a federal constitutional claim.see id.a procedural rule is adequate only when it is firmly established and regularly followed at the time it was applied.see rogers howes,cir.the rule would be an independent basis for disposition of a case if the state courts actually relied on the procedural bar.see harris reed,d.fourth,if the federal court answers the first three questions in the affirmative,it would not review the petitioner procedurally defaulted claim unless the petitioner can show cause for not following the procedural rule and that failure to review the claim would result in prejudice or a miscarriage of justice.see maupin,at.based on this test,we do not believe we can find that williams procedurally defaulted on his brady or eighth amendment claims.
brady claim 
we do not believe we need go any further than the first factor of inquiry in determining whether williams procedurally defaulted his brady claim.before we explain why,we provide a detailed procedural background.williams claims to have alleged a brady violation in his first petition for pcr.the petition alleged that williams was denied his constitutional right to a fair and impartial trial when the prosecutor used against him testimony of anderson and brooks which was know to be false and which was produced by promises made by the prosecutor to anderson and brooks.at the trial court dismissed this petition without opinion and williams never appealed the dismissal.
williams did not raise the his first pcr petition did raise either his second or third petitions for pcr.this despite the fact that his third petition for pcr contained information that would suggest a possible brady claim an affidavit dated february,from gary english,a jail mate of williams and anderson,which stated that english overhead anderson telling williams he,anderson,was going to get a lesser sentence for testifying against williams.the text of the affidavit makes clear that the conversation took place prior to the end of williams trial which would mean williams was aware of the alleged deal prior to the end of his trial rather than raising the claim there,williams chose to wait until his fourth pcr proceeding to raise the brady claim.
in alleging the brady violation in his fourth pcr petition,williams pointed to several facts that led him to believe a deal existed between the prosecution and the,that after their testimony each witness received a reduced sentence.the petition also included an affidavit from jeff layman,an investigator hired by williams counsel,which stated that while visiting anderson at the marion correctional facility,anderson informed layman that the prosecution promised to recommend a reduced sentence if he testified against williams.see at.curiously,the petition did not include english affidavit nor did it include an affidavit from anderson.the trial court dismissed the claim finding it was barred by res judicata because it should have been considered on direct appeal.the court of appeals and the state supreme court affirmed on that reasoning.
nevertheless,williams raised the claim again in his fifth petition for pcr,this time including an affidavit from anderson stating that he made a deal with the prosecution.again the trial court dismissed the brady claim on the ground that it was barred by res judicata.it then went on to state,f urther,these exhibits fail to present substantive grounds upon which relief can be granted.in his appeal from that dismissal,williams alleged that it was error for the trial court to dismiss the petition on the ground of res judicata because his claim was based upon evidence outside the affidavit from ohio law did not apply the doctrine to claims supported by evidence outside the record.williams also stated that the trial court erred by failing to grant his petition as to the brady claim.the court of appeals rejected williams contention that evidence outside the record prevents a court from applying res judicata to procedurally bar a claim.it stated,
defendant seventh assignment of error contends the prosecution presented false testimony from michael anderson and concealed a deal to obtain his testimony,thereby depriving defendant of effective counsel defendant contends he is entitled to file successive pcr petitions,despite the denial of prior pcr petitions rasing the same grounds,whenever he presents new evidence to support the claims.
contrary to defendant argument,ohio law does not grant carte blanche to file successive pcr petitions endlessly trial courts are not required to entertain successive petitions which allege the same grounds as earlier petitions defendant has failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion by dismissing these claims in his fifth pcr.
defendant raised the same claims in his fourth pcr petition and made no attempt to show good cause for permitting him to raise them again belatedly with additional evidence.that michael anderson testified falsely at trial and the prosecution concealed promises of lenient sentencing to induce his testimony were arguments raised before.defendant fourth pcr petition was based on an affidavit of investigator jeff layman and defendant fifth petition merely adds an affidavit in which anderson recants his trial testimony.however,recanted testimony is suspect and does not generally warrant a hearing 
state williams,wl at ohio,unpublished opinion internal citations omitted.the court did not go on to address the merits of the claim.the supreme court of ohio affirmed without opinion.
those dismissals,the warden argues,establish a procedural bar to this court hearing williams brady claim.pointing to our decisions in wong money,cir,and norris schotten,cir,the warden asserts that the doctrine of res judicata is an adequate and independent state ground for barring federal review.
after reviewing ohio doctrine of res judicata,we conclude that while it seems likely that williams did procedurally default his brady claim,the ohio courts have not provided us with enough analysis to hold that williams defaulted his claim.under ohio law,the doctrine of res judicata will bar a party from raising issues that it had an opportunity to raise at an earlier proceeding.see state roberts,ohio,ohio stating that the petitioner is precluded by the doctrine of res judicata from asserting constitutional issues in this post conviction proceeding since she failed to raise these issues at the earliest possible time state johnson,wl at ohio,state resh,ohio app d,ohio.this doctrine applies equally in proceedings,barring claims for relief when the petitioner could have raised the issue on direct appeal but did not,see state perry,ohio,ohio to claims raised in federal habeas proceedings that were not raised on appeal from a trial court dismissal of a petition for relief but could have been,see brooks edwards,wl at cir,and to claims that a successive petition for relief raises that could have been raised in an earlier proceeding but were not,see state slagle,wl,at ohio,state mullins,wl,at ohio.april.when the claim raised is based on evidence outside the record,the rules change a bit.but how the rules change appears to depend on which opinion you examine.for instance,some courts appear to suggest all that matters is whether the claim is based on evidence outside the record and could not have been appealed on the original record e vidence must show that the petitioner could not have appealed the constitutional claim based on the information in the original trial record.state combs,ohio app d,ohio.thus,a narrow reading of those cases suggests that the question of whether the petitioner could have obtained the evidence earlier is of no consequence.others find that question important,and require not only that the evidence is outside the record but also that the party presented the claim when the party could have reasonably obtained the evidence.see mapes coyle,cir slagle,at resh,at res judicata does not apply because the defendant could not have reasonably discovered the attached evidentiary materials at or before trial.still other sources have stated the issue as whether the party could have known of the error in time to raise it at trial or on appeal.baldwin ohio.west.
williams does not address the varying interpretations of the doctrine,choosing simply to adopt the one most favorable to him.applying that interpretation,he argues that because his claim is based on evidence outside the record,the delinquency in raising it is absolved.apparently the ohio courts did not agree.the court of appeals in dismissing his fourth pcr appeal held,the claims raised in this assignment of error could have been raised on appeal or through the previous petitions for relief.williams,wl,at.the trial court ruling was similar.the courts presumably based these holdings on the ground that williams could have reasonably obtained the evidence supporting his brady claim earlier that his fourth petition for pcr.but while the evidence suggests that to be case,the ohio courts failed to discuss any of that evidence,make specific factual findings on the matter,or provide any reasoned analysis.without such analysis,we are unwilling to rule that the claim is procedurally barred 
jury instruction 
the warden argues that williams procedurally defaulted his eighth amendment jury instruction claim by failing to make a contemporaneous objection to the instruction and failing to raise the issue on direct appeal.we disagree.it appears that williams raised the issue of the court jury instruction regarding the degree of agreement needed to return a life sentence recommendation on his direct appeal to the ohio supreme court.that court,though it stated that the issue had not been briefed or raised below,went on to decide the case on the merits.
in his twelfth proposition,appellant argues that the jury should have been instructed that a life imprisonment sentence does not require a unanimous vote.not only was this issue not briefed and decided below,but this alleged reading of d ignores the requirement set forth in crim.a that all verdicts in criminal proceedings be unanimous.furthermore,we rejected this argument in jenkins and held that in returning a sentence of life imprisonment under d,the jury verdict must be unanimous.
williams,at citation omitted.we do not believe that we can read this decision as resting on a procedural bar as it simply says in passing that williams failed to comply with the procedural rules accordingly,williams is not barred from raising the issue now.
because we find that we are not procedurally barred from reviewing either claim,we move to williams assignments of error.
iii.williams claims 
evidentiary hearing 
in his first assignment of error,williams alleges the district court should have granted him an evidentiary hearing on his brady and ineffective assistance of counsel claims.in point of fact,the district court did grant and proceed with an evidentiary hearing.at the hearing,williams introduced thirty exhibits,including an affidavit from anderson claiming that he lied at williams trial.williams also called two witnesses,including a mitigation expert who testified that williams trial counsel were ineffective in preparing for the mitigation stage of the trial.williams did not,however,call anderson as a witness.his counsel informed the court at a conference that anderson was unavailable in a psychiatric ward at allen correctional institution.as it turned out,anderson was not in a psychiatric ward but in the general population and therefore available.thus,his affidavit was inadmissible hearsay.
after the hearing,the district court ruled that the aedpa prohibited it from using the evidence in evaluating the merits of williams claims.specifically,the court found that williams had failed to develop the state record and did not meet one of the exceptions in e for obtaining an evidentiary hearing under those circumstances the request was not based upon a new constitutional rule nor was it based upon newly discovered evidence.the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing was not newly discovered material evidence at best,it consisted of new interpretations of evidence presented or not presented at williams trial.while the interpretations are arguably new,the factual predicate from which they are derived is not.at.
despite the court conclusion that it was prohibited from using the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing,it proceeded to evaluate the evidence.it began in footnote as a practical matter,whether the court disregards the evidence received at the hearing is of no consequence,for,as will shortly be discussed,williams is not entitled to relief even upon consideration of such evidence.giving williams every possible advantage,the district court included the hearsay affidavit in its evaluation as well,stating,anderson affidavit,even if it were not hearsay,must be viewed with extreme suspicion anderson inadmissible affidavit is insufficient to establish that the state had promised him a reduced sentence in exchange for testimony against williams.at footnotes omitted.in evaluating the ineffective assistance of counsel argument,the district court said,williams would fair sic no better even were the court to consider the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing.at.it then went on to consider that evidence,finding that the mitigation expert testimony did not support a finding of deficient performance by williams counsel or the prejudice required to overturn the sentence.
nevertheless,williams argues that he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing.ignoring the only conclusion one can reach from reading the district court the court considered the begins by observing that his case is outside the scope of e because he did not fail to develop the record in state court.rather,he asserts,the state courts incorrectly refused to allow him to develop the record.because the case is not governed by e,he reasons,we must analyze his request for an evidentiary hearing under the rules that governed requests,namely,townsend sain,d.and under those rules,he concludes,he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on both issues we disagree.
as the district court did in fact evaluate the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing,what williams is actually requesting is a second federal evidentiary hearing.the sole purpose of that the district court already considered the affidavits and testimony of the mitigation be to introduce the testimony of anderson rather than relying on his affidavit as williams had previously done.in hope,we suppose,that the district court would look more favorably on anderson statement if he were there in person.but the district court opinion suggests otherwise.it did not say that anderson statement was incredible because anderson was not before the court rather it found the statement lacked credibility because anderson waited nine years to reveal his alleged perjury and the state did not have the authority to promise anderson what he alleges it promised him.williams has not presented us with an authority,nor have we found any,that would indicate such a hearing is required.the principles applicable to this situation,moreover,militate against such a hearing.see mcdonald johnson,cir.williams has had the opportunity for a full and fair hearing in federal court.if we were to analogize williams request to one governed by e,moreover,williams would not be entitled to a second hearing.any undeveloped factual absence of testimony by a result of williams failure.williams does not meet one of the listed exceptions.accordingly,we reject williams argument that he is entitled to a second federal evidentiary hearing.
standards of review 
because the aedpa applies to williams petition,see williams coyle,cir,we review his petition under the standards set forth in d.that section provides 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings.
d.thus,the supreme court has held,t he threshold question under this section is whether the petitioner seeks to apply a rule of law that was clearly established at the time his conviction became final.williams taylor,d a rule of law is clearly established if it is directly based on a holding,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court as of the time the conviction became final.id.at.
a decision can be contrary to such law in one of two ways.first,when the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from its precedent.see id.at.second,when the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court cases.id.at.
a decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it identifies the correct principle of law but unreasonably applies it.see id.at.a n unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law under d unreasonable application clause,then,a federal habeas court may not issue a writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.original emphasis.
we pause here to emphasize that the court did not,contrary to some opinions from this and other circuits,hold that a decision might be an unreasonable application if it unreasonably extended or declined to extend an existing principle of law.the court mentioned that theory,but only in the context of reviewing for the reader what the fourth circuit had previously ruled constituted an unreasonable application of the law.the court began,
the fourth circuit interpretation of the unreasonable application clause of d is generally correct.that court held in green that a decision can involve an unreasonable application of this court clearly established precedent in two ways second,a decision also involves an unreasonable application of this court precedent if the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from our precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.
id.at.citations omitted.but the court then went on to emphasize that it was not ruling on the unreasonable extension principle.
the fourth circuit also held in green that decisions that unreasonably extended a legal principle from our precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuse to extend a legal principle to a new context where it should apply should be analyzed under d unreasonable application clause.although that holding may perhaps be correct,the classification does have some problems of precision today case does not require us to decide how such extension of legal principle cases should be treated under d.for now it is sufficient to hold that when a decision unreasonably applies the law of this court to the facts of a prisoner case,a federal court applying d may conclude that the decision falls within that provision unreasonable application clause.
id.at emphasis added internal citation omitted.
we will review williams jury instruction and ineffective assistance of counsel claims under the standard set forth in d.because the ohio supreme court reviewed the jury instruction claim on direct appeal,our review will focus on that opinion.the ineffective assistance of counsel argument,however,was not reviewed on direct appeal.whether d applies to issues addressed for the first time in state proceedings was not addressed by either party.the warden simply assumed it did apply and with his approach to every we review the claim de novo.nevertheless,we have little doubt that the aedpa standards apply to state collateral decisions as well as those on direct appeal.section d draws no distinction between decisions on direct appeal and those in state collateral proceedings,requiring only that the claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.d.further,at least two of our sister circuits have applied the standards to state proceedings.see bell jarvis,cir en banc moore gibson,cir.and more importantly,the supreme court review in williams taylor was of a state court decision.the question still remains which state decision we should review.the ohio courts last addressed the merits of williams ineffective assistance of counsel claim in his third pcr proceedings.the court of appeals articulated its reasoning,while the ohio supreme court affirmed without opinion.because both courts reached the same conclusion,and it is the conclusion rather than the analysis that matters,see bell,at,we think which decision we review is of little import whether we review the decision of the court of appeals or the ohio supreme court.although we review the collateral decision,we still look to the clearly established law at the time williams conviction became final.williams,at.
jury instruction 
after reading the possible verdicts,the trial court instructed the jury as follows 
if all twelve of the jury find,by proof beyond a reasonable doubt,that the aggravating circumstances which lewis williams was found guilty of committing murder outweighs the mitigating factors,then you must return such finding to the court.i instruct you as a mater of law that if you make such a finding,that you have no choice and must recommend to the court that the sentence of death be imposed upon the defendant,lewis williams.
on the other hand,if after considering all of the relevant evidence raised at the trial you find that the state of ohio failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances which the defendant was found guilty of committing,outweigh the mitigating factors,then you will return your verdict reflecting your decision.
that is,you must find that the state has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances of which the defendant was found guilty outweigh the mitigating factors.in this event,you will then proceed to determine which of the two possible life imprisonment sentences to recommend to the court.
so you have three options,as i have indicated to you.of course,whichever you choose,all twelve of the jurors have to agree and sign in ink.
at emphasis added.that passage,williams contends,violated his rights because it erroneously instructed the jury on the level of agreement necessary to recommend a life sentence and that this erroneous instruction violated his eighth amendment right.
ohio d simply does not require unanimous agreement to recommend a sentence other than death,williams contends.indeed,he argues,the jury must recommend a life sentence if even one juror disagrees with a recommendation of death.the trial court instruction otherwise,he maintains,misinformed the jury about its role in sentencing a capital defendant and therefore violated his eighth amendment rights as described in caldwell mississippi,d.
the ohio supreme court rejected that argument and so do we.the ohio supreme court held that,in accord with its decision in state jenkins,ohio,ohio,all verdicts must be unanimous under rule ohio criminal rule a and consequently,a recommendation of a life sentence must be unanimous.see state williams,ohio,ohio.jenkins was clearly decided before williams conviction was final.
in,the ohio supreme court,reached a decision contrary to jenkins in state brooks,ohio,ohio.a opinion by the ohio supreme court also suggests that a recommendation of life need not be unanimous.see state springer,ohio,ohio.the brooks court did not mention jenkins but nevertheless appears to overrule it.the brooks decision was over a month after williams last pcr request was dismissed and both brooks and springer were decided after williams conviction became final.williams did not raise the jury instruction issue in his pcr proceedings,moreover,thereby depriving the ohio courts of the opportunity to address the apparent conflict between jenkins and springer.
the timing of these decisions requires us to find that the ohio supreme court decision was not an unreasonable application of nor was it contrary to clearly established this case the time williams conviction became final.caldwell prohibits the judge or prosecutors from making misleading statements to the jury.thus,for the decision to have been contrary to or an unreasonable application of caldwell,it would have had to affirm what was then an erroneous statement of the law by the judge that misled the jury.that is,the jury instruction would have to had been an erroneous statement of ohio law at the time williams conviction became final.if it was not,then the instruction was not misleading,and therefore,not in violation of caldwell.at the time williams conviction became final,ohio highest court read section d in conjunction with ohio criminal rule of procedure a to require jury unanimity for life imprisonment recommendations in capital cases.therefore,the decision affirming williams sentence was not an unreasonable application of or contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent.
williams second challenge fares no better.he alleges the instruction led the jury to believe that they must return a unanimous recommendation,thereby precluding them from considering any and all mitigating circumstances in violation of mills maryland,d.
the ohio supreme court did not address williams second argument however,it is easily disposed of.we first note that mills was decided after the united states supreme court denied certiorari from williams direct appeal and therefore was not clearly established law at the time williams conviction became final.even if the law were clearly established,the jury instruction did not run afoul of it or its principles.mills stands for the proposition that a death penalty scheme can not require unanimity as to the existence of a mitigating circumstance.see mills,at.here the jury instruction clearly did not require unanimity as to the existence of a mitigating circumstance only as to the question of whether the aggravating circumstances as a whole outweighed the mitigating circumstances as a whole.we do not see how that instruction violates mills.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
if his death sentence is not the result of judicial error,it must be the result of his counsel error,williams contends.that error,he argues,was his trial counsel failure to fully investigate his background for information that they could have presented at the sentencing stage of his trial as mitigating circumstances.if they had,he maintains,they would have discovered additional information that supports williams claim that the death penalty should not have been imposed because of his troubled childhood.specifically,williams points to testimony that his school test revealed he has a low iq and statements from family members that he was abused and his father was a homosexual who spent little time with williams and brought other men around williams home.counsel failure to present such evidence,he alleges,was deficient performance.had they presented that evidence,williams argues,there is a reasonable probability that the jury recommendation would have been different.
the ohio courts saw things differently.williams first raised the claim in his third pcr petition the court of appeals was the last to provide an articulated decision.applying strickland washington,d,it found that williams could not show that his attorneys decision not to call certain witnesses was deficient performance.the witnesses williams claims his counsel should have called to testify would have merely provided support for the theory of mitigation that his counsel presented and the jury rejected,the court reasoned.accordingly,it concluded,counsel strategic decision not to call these witnesses did not constitute deficient performance.further,it stated,the failure to present the cumulative evidence did not prejudice williams as the jury did not accept this theory of mitigation.the ohio supreme court affirmed without opinion,we assume on the same rationale.
we pause here to stress the import of the aedpa requirements on our analysis.the aedpa requires us to review the ohio court decision based on clearly established supreme court precedent at the time williams conviction became final.we are not permitted to rely on supreme court cases decided after the court decision,nor are we permitted to rely on any decision by any court other than the supreme court in evaluating the ohio court decision.thus,williams references to supreme court decisions after the time williams conviction became final are largely irrelevant.so too are williams references to federal circuit court decisions.
at the time williams conviction became final,strickland washington was three years old but still the most instructive supreme court case on his issue.under strickland,counsel is deemed ineffective if his performance is deficient and this deficient performance prejudiced the defense.at.a counsel performance is deficient if he committed errors so serious that he was not performing at a reasonable professional level.the burden is on the defendant to make such a showing by identify ing the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment.id.at.the court warned against the type of hindsight and in which williams asks us to engage.
judicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential.it is all too tempting for a defendant to counsel assistance after conviction or adverse sentence,and it is all too easy for a court,examining counsel defense after it has proved unsuccessful,to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.a fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation,a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that is,the defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.
in making its determination,the court should keep in mind that counsel function,as elaborated in prevailing professional norms,is to make the adversarial testing process work in the particular case.at the same time,the court should recognize that counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.
id.at.citations omitted.and as to investigative decisions of counsel,the court also instructed courts to act deferentially.
s trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.in other words,counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.in any ineffectiveness case,a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances,applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgment.
w hat investigation decisions are reasonable depends critically on information supplied by the defendant.for example,when the facts that support a certain potential line of defense are generally known to counsel because of what the defendant said,the need for further investigation may be considerably diminished or eliminated altogether.and when a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful,counsel failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable.in short,inquiry into counsel conversations with the defendant may be critical to a proper assessment of counsel other litigation decisions.
id.at.assuming a defendant overcomes this high burden,he must still prevail on the second prong before he will receive relief.
to prevail on the second prong,the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.again,we note that it is important to bear in mind that we are not proceeding de novo instead,we are assessing whether the ohio court application of the strickland standard and only the strickland standard as it was described by the supreme court in unreasonable or its decision contrary to the standard.
applying strickland through the lense of the aedpa,we do not believe it was unreasonable for the ohio court to determine that williams failed to make the required showing.section b of the ohio revised code listed the following items as mitigating factors in death penalty cases 
whether the victim of the offense induced or facilitated it 
whether it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed,but for the fact that the offender was under duress,coercion,or strong provocation 
whether,at the time of committing the offense,the offender,because of a mental disease or defect,lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of the offender conduct or to conform the offender conduct to the requirements of the law 
the youth of the offender 
the offender lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications 
if the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender,the degree of the offender participation in the offense and the degree of the offender participation in the acts that led to the death of the victim 
any other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death.
ohio ann.the only factor that favored williams was the catchall contained in subsection seven.williams counsel presented evidence on this factor in the form of testimony that williams had a troubled youth.the court finding that counsel decision not to introduce redundant evidence about lewis williams troubled youth followed the supreme court guidance and applied a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that it might be considered sound trial strategy.at.while further testimony on the mitigating factor,particularly from professionals,might have been helpful,we do not find the court decision that williams counsel were effective to be an unreasonable application of strickland.as the court of appeals noted,williams counsel presented a theory of mitigation and provided evidence to support that theory.the jury simply rejected the is,it rejected the catchall mitigating factor that would include troubled childhoods.
the dissent focuses on this as well,reasoning that had counsel investigated is,spoken to more of williams could have easily determined that some of what williams father testified to was not true.this may well be true.the dissent analysis,however,overlooks strickland requirement that we analyze counsel investigation in light of the defendant actions and statements.as the district court noted,williams was uncooperative with a psychologist in the past and that behavior may have influenced counsel decision not to have williams analyzed again.more importantly,williams had the opportunity to raise with his counsel all the facts he and the dissent claim counsel should have obtained through another method.it is not apparent from the record,moreover,that counsel were unaware of those facts several times during williams unsworn statement,counsel tried to elicit information from williams regarding his home life.williams had the opportunity to raise that and other issues in the mitigation hearing.he chose not to do so,choosing instead to remark how he blamed no one for how he turned out,saying,i do want to be hurting nobody by saying anything,you know.at.counsel tried to get williams back on track,but williams refused.
williams also complains that had his counsel investigated further,he would have discovered that williams was tested as having a low iq.specifically,had counsel reviewed williams records from there is no indication that counsel were not aware of their would have discovered the test results.such practice is common today,williams expert testified before the district court.this argument like much of williams argument goes to what is considered standard practice in mitigation hearings today.but as we have pointed out,that is not the question under strickland nor is it the question under the aedpa.strickland directs the ohio court to analyze effectiveness based on the then prevailing norms and counsel perspective at the time.id.at.the question is whether williams counsel met the professional standards of the time and williams has provided no indication that they did not.see id.at.what counsel knew and why they acted as they did is never directly explained.while one of williams attorneys was deceased at the time of the evidentiary hearing,williams did subpoena the other attorney but did not call him in the evidentiary hearing nor was any affidavit from this attorney ever submitted.williams,moreover,was uncooperative with the psychologists that evaluated him.based on williams conduct,counsel may have determined that they would be better served simply having williams explain his childhood at the mitigation hearing the ohio court decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established law.
the same is true with respect to the prejudice prong.as the ohio court of appeals noted,the evidence williams claims should have been introduced goes to a theory of mitigation that the jury found did not outweigh the aggravating circumstances.williams has made no showing,other than merely alleging,that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.
as williams has failed to show that the ohio courts unreasonably applied strickland in dismissing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,we affirm the district court decision to dismiss williams ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
brady violation 
our review of williams brady claim will be under standards because no state court reviewed the merits of that claim.under that standard,we review mixed questions of law and fact de novo.see carter bell,cir.allegations of brady violations are mixed questions of law and fact,accordingly,we review the claim under that standard.see id.we review the district court factual findings only for clear error.see id.
under brady maryland,d and its progeny,a defendant due process rights are violated when the prosecution suppresses exculpatory evidence.exculpatory evidence includes evidence regarding the reliability of a witness.see united states bagley,d see also kyles whitley,d giglio united states,d bell,at.failure to disclose such evidence is material where the evidence creates a reasonable probability of a different result.see bagley,at.a reasonable probability of a different result exists when the government evidentiary suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.kyles,at.quoting bagley,supra.
according to williams,a deal to exchange lighter sentences for testimony against williams existed between the prosecution and anderson and brooks prior to williams trial.that the prosecution did not disclose the existence of the deal,williams asserts,violated his fourteenth amendment due process rights,as interpreted by brady.to support this claim,williams points to several events that he alleges raise doubt about the witnesses testimony that they were not promised a reduced sentence in exchange for their testimony.first,anderson,who had been charged with aggravated robbery,was allowed to plead guilty to a offense one month after his testimony in williams trial.he was sentenced to one and years of incarceration for the offense however,the execution of the sentence was suspended and he was placed on five years probation.second,brooks,who was serving a one year sentence,was allowed to vacate his plea agreement and plead to a offense.after doing so,he received a three sentence and was placed on six months inactive probation.in addition to this circumstantial evidence,williams also offers an affidavit from anderson stating that he did in fact make a deal with the prosecution prior to testifying and that he lied during the trial when he testified that there was no such deal.williams does not allege that brooks has recanted his trial testimony that no deal existed between himself and the prosecution.nevertheless,he argues there was a deal and the existence of that deal was material therefore,the prosecution failure to disclose it violated his due process right.
the district court disagreed and held there was no brady violation.while it agreed with williams that the prosecutor failure to disclose evidence of a deal between the state and the witnesses would amount to a brady violation,it rejected williams argument that the evidence he presented reveals that a deal between the prosecutor and the witnesses existed prior to the trial.the post trial events,it found,are not evidence that a deal existed prior to the witnesses testifying.and anderson affidavit,it ruled,was not credible.further,there was no evidence that brooks ever recanted his testimony.accordingly,it found no violation and dismissed the claim.
to convince us that the district court erred,williams must show that the court factual finding that no deal existed was clearly erroneous.he can not make that showing.the mere fact that anderson and brook sentences were later altered is not evidence that a deal existed prior to their testimony at trial.in fact,at williams trial anderson testified he hoped to obtain a reduced sentence by reason of his testimony.likewise,the prosecutor stated that he would consider the witnesses cooperation in disposing of their pending cases.the other evidence williams offers,anderson affidavit,is suspicious on both a legal and a factual basis,as the district court found.legally,recanting affidavits are always viewed with extreme suspicion.united states chambers,cir.the circumstances surrounding the confession are also dubious.williams counsel did not offer anderson as a witness in the district court evidentiary hearing because,he stated,anderson was in a psychiatric ward and therefore unavailable.as respondent points out,however,anderson was actually in the general population.both prosecutors,moreover,testified at the evidentiary hearing that they made no such deal with anderson or brooks.all these facts led the district court to find anderson affidavit incredible,and require us to hold that that finding was not clearly erroneous.
even if we assume such a deal existed,we do not believe the prosecution failure to disclose it would have been material.while the jury would not have been aware that a deal existed,it was fully aware of the witnesses motivation for hope of getting favorable treatment from the prosecution in their own cases.williams counsel extensively the witnesses.anderson admitted that he hoped his testimony would benefit him in his case.and the prosecution stated it would consider the witnesses cooperation in determining how to dispose of their cases.thus,the jury knew of this reason to question the veracity of their anderson and brooks testimony.we do not believe that knowledge of the existence of an actual deal prior to deliberation would have given the jury a greater reason to question the veracity of anderson and brooks testimony.at least,not to the level that not knowing undermines confidence in the outcome.see byrd collins,cir.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
because i disagree with the majority determination that williams is not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus because of ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial,i respectfully dissent from the corresponding portion of the majority opinion.unlike the majority,i believe that the state courts decision on williams ineffective assistance of counsel claim involved an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent,specifically of the legal standards set forth in strickland washington,d.
we review de novo a district court decision on a petition for writ of habeas corpus.see carter bell,cir.as we previously noted in williams coyle,cir,this case is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,and under d,this court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus for any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the adjudication 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d emphasis added see also penry johnson,d.in williams taylor,d,the supreme court explained the precise meaning of the language in d,which is at issue here.the supreme court explained that a state court decision is contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent when it is opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or faces a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at an opposite result.id.at.the supreme court further explained that a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent when it correctly identifies the governing legal principle in the case but applies that principle to the facts of the defendant case in an objectively unreasonable manner.id.at.see also penry.at.
the benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial can not be relied on as having produced a just result.strickland,at.the supreme court has recognized that a capital sentencing proceeding like the one involved in this case is sufficiently like a trial in its adversarial format and in the existence of standards for decision that counsel role in the proceeding is comparable to counsel role at trial.id.at.as the majority notes,a defendant must satisfy the,test set forth in strickland to prove a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel 
first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.
with regard to the performance prong of the test,a defendant must show that his counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.in reviewing the reasonableness of such counsel performance,courts must be highly deferential and must be careful to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.id.at.s trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.id.at.emphasis added.in essence,a defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy to satisfy the performance prong of the strickland test.id.at.with regard to the prejudice prong of the strickland test,a defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.it is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.id.at.
background 
in the state courts,williams argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial because his counsel failed to investigate possible mitigating factors adequately and failed to develop and present a coherent theory of mitigation to the jury.specifically,williams claimed that his attorneys failed to obtain pertinent background information on him by neglecting to interview family members other than his father and his sister deborah and by neglecting to request school and juvenile facility records relevant to his development that his attorneys failed to prepare witnesses for the testimony they were to give during the sentencing phase of his trial and that his attorneys failed to request the appointment of a psychological expert who could comment on his development and the mitigating circumstances resulting therefrom.
the eighth amendment requires that a jury be permitted to consider evidence proffered by the defendant regarding the circumstances of the crime and the defendant background and character during the sentencing phase of a capital trial.lockett ohio,d.as the supreme court has repeatedly recognized,because the adversarial testing process generally will not function properly unless defense counsel has done some investigation counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.kimmelman morrison,d quoting strickland,at.see also williams,at.acknowledging that the defendant trial counsel had an obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant background therefore,if counsel failure to investigate is not due to strategic concerns and is unreasonable considering all the circumstances,such failure to investigate may constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.see strickland,at.
under ohio death penalty statute,a sentencing jury must weigh the aggravating circumstances of a defendant capital offense against the nature and circumstances of the offense,and the history,character,and background of the offender before recommending a death sentence.ohio b.the statutory mitigating factors that may considered by the jury in a capital case include the following 
whether the victim of the offense induced or facilitated it 
whether it is unlikely that the offense would have been committed,but for the fact that the offender was under duress,coercion,or strong provocation 
whether,at the time of committing the offense,the offender,because of a mental disease or defect,lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law 
the youth of the offender 
the offender lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications 
if the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender,the degree of the offender participation in the offense and the degree of the offender participation in the acts that led to the death of the victim 
any other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death.
during the sentencing phase of williams trial,his attorneys presented the testimony of three persons olivia smith packnett,the mother of one of williams childhood friends deborah williams,williams younger sister and lewis williams,williams birth father.williams then gave unsworn testimony before the jury on his own behalf.
packnett was the first witness to testify during the sentencing phase.she testified that she had known williams since he was a child that williams often stayed at her house when there was no gas at his mother house and when his mother put him out that she had never known williams to be violent and that she believed williams to be a respectful and excellent fellow.joint appendix at.on,however,packnett revealed that she was unaware of williams repeated troubles in juvenile court and his arrests as an adult for grand theft and aggravated robbery.at.
deborah williams was the second witness to testify.she testified that her parents separated when williams was about six years old that williams had no stable home and that he often slept over at friends homes or in her car.at.according to deborah williams,her brother attorneys were derelict in preparing her to give testimony before the jury,having only spoken to her for five minutes immediately before she testified and advising her only to explain williams life at the hearing.at.
lewis williams,followed deborah williams at the sentencing hearing.he testified that he was with the family as much as maybe he should have been,but whenever williams called him or anything,he was there.whenever he could be with him.at.lewis williams,also testified that he felt that williams cared more for his mother then sic he did himself,but times,as if he was being rejected by his mother for some reason.at.according to lewis williams,his son attorneys did not fully explain to him the purpose of his testimony or to what he would be testifying.at.on top of that,lewis williams,claimed that the attorneys interviewed him for to thirty minutes only and asked him very few questions about williams background.at.
williams was the last person to take the stand and gave an unsworn statement to the jury.on the stand,williams stated that he was years old,see at that he first became involved with the law at age nine for running away from home,see at that he spent many of his formative years at different boys institutions,see at and that the highest grade he had completed was the ninth grade,see at.williams also testified that,although he had the option of going to jail or staying at home when he was arrested for the first time as an adult,he went to jail to try and hurt his family,to see if they really cared.at.
the last state court to render a written decision on williams claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase was the ohio court of appeals in a proceeding the ohio court of appeals denied this claim,stating that the additional evidence that williams had presented in his petition was merely cumulative to the testimony already given during the sentencing phase of his trial and that it did not demonstrate the required diminished responsibility.it then held that williams counsel performance was not deficient.it explained 
here,williams presented a variety of witnesses in the penalty phase.olivia packnett,the mother of one of williams friends,testified that williams has always been and respectful at home.debra williams,defendant sister,testified about the instability of defendant home life.lewis williams,defendant father,testified that he did not spend much time with defendant and that defendant mother rejected him.defendant himself proffered unsworn testimony of his criminal conduct that started at the age of nine which was designed to get his family attention.he stated that he was blamed for all of the family problems and spoke up about his troubled relationship with his mother.
in his petition for post conviction relief,williams submitted a mass of affidavits.such affidavits,however,add only additional detail to support his original mitigation theory that he pursued a life of crime to compensate for a troubled childhood.such evidence does not demonstrate the diminished responsibility that the legislature considered to be mitigating.therefore,we do not believe that counsel performance was deficient by failing to present certain evidence during the mitigation phase of the trial.the absence of such testimony did not prejudice williams so as to render the result unreliable.
state williams,ohio app d,ohio citations omitted emphasis added.
the district court also concluded that williams had not been denied effective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial.specifically,the district court determined that 
the information contained in the affidavits of family members,friends,and professionals was simply additional evidence of williams troubled topic that counsel presented at the mitigation hearing that counsel chose to call as witnesses those persons directly involved in his upbringing his father and sister to establish the conditions of his childhood,rather than relying upon the testimony of more extended family and friends,was a reasonable tactical choice even assuming that counsel failure to interview more of williams family members and friends was unreasonable,there is nothing in the record to suggest that had this additional information been presented to the jury their recommendation would have been different.
at.with regard to the allegations that williams attorneys failed to prepare witnesses for their testimony,the district court held that there is no minimum number of meetings between counsel and witnesses necessary to prepare an attorney to provide effective assistance of counsel and that williams fail ed to explain how the lack of consultation affected the outcome of the hearing.at citation omitted.the district court also determined that williams had failed to identify the information in his records from school and the juvenile and correctional facilities in which he had been incarcerated that would have convinced a jury to spare his life and that williams attorneys were not ineffective for not requesting assistance of a psychological expert in light of williams refusal to cooperate with psychologists during a competency hearing and his refusal to speak ill of his family at his sentencing hearing.at.
finally,the district court held that the presentation of mitigating evidence by williams attorneys was not ineffective.in so doing,the district court noted that williams attorneys presented two theories of mitigation,that williams troubled childhood had led him to a life of crime and that the criminal justice system had let williams down by not rehabilitating him.the district court further stated that williams himself thwarted the force of these arguments by refusing to disclose any relevant information.at.the district court conceded the weaknesses of the investigation and the presentation of mitigating evidence,however,stating 
in the end,the court agrees that the defense presented little if any relevant mitigating evidence to the jury at the hearing.however,this absence resulted more from the lack of such evidence than from the ineffectiveness of williams counsel.to be sure,defense counsel could have been more thorough in the investigation and the presentation of evidence.the defense theories of mitigation could have been better developed.nevertheless in light of the absence of any mitigating evidence,the court concludes that even if counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,there is not a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the results of the proceeding would have been different.

ii.analysis 
after careful review,i conclude that the ohio court of appeals decision on williams claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase constituted an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent.in my opinion,although the ohio court of appeals correctly identified the governing legal principles in this case,it then unreasonably applied them to the facts.in concluding that the performance of williams attorneys was not deficient because the attorneys had a theory of mitigation and presented some although very little evidence in support of that theory to the jury,the ohio court of appeals misunderstood the purpose of allowing a capital defendant to present mitigating evidence at his sentencing hearing.in capital cases,the outcome of a sentencing hearing turns upon the weight of the competing evidence presented by the parties.it is a simple matter of weighing aggravating factors against mitigating factors.thus,williams attorneys were obligated to do more than simply think of a theory and present sparse evidence in support in order to provide effective assistance of counsel to williams in his sentencing hearing they also needed to investigate and gather facts to support that theory and to present the theory in a coherent manner.it was objectively unreasonable for the ohio court of appeals to conclude,without any analysis whether williams attorneys were deficient in collecting readily available evidence of mitigating factors,that williams attorneys provided him effective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial.in other words,the ohio court of appeals was objectively unreasonable in failing to recognize that the affidavits introduced in the proceedings revealed the failure by williams attorneys adequately to investigate his background for meaningful mitigating factors and to prepare mitigation witnesses for their testimony during the sentencing hearing.as a result,the court also failed to uncover how the attorneys failure to conduct a proper investigation prevented them from laying the very foundation for their mitigation theories and effectively left williams without any theory of mitigation at all.
analysis of investigation 
first,i believe that the ohio court of appeals unreasonably determined that williams did not demonstrate that his attorneys investigation and preparation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.at the outset,i note that the lack of investigatory actions by williams attorneys can not reasonably be considered a strategic choice made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options.strickland,at.emphasis added.the investigation by williams attorneys was anything but thorough,consisting solely of one interview with williams father before the sentencing hearing one discussion with williams sister deborah,just immediately before she gave her testimony at the hearing an interview of unspecified time with the mother of one of williams childhood friends and a request for a very limited psychiatric evaluation from the cleveland court clinic in that did not meet the usual standards of investigation for a mitigation evaluation.at aff.of nancy schmidt goessling.to conclude that such investigatory actions were constitutionally adequate is not only completely erroneous but objectively unreasonable.after all,the very core of a capital sentencing hearing is the jury balancing of evidence of mitigating and aggravating factors.if only a minimal investigation is completed by defense counsel to gather evidence of mitigating factors,then there is nothing to place in the balance before the jury to the tip the scales in favor of a life sentence.
additionally,i do not believe that the investigatory actions of williams attorneys can reasonably be considered a strategic choice made after a less than complete investigation such that reasonable professional judgments support ed the limitations on their investigation.strickland,at.emphasis added.indeed,one would be to find any situation in which it would be sound professional judgment for an attorney not to inform a witness in a capital sentencing hearing of the very purpose of the hearing.and yet,williams attorneys failed to explain such purpose to two key sentencing witnesses,williams father and his sister deborah.at aff.of lewis williams,noting that the attorneys did not fully explain to him the purpose of his testimony or to what he would be testifying at aff.of deborah williams stating that a lthough she was contacted by lewis trial attorney,he spent only about five minutes interviewing her and t his was just prior to her testimony.such failure to inform two of williams three witnesses,especially the only two family members to testify during the sentencing hearing,negated the very reason for having these witnesses testify on behalf of williams in the first place because it did not allow either witness an opportunity to think of the events or disadvantages in williams life that would have helped to support a life sentence recommendation as opposed to a death sentence.
furthermore,i do not believe that there is any basis for concluding that the attorneys decisions limiting which family members to interview or the attorneys failure to request pertinent records concerning williams and intellectual development resulted from the exercise of reasonable professional judgment or sound strategy.williams,at.noting the importance of the defendant school and juvenile records.nancy schmidt goessling,a psychologist who was familiar with the type of preparation required in capital cases,asserted in her affidavit of january that,according to the standards at the time 
any preparation for a capital case should involve obtaining extensive background of the defendant including the defendant developmental experiences,the family of origin functioning and dynamics,the parenting capacities of the defendant parents,the defendant intellectual functioning,including but not limited to academic and work performance,the defendant work capacities and experiences,the defendant ability to relate to others both in intimate and social situations,the defendant sexual and marital history,the defendant medical history,and the defendant psychological functioning across his lifetime.
at aff.of nancy schmidt goessling.schmidt goessling further explained that such information should be pursued through extensive interviews of family members,including aunts and uncles,grandparents,cousins,as well as the nuclear family and that records should be obtained from schools,treatment sites,courts and employers.at aff.of nancy schmidt goessling.according to schmidt goessling,in this case,defense counsel failed adequately to research williams background for possible mitigating information by failing to make collateral contact with williams family,friends,teachers,employers,and significant others obtain records of prior treatment sites for williams and williams school and work records and obtain an independent evaluation of williams.at see also at aff.of gerald simmons,noting that the performance of williams attorneys at the sentencing phase constituted ineffective assistance of counsel because the attorneys failed to investigate williams family life and failed to hire a psychological expert to explain williams behavior in light of development at aff.of susan schorr asserting that williams attorneys failed to develop a complete life history of williams through interviews,failed to collect necessary records or documentary evidence,and further failed to present this to a licensed psychologist and then to develop a cohesive theory of mitigation.
in light of all this evidence,the attorneys preparation was wholly inadequate.williams attorneys not only failed to speak with his core family members,who were willing to testify on his behalf,but also failed to make efforts to obtain records to learn and gather the background information necessary to support their own theories of mitigation.indeed,the attorneys did not even attempt to contact williams mother,nor did they contact his other sister pamela,or his mother sister and his aunt shirley boykin,who had lived with williams and his family at one point,all of whom asserted that they would have testified on williams behalf if asked.
had williams attorneys simply discussed williams life with core family members such as his mother,his sister pamela,and his aunt shirley,and interviewed williams sister deborah for more than a mere five minutes,they likely would have discovered the following possible mitigating information that williams mother often chose abusive partners,including williams stepfather,and that williams witnessed some of this abuse,including at least one instance in which williams mother was hospitalized,see at schmidt goessling aff,deborah williams aff,shirley boykin aff.that williams father smoked marijuana and sold large quantities of marijuana in his store,see at deborah williams aff,robert thomas aff,shirley boykin aff.that williams was using drugs as serious as cocaine by age thirteen,see at deborah williams aff.that only one of the five williams children had graduated from high school,see at bonnie williams aff,pamela williams aff.and that,as a child,williams was whipped as often as three or four times a week by his father,including with a switch,belt,and extension cord,see at pamela williams aff.the attorneys may have also obtained information from williams relatives that is in direct contradiction to the harmful testimony given by lewis williams,who claimed during the sentencing phase that,although absent from the home,he was there for williams whenever he could be there.the record is replete with sworn statements from relatives and friends indicating the exact williams father was not there for any of his children.see,at deborah williams aff.my father was there for us dad was never there for us.furthermore,his attorneys likely would have discovered additional information that schmidt goessling had learned in the process of reviewing williams life history,such as the fact that williams was sexually molested by a cousin when he was five or six years old and that williams had prostituted himself with men for money when he was a teenager.see at aff.
finally,had williams attorney taken the time to obtain williams school,juvenile,and treatment records they would have discovered that williams mother had sought psychological treatment for him at the child diagnostic center at the age of more importantly,the attorneys may have obtained the very records needed to give a meaningful presentation of one of their mitigation theories as identified by the district court,that the juvenile justice system had failed williams.such records would have detailed exactly how the system had failed williams,including its failure to meet his psychological and emotional needs.see at aff.providing an explanation for why juvenile facilities reinforced williams criminal behavior,rather than rehabilitated him.
in sum,had the attorneys met the minimal standards of investigation necessary to obtain relevant mitigating information,see kimmelman,at.they could have presented relevant mitigating information to the jury.the attorneys failed,however,to perform an adequate investigation and instead unreasonably limited the number of persons they interviewed and neglected to prepare even those persons for their testimony at the sentencing hearing.therefore,i would hold that williams has sufficiently demonstrated that his attorneys inadequate investigation and preparation of mitigation evidence constituted deficient performance under the first prong of the strickland test.see,williams,at.concluding that the state supreme court decision was contrary to and an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent in strickland where t he record establishe d that counsel did not begin to prepare for the sentencing phase of the proceeding until a week before the trial and failed to conduct an investigation that would have uncovered extensive records graphically describing the defendant nightmarish childhood,not because of any strategic calculation but because they incorrectly thought that state law barred access to such records.
presentation of evidence during sentencing phase 
i also believe that williams has sufficiently demonstrated that his attorneys presentation of evidence during the sentencing phase was inadequate under the performance prong of the strickland test.specifically,i believe that,as a result of their poor investigation and preparation of mitigating evidence,williams attorneys gave an objectively unreasonable presentation of the mitigating evidence during the sentencing phase of williams trial 
to begin,the opening statement of williams counsel was at best neutral,consisting in its entirety only of the following three sentences,in which counsel stated 
ladies and gentlemen,there will be a number of witnesses who will be before you to give some testimony with reference to the background of lewis williams.i will ask you to listen to their testimony carefully.it is our view that it is extremely important that you do and that you weigh it as you do other evidence and follow the instruction that the court will give you about lewis williams.thank you.
at.inexplicably,counsel did not even begin the sentencing hearing with a request for mercy on williams.
the body of counsel presentation of the witnesses testimony during the sentencing hearing was equally deplorable and reflected little preparation.for example,defense counsel failure to prepare deborah williams for her testimony and to explain the purpose of mitigating evidence to her significantly hurt williams because it resulted in deborah omission of valuable mitigating evidence that she included in her affidavit from her testimony,including information concerning lewis williams,absence from and lack of involvement in the lives of his children,see at deborah williams aff.williams witnessing the abuse of his mother by his stepfather,including one instance that resulted in his mother hospitalization,see at deborah williams aff.lewis williams,use of marijuana,see at deborah williams aff.and williams early use of cocaine at age,see at deborah williams aff.likewise,the prosecution of packnett revealed that defense counsel had no knowledge of packnett familiarity with williams.as the prosecution revealed,packnett hardly knew any facts regarding williams life after his childhood and was completely unaware of williams criminal history.packnett lack of familiarity with williams effectively erased any positive effect of her testimony.for while the jury could clearly see that packnett had good intentions in testifying on behalf of williams,the jury likely discredited her testimony that williams was an excellent fellow because of her complete lack of knowledge regarding williams criminal history.in essence,the jury likely felt that packnett supportive testimony for williams was completely negated by the fact that she was not even familiar enough with williams to know that he had spent time in jail.
more importantly,i believe that,as a result of the attorneys failure to investigate williams background properly,they failed to present meaningful evidence to support their two theories of mitigation during the sentencing phase that williams troubled childhood had led him to a life of crime and that the criminal justice system had let williams down by not rehabilitating him.after all,their first theory was meaningless without an actual presentation of the very troubled childhood that led williams to a life a crime,a childhood that the attorneys failed to support factually because they neglected to interview williams family members and to obtain his school and psychological records.likewise,their second theory was meaningless without an investigation and review of williams juvenile and prison records,which would have revealed more information about williams incarceration in state facilities,including details concerning any failed attempts of rehabilitation.in essence,without presenting evidence of a troubled childhood and information on the actual failures of the state criminal justice system,the attorneys questioning of williams and presentation of mitigating evidence,which revealed williams long history of juvenile and then adult crimes,and counsel closing argument spanning no more than three and a half transcript pages,in which counsel reiterated this long history,tended only to support a death sentence recommendation,as they did nothing to shift moral culpability away from williams.in fact,the district court suggested as much when it stated that the defense presented little if any relevant mitigating evidence to the jury at the hearing.at emphasis added.in conclusion,because of his attorneys failure to prepare witnesses and to gather necessary background information to support their mitigation theories,i would also hold that williams has sufficiently shown that his attorneys deficient presentation of evidence during the sentencing phase of his trial satisfies the performance prong of the strickland test.
finally,i believe that the ohio court of appeals unreasonably applied the legal standards of strickland when it determined that williams failed to show that he was prejudiced by his counsel performance during the sentencing phase.in my opinion,the performance of williams attorneys during the sentencing phase was so deficient that it undermined confidence in the jury recommendation of the death penalty.
as i previously noted,a jury must be permitted to consider mitigating evidence proffered by a defendant during the sentencing phase of a capital trial,and defense counsel must meet minimal standards of investigation to obtain such evidence for the jury.lockett,at.kimmelman,at.relying on strickland.in this case,williams attorneys failed to meet these minimal standards of investigation by unnecessarily limiting their investigation to two family members,one family friend,and one report from the court clinic.as i explained above,this,in effect,deprived williams of the opportunity to present any valuable mitigating evidence,all of which was easily accessible,to the jury during the sentencing phase and left nothing for the jury to weigh against the prosecution proof of aggravating factors.given the wealth of information that the attorneys could have presented regarding williams troubled life,see supra,and the ease with which the attorneys could have obtained such information,it is difficult to imagine how the attorneys failure to conduct a proper investigation and then present meaningful mitigating evidence did not prejudice williams.after all,the very reason for allowing a capital defendant to present mitigating evidence to a jury is so that the jury may consider and weigh these factors against the aggravating circumstances of the defendant offense to determine whether the defendant life should be spared.in this case,although defense counsel had two theories of mitigation,they failed to provide readily available factual support for both of their theories and,as a result,essentially left the jury with no choice but to recommend the death penalty.
not only did williams attorneys fail to present any meaningful mitigating evidence at the sentencing phase,they also placed harmful and damaging evidence before the jury.for example,because the attorneys failed to explain the purpose of mitigating evidence to williams father,lewis gave damaging testimony during the sentencing hearing when he failed to acknowledge his absence from williams life and how such absence contributed to williams troubled childhood and life of crime.lewis stated that whenever williams called him or anything,he was there.at.he also claimed,well as his father,i spent as much time as i possibly could,as i said.when he was away or was home,i would go over to visit him and keep a close contact with him as much as i possibly could,when it was possible.at.additionally,without the mitigating factual support to show why williams was led to a life of crime or how the criminal justice system had failed williams,the attorneys presentation of williams criminal track record as a juvenile and an adult was similarly damaging,as it suggested that williams was incapable of rehabilitation.
it was an objectively unreasonable conclusion to hold that the presentation of such theories of mitigation by defense counsel without any adequate investigation into,preparation of,and development of the factual foundation for the theories constituted effective assistance of counsel.as the supreme court noted in strickland,t hat a person who happens to be a lawyer is present at trial alongside the accused,however,is not enough to satisfy the constitutional command.strickland,at.the lawyer must assist the defendant in his trial and be an advocate for his cause.id.at.
in essence,in this case where counsel neglected to perform an adequate investigation of williams background to identify mitigating evidence and prepare witnesses,and,as a result,essentially presented no mitigating evidence to the jury for williams,it was an unreasonable application of the law established in strickland to hold that there was no reasonable probability that the jury would have arrived at a different outcome had counsel performance not been deficient.in fact,i believe that this case is strikingly similar to williams taylor,in which the supreme court concluded that the virginia supreme court decision regarding defense counsel performance during the sentencing phase and the prejudice resulting therefrom was both contrary to and an unreasonable application of its precedent.
in williams taylor,justice stevens,writing for six justices in part iv of his opinion,held that the defendant terry williams had been prejudiced by his counsel failure to investigate and uncover extensive records graphically describing terry williams nightmarish childhood,including the facts that that terry williams was borderline mentally retarded and did not advance beyond the sixth grade that terry williams parents had been imprisoned for the criminal neglect of terry williams and his siblings,that terry williams had been severely beaten by his father,that he had been committed to the custody of the social services bureau for two years during his parents incarceration including one stint in an abusive foster home,and then,after his parents were released from prison,had been returned to his parents custody that terry williams was commended for helping to crack a prison drug ring and for returning a guard missing wallet and that terry williams was considered by prison officials as the inmate lea
