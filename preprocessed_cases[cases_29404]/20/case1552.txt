petitioner james filiaggi,an ohio prisoner,appeals a district court order denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.the district court granted a certificate of appealability coa on two claims.in his first claim,filiaggi argues that his jury waiver was invalid because he was incompetent at the time it was made and because the trial court did not engage him in an adequate colloquy.second,filiaggi argues that the trial court should have found him incompetent during his trial.because we conclude that the ohio supreme court reasonably interpreted the facts of the case and reasonably applied clearly established federal law,we affirm the district court denial of filiaggi petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
the story of filiaggi crime,which is not relevant to his petition,is set forth in the ohio supreme court opinion,state filiaggi,ohio.our account begins with filiaggi first appearance in court.
on the first day of filiaggi trial,the stun belt used to restrain him as he was being transported to court misfired,resulting in what filiaggi refers to as his electrocution.inasmuch as filiaggi remains among the living,we will refer to the incident as an electrical shock.afterward,filiaggi was visibly shaken,his back was burned,and he suffered muscle spasms.the jail physician gave him ten milligrams of valium to ease his pain and to relax his muscles.because of this incident,the court delayed the start of his trial until the afternoon.during the afternoon session,filiaggi waived his right to a jury trial and elected instead to be tried to a panel.the next day,at the behest of defense counsel,the trial court ordered an evaluation of filiaggi competence to stand trial.thomas haglund examined filiaggi that afternoon.the court held a competency hearing the following day,and haglund testified,albeit it somewhat hesitantly,that filiaggi understood the proceedings against him,and was able to consult with his counsel and to assist them in preparing his defense.the court therefore held that filiaggi was competent to stand trial.filiaggi counsel disagreed and requested reevaluation.the court refused the request and the trial proceeded.the panel eventually found filiaggi guilty and sentenced him to death.
after procedurally exhausting his direct appeal and claims in the state of ohio,filiaggi filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court.the petition was denied.filiaggi state,d.in january,filiaggi filed this petition in the district court for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,asserting ten constitutional violations.the district court denied the writ but granted a coa on filiaggi first two claims whether he had knowingly,voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to a jury trial and whether he had been competent at the time of his trial.filiaggi did not attempt to expand the coa in this court,and he appeals only the two claims for which the district court granted a certificate.
standard of review 
the provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa apply to filiaggi petition.lindh murphy,d holding that aedpa applies to petitions filed after april.title sets out the requirements for a grant of habeas relief 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented at the state court proceedings.
under the contrary to clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.
williams taylor,d.a federal habeas court may not issue a writ under the unreasonable application clause simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.bell cone,d quotation omitted.if the state court decision does not squarely address the federal constitutional issue in question,but its analysis bears some similarity to the requisite constitutional analysis,we must carefully review both the record and the applicable law,and we may reverse only if we conclude that the state court decision is contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law.maldonado wilson,cir.
when reviewing a district court decision to grant or deny a writ of habeas corpus,we review de novo the court legal conclusions and its own factual findings for clear error.smith hofbauer,cir.like the district court,we must presume that factual determinations made by the state court are correct,unless the habeas petitioner has rebutted them by clear and convincing evidence.see e.
ii.jury waiver 
filiaggi argues that his waiver of a jury trial was not knowing,voluntary or intelligent.specifically,he asserts that,due to the electrical shock,he was not competent at the time of the waiver.he also asserts that his attorneys did not inform him that the waiver would make certain errors,such as evidentiary errors,essentially unreviewable on appeal.finally,he argues that the trial court did not engage him in a sufficient colloquy.
because the right to a jury trial is fundamental,duncan louisiana,d,filiaggi waiver of that be have been knowingly,intelligently and voluntarily made.edwards arizona,d.the clearly established supreme court precedent at the time that filiaggi waived his right to a jury trial,as well as at the time that the ohio supreme court held that his waiver was valid,required only that the waiver be consented to by the government and sanctioned by the court,and that it reflect the express and intelligent consent of the defendant.patton united states.as the court explained a decade later 
the patton decision left no room for doubt that a determination of guilt by a court after waiver of jury trial could not be set aside and a new trial ordered except upon a plain showing that such waiver was not freely and intelligently made.if the result of the adjudicatory process is not to be set at naught,it is not asking too much that the burden of showing essential unfairness be sustained by him who claims such injustice and seeks to have the result set aside,and that it be sustained not as a matter of speculation but as a demonstrable reality.
adams united states ex rel.mccann.filiaggi therefore has the burden of demonstrating that he did not expressly and intelligently consent to waive a jury trial and that the ohio supreme court judgment to the contrary is either an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent or contrary to that precedent,or resulted from an unreasonable interpretation of the evidence presented to the state courts.
the ohio supreme court held in state filiaggi,ohio,that filiaggi claims that his waiver was not valid were meritless.the court first held that there was no requirement that a trial court interrogate a defendant in order to determine whether he or she is fully apprised of the right to a jury trial that the trial court failure to make inquiry of filiaggi as to whether he understood the presumption of correctness that attached to the findings of the panel was therefore not error and that the trial court reading aloud of the written waiver and ensuring that it reflected filiaggi desire,was all that was required.id.at.the court went on to hold that 
the record supports defendant claim that he was shocked by the stun belt however,the record does not indicate the voltage level.the record also indicates that the trial judge stated the defendant is shaken,and he may be on valium.the court took a recess directly after this incident for the remainder of the morning,and the court then reconvened at immediately upon reconvening,the parties addressed the subject of the waivers and made opening statements.nothing indicates that defendant was unable to make a decision concerning the jury waiver.defendant was represented by three attorneys,one of whom was a physician,and they never indicated that defendant would not be able to waive his right to a jury.further,while defense counsel requested a mistrial and additional evaluations of defendant during the course of the trial alleging incompetence,they never asked the court to revisit the jury waiver issue.the record does not support defendant claim that his waiver was not knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.therefore,we overrule this proposition of law.
id.filiaggi makes three arguments to the contrary.
filiaggi first argues that the electrical shock left him too disoriented to make a valid waiver of his right to a trial by jury.he cites two items in evidence the trial court observation that he appeared shaken and had taken valium following the stun belt incident,and his own affidavit,made nearly a year after the incident,which states that he was severely disoriented at the time of the waiver.the affidavit also states,had i been conscious of what i was doing at the time,i would have wanted further clarification from the court of the consequences of my jury waiver.the record,however,supports the court findings,and filiaggi has not rebutted them by clear and convincing evidence.
filiaggi next argues that his waiver was not intelligent and voluntary because his counsel failed to discuss with him the appellate consequences of waiving a jury trial.specifically,he points to an affidavit of attorney james burge,in which burge stated that he did not explain to filiaggi that certain errors which might be deemed prejudicial by an appellate court if they occurred before a jury would be deemed harmless when they occur before a judge or a panel of three judges.burge also stated that,to the best of his knowledge,none of filiaggi other attorneys had explained this point to filiaggi.
we are aware of no supreme court filiaggi points to conditions the validity of a jury waiver upon a defendant understanding of the appellate process.furthermore,filiaggi has produced no evidence to suggest that he did not understand the basic workings of a jury trial.he does not allege that he was unaware of the substantive and procedural difference between a bench trial and jury trial when he gave his waiver.furthermore,the evidence that he points tohis own affidavit and the affidavit of his attorney,james only that filiaggi was unaware of the harmless error doctrine.because evidentiary errors affected by the doctrine are,by definition,harmless,filiaggi lack of familiarity with the doctrine does not affect the validity of his waiver.
finally,filiaggi argues that the trial court did not engage him in a sufficient colloquy during the waiver proceeding.we have held,under the standard,that t here is no constitutional requirement that a court conduct an on the record colloquy with the defendant prior to the jury trial waiver.united states martin,cir.in the case at hand,the trial court engaged in the following colloquy with filiaggi 
court and you waive your constitutional right to a jury trial 
defendant yes.
court i have the same entry,i,james filiaggi,defendant in the above captioned cause,hereby voluntarily waive and relinquish my right to a trial by jury and would elect to be tried by a judge of the court in which said cause may be pending.i fully understand that under the laws of this state i have a constitutional right to a trial by jury.and your signature appears there.is that your signature 
defendant yes,sir.
court is it your desire to have the aggravated murder tried by three judges,judge kosmas sic glavas and judge frank horvath and myself,and it will require three judges to render a verdict in this matter and that is the one count.is this your desire 
defendant yes.
filiaggi points to no supreme court established at the time the ohio supreme court ruled that his waiver was valid or,for that matter,any colloquy,much less more explicit colloquy than was conducted here.filiaggi argues only that he was unaware of the consequences of his waiver on appeal he does not claim that he did not understand that he was giving up the right to be tried by a jury.
the ohio supreme court concluded that filiaggi waiver of his right to trial by jury was knowing,voluntary and intelligent.filiaggi has failed to demonstrate that the court judgment is contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent that was clearly established at the time that judgment was entered,or that the ohio supreme court judgment was based on an unreasonable interpretation of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of habeas relief on this ground.
iii.competence 
having concluded that the state did not err in finding filiaggi jury waiver constitutionally sufficient,we now turn to the question of whether filiaggi was competent to stand trial.filiaggi argues that continued medical and psychological trauma from the stun belt shock required the trial court to conduct multiple evaluations of his competency.
haglund,a clinical psychologist,evaluated filiaggi competence on the day following the stun belt incident.filiaggi and haglund discussed the stun belt incident,filiaggi incarceration,his court proceedings and his treatment for mental disorders.during that interview,filiaggi was mentally alert and oriented.filiaggi,at.in addition,haglund testified that filiaggi was able to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him,to consult with his lawyers and to assist in preparing and presenting his defense.as a result,the trial court concluded that filiaggi was competent to stand trial.
although filiaggi counsel challenged his competence a number of other times during the trial,they presented no additional information regarding his behavior until they filed a motion for a new trial.filiaggi,at.in an affidavit filed with that motion,a psychiatrist who examined filiaggi four days after the incident stated that it was his unequivocal opinion that filiaggi was incapable of participating in his own defense for at least two days following his the shock.the psychiatrist described filiaggi as aggressive,confused,disoriented,and often nonresponsive to simple verbal questions filiaggi also submitted affidavits of two of his three attorneys stating that he was foaming at the mouth and often in an agitated,catatonic stupor.the trial court gave little weight to the submissions and noted that at the time of his jury waiver,filiaggi was functioning with all of his faculties and with the blessing of all three of his lawyers.order denying motion for a new trial,january,at.noting that defense counsel had repeatedly claimed that filiaggi was incompetent to stand trial but had never brought to the court any evidence to support those claims,the court reviewed the evidence and found that filiaggi was malingering.
during the second day of the trial the state represented that the defendant attended the trial the day before,was functioning normally,and had his breakfast.the state argued that there was no representation from the defense that the defendant was not able to understand the conversations he had with burge regarding coming to court or voluntarily waiving his absence.the state argued on the record that the defendant was able to visit with and confer with his minister,and that the defendant was functioning normally until it was time to come to court.the state related that the defendant ate at the appropriate time,and at,the night before requested an attorney call and engaged in a very lengthy conversation with his lawyer.again,the defense did not refute these claims 
the court took testimony from a deputy that was guarding the defendant during the noon
