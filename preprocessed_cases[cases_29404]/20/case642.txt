this appeal requires that we determine whether denorris mahone conviction for making terroristic threats under of title of the pennsylvania crimes code constitutes a crime of violence under united states sentencing guideline a.we conclude,based on the record before us,that mahone conviction qualifies as a crime of violence.for that reason,we will affirm the judgment of the united states district court.
mahone pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.a probation officer prepared a presentence report,which determined that mahone base offense level under a was because he had at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence cov or a controlled substance offense.mahone objected.he acknowledged that he had a prior conviction for a controlled substance offense.but he asserted that his base offense level should have been only because his conviction under pennsylvania law for making terroristic threats in violation of.did not qualify as a cov.
prior to sentencing,the district court issued a memorandum order and tentative findings and rulings.it concluded that mahone terroristic threats conviction qualified as a cov for purposes of a.thereafter,it sentenced mahone to a sentence of months of imprisonment,followed by a three year term of supervised release.this timely appeal followed 
mahone pleaded guilty to violating g.appendix a to the sentencing guidelines specifies that governs the computation of the offense level for g offenses.guideline a provides that the base offense level is,if the defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a cov or a controlled substance offense.the commentary to instructs that cov has the meaning given that term in a and application note to that guideline,cmt.section of the sentencing guidelines defines the term cov as,inter alia,any offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.a.
in resolving the question of whether making terroristic threats in violation of.satisfies the definition of cov in a,we must employ the formal categorical approach applied by the supreme court in taylor united states,d this approach mandates that we look only to the statutory definition of the prior offense,and not to the particular facts underlying that conviction.id.at.our inquiry focuses on the elements and the nature of the offense of conviction,not the details of the crime actually committed.leocal ashcroft,d.
the offense of making terroristic threats is set forth in.in,when mahone pleaded guilty to violating,the statute made it unlawful for a person to 
threaten to commit any crime of violence with intent to terrorize another or to cause evacuation of a building,place of assembly,or facility of public transportation,or otherwise to cause serious public inconvenience,or in reckless disregard of the risk of causing such terror or inconvenience.
like the offense of burglary in taylor,at,the statutory offense of making terroristic threats in is broader than the definition of cov in a.section encompasses some crimes that could be committed by using,attempting to use,or threatening to use physical force against the person of another,as well as against another person property.a property offense,however,does not qualify as a cov for purposes of the sentencing guidelines.as a result,it can not be said that the offense of making terroristic threats under categorically qualifies as a cov under a.
our inquiry does not end at this point,however,for there are two exceptions to the formal categorical approach.in singh ashcroft,we explained that the first exception applies when the terms of the federal statute enumerating categories of crimes,which warrant application of the sentencing enhancement,invite inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the conviction at issue,cir see nijhawan holder,d recognizing that some statutes require application of a circumstance specific approach.the second exception arises when the statute of conviction is phrased in the disjunctive,singh,at,and it is unclear what elements formed the basis for a defendant underlying conviction.evanson attorney,cir.statutes phrased in the disjunctive are akin to,and can be readily converted to,statutes structured in outline form,with a series of numbered or letter elements.id.the disjunctive wording or outline formatting presents either separate subsections that describe distinct offenses with distinct punishments,or alternate types of conduct or variations of the same offense,with no difference in punishment.see also garcia attorney,cir.
when the enumerating statute invites inquiry or the statute of conviction is phrased in the disjunctive,the sentencing court applies a modified approach,rather than the formal categorical approach.taylor,at.this modified approach permits a court to look beyond the mere fact of conviction,taylor,at,in order to determine which statutory variation was the basis for the conviction.johnson united states,d.if the prior conviction was the result of a guilty plea,as it was in mahone case,this modified categorical approach allows the court to examine the charging document,the terms of a plea agreement,or the transcript of a plea colloquy to determine whether a defendant plea of guilty to an offense necessarily admitted elements which constitute a cov under a.shepard united states,d.
in this case,the exception for disjunctive statutes of conviction applies.in,the pennsylvania legislature amended,placing the original definition of the offense of making terroristic threats in subsection a and adding subsections b and c,which pertained to restitution and the preservation of private remedies,june.the following year,was further amended by breaking the substantive description of the offensive conduct in subsection a into numbered parts,an outline.see.as amended,a provides 
a offense defined.a person commits the crime of terroristic threats if the person communicates,either directly or indirectly,a threat to 
commit any crime of violence with intent to terrorize another 
cause evacuation of a building,place of assembly or facility of public transportation or 
otherwise cause serious public inconvenience,or cause terror or serious public inconvenience with reckless disregard of the risk of causing such terror or inconvenience.
a.we conclude that the pennsylvania legislature division of the statute into numbered sections in the amendment reflects that was divisible,describing three variations of the same offense.
because the version of that existed in at the time of mahone conviction could be converted into an outline form,our next step is to determine whether a violation of some of those sections,but not others,would constitute a cov.joseph attorney,cir.viewed in outline form,it is only a which might qualify as a cov under federal law as it is the only variation that requires at a minimum the threatened use of physical force against the person of another.see a emphasis added see also united states ortiz gomez,cir noting that it is apparent from the statute face that one or more of those offenses do not have as an element the threatened use of physical force against the person of another.parts and of subsection a of the pennsylvania statute could be proven by establishing that there was a threat to use force against the property of another,as opposed to the person of another.furthermore,a is the only subpart that would always require a showing of intentional conduct as opposed to reckless or negligent conduct,which would be insufficient to establish the intent necessary for a cov.see singh gonzales,cir explaining that the use of force component for a cov under a,which is similar to a,requires specific intent and that mere recklessness is insufficient citing tran gonzales,cir united states otero,cir reiterating that categorical crimes of violence require intentional conduct against another rather than reckless or grossly negligent conduct.
we can not conclude at this step in our analysis that the statutory variation in a categorically qualifies as a cov under a because this v
