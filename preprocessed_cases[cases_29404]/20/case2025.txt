emmanuel page appeals the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.see.the district court held that the last decision rendered on the merits by the state courts,the court of appeals of wisconsin decision of may,was based on an independent and adequate state procedural ground and therefore barred collateral review in the federal courts.because we are in respectful disagreement with that determination,we must reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.
backgrounda.facts 
in,page was convicted in the circuit court for milwaukee county,wisconsin,on two counts of intentional homicide and one count of attempted armed robbery.these charges were based on the deaths of felix rodriguez and daniel valentin.in the state trial court,page was represented by attorney andrew mishlove.only one witness to the crime,john guirau,testified in the state case.guirau stated that,on august,he was in his apartment with some friends,including the two decedents.an old friend of guirau,caprice summers,appeared at the door and informed the occupants that he had a friend outside who was interested in selling an assault rifle.valentin indicated an interest in the weapon guirau therefore invited summers and his three friends,including page,into the apartment.according to guirau,at some point during the ensuing negotiations over the weapon price,page pulled a gun,pointed it at guirau head and announced a robbery.summers and rodriguez then began struggling for control of the.guirau testified that page fired at him but missed.guirau also believed that he heard the fire during the struggle.he heard five shots fired,but he did not see page shoot anyone.
at trial,the most incriminating evidence that page was the shooter was his alleged confession in the handwriting of detective sliwinski,one of the two officers who had questioned page at the police station.the document provided two places for the suspect to sign,one indicating that the individual agreed to waive miranda rights and to provide a statement and the other affirming the accuracy of the statement.page had signed neither,and the document provided no explanation for this omission.page testified at trial that he had invoked his miranda rights but that the officers nevertheless had continued to question him and to ask him to sign a number of statements he had refused to do so.detective sliwinski testified that page had agreed to make a statement,had agreed to its accuracy,but nevertheless had refused to sign the form.
page filed a motion to suppress the alleged confession on the ground that the statement had been procured through a violation of page miranda rights however,at the suppression hearing,counsel neither briefed the issue nor invited the court attention to any relevant case law.the trial court determined that,as a matter of law,the statement lack of signatures went to credibility and not admissibility.the trial court then denied the motion to suppress the statement without addressing the miranda issue.during the suppression hearing,mishlove neither submitted any documentary evidence nor called any witnesses other than page.page eventually was convicted on all counts and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences.at that stage,mishlove withdrew from the case.he was replaced by new counsel,robert kagen.
following page conviction,attorney kagen filed a postconviction motion in the state trial court.see.stat.this petition presented only one issue whether certain jury instructions regarding lesser included offenses should have been given.kagen did not challenge the effectiveness of trial counsel or the admission of the alleged confession.the trial court denied the postconviction motion.
attorney kagen then filed a brief in the court of appeals of wisconsin.see anders california,d.counsel brief presented three issues page filed a pro se response that raised two additional issues.none of these issues addressed the allegedly improper confession,the miranda violation,or the effectiveness of trial counsel.on july,the court of appeals of wisconsin granted the anders motion,permitted counsel to withdraw and affirmed the trial court decision after reviewing the record and finding no issues of arguable merit.
page,proceeding pro se,then filed a second postconviction motion in the wisconsin trial court this motion was filed under wisconsin statute.the motion asserted several constitutional claims,including ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel for failing to raise the miranda violation,a confrontation clause claim,and an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim.the state trial court denied the motion it stated that the issues presented had no merit and further reasoned that,as a consequence,neither of page attorneys had been deficient in failing to raise them.the state trial court also denied the motion on the ground of procedural waiver because the issues had not been raised in the briefs on direct appeal.the state trial court further concluded that page could not overcome the waiver because he had not shown good cause for failing to raise these issues on the direct appeal.
page,continuing to act pro se,then filed in the court of appeals of wisconsin an appeal of the trial court denial of his motion.the court of appeals of wisconsin affirmed the trial court order on may.it stated that page was procedurally barred by the supreme court of wisconsin ruling in state.the court then divided its analysis of page claims into those waived and those denied on the merits.the court determined that page had waived his confrontation clause claim,his miranda claim,and his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim because he failed to raise these issues in his response to the brief on direct appeal.the court provided a rationale for denying page ineffective assistance of counsel claim by holding that the underlying issues previously had been decided to be meritless and therefore need not be reviewed again.
district court proceedings 
page next filed a pro se petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus in the united state district court for the eastern district of wisconsin.he raised several constitutional issues,including ineffective assistance of trial counsel.specifically,he argued that his counsel was ineffective in presenting these constitutional challenges before the wisconsin courts.see at.the district court denied the petition.the court took the view that the ineffective assistance of counsel claims had been procedurally defaulted and that federal review therefore was barred.
on september,a judge of this court issued a certificate of appealability certifying three issues 
whether the state appeals court decision that petitioner waived his ineffective assistance of counsel claims rested on an adequate and independent state procedural ground or whether the decision relied on the merits such that the federal claims were preserved for review.see moore bryant,cir.
whether the state appeals court decision that petitioner waived his ineffective assistance of counsel claims by not raising them in response to appellate counsel report pursuant to anders california,d,was adequate and independent.wilkinson cowan,sic cir.
whether petitioner various attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the united states constitution with respect to petitioner miranda arizona,d,claims.

discussion 
a federal court entertaining a petition for a writ of habeas corpus will not review a question of federal law if it determines that the state decision rests on a state procedural ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.see moore bryant,cir braun powell,cir.simply stated,the independent and adequate state ground doctrine bars federal habeas when a state court has declined to address a prisoner federal claims because the prisoner has failed to meet a state procedural requirement.moore,at quoting coleman thompson,d.in assessing whether a state court ruling is based on an independent and adequate determination of state law,the federal court must refer to the decision of the last state court to have ruled on
