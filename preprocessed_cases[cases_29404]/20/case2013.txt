donald wallace killed an entire family in cold blood.he broke into a house to commit a burglary and found the occupants at home.he tied up the parents and shot each in the head to prevent them from identifying him.then he shot both children to stop them from crying.this crime,the culmination of a long criminal career,led to a death sentence.the supreme court of indiana affirmed,and rejected wallace bids for collateral relief.wallace filed his federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus before enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,which therefore does not apply.see lindh murphy,d.the district court denied wallace petition.dist.lexis.
capital punishment may be imposed in indiana only if one or more aggravating factors exists.whether such a factor has been established beyond a reasonable doubt is for the is true as a matter of both state law and constitutional command,see ring arizona,d but once it finds aggravating circumstances and makes a recommendation about the appropriate punishment the ultimate decision is in the judge hands.see schiro farley,d describing indiana system and rejecting constitutional challenges to its operation.the jury found that wallace had committed murder with aggravating circumstances and recommended capital punishment.the judge imposed that sentence after agreeing with the jury that two aggravating factors murder during the course of another felony,and multiple murders and no mitigating factors had been established.in the course of evaluating the appropriate penalty,the judge mentioned many additional facts that wallace had committed the murders while on parole,that he displayed a total disregard of human life,that there was no provocation whatsoever for his acts,and that he had a long history of serious criminal conduct.the judge listed offenses for which wallace had been arrested or convicted.
after the judge sentenced wallace to death,two of these were set aside on the ground that,when taking wallace guilty pleas,the judge had not informed him of all rights being waived in the process.wallace had completed his sentences for those offenses,so there was no occasion to determine whether valid convictions could have been obtained.the vacatur sets up wallace principal argument that by relying on invalid aggravating factors the sentencing judge violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.the invalid component of this phrase reflects the fact that the convictions were annulled,see johnson mississippi,d,though whether wallace committed and could have been convicted of those crimes remains an open question.the component of the phrase reflects the fact that prior convictions are not statutory aggravating factors in indiana.the gist of the argument is that it is bad if not always forbidden for a judge to rely on factors,and,if this is to be done at all,reliance must be placed on true rather than false considerations.
the district court responded that,even if the convictions are assimilated to aggravating factors and vitiated in conformity with johnson,there remain two uncontested aggravating factors murder in the course of burglary,and multiple murders.these support the sentence and make it unnecessary for the state judiciary either to hold a fresh sentencing proceeding or to consider expressly whether reliance on the vacated prior convictions was harmless.the district court relied on zant stephens,d,and wallace contends that this was a mistake although zant holds that use of an improper aggravating factor may be harmless,wallace insists that only the state judiciary may evaluate the error consequences,because only the state judiciary is empowered to weigh the evidence.see sochor florida,d clemons mississippi,d.this supposes,however,that the state court itself initially weighed an invalid aggravating factor against some proper mitigating factors.when this occurs,reweighing is a job for the state.it is not what occurred here.the state judge did not find any mitigating factor to be weighed against the aggravating factors there is no to do.
this is why the district judge deemed the matter one of harmless error and looked to zant rather than sochor and clemons.and if the right question is whether any error was harmless,the answer must be yes.when an improper aggravating factor is entangled in some way with the,for example,improperly excluded evidence would bear on multiple it is improper for a federal judge to evaluate the error because it is impossible to tell whether,but for the error,the defendant would be eligible.but if the factors are independent,then one error may be isolated without affecting the validity of the sentence.zant was predicated on the fact that even after elimination of the invalid aggravator,the death sentence rested on firm ground.two unimpeachable aggravating factors remained and there was no claim that inadmissible evidence was before the jury during its sentencing deliberations or that the defendant had been precluded from adducing relevant mitigating evidence.tuggle netherland,d.one may say the same here.two unimpeachable aggravating factors support the sentence,and neither factor was affected in any way by the judge belief that wallace had committed a particular number of additional offenses earlier in his criminal career.
wallace case is easier to resolve than either zant or tuggle,because his favorite phrase invalid aggravating factor language that the supreme court has never used except when quoting from another court decision,see jones united states,d glosses over the fact that,in indiana,prior criminality is not an aggravating factor in the first place.indiana distinguishes between aggravating factors,at least one of which is essential to establish eligibility for capital punishment,and other considerations that may influence the exercise of discretion once eligibility has been established.only statutory aggravating factors matter to the eligibility decision.after ring,the distinction between facts that determine eligibility and those that influence the exercise of discretion is constitutionally based the former decision must be made by the trier of fact under the standard,while the latter decision may be entrusted to a judge on the preponderance standard,and with relaxed rules of evidence.
the problem in cases such as johnson,zant,and tuggle arose because an accused was declared eligible for capital punishment on grounds that may have been erroneous,and it became essential to know whether,with the invalid ground sheared off,the accused still would be eligible.if several grounds of eligibility are related,it is hard to answer that question and sensible to insist that the state deal with the matter in the first instance.in this case,by contrast,wallace prior crimes played no role in the eligibility decision,so there is no puzzle to solve.the jury,which found two aggravating factors,never learned about wallace criminal history.and the judge,who did know about wallace past,distinguished between aggravating factors and other considerations.
the judge oral explanation of his sentence finds that two aggravating factors murder during burglary,and multiple murders have been established beyond a reasonable doubt,and that no mitigating factors are present.the judge did not mention wallace criminal history.the written explanation for the sentence does mention criminal history but clearly separates this from the aggravating factors.the judge made thirteen numbered findings.five are pertinent,and we reproduce them 
the aggravating circumstances alleged were 
a.that the defendant committed the murder of each victim by intentionally killing the victims while committing or attempting to commit burglary.b.the statutory references in the sentencing judge findings are to the version of indiana code,which was in effect at the time of his murders.
b.that the defendant committed three other murders,regardless of whether or not the defendant had been convicted of the other murders,in three instances in each count.b.
the court finds that the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that two aggravating circumstances exist that warrant the imposition of the death penalty 
a.that the defendant,donald ray wallace,murdered patrick gilligan,theresa gilligan,lisa gilligan and gregory gilligan while committing the crime of burglary on the day of january,in vanderburgh county,state of indiana.b.
b.that the defendant,donald ray wallace,murdered patrick gilligan,and then murdered theresa gilligan,lisa gilligan and gregory gilligan that the defendant,donald ray wallace,murdered,in order,after the murder of patrick gilligan,theresa gilligan,lisa gilligan and gregory gilligan.b.
that the aggravating circumstances set forth in paragraph eight above outweigh any mitigating circumstances offered under c.
the court has considered the jury recommendation to impose the death penalty,and bases the sentence here given on the same standard as required of the jury,that being that 
a.the state has presented beyond a reasonable doubt that two of the aggravating circumstances exist with the murders of patrick gilligan,theresa gilligan,lisa gilligan and gregory gilligan within b,and b all as set forth in paragraph eight and 
b.that any mitigating circumstances that exist within c are by the aggravating circumstances 
in addition to the requirements of,this court further finds 
a.that donald ray wallace,has recently violated the conditions of parole by killing the gilligan family while on parole from a prior sentence 
b.that donald ray wallace,had a long history of serious criminal conduct list with entries follows.
it is hard to see how the judge could have been clearer.two aggravating factors were charged,and both were found.neither factor is problematic.there were no aggravating factors.although wallace criminal history is not a statutory or any other kind of aggravating factor,this does not foreclose all mention of it,for what it may be worth,any more than the judge is forbidden to notice that wallace committed the murders while on parole or that wallace was an armed career criminal.to anathematize such considerations would not stop judges from thinking about them it would just drive them underground,which would benefit no one.
indeed,because the list of arrests and convictions was unrelated to any aggravating factor,the state court did not commit an error,harmless or otherwise.once a state has determined in a manner that a given person is eligible for capital good description of the eligibility decision for sentencing court is free to consider all other circumstances.graham collins,d eddings oklahoma,d lockett ohio,d.here the state judge lumped wallace arrests with his convictions,not distinguishing between the two or between juvenile and adult adjudications.the gist was that wallace is incorrigible.moving a given event from the conviction column to the arrest without definitive adjudication best way to understand what happened when wallace guilty pleas were deemed procedurally not undermine the point made in b of the state judge opinion.in cases there is no need to redo the sentencing every time a prior conviction that was taken into account later is challenged or annulled.see daniels united states,d custis united states,d.there is an exception for convictions obtained without the opportunity to have the assistance of counsel wallace does not contend that he lacked counsel when entering the pleas that later were vacated.nothing in johnson,sochor,or any other decision of the supreme court suggests that things are otherwise in capital prosecutions.the eighth amendment requires special protections,and assurance of regularity,when making the decision that the accused is eligible for capital punishment none of these decisions applies the same scrutiny to every sentence of a state court decision,even when the subject is something other than eligibility.if johnson and sochor are to be extended beyond the ascertainment of those aggravating factors that establish eligibility,that must be done by the supreme court on direct appeal given teague lane,d,a federal appellate court can not elaborate on doctrine in this fashion in a collateral attack.
thus we arrive at what seems to be the inevitable argument in capital cases that counsel at sentencing was ineffective.the charge is that wallace lawyer did not put on much mitigating evidence one uncle and two clerics.they did not persuade either the jury or the judge,who wrote that no evidence whatsoever was presented to show the existence of any mitigating circumstances which could be considered under c through excellent arguments and philosophical discussions of both hebrew and christian history and philosophy were heard and considered within c.subsection c as it stood in allowed the jury and judge to consider any mitigating circumstance not otherwise listed.today this is found in c.the strategy did not work in already reproduced the judge found that the aggravating factors outweighed the considerations allowed by subsection c.relying on wiggins smith,d,and hall washington,cir,wallace current lawyers contend that,instead of stopping with theology and a few personal details offered through the uncle,counsel should have tried to create some sympathy through evidence about wallace unhappy upbringing and the possibility that wallace suffered from some form of mental illness,though not enough to support an insanity defense or demonstrate incompetence to stand trial.
current counsel argument supposes,however,that it was possible to offer evidence consistent with both the facts and the attorney ethical duties.as the district judge found,however,neither was true.the lawyers who represented wallace at sentencing testified in state proceedings that they investigated many potential witnesses who might have testified about wallace and mental state and could not find any,other than the uncle,who would do more good than harm.wallace friends and relations,counsel believed,would not be helpful.counsel thought that the witnesses who could testify to wallace past,character or family would not be able to withstand without losing ground for the defense.trial counsel further testified that wallace was not cooperative in the gathering of this information and did not want certain family members to testify at his trial.the only family member whom counsel asked to testify at the sentencing hearing was wallace uncle,because i think he comes across as objective and would have not made any absurd statements.dist.lexis at.one drawback,for example,is that wallace had bragged in prison about faking psychological problems.this evidence came out during a hearing held to inquire whether wallace was competent to stand trial.the state judge concluded that wallace had been faking and was competent.any effort to present evidence at sentencing would have allowed this into the record in response,undermining wallace chances.other lines of evidence would have brought wallace extensive criminal record to the jury attention.when counsel focuses on some issues to the exclusion of others,there is a strong presumption that he did so for tactical reasons rather than through sheer neglect.yarborough gentry,d.current counsel now try to overcome that presumption by contending that yet other potential witnesses could have been contacted and evaluated,but evidence to this effect was not presented at the hearing held in the state proceedings,and there is no persuasive reason why it was withheld.one evidentiary hearing is the norm the state did not hamper wallace ability to develop his factual position in the collateral litigation.
the absence of any additional only at sentencing but also during the be laid at wallace doorstep,and here is the source of counsel ethical problem.during the state proceedings,wallace testified that the paucity of evidence was his own preference.he told the state judge that counsel did in fact approach me and try to develop all these sources that they are prepared to present and at that time i forbid him to do that.he repeatedly asked me to do that,i repeatedly forbidden it.finally he acceded to my wishes.wallace had been examined and found to be competent to stand trial,which means that he also was allowed,if he insisted,to make major decisions about his defense.see godinez moran,d.if counsel had presented eviden
