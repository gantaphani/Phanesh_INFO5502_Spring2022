discussion 
we review de novo the district court denial of habeas corpus relief.in reviewing a state court decision,we may grant habeas relief only if the state adjudication of an issue 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the relevant decision is that of the last state court to review the,the supreme court of illinois.williams bartow,cir w e,like the district court,must evaluate the decision of the last state court to have adjudicated the petitioner claim on the merits.
hearsay statements 
the sixth amendment provides that a criminal defendant shall have the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.cookson submits that the admission of statements to wiese and gonzalez violated the confrontation clause because could not remember making the,indeed,ever speaking to wiese and gonzalez at therefore he could not her about them.he relies upon crawford washington,d,in which the supreme court held that the confrontation clause bars,in criminal cases,the admission of testimonial hearsay statements made by witnesses who are unavailable at trial.cookson submits that,although testified at trial,she was not available,for confrontation clause purposes,because she did not remember making the statements and therefore could not be about them.
cookson does not cite any cases holding that the confrontation clause bars admission of hearsay statements in circumstances such as these.he contends,however,that dicta in two federal court of appeals opinions support his position.in united states dicaro,cir,we wrote that a witness total amnesia concerning a prior statement will often make him not subject to for confrontation clause purposes.in united states spotted war bonnet,cir,the eighth circuit opined that if a child witness is so young that she can not be at all,or if she is simply too young and too frightened to be subject to a thorough direct or,the child mere physical presence on the witness stand will not satisfy the confrontation clause availability requirement.
the state responds that there is no confrontation clause problem with admission of the statements because cookson was able to at trial.the state points to language in crawford stating that when the declarant appears for at trial,the confrontation clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements.crawford,at.that language is not dispositive,however,because the supreme court elaborated on this statement two sentences later t he clause does not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it.id.emphasis added.cookson contention,of cours
