david murrell was charged and convicted of committing five counts of reckless injury in connection with a shooting that took place on october,in a nightclub known as the roxbury club,located in the city of milwaukee,wisconsin.after a trial,the jury found murrell guilty on all counts.murrell filed a motion for a new trial,arguing that his attorney failed to provide him with effective assistance at trial.after conducting multiple hearings in the matter,the state trial judge denied murrell motion for a new trial based on his claim of ineffective assistance.the trial court decision was affirmed by the wisconsin court of appeals.the wisconsin supreme court declined to accept the matter for review.thereafter,murrell launched a collateral attack on his conviction and the federal district court denied murrell request for habeas relief,finding that the wisconsin court of appeals decision could not be classified an unreasonable application of strickland.we affirm.
factual background 
around on october,a shooting took place at the roxbury club the club,in which some five gun shots were fired,resulting in bodily injury multiple gunshot wounds to four of the club patrons orlando williams,mario burrage,randolph harvey,and shawn bufford,as well as one of the club security guards,eddie murphy.a number of the victims were in serious condition when received at the hospital all of them have since been discharged.
after an investigation,the state charged david murrell and carl owens with five counts of reckless injury.judge diane sykes,the trial judge,upon motion of defense counsel at the close of the prosecutors case,dismissed the charge against carl owens based upon insufficient evidence.the case against murrell continued and after completion of the trial,the jury convicted murrell on all counts.
trial testimony 
at trial,prosecutors presented a plethora of testimony and other evidence pinpointing murrell as the perpetrator of the shootings resulting in the reckless injury crimes charged.jermaine burrage,whose brother was injured in the shooting,was an eyewitness to the event,and,consistent with a statement he gave police on the morning of the shooting,testified at trial that he saw murrell commit the crimes reckless injury.specifically,burrage recounted that,shortly before the shooting,he entered the men bathroom and saw murrell,who greeted him,stating,what up.soon thereafter,owens entered the bathroom and told murrell to give him the strap because it drama.day tr.at explaining that the word strap was slang for gun and the phrase it drama meant that something was going on like a fight or something.burrage testified that murrell pulled an automatic pistol out from under his sweater,moved the slide in preparation for firing,and exited the bathroom with owens,with the weapon in his murrell possession.burrage followed murrell and owens out the bathroom door and,as burrage was standing behind murrell,burrage saw murrell fir e the gun five or six times.id.at.
after the shooting,burrage waited with his brother until the flight for life helicopter ambulance arrived,and thereafter he proceeded on his own to the hospital where his brother was transported for emergency care.police officers meanwhile began an investigation at the nightclub,and although burrage was unable to give local authorities a detailed interview at the crime scene because of his travel to the hospital to see his brother,about seven hours later he contacted the milwaukee police and informed them that it was murrell who fired the weapon.
during trial,christopher davis,a security guard at the roxbury,also provided testimony that proved damning to murrell.davis testified that,immediately prior to the shooting,he was standing inside near the entrance to the club when an altercation broke out on the dance floor.he stated that,approximately three seconds after he had broken up the fight,he heard gunshots ring out behind him.davis immediately exited the club,positioned himself just outside the club front entrance and,while watching the entrance of the club,observed murrell walk out of the club very casually,clutching on his right side what davis believed to be a weapon.id.at.davis remarked at trial that murrell looked suspicious because as he exited the club,he was walking in a manner that was far too calm for one who had just been in very close proximity to the scene of the shooting.id.at.
davis testified that,upon observing murrell,he asked him to stop,and murrell started running and i chased behind him.id.davis trial testimony as to what transpired during the footchase was as follows 
murrell ran towards the club parking area,and he was running towards the parked cars.i asked him to stop again,and then at that point i saw him bring something out,and he shot it on the ground which was a gun,and he tried to toss it up under one of the cars there,but at that point i looked back to see if anyone else was around,and i saw danny believe that his last i screamed to him,hey,watch the gun,and i continued to chase.id.
davis further remarked that he identified the object tossed,as a gun when it hit the ground and in that instant was able to see that it was a black a glock.id.at.in fact,davis stated that,while in pursuit of murrell,he actually ran over the gun,and at this time recognized the make of the gun because he davis carr ies a glock him self in connection with his duties as a security guard.id.davis went on to explain that,in an attempt to catch up with the suspect,he continued to chase murrell through the club parking lot,across the street,and into a nearby parking lot northridge shopping center parking lot where he murrell was then apprehended by the milwaukee police department.id.at.thereafter,davis returned with a police officer to the location where he had previously seen the gun dropped id.at,and,within a minute or two,with davis assistance,the officer retrieved the glock that was later determined to have been used in the shooting.see infra at.
a number of police officers henson,arndt,and shaw provided testimony consistent with davis account of his pursuit of the suspect.officer gregory henson,a sergeant with the police department,testified that he was seated inside his squad car in the northridge parking lot about to yards west of the club entrance,and while talking to an officer in another squad car david arndt,he heard the sound of four to five shots come from inside the club.sergeant henson estimated that a pproximately three to four seconds later he observed a uniformed security person chasing another male westbound from the entrance of the club into the parking lot.day tr.at.he further stated that the two people he observed running were later identified as davis and murrell,and were the first two people he saw leaving the area of the club running through the club parking lot after he henson heard the five gun shots fired.id.at.
officer henson testified that,once murrell was apprehended,davis told me that the subject he had been chasing had dropped a weapon almost immediately after he had left the club next to a vehicle parked in the club parking lot.id.at.according to officer henson,immediately after the footchase id.at,davis led him back to the location in the parking lot where he had seen murrell drop the gun and remarked,this looks like the car that i ran between,at which time sergeant henson spotted the weapon laying there on the ground immediately next to the car.davis then informed henson that the gun lying there on the ground was the gun that he saw murrell drop glock.id.at.after murrell was taken into custody,henson estimated that,with davis assistance,it took him but a minute,minute and a half at most to find the glock.id.at.
at trial,a forensic expert testified that the markings and indentations on the cartridge casings recovered at the scene of the shootings were consistent with the glock gun found lying on the ground immediately next to the car,and retrieved by sergeant henson with the assistance of christopher davis.the expert stated that all of the casings discharged during the shooting w ere from the glock handgun recovered from the club parking lot.day tr.at.
officer david arndt,who was seated in his own squad car next to henson squad car when the shots rang out,also testified that,after hearing the gunshots,he went on broadcast radio and advised other tactical police units of the incident.id.at.arndt stated that,after he accelerated his car out of its parked position,he noticed that people were running out of the roxbury,and at that time had an opportunity to observe a uniformed individual davis chasing another black male murrell away from the club across the parking lot.id.at.officer arndt drove toward these two individuals and apprehended the subject murrell in the northridge parking lot the lot adjoining the club parking lot,see supra note.according to arndt,as he placed murrell in cuffs,davis came upon the scene and,while acting very excited,stat ed this guy murrell had thr own his gun to the ground immediately after he exited the club.id.at.
leroy shaw,a detective with the police department,took the stand and recounted an interview that he had conducted with christopher davis just two days after the shooting.detective shaw testified,as recorded in his interview report,that davis had advised him that he had chased murrell for some distance at which time he observed murrell drop the gun from his pants.day tr.at emphasis added.shaw also stated that,according to what davis had told him during the interview,another roxbury club security guard danny deneal had yelled out to davis,during the footchase,in an attempt to alert davis to the fact that he dropped a gun.id.
in further corroboration of davis testimony,detective shaw recounted that the club video tape which was established to have been filming the scene during the incident captured a uniformed security guard davis running out the door immediately after the shooting inside the club.id.at detective shaw also remarked that,after the security guard exit,you can see on the videotape someone murrell running out of the door clutching their right arm towards their side id.at emphasis added when the defense attorney asked detective shaw whether the man on the videotape exiting the club clutching his right arm wa s absolutely david murrell,detective shaw responded yes,that is david murrell on the videotape.id.at.
murrell took the stand,in his own defense,and in an attempt to distance himself from the possession of the weapon and even more so from the firing thereof,testified that he was in the bathroom of the roxbury club,gambling shooting dice,just prior to the shooting,and stated that owens never entered the bathroom to ask him for a gun.murrell also testified that on the night of the shooting he never had a weapon in his possession and that he left the bathroom on his own,to respond to a beeper message,and to try to get out of the bathroom because i won this money and i wanted to leave with it.id.at.murrell further stated that,as he was walking toward the phone,he heard the shots ring out,and dropped to the ground.
murrell did not see fit to comment on davis observation that he was acting too calm as he left the crime scene,nor did he say anything about the fact that he was observed to be clutching what the security guard believed to be a gun.murrell simply testified that he exited the club attempting to get away from the scene of the shooting,and claimed that he was unaware of the fact that davis was chasing him through the parking spite of the fact that davis had repeatedly asked him to stop.id.at i did know the little dude davis was chasing me.murrell alleged that,instead of running to get away from davis,he was running in order to get to his car,which he claimed he had parked in the northridge parking lot.
the jury,after hearing and weighing all of the testimony and evidence presented,and applying the judge instructions to the facts,found beyond a reasonable doubt that murrell was guilty as charged of all five counts of reckless injury set forth in the criminal information on file with the court.
motion for a new trial 
at a hearing held on june,and presided over by the trial judge diane sykes,murrell alleged that his trial counsel failure to present evidence of prior testimony given by christopher davis,failure to call danny deneal and briant horton to testify,and failure to determine the exact number of his prior convictions prior to trial,amounted to ineffective assistance at trial.
davis prior statement 
in support of his motion,murrell submitted a transcript of christopher davis testimony at his murrell probation revocation hearing,held on february,more than one year prior to murrell trial on the reckless injury charges.despite the fact that murrell submitted the transcript to support his theory that his trial counsel should have used the transcript to impeach davis at trial,a reading of the transcript reveals that davis testimony at the revocation hearing is,in nearly every respect,best classified as uniformly consistent with his trial testimony which,as far as davis credibility is concerned,is noteworthy considering the hearing and trial were held over a year apart and,each time,he was exposed to extensive and thorough direct and.at both the probation revocation hearing and at trial,davis testified that 
he was standing at the front of the club near the entrance when an altercation broke out day tr.at,rh tr.at 
he attempted to break up a fight between buck owens and another person,day tr.at,rh tr.at,after which time shots rang out day tr.at,rh tr.at 
he exited the club,and noticed that a person exiting after him later identified as murrell looked as if he was clutching his right side,and putting what davis thought was a firearm or,at trial,a weapon under his sweater day tr.at,rh tr.at,noting it was his right side 
davis immediately became suspicious of murrell,both because he murrell appeared to be tucking a weapon under his sweater,and appeared to be too calm for the situation,considering a shooting had just taken place inside the club day tr.at,rh tr.at 
his suspicions aroused,davis asked murrell to stop,but he murrell took off running day tr.at,rh tr.at 
as davis chased murrell,he either saw murrell drop the gun to the ground day tr.at or,put in a slightly different though not necessarily contradictory way,saw the gun on the ground right where murrell had just passed.rh tr.at.
the one difference between davis testimony at the probation revocation hearing and the testimony he presented during trial was that,rather than stating that he had seen the gun drop,he davis testified that,as he was chasing murrell,another security guard,danny deneal,hollered,he dropped the gun,which made him aware that murrell had dropped the gun,and caused him to look down,at which time he immediately observed the glock there on the ground,right where murrell had just passed id.emphasis added.
deneal testimony at the hearing 
in support of his motion for a new trial,murrell also theorized that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call to the stand danny deneal,the witness with the testimony.because deneal at one point allegedly told a private investigator that he had seen someone else other than murrell throw the gun down in the roxy parking lot,in all likelihood,murrell probably was hoping that deneal would give this similar account of the night events at the hearing.instead,on this occasion,deneal came up with still another story and testified that,just after the shooting,he and davis ran outside,and there was a glock laying under the car the gun was already there when we ran outside.it was already laying on the ground.pc tr.at.when asked at the hearing on direct examination whether he had see n anybody throw down the gun in the parking lot,deneal replied,no the gun was already there when we ran outside.it was already lying on the ground.id.at.during,deneal also claimed in spite of the fact that davis and a number of officers had testified extensively regarding davis participation in the footchase that he never saw davis chasing murrell after the shooting.id.at.
after deneal testimony at the probation revocation hearing,charles haase,an investigator with the public defender office,took the stand and it became clear that deneal had given haase still another entirely different version of the night events on a prior occasion.investigator haase recounted that on april,about three months prior to the hearing,and approximately one year after the trial,he interviewed deneal.according to haase,during this interview with deneal,deneal initially informed him that he had not seen who dropped the gun on the ground.then,during the same questioning,deneal took an around that statement and changed his story to reflect a statement he had previously given to he had seen the man who dropped the gun,and that the person was a bald,black male,around,who was not murrell.rh tr.deneal went on to elaborate that the bald man whom he had allegedly seen drop the gun had shortly thereafter driven by and pointed a shotgun at him this new addition to the story was not even included in his prior statement to the police.id.at.also during the interview,deneal went further beyond all realms of truthfulness and further expanded his most recent version of the night events and told haase that he remained with the gun,guarding it until milwaukee police arrived to tak e control of the evidence id.at this is not recorded in any police report 
despite the fact that haase testimony highlighted deneal tendency to repeatedly contradict himself,and to switch around and embellish the facts,murrell presented haase testimony at the hearing in support of his theory that the presentation of these statements deneal would likely have changed the outcome of his he failed to specify which version he would have used.
briant horton testimony 
along with the deneal theory,murrell also complained that his attorney should have called the newly discovered mystery witness,briant horton,at trial.horton,a associate of murrell,did not come forward with his account of the roxbury club incident until some five months after the night of the shooting.moreover,at the time he disclosed his purported information regarding the shooting,horton was an inmate in the milwaukee county jail,confined in the same area of the jail as murrell and had been in personal contact with murrell.we can not tell from the nature of the questioning in the record,nor can we fathom or understand why horton did not make known this purported information regarding his alleged witnessing of the shooting earlier,rather than some five months after the event,or,for that matter,why he suddenly had a change of mind and decided now to get involved at this late date.his explanation,if believable,was that although he initially did not want to get involved with the law,after he had seen murrell in jail and asked him what going on,what you locked up for,and he told me why he was in jail i told him,man,to tell your lawyer to contact me.i was there.pc tr.at.
at the hearing,horton testified that,on the night of the shooting,he was in the dance hall,standing at a phone booth,when he saw murrell exit the men bathroom.thereafter,according to horton,shots rang out,and when he first heard the shots,horton hit the ground and looked over at murrell,who was lying on the ground next to him.pc tr.at.horton claimed that,while he was lying on the ground next to murrell,he heard more shots,and was able to see murrell at that point and murrell was not firing the shots.pc tr.at.
despite murrell claim to have informed his trial attorney,ronald hendree,about horton willingness to testify,when asked whether horton name ever c a me up as a witness before or during the trial,hendree replied,i do remember horton at all.pc tr.at.on,hendree stated that if murrell had given him horton name as a possible witness,hendree woul d have tr ied to contact horton as best he could,but cautioned that the people who were allegedly in murrell company on the night of the incident are not people who you can pick up the phone book and just simply get their names.id.at.hendree testified that he had used his best efforts to track down all of the names of witnesses that murrell had provided him.id.thus,attorney hendree testimony placed in grave doubt murrell claim to have informed hendree about briant horton.
murrell history of prior convictions 
in his motion,murrell also challenged his trial counsel failure to determine the exact number of criminal convictions on his record before trial.the trial judge,in the absence of the jury,held a hearing regarding murrell criminal record in an attempt to settle the question.despite the fact that the court database listed six convictions,murrell the hearing and at he only had four separate convictions two counts of operating a vehicle without the owner consent,one misdemeanor count for possession of a controlled substance,and one conviction for fleeing from a police officer.when the parties were unable to reach an agreement or to stipulate to murrell prior record of criminal convictions,murrell continued to dispute the number of conviction s on his record at trial,maintaining that he had only four criminal convictions in his record 
the parties subsequently discovered after trial that murrell battery conviction had been overturned as he maintained and thus he had been convicted of only five of the convictions listed on the court database but they also determined that murrell had been convicted of another crime not listed on the court database murrell did in fact have six criminal convictions on his record rather than only the four that he admitted to at trial.thus,if murrell,during questioning by his own attorney,had admitted having six convictions on his record,he would not have been subject to on the nature of his prior record of convictions including the battery count.
ii.analysis 
standard of review of murrell ineffective assistance claim 
murrell claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel under the sixth amendment.to prevail on his ineffective assistance claim,murrell must demonstrate that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and caused him prejudice.strickland washington,d.in order to satisfy the prejudice requirement,murrell must establish that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.emphasis added.
our review of the state court adjudication of murrell ineffective assistance claim is governed by the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.codified at.under the aedpa,a state prisoner who petitions for a writ of habeas corpus must establish that the state court adjudication of his case was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d emphasis added.it is clear from the record before us,and our review of the law,that the wisconsin court of appeals properly identified and applied strickland as the proper legal standard governing murrell ineffective assistance claim.thus,unless we can hold that the state appellate court unreasonably applie d the strickland standard to the facts of the case,we are without authority to grant murrell petition for habeas relief.bell cone,d emphasis added.
the bar for establishing that a state court application of the strickland standard was unreasonable is a high one we have stated on prior occasion that only a clear error in applying strickland would support a writ of habeas corpus,dixon snyder,cir quoting holman gilmore,cir,because strickland calls for inquiry into degrees,thereby add ing a layer of respect for a state court application of the legal standard.whitehead cowan,cir emphasis added.accordingly,this court is obligated to affirm the district court decision to deny the writ,so long as the wisconsin court of appeals t ook the constitutional standard seriously and produce d an answer within the range of defensible positions.mendiola schomig,cir emphasis added.
additionally,in reviewing the state trial and appellate courts adjudication of an ineffective assistance claim,we must presume that all factual determinations made by the state courts,including credibility determinations,are correct,unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.see collier davis,cir we presume a state court factual determination to be correct unless it is rebut ted with clear and convincing evidence to the contrary e.this stands to reason,in light of the principle of jurisprudence that the trial judge is in the best position to judge the credibility of witnesses,united states woods,cir emphasis added,when indeed,the trial judge has the best opportunity to observe the verbal and behavior of the witnesses focusing on the subject reactions and responses to the interrogatories,their facial expressions,attitudes,tone of voice,eye contact,posture and body movements,as well as confused or nervous speech patterns in contrast with merely looking at the cold pages of an appellate record.id.emphasis in original quoting united states tolson,cir.we extend great deference to trial courts credibility determinations because such deference is mandated by congress under the aedpa,tolson,at discussing this court deference to a trial judge determination of acceptance of responsibility in the sentencing context,based on the same jurisprudential principle that the sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate witness credibility.see lindh murphy,d outlining the aedpa presumption of correctness of factual findings,and emphasizing the act highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings on collateral review.
as we have previously remarked,the criterion for assessing the reasonableness of a state court application of supreme court case law,pursuant to d,is whether the determination is at least minimally consistent with the facts and circumstances of the case.sanchez gilmore,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted,emphasis added.in this case,after conducting our review of the record,transcripts and state trial and appellate courts orders and opinions,we are convinced that the state courts adjudication of murrell claim was not only minimally consistent with the facts in this case,but indeed was wholly supported by the plethora of damning evidence presented against murrell.
davis alleged prior inconsistent testimony 
murrell,in spite of the overwhelming evidence of his guilt,contends that there is a reasonable likelihood that,if his counsel had presented during trial davis testimony from the probation revocation hearing more than one year prior to date of trial,as he did at the hearing,the outcome would have been different.murrell argument is that davis prior testimony from the probation revocation differed from his trial testimony only as to the exact split second when davis saw the gun as it left murrell hand and fell to the ground or just after it hit the ground would have impugned his general integrity at trial and directly challenged the most important part of his trial testimony,appellant br.at,namely,the link between murrell and the glock gun used in the shooting.we disagree.
davis general integrity 
murrell claims that davis prior testimony at the probation revocation hearing concerning the footchase would have impugned davis general integrity we disagree for it would have at most put in question but one single point in davis pages of trial testimony,namely,his statement that,as he pursued murrell during the footchase,he in fact saw him bring something out,and he shot it on the ground which was a gun.tr.at.
a comparison of the probation revocation hearing and trial transcripts reveals that the only discrepancy between davis description of the shooting and subsequent footchase at trial and his prior description of the event at the probation revocation hearing was regarding his observation of murrell he saw the gun just before it hit the pavement as it left murrell hand,or immediately after it fell to the ground.see supra at.when taken in the context of his overall testimony,this single reference to an alleged inconsistency between his trial testimony and prior probation revocation hearing testimony as to this split second in time is more accurately described as a difference that is but a matter of degree rather than a difference in kind.after all,davis prior testimony that he could say that he actually saw murrell drop it,pr tr.at,must be read in conjunction with all of his other statements concerning the gun possibly more than ten in number from the period in the time sequence when he had seen murrell clutching what he believed was a gun,to the instant during the footchase that another security guard deneal made him aware that murrell had dropped a gun,and at which point he looked down and saw the gun right at the spot that murrell had just passed reading davis probation revocation hearing testimony in its entirety,this prior statement was substantially the same as his claim to have actually seen the gun as it hit the ground as davis stated at trial and regardless whether he saw the gun at the split second it left murrell hand,or the fraction of a second when it hit or just after it hit the ground,the gun davis saw during the footchase was later positively identified by forensic experts,after thorough testing,photographing and examining,as the glock gun used in the shootings.see supra at.
it is important to note that it was amply clear,based on davis excited utterances to police officers just after the firing of the gun and the footchase,as well as the testimony he and time the circumstances of the footchase,that the combined events surrounding the shooting led davis to form the logical and reasonable belief that murrell was in possession of the gun as he left the club,and that murrell had dropped a glock during the footchase.see,day tr.at officer arndt testimony recounting that after murrell was apprehended,davis was very excited,and told him that murrell had thr own his gun to the ground after exiting the club.
it is also certainly very understandable for davis,having seen a glock gun right in murrell immediate path,having heard someone holler,he dropped it,and having observed no one else in the area other than murrell,to have properly and logically reaffirmed his belief that the subject he was chasing had dropped the gun.id.at.it is equally understandable that davis,in his excitement,stated to a police officer,immediately after the incident,that,while he was in hot pursuit of murrell with his eyes focused on the fleeing suspect,he had seen the gun drop,as he very well may have.id.at henson testimony that,with davis help,he was able to locate the glock gun in a minute or minute and a half at most and that davis indicated that the glock located in the club parking lot was the gun that he saw the person he was chasing drop.indeed,according to officer henson observation,davis and murrell were the first two people to leav e the area of the club after the shooting it is nigh unto impossible,under these circumstances,that the glock identified by forensic experts as having been the gun used in the shooting was thrown in the path of davis and murrell footrace by any person other than murrell.id.at.
finally,prosecutors presented corroborating evidence supporting davis claim and testimony that he was in continuous hot pursuit of murrell from the time he left the club immediately after the shooting and that,during that time,he saw murrell drop the gun.see supra at.davis initial recollection of murrell exit from the club clutching something under his arm at right side was bolstered by detective shaw testimony that the club videotape captured a uniformed security guard davis running out the door immediately after the shooting inside the club,as well as another individual who shortly thereafter exited the club clutching their right arm towards their side.id.at.see supra at.officers arndt and henson verified that they saw a uniformed black male chase another black male through the parking lot outside the club straight into the path of arndt squad car,where the individual,murrell,was apprehended.id.at see also day tr.at.and officer henson confirmed that,after murrell was taken into custody,the witness davis was immediately able to show henson the area where the weapon had been dropped and that henson almost immediately did locate a weapon there glock id.at,emphasis added.see supra at same gun identified by forensic experts as the weapon used in the shooting.
a reading of davis trial testimony in its entirety makes it more obvious that any variance was very minimal at best from his prior testimony at the probation revocation hearing more than one year before trial.because davis account of the incident was further corroborated with the statements of officers henson,arndt and shaw,we are convinced that davis would have remained a most credible witness,even if his prior testimony from the probation hearing had been presented.
linking murrell to the gun 
having established that davis prior testimony would not have affected his credibility,we turn now to the question of whether,as murrell claims,introducing davis prior testimony that he had not in fact seen the gun drop would have challenged the accuracy of the most important part of davis trial testimony.appellant br.at.murrell speculates that,if davis had been challenged on his claim to have seen the gun drop,there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different.but the single statement that murrell a split second time differential in murrell observation of the but a segment of one minute of what was,overall,a detailed,clear and convincing recitation of the facts,given by davis,corroborated by other law enforcement officers and proven beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the jury.and unfortunately for murrell,even without davis statement at trial that he in fact saw murrell drop the gun,davis clear,unequivocal and convincing testimony regarding murrell behavior just after the shooting,and his discovery of the gun right in murrell path of flight,combined with the corroborating testimony of other witnesses burrage,arndt,henson,forensic expert,as well as the videotape shaw,presented more than ample evidence to the jury and trial judge establishing that murrell was in possession of and used the glock weapon to perpetrate the shootings at the roxbury club.
notably,the state presented eyewitness testimony that murrell committed the crimes charged.as recounted above,burrage with a statement given to police the morning of the while he was in the men bathroom just prior to the shooting,he saw murrell pull out a glock gun and work the slide in preparation for firing it.burrage testimony provided a motive for the,that murrell had been informed by his friend owens that there was a fight going on,and that murrell was needed to attend to the situation by getting out the strap the gun.burrage also recounted that,after he followed murrell and owens out of the bathroom,he personally witnessed murrell fire five or six shots into the crowd 
even excluding davis single alleged inconsistent statement,his testimony linked murrell to the glock gun used in the shooting.as we have already explained,davis noticed that as murrell exited the club he was acting very suspicious because he appeared to be too calm considering what he had just witnessed,and that as supported by the club videotape he was tucking into his pants something that davis could have sworn was a gun.furthermore,davis testified that murrell refused to stop when davis asked him to,and at that time took off at an accelerated pace.according to davis,he either saw the gun drop trial or was made aware of the gun drop when he saw the glock on the ground and,indeed,he stepped right over the gun right at the place that murrell had just passed revocation hearing.in any case,davis observation of the glock gun right in murrell confirm his prior suspicion that murrell was the shooter too calm,tucking what he thought was a gun into his pants,and under his sweater at the beltline and that he was trying to discard the weapon in an attempt to do away with the most incriminating gun used in the shootings 
moreover,as discussed above,officer henson trial testimony,as well as davis probation hearing testimony,established that there was no other person in the club parking lot immediately after the shooting the time frame when davis observed the glock right in the immediate vicinity where murrell had just passed.see supra note and accompanying text discussing henson observations of the footchase.in the absence of any other persons in the area,it is most unlikely that anyone but murrell could have dropped the gun in the parking lot.
circumstantial evidence is of equal probative value to direct evidence and in some cases is even more reliable.united states reyes,cir internal citations omitted.in this case,prosecutors presented both circumstantial and direct evidence of murrell guilt,and one would be,in the face of this wealth of overwhelming evidence of murrell guilt,to find that there is a reasonable probability that davis previous testimony regarding the dropping of the gun would have resulted in a different outcome at trial.see strickland,at.to demonstrate prejudice,defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.after reviewing the record,the wisconsin court of appeals did not find that there was such a reasonable probability nor do we upon federal appellate review.we are convinced that,in light of the totality of the consistent and damaging testimony that davis presented both at the probation revocation hearing and at trial,the statements of the police officers,as well as the eyewitness testimony of jermaine burrage,the state court decision was both reasonable and proper.
deneal testimony 
neither was counsel trial decision not to present danny deneal testimony prejudicial.although deneal testified at the hearing that he saw a gun on the ground immediately after he exited the club after the shooting thus contradicting davis claim at trial that murrell did not discard the gun until after he took off on a footrace,deneal credibility had significantly diminished by that point,for he had changed his account of the incident some three times.because deneal testimony at the almost every single entirely inconsistent with the statement he deneal had given investigator haase on a prior occasion,we have no trouble agreeing with the dissent assessment that deneal was a thoroughly unreliable witness.dissent at.
at the hearing,deneal testified,contrary to one of his prior statements he had given police,that he did not see anyone throw the gun to the ground,and furthermore that the gun was already on the ground at the time that he exited the club.this version of events was dramatically different from the other story he had told investigator,that he saw a short,bald man not murrell drop the gun in the parking lot.we can not imagine that a defense attorney worth his salt would present a witness who had attested to three different versions of the night a feast for the prosecuting attorney on cross examination.indeed,given deneal penchant for switching,changing and altering stories to fit the need,who knows what sort of new thread of fabrication deneal would have manufactured had he been called to testify once again 
in any case,deneal claim that he happened to see the glock already on the ground,after he exited the club after the shooting,was incredible under the circumstances,given that the gun was not recovered by the police officer right outside the club,but rather in a parking lot immediately west of the distance away at least fifty feet from the entrance to the club right where the weapon was observed by davis during the footchase.tr.at.it is most unlikely that,in the pitch black of night,deneal would have been able to see a black gun lying on the parking lot pavement some fifty feet from the entrance of the club 
moreover,even if murrell counsel had presented deneal prior statement to investigator haase,by way of impeachment,that he had seen a bald,male not murrell drop the gun,and if counsel had also presented by impeachment davis prior revocation hearing testimony,there is still no reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different.after all,the dissent even admits that deneal was a thoroughly unreliable witness.dissent at.and furthermore,if deneal could not be trusted to tell the truth,when he was under oath,we fail to see how any report he gave outside the confines of the courtroom witness chair,when not under the penalty of perjury,would have been accepted by the jury or would have otherwise changed the outcome of the in light of the lack of evidence corroborating the statement and the number of times he changed his story at least three given the unbelievability of deneal testimony,it is quite unlikely that anything he said could,or much less would have affected the outcome of the trial deneal was simply incredible.thus,the wisconsin court of appeals conclusion that deneal testimony would not have altered the outcome of the trial was both reasonable and proper.
briant horton testimony 
the omission of briant horton testimony was similarly without prejudicial effect,because,although horton made a claim to have been with murrell during the incident,and to have observed murrell fall to the ground at the time of the a gun in his are convinced that the jury would not have accepted his statement.after all,the trial judge,whose factual determinations we must presume to be correct,e,made a specific finding that horton testimony wa s not credible and furthermore was not enough to undermine the strength of the eyewitness testimony given by davis and burrage.wisconsin murrell,no,at.may,emphasis added.
indeed,horton,the mystery witness,and the associate of murrell,did not come forward with his information until more than five months after the incident and,by that time,had an opportunity to confer with murrell while both were confined in the same area of the jail.see supra at.it is all too convenient for murrell that one of his associates,with whom he was confined,somehow surprisingly claimed to have evidence regarding the shooting that was exculpatory to murrell.
we have frequently held that the trial judge is in the best position to judge the credibility of witnesses who offer conflicting testimony,united states pitz,cir,insofar as the trial judge is in the best position to observe the testimony and behavior of the witnesses.see supra at.thus,in the habeas corpus context,we can not upset a factual finding of credibility by the state trial judge,without running afoul of applicable law.see mendiola,at discussing applicability of e to state court credibility determinations.deferring,as we stated earlier we must,to the state court finding that horton was not credible,we believe that the state appellate court holding that the failure to call horton was not prejudicial was entirely reasonable.
criminal conviction history 
lastly,even if it were somehow true that trial counsel failure to investigate murrell criminal history was deficient performance,as appellate counsel alleges,it was not prejudicial.even if counsel had jumped through every hoop that murrell appellate counsel,a veritable monday morning quarterback,would now have him do,murrell still would have had to admit to five prior criminal than the four convictions he insisted he had.see supra at.any possible negative effect of the additional prior conviction and even murrell explanation of the mixup in the record was at most marginal.moreover,we note that murrell himself could have avoided any questioning and explanation of the nature of his prior convictions if only he had been candid regarding the number of convictions on his record.instead,he was less than truthful and refused to admit that he did in fact have six criminal convictions on his record.
considering that the evidence of guilt against murrell was most convincing and overwhelming eyewitness testimony of burrage,davis,corroborating testimony of arndt,henson,shaw,and that murrell would have,in any case,had to admit to five prior convictions,there is no reasonable likelihood that but for counsel failure to correct the information regarding murrell prior record,the jury would have reached a different conclusion as to murrell guilt.
iii.conclusion 
this case is about credibility determinations first and last,initially made by a competent jury of murrell peers during a trial,and then reviewed by the trial judge during proceedings,as well as the state appellate court on direct review.at trial,in the face of all of the evidence presented to it,including the damning testimony of jermaine burrage,christopher davis,and three police officers,the jury concluded that murrell was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of each and every element of the five counts of reckless injury charged against murrell in connection with the shooting at the roxbury club october.
during proceedings,the trial judge,when presented with the testimony of danny deneal,briant horton,and a transcript of the prior testimony of christopher davis probation revocation hearing,found that the exclusion of such testimony from the trial itself or,in the case of davis testimony,the failure to impeach using a prior inconsistent statement did not rise to the level of prejudicing murrell.the experienced and very trial judge had ample opportunity,both during trial and proceedings,to observe the conduct and demeanor of each one of the witnesses,focusing on their reactions and responses to the interrogatories,their facial expressions,attitudes,tones of voice,eye contact,posture,and body movements,dunning simmons airlines,cir alteration in original,unlike this court which has access only to the cold pages of the appellate record.the trial judge conclusion that counsel alleged deficiencies were not prejudicial was inextricably linked to her credibility determinations made throughout the course of the proceedings to the factual conclusions of an experienced state trial judge would be contrary to applicable law.see mendiola,at discussing applicability of e to state court credibility determinations.
on appeal from the trial judge order denying a new trial,the wisconsin court of appeals agreed with the finding that murrell had failed to establish prejudice.we are convinced,after a reading of the state appellate court decision,which highlights the wealth of damning and inculpatory evidence that supported the jury conviction and the trial judge denial of a new trial in the case,that the court of appeals t ook the strickland standard seriously and produce d an answer within the range of defensible positions.mendiola,at emphasis added.thus,under the terms of the aedpa,it is clear that the district court denial of the writ was entirely proper.
in closing,we note that although murrell trial may not have been perfect,the united states constitution does not guarantee a perfect trial,only a fair trial.united states harris,cir emphasis added.and in this case,when considering murrell allegations of deficient performance,both singly and cumulatively,we are convinced that,in light of the immense inculpatory evidence presented at trial both circumstantial and direct,and the incredibility of horton and deneal,the wisconsin court of appeals conclusion that trial counsel errors were not prejudicial was not only reasonable,but represented a proper application of strickland.murrell was entitled to and received a fair trial before a jury of his peers that convicted him of each and every element of each of the five counts of reckless injury charged.the district court denial of murrell petition for habeas relief is affirmed.
david murrell was convicted by a jury in a wisconsin state court of five counts of reckless injury while armed and was sentenced to prison for years.the only issue presented by the appeal is whether the state courts were unreasonable in rejecting his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at his,whether they were unreasonable in applying to the facts of the case the decision of the united states supreme court in strickland washington,d see d williams taylor,d.since the state concedes that murrell trial lawyer fell below the minimum required level of professional competence in representing him,all that we must decide is whether the state courts were unreasonable in finding that the defendant would surely have been convicted even if his lawyer had been up to snuff.i think they were.
murrell was one of nearly people who were enjoying themselves one night in at a nightclub in milwaukee inner city.while he was in the bathroom gambling,a fight broke out between several of his friends and members of another group,the boys.it is apparent from the record that these were gangs,and not friendly ones either had there been no preexisting animosity between them,a shooting would not have been likely to ensue from someone bumping into another person on the dance floor.the contestants included carl owens and members of the rival gang including the brothers jermaine and mario burrage,though jermaine denied that he was a member,while acknowledging that his friends were.shooting broke out and five men were injured happily none fatally,including mario burrage.murrell and owens were prosecuted together for the shootings.jermaine burrage testified that just prior to the shooting he had gone into the bathroom,where he had seen murrell,and that owens had burst in and asked murrell to give him a gun because it drama.in response,according to burrage,murrell drew out a semiautomatic pistol,loaded and cocked it,left the bathroom,and fired five or six shots into the crowd.before trial burrage had also said that murrell had left the bathroom in the company of owens and that the two had been standing side by side during the shooting.but at trial burrage testified that he did not remember where owens had been standing.as a result,the judge ordered the case against owens dismissed.
as a member of a rival gang whose brother had been one of the victims of the shooting,and having contradicted his prior statement regarding owens,burrage was not a highly credible witness.he testified that he had given the account that he gave at trial to a police officer or security guard at the scene of the shooting,but the evidence at trial was that no one had taken a statement from him nor did any officer or guard match the description that burrage gave of the person to whom he had given the statement.he first called the police the morning after the shooting.his story was discrepant with other evidence offered at the trial as well,and it also contradicted itself with respect to the size of the gun,what hand murrell had held it in,where murrell was when he started to shoot,and who else was in the bathroom.
the key evidence against murrell was given by a security guard at the nightclub named christopher davis.davis testified that he had seen murrell leave the club after the shooting,clutching his side as if he were hiding a weapon,and that when he asked murrell to stop,murrell ran away and tossed a pistol under a car.the pistol was later sure enough it was the one that had been used in the shootings.this iced the case against murrell.
yet at a probation revocation hearing conducted before the trial,davis had testified that he had not seen murrell holding or tossing the gun,that rather the nightclub bouncer,danny deneal,had told him that he deneal had seen murrell drop the gun.davis had made a similar statement to murrell original lawyer,who had turned it over to murrell trial lawyer,who had done nothing with it.the lawyer was also shown a statement that deneal had given to the police the night of the shootings to the effect that he had seen a man,who from his description could not have been murrell,run from the scene of the crime and toss the very gun that had done the a parked car.the lawyer did nothing with this statement either.he neither impeached davis with his prior inconsistent of which,the one at the probation revocation hearing,had been under called deneal as a witness.he acknowledged having no tactical reason for these omissions,which is why the state does not argue that he rendered competent professional assistance to murrell.at a state postconviction hearing,deneal recanted his statement that he had seen who had tossed the gun this cast a shadow over davis testimony that deneal had told him the night of the shooting that he had seen murrell toss the gun.
impeaching davis with his prior inconsistent statements and calling deneal as a witness to contradict davis present testimony would have neutralized davis as a prosecution witness,leaving the state entire case to rest on the narrow shoulders of,to repeat,was a member of a rival gang,whose brother had been shot,and who was an unreliable witness,having in effect recanted at trial a key portion of his statement to the police.had davis been neutralized in the manner indicated,murrell might well have been acquitted.in his closing argument,the prosecutor emphasized that davis credibility had not been not,because of the failure of murrell lawyer either to impeach davis with davis prior inconsistent statements or to put deneal on the stand to contradict davis testimony.
in finding by a split vote that the lawyer pratfalls had not prejudiced murrell,the state appellate court erroneously stated that davis testimony that he had seen murrell toss a gun had been corroborated by the testimony of other officers actually they were merely repeating what davis had told them and thus uttering inadmissible and unreliable hearsay.state peters.my colleagues repeat this mistake.it is true as they point out that much of davis testimony was corroborated,but not the crucial part of it.on by murrell trial lawyer,davis emphatically repeated his emphatic direct testimony that he had seen murrell toss the gun.compare this with his testimony at the revocation hearing 
q did you ever actually observe david murrell with a gun in his possession 
a no,i did.
q you did actually see david murrell drop a gun.
a no,i did.
what is true as my colleagues emphasize is that davis also testified at that hearing that someone had called out he dropped it,he dropped it.i looked down,and lo and behold,it was there on the ground,had just passed that point,i know that.but at trial he testified that he had not heard anyone say he dropped the gun.it was he who had said it no one screamed there was a gun until after that gun hit the ground.that when i screamed there a gun.
all this would be of little moment had there been no one besides murrell except davis in the parking lot,so that only murrell could have dropped the gun.but the only evidence to support this suggestion was the testimony of one of the officers that davis and murrell were the first two people that he saw leaving the area.davis himself testified that there was a stampede and that murrell left after the stampede another officer referred to a mass exodus.the surveillance videotape confirmed that at least one person left the club before the person who the state argued was murrell clutching his side left seven seconds later,and that that person also appeared to be holding something.at least two more people ran out just seconds after murrell.
according to the state appellate court,another officer identified murrell as the man seen on the video leaving the club clutching his side,and thus corroborated a part at least of davis testimony,though not the critical part.the court was again mistaken about the record.the officer said he was unable to identify the person clutching his side because of the poor quality of the videotape,and that he had based his identification of murrell not on his own knowledge but on what davis had told him more hearsay,which would have unraveled had davis been impeached by his testimony at the revocation hearing.
my point is not that the state courts misapplied the rules of evidence,a matter in the first instance at least of state law it is that in assessing the harm to the defendant from his lawyer performance they misconstrued the trial record and as a result slighted that harm.the fact that they considered davis believable was vitiated by the errors that i have noted,and anyway the question is not whether they believed davis but whether a competent lawyer would have so undermined davis credibility as to persuade the jury to acquit murrell.
as for deneal,it is true as the court pointed out that at the postconviction hearing he recanted his statement that he had seen someone who could not have been murrell toss the gun.but his new version was that neither he nor davis had seen who tossed the gun,and the jury might have believed this and so rejected davis believed deneal original statement,made to the police on the night of the shootings,that he and davis had pursued several patrons who had fled the scene of the shooting that he had observed a short,black male with a shaved head and sweater not murrell dump a handgun underneath a car in the parking lot that he had told davis that the man dropped the gun and that he deneal remained near the gun until the police officers arrived.this statement was consistent with davis statement at the revocation hearing that deneal,not davis,had seen someone toss the gun,but of course if believed it would tend to exonerate murrell.
to this my colleagues respond that deneal statement about the short bald guy was false and his testimony at the postconviction hearing outlandish.but as the ground for davis belief that murrell was the was deneal,it is hard to see how deneal lack of credibility is helpful to the state.as my colleagues remark,though without embracing the implications of the remark,if deneal could not be trusted to tell the truth when he was under oath,we fail to see how something he said outside the courtroom,when he was not under penalty of perjury,would have been accepted by the jury.precisely and it was outside the courtroom that deneal supposedly told davis that murrell had dropped the gun.it is not as if deneal were a friend of murrell,with a motive to lie to protect him he was not on the contrary,he was a colleague of were members of the nightclub security attempted to apprehend the shooter.
a friend of murrell,an eyewitness to the shooting named horton,asked murrell before the trial to tell murrell lawyer to contact him.the lawyer did not do so.horton would have testified that he had been looking at murrell when he heard the shots,and that murrell had not fired them.horton testimony would not have done much for murrell,standing to neutralize burrage unconvincing testimony.horton,it is true,was a friend of burrage was an enemy.if in addition to calling horton as a witness,murrell lawyer had brought out the fact that davis had not seen who had dropped the in testifying that it was murrell,davis had just been parroting deneal,a thoroughly unreliable might well have been acquitted.the state courts were unreasonable in concluding otherwise.he is entitled to a new trial.
in,justice sykes was elevated to the wisconsin supreme court where she presently serves.
according to the dissent,jermaine burrage denied that he was a member of a rival gang,while acknowledging that his friends were.dissent at.the record reflects otherwise and establishes that burrage never stated,much less admitted that any of his friends were in a gang.he did testify to the fact that some of his friends were referred to as the one way boys,because,as he explained,all of us lived on the street day tr.at but it is less than accurate to state that he acknowledged that his friends belonged to a rival gang.
burrage stated that before he left the crime scene to be with his injured brother at the hospital,he told a person in uniform that he had seen murrell fire the weapon day tr.at,but we have been unable to verify this in the record.
davis and murrell footchase commenced just outside the entrance to the roxbury club,and continued westbound through the club parking lot,over a service drive or street and into another parking lot northridge shopping area lot where murrell was ultimately apprehended.day tr.at.when henson first observed davis in pursuit of murrell,the two men were right where the first parking lot the club parking lot starts,and were located closer to the roxbury club than to the service drive.id.at this testimony,which reveals that henson observed davis and murrell early on in their footchase,is consistent with henson testimony that he observed davis and murrell already engaged in a footchase a mere three to four seconds after he heard gunshots fired from inside the club.id.at.
detective shaw testimony regarding the contents of the videotape,his assertion that on the videotape you can see someone running out of the front door clutching their right arm towards their side,day tr.at was based on his own observations after viewing the videotape.
murrell submitted a transcript of davis prior testimony from the probation revocation hearing in lieu of davis direct testimony,for davis was not subpoenaed to appear at the hearing.thus,davis was never given an is the usual practice and custom in cases of impeachment by prior refresh his recollection and read his prior testimony from the hearing held over a year prior to trial and to explain any wonders whether murrell counsel opted to present the transcript rather than calling davis to testify in an attempt to nit pick the record for a possible inconsistency that davis would have no opportunity to resolve.we have uncovered nothing in the record that explains why davis himself was not called upon to testify at the hearing,but we note in passing that,had murrell truly sought to search for and uncover the truth,calling davis as a witness would have been the more advisable course.
citations to the hearing transcript are denoted pc tr.
we must note that,at murrell trial,not a single police officer at the crime scene testified that deneal was standing guard over the glock gun when it was found by officer henson in the club parking lot,immediately after the end of the footchase.
additionally,if in fact murrell did inform hendree of horton willingness to testify,nothing in the record supports that he murrell turned over one scintilla of information concerning horton address,phone number or other contact information relatives names,schools attended,to aid hendree in his effort to contact the new mystery witness.murrell who maintained that he did discuss horton testimony with hendree stated at the hearing that he told hendree that the man name was brian horton,rather than his actual name briant horton.pc tr.at he asked me what was the witness name and i told him brian horton.if hendree was not even given briant horton correct less a shred of additional possible contact is difficult to understand how he could be expected to locate the newly discovered mysterious witness.
although the court database listed two additional count of escape and one battery claimed that neither of those convictions was actually on his record although he did mention that he was not all the way certain about the escape charge day tr.at.
under wisconsin law,the state,on or rebuttal,is permitted to inquire as to whether the defendant has ever been convicted of a crime and if so,how many times,see,nicholas state of wisconsin,and if the defendant provides a less than accurate number of criminal convictions,the state may ask the nature and exact date of each of the criminal convictions.id.at.in this case,murrell defense attorney initially questioned murrell as to how many convictions were on his record on direct examination,at which time murrell claimed he had previously been convicted of only four crimes.anticipating that the state would murell as to the disputed number of convictions,hendree went on to ask,a nd there are two convictions that you dispute,right,to which hendree replied,yes i not all the way certain about the escape b ut i know about the battery by prisoner,that not there.day tr.at.
after testifying at trial that he had only four convictions in his record,murrell conceded after trial,in his motion,that he now for the first time owned up to the fact that he had at least six prior convictions on his record for impeachment purposes.state of wisconsin murrell,no.at.may.
additionally,we note that even at trial,davis testified that he did not identify the falling object as a gun until the second that it hit the ground.day tr.at.in that sense,his trial testimony regarding the timing of his identification of the gun was consistent with his statement at the probation hearing that it was not until he looked down that he saw the gun there on the ground,right where murrell had just been running.pr tr.at.
notably,davis had,on other previous occasions even before giving his testimony at the probation revocation hearing,stated,as he did at trial,that he had seen murrell drop the gun.as detective shaw testified at trial,in an interview of davis,conducted two days after the shoot
