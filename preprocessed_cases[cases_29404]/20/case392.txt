dwayne brown was convicted of robbery after a jury trial in in the new york state supreme court.on appeal thereafter to the first department of the appellate division of the new york supreme court,brown argued that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective.the jury charge,brown contended,may have led the jury to convict him under a preponderance of the evidence standard and not,as is constitutionally required,under the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.according to brown,trial counsel failure to object to the charge constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.the appellate division rejected this argument.people brown,dep t.thereafter,the new york court of appeals denied leave to appeal.people burwell.then,in june,brown brought a habeas petition pursuant to in the united states district court for the southern district of new york kimba wood,chief judge.the district court denied the petition,finding that the appellate division opinion was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,federal law.brown green,civ,dist.lexis.we agree.
background 
in january,two men stopped claudio in a subway station on the upper west side of manhattan and,after a brief scuffle,stole his wallet.a few minutes later,contacted the police.he described the physical appearance of the two thieves,which the officers quickly broadcast over the police radio.a nearby squad car stopped two men thought to match the description brown and eric burwell.the police took to view brown and burwell he indicated that they were the men who had robbed him.
brown and burwell were charged with second degree robbery and tried jointly before new york state supreme court justice edward mclaughlin hereafter the trial judge.the key issue at trial was whether brown and burwell were the two individuals who had robbed.the opening and closing statements of both the defense and the prosecution focused on this aspect of the case and also included numerous statements to the effect that the jury must employ the reasonable doubt standard 
the jury charge also included the following language 
a jury makes factual findings.to,factual findings can be made,although they are not established beyond a reasonable doubt.the elements must be established beyond a reasonable doubt if they going to be established at all.
the charge contained many other references seven,by our count to the beyond a reasonable doubt standard most either told the jury to apply that standard or described how it functioned.for example,the trial judge told the jury the focus of a trial is to determine whether or not the prosecution can prove the elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.later,the trial judge said,i f the people prove the three elements beyond a reasonable doubt you must convict the person.if they can not prove one or more or all of the elements,miss proving that beyond a reasonable doubt,you have no choice,you have to acquit the person.finally,the charge also included the following statement,which we will call the election example 
f or centuries elections have been closely decided.beats every time and yet,for years now,juries,the same pool of people who ca agree on a candidate,have been unanimously deciding cases.so,how does that happen it happens,obviously,because within the jury deliberation context,people sometimes change their minds.you can change your mind if somebody by reason,logic and reliance on the record of this case can cause you to change a position that you may have originally held.
no party objected to the charge.
the jury convicted brown and burwell after two and hours of deliberation,and brown received a sentence of years to life in prison.as already indicated,on appeal to the appellate division,brown argued that the jury charge was constitutionally deficient because it may have confused the jury,causing it to convict brown based on a preponderance of the evidence standard.brown also argued that trial counsel failure to object to the jury charge constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.the appellate division found that defendants received effective assistance of counsel and that the direct challenge to the jury charge was unpreserved.brown,at.the new york court of appeals denied leave to appeal.burwell.
in june,brown brought this habeas petition in the southern district,arguing only that trial counsel failure to object to the jury charge constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.the petition was assigned to chief judge wood,who referred it to magistrate judge andrew peck.the magistrate judge recommended that the petition be granted.brown greene,civ,wl,dist.lexis may.judge wood disagreed and in a careful opinion denied the petition,but granted a certificate of appealability.brown,dist.lexis.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
brown sole claim before us is that his trial counsel failure to object to the jury charge constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.
standard of review 
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,w hen the state court has adjudicated the merits of the petitioner claim we may grant a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court adjudication was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states.dolphy mantello,cir quoting d.when a district court has denied a habeas petition,we review its legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.drake portuondo,cir.
ineffective assistance and the jury charge 
the strickland and winship standards 
under strickland washington,d,to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,petitioner must demonstrate that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and affirmatively prove prejudice arising from counsel allegedly deficient representation.carrion smith,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in assessing whether counsel performance was objectively reasonable,we must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,and be watchful to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight.aparicio artuz,cir quoting strickland,at.moreover,counsel can not be deemed incompetent for failing to predict that a higher court would overrule its earlier precedent.jameson coughlin,cir.
it has long been the law that the due process clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt in re winship,d.if there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction based on proof insufficient to meet the winship standard,then the charge is constitutionally deficient.victor nebraska,d see also estelle mcguire,d.however,i n making this assessment,the challenged instructions must be viewed in context,not only with respect to the overall charge,but also with respect to the entire trial record.gaines kelly,cir citing cupp naughten,d.
the to instruction brown argument 
brown principal contention is that the to instruction made it likely that the jury did not correctly apply the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.according to brown,the to instruction told the jurors to make factual findings under the to rubric.this,brown contends,may have led the jury to apply the to standard when determining whether the elements of the crime had been met.
brown gives an example.one of the elements of robbery is that the prosecution must prove that the defendant took property forcibly.see.according to brown,the jury may have thought that the question of whether there was a physical struggle when wallet was stolen was a factual question that,under the judge instructions,should be decided under the to standard.if the jury found,under that standard,that a struggle did occur,it might then automatically conclude that the force element had been satisfied.in the end,under brown reasoning,this would mean that the jury would have found an element to have been satisfied under the to standard.according to brown,the trial judge should have told the it could only find certain facts under the to standard or,alternatively,simply not said anything about making factual findings under a to standard.
applicable second circuit precedent 
three of our earlier cases dealt with jury charges that included language very similar to the to instruction.in united states,cir,the charge stated the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt operates on the whole case,and not on the separate bits of evidence.and each individual item of evidence need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.we concluded that this statement was technically accurate,since the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not operate on the many subsidiary facts on which the prosecution may prove that a particular element has been established beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.nonetheless,we found that the statement might confuse jurors,and we advised trial judges to stick to the model jury instructions.see id.at.but we concluded that viewing the charge as a whole,we are persuaded that the jury in this case fully understood the beyond a reasonable doubt standard,since the jury charge included at least three statements to the effect that the jury must use that standard.id.at internal citation omitted.
in united states gatzonis,cir per curiam,we upheld a nearly identical charge.as in,we noted that the charge,while technically accurate,could be confusing and advised trial courts to use the model jury instructions.id.at.again,we rested our conclusion in part on the repetition by the trial judge in that case at least five times during the jury instructions that all elements of an offense must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.thus,any ambiguity that might have arisen from the earlier reference that the burden operated on the whole case was sufficiently removed.id.quoting,at.
finally,in united states delibac,cir per curiam,we rejected a challenge to a charge that stated that y ou need not find every fact beyond a reasonable doubt.you need only find that the government has established beyond a reasonable doubt each and every essential element of the crime charged.again,we cautioned trial courts against departing from the model jury instructions,found the language technically accurate but confusing and upheld the charge.see id 
trial counsel failure to object 
the basic question before us in this proceeding is whether trial counsel failure to object to the charge constituted ineffective assistance.we think that it did not.a defense lawyer aware of delibac,viafara and gatzonis might have reasonably believed that the charge in this case was not materially different from the charges that we had previously upheld.the actual language of the to instruction is not much different from the language in these earlier cases.and,as in those cases,the jury charge in this case contained several statements referring to the beyond a reasonable doubt standard 
it might be possible,if this case were before us in a different procedural posture,if it did not involve the deferential standards of aedpa and strickland,to find a distinction between brown case and the line of cases.but such a distinction would be a fine one,and we would not find counsel constitutionally inadequate for failing to detect it 
brown also criticizes the election example.brown argues that this statement would remind the jury that earlier,the trial judge had told them that the facts had to be proven to.however,we find this unlikely.as brown concedes,it is obvious that the trial judge use of the election example had nothing to do with the burden of proof the trial judge was simply trying to explain to the members of the jury how they should deliberate the message was that they should not be afraid to change their minds in response to other jurors arguments.the fact that the election example included the same numbers that were in the to instruction is not,by itself,a sufficient distinction between this case and our earlier cases for us to find that trial counsel failure to object was objectively unreasonable 
we must emphasize that this is not a case about the jury instruction alone.the sole question that we are faced with today is whether counsel performance was constitutionally deficient.we need not state whether delibac,gatzonis and would compel us to uphold the charge if it came before us in a case that did not involve the deferential standards of aedpa and strickland.we need only hold that,given those cases,and the procedural posture of this one,failure to object to the jury charge did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel thus,the new york court rejection of brown habeas petition was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,federal law.
although we do not grant brown petition,we repeat our suggestion that trial judges should use the model jury instructions when applicable.improvised definitions of the beyond a reasonable doubt standard may be confusing or misleading.see,at t rial judges would be exceedingly well advised to use the model instructions rather than impose variations upon it.internal quotation omitted.we urge trial courts,in the future,to stick to the model jury instructions regarding this issue.
iii.conclusion 
we hold that the appellate division rejection of brown ineffective assistance of counsel argument was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,federal law,given that the charge at issue in this case was very similar to the charges upheld in gatzonis,delibac,and.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court entered pursuant to chief judge wood opinion.
our judicial system provides jurors with an awesome responsibility,placing a defendant liberty in the ir hands jurors can not perform this role as protectors of liberty if they are not properly instructed about that role fong poole,d,gerard lynch,judge.
this case illustrates the perils of instructing a criminal jury that not every fact must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt or,as the court instructed at dwayne brown trial,that factual findings can be made by to.while strongly voicing our disapproval,we have previously tolerated instructions that a jury may apply to some factual determinations a standard of proof lower than beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states delibac,cir per curiam united states gatzonis,cir per curiam,cert.denied,d united states,cir.
at brown trial,however,this troublesome preponderance language operated in concert with the court additional,unnecessary deviations from pattern instructions to diminish the prosecution burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that brown was one of the two men who robbed claudio.in effect,brown jury was instructed to decide whether brown had been accurately identified as one of the perpetrators,the only disputed fact at trial,by a mere preponderance of the evidence.such a jury charge is constitutionally deficient,and in my view it is unreasonable to find otherwise.
i further believe that it was outside the range of reasonably competent assistance for brown trial counsel to fail to object to this charge.a defendant sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel encompasses counsel obligation to ensure that jury instructions adequately convey the bedrock principle that the prosecution burden of proof is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.in my view,brown was denied this right and the state court rejection of his claim was unreasonable.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
state court proceedings 
trial and jury instructions 
the crux of the people case against brown was testimony that he had been mugged by two men and that he accurately identified brown and eric burwell as his assailants when brought to the scene of their arrest several blocks away.at trial,brown and burwell did not dispute that had been robbed.the sole factual dispute for the jury to resolve and the focus of all parties opening statements and summations was whether the defendants had been accurately identified.
at the core of my disagreement with the majority lies my view that the jury charge is fairly read to have instructed the jury to use a mere preponderance of the evidence standard in deciding the identity of robbers rather than the constitutionally required standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.this reading is conveyed by the following portions of the jury charge 
we have different functions.you are the exclusive judges of the facts.only you can make the accuracy and credibility assessments that are the starting point of your.
your chief function as finders of fact is to determine the accuracy and the credibility of the people who testify in front of you.the way you do that is really the way you do it in your own lives.only you can say that a person who testified was truthful or not truthful and what weight or emphasis you should give to the testimony was the person accurate or inaccurate.
i going to give you some suggestions,but you see that these are things that any functional,intelligent adult human being considers instinctively in his or her effort to decide accuracy and truthfulness.
it is the quality of the evidence and not the quantity which must control.
that principle,quality not quantity,is the reason why new york has the identification rule about which you were alerted during the jury selection.the testimony of one person is sufficient for there to be a conviction,provided that testimony is of sufficient persuasiveness and credibility that it permits the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the people have proven their case.
crimes are defined by elements.the focus of a trial is to determine whether or not the prosecution can prove the elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.
during the course of a trial,things happen.you hear testimony.you can spend your deliberation time trying to resolve each and everything that you heard.my suggestion is you try to resolve only the things that you need to resolve in order to make a determination whether the people have proven the elements of a charge beyond a reasonable doubt.
a jury makes factual findings.to,factual findings be sic can be made,although they are not established beyond a reasonable doubt.
the elements must be established beyond a reasonable doubt if they going to be established at all.
what your concern is did the people prove beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of a robbery and,equally,if not more importantly,the accuracy of the identification of burwell and brown as the person or persons involved in the crime.
with regard to identification cases,as this is,it the judge responsibility to focus the jury on the considerations that a jury should go through in deciding whether or not the people have proven an accused guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.i go through these things.
but,with respect to the credibility factors and the identification considerations,you see that an intelligent,functioning adult human being instinctively would think of or examine,assess virtually all these things,if not all these things,in trying to determine whether the people have met their burden.
first of all,you got to decide the credibility of,as well as any other witness.because only by initially making factual decisions do you have a basis on which to draw your ultimate conclusions.you got to decide what facts you working with.that means you got to decide as the witnesses are conveying testimony here,is their testimony accurate and credible.
so,with respect to whether the identification is truthful,that is not deliberately false,y ou must evaluate the believability of the witness who makes an identification.in doing so,you may consider the various factors for evaluating the believability of a witness testimony that i listed for you a while ago with regard to whether the identification is accurate 
these factors are c ommon sense things that any intelligent person would assess in making the determination whether the defendant or defendants are correctly identified.
you heard me say crimes are defined by elements.essentially,there are three elements with regard to robbery.
so,there are three elements,each of which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
was there a theft 
ordinary meaning.
was there force used 
force is any physical force beyond some incidental touching.
and,was there a person present who was present,ready,willing and able to aid in the commission of the robbery,the theft 
those three elements have to be proven separately as to each person,burwell and brown.
if the people prove the three elements as i just described them beyond a reasonable doubt,each one of them,then you have no choice,you must convict the person.if the people miss any one or more or all of the elements,miss proving that beyond a reasonable doubt,you have no choice,you have to acquit the person.
does the jury unanimously agree as to the charge against burwell,as to the charge against brown when you get into the jury room,conceivably,there would be disagreements among you.not surprising.
the two most important civic functions that people do are to vote and to serve on juries.and for centuries elections have been closely decided.beats every time,and then you stuck with somebody for two,four,six or in the case of some judicial elections fourteen long years.and,yet,for years now,juries,the same pool of people who ca agree on a candidate,have been unanimously deciding cases.
so,how does that happen it happens,obviously,because within the jury deliberation context,people sometimes change their minds.
although no party objected to the charge,burwell counsel asked for confirmation that the identification charge included an instruction that along with the elements of the crime,that the identification of these people being the perpetrator was proven beyond a reasonable doubt.the court responded that this was t he first thing i said.
the jury returned a verdict convicting both brown and burwell of second degree robbery.on august,brown was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of sixteen years to life.
direct appeal 
as the majority recounts,see ante at,on appeal,brown,represented by his current counsel,pressed several claims,including that the trial court jury instructions diminished the prosecution burden of proof and that his trial counsel failure to object to the charge violated his right to the effective assistance of counsel,all in violation of his federal and state constitutional rights.while brown direct appeal was pending,the appellate division,first department,held in people johnson,dep t,leave to appeal denied,that substantially similar jury by the same justice of the supreme court,edward mclaughlin,who presided over brown trial risk ed eliminating the reasonable doubt standard from the trial,and thus required reversal of that defendant robbery conviction.id.at,at.at johnson trial in may,justice mclaughlin had,as he would do at brown trial the following month,instructed the jury that it should find facts by a preponderance of the evidence and that this to standard does not apply to the requirement of jury unanimity see id.at,at.in addition,at johnson trial,the court gave a charge,see id.at,at,while such a charge was not given at brown trial.
despite the similarity of the instructions,the extended discussions of the recently decided johnson appeal in the prosecution response brief and brown reply brief,and the overlapping composition of the appellate panels the appellate division,first department,affirmed brown and burwell convictions without any reference to johnson people brown,dep t brown i.in brown i,the court simply held with respect to the jury charge issues the record establishes that defendants received effective assistance of counsel.defendant sic remaining contentions are unpreserved and we decline to review them in the interest of justice.id.at,at citations omitted.
ii.federal court habeas proceedings 
standards of review 
under the deferential standard of review established by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,in order for brown to prevail on his habeas petition,he must show that the state court adjudication of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d see,dolphy mantello,cir.
the parties agree that the clearly established federal law underlying brown claim is strickland washington,d,and a petitioner is not required to further demonstrate that his particular theory of ineffective assistance of counsel is also clearly established,aparicio artuz,cir.
under strickland,to establish ineffective assistance,petitioner must demonstrate that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in light of prevailing professional norms and affirmatively prove prejudice arising from counsel allegedly deficient representation.carrion smith,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
aedpa,however,requires more than a conclusion that counsel performance was constitutionally inadequate.id.at see also schriro landrigan,d the question under aedpa is not whether a federal court believes the state court determination was incorrect but whether that determination was substantially higher threshold.p etitioner must identify some increment of incorrectness beyond error in order to obtain habeas relief.that increment,however,need not be great otherwise,habeas relief would be limited to state court decisions so far off the mark as to suggest judicial incompetence.jones west,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.however,because the strickland standard is a general standard,a state court has even more latitude to reasonably determine that a defendant has not satisfied that standard.knowles mirzayance,d see hawkins costello,cir,cert.denied,d.
strickland prejudice prong 
as the parties agree,strickland prejudice prong is satisfied if the trial court gave an unconstitutional reasonable doubt instruction.see bloomer united states,cir w e will presume prejudice when a jury instruction on reasonable doubt is found to be constitutionally deficient.thus,brown may satisfy this aspect of his claim regardless of the strength and quantity of evidence against him.id.at.
the test for determining whether a reasonable doubt instruction is constitutionally deficient is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction based on proof insufficient to meet the winship standard,victor nebraska,d,which requires that a criminal conviction be based upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which the defendant is charged,in re winship,d.
it bears emphasizing that we do not review challenged language in isolation rather,we consider the charge in its entirety to determine whether,on the whole,it provided the jury with an intelligible and accurate portrayal of the applicable law.united states shamsideen,cir citations,internal quotation marks,and brackets omitted.accordingly,an asserted error in a reasonable doubt instruction may be innocuous or inconsequential when viewed in the context of the charge as a whole surrounded by different language in a different charge,however,the same language may create a constitutional infirmity.vargas keane,cir,cert.denied,d.the jury charge taken as a whole might have explained the proper standard with sufficient clarity that any ambiguity in the particular language challenged could not have been understood by a reasonable juror as reducing the burden of persuasion.francis franklin,d.on the other hand,vague language that in and of itself does not warrant reversal,may become grounds for reversal when it is coupled with other problematic but,in itself,language in a manner that is reasonably likely to confuse the jury.gaines kelly,cir.although a particular instruction may withstand constitutional scrutiny in isolation,our analysis focuses on the cumulative effect,and even if each instruction were to pass constitutional muster,their cumulative effect may violate constitutional due process.id.at.
here,the court instruction that a jury is to find facts by a preponderance standard of to must be viewed in the context of the charge as a whole doing so leads me to conclude that the jury charge in this case instructed the jury to apply the preponderance of the evidence standard in determining whether the defendants had been accurately most important,and indeed the only factual dispute at trial.while the court instructed the jury to find the elements of robbery beyond a reasonable doubt,it did not clearly instruct that identification must be so proven,but rather described the issue of identification as a factual decision subject to the to standard.in addition,the court highlighted this erroneous preponderance standard at the conclusion of the charge,stating that beats every time in elections,but a jury must decide cases unanimously.in my view,the court instruction to make factual determinations by a preponderance of the evidence,considered in the context of the entire charge,created a reasonable likelihood that the jury unconstitutionally applied that standard to a fact necessary to constitute the crime with which brown wa s charged.winship,at.and i respectfully believe that it is unreasonable to conclude otherwise 
initially,the court correctly explained that under new york identification rule t he testimony of one person is sufficient for there to be a conviction,provided that testimony is of sufficient persuasiveness and credibility that it permits the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the people have proven their case.however,with each reference to the question of identity,the court instructions increasingly obscured and diluted the applicable burden of proof.
at the outset,the court charged the jury with the duty to find facts and to make accuracy and credibility assessments as the starting point of your.it went on to describe two ways in which the jury may find facts,by examining direct evidence or by drawing reasonable inferences therefrom.the court soon repeated that making accuracy and credibility assessments is the jurors chief function as finders of fact.the court further elaborated on the methods the jurors should employ in executing this task,first explaining that the methods are those that any functional,intelligent adult human being considers instinctively in his or her effort to decide accuracy and truthfulness.
as noted,the court then referenced new york identification rule,defining the prosecution burden as proof beyond a reasonable doubt.after instructing on the presumption of innocence and the meaning of reasonable doubt,the court repeated that it the people obligation to prove a defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.in returning to this burden after a brief digression on issues the jury should not consider,the court explained,crimes are defined by elements.the focus of a trial is to determine whether or not the prosecution can prove the elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.the court then explained that the jurors need not resolve each and everything that you heard.the court suggested rather that the jurors try to resolve only the things that you need to resolve in order to make a determination whether the people have proven the elements of a charge beyond a reasonable doubt.at this point,the court delivered the challenged preponderance instruction 
a jury makes factual findings.to,factual findings can be made,although they are not established beyond a reasonable doubt.
the elements must be established beyond a reasonable doubt if they going to be established at all.
after referencing other issues the jury should not consider,the court reiterated what the jury concern is and gave its second instruction regarding the burden of proof and the identification of the defendants 
did the people prove beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of a robbery and,equally,if not more importantly,the accuracy of the identification of burwell and brown as the person or persons involved in the crime.
by separating identification from the elements,this instruction is not entirely clear about the standard of proof applicable to identification.
most perniciously,however,the discussion of identification that follows treats this critical issue as a preliminary factual determination that is subject to the to preponderance standard previously charged.the court instructions on how to make the identification decision do this expressly by describing the accuracy and credibility of identity testimony as a factual decision to be made initially before draw ing your ultimate conclusions.as previously mentioned,the challenged preponderance instruction,which advises the jury to resolve only the things that you need to resolve in order to make a determination of the ultimate question of whether the people have proven the elements of a charge beyond a reasonable doubt,distinguishes factual findings that can be made by a preponderance from elements that must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.combining these instructions would undoubtedly create a reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the to standard to the critical question of identity.
the charge reinforces the application of the preponderance standard to the identification determination by then repeating and incorporating the various factors for evaluating the believability of a witness testimony that had previously been charged as the tools to be used in carrying out the jurors chief function as finders of fact.while the court first refers to these tools in its instructions as things that any functional,intelligent adult human being considers instinctively in his or her effort to decide accuracy and truthfulness,the court describes them similarly in its identification instructions as tools that an intelligent,functioning adult human being instinctively would think of or examine,and c ommon sense things that any intelligent person would assess in making the determination whether the defendant or defendants are correctly identified.these parallel instructions strengthen the court direction to treat identity as a factual determination subject to the to standard.moreover,immediately after this instruction on identification,the court switches gears to discuss the three elements,emphasizing that each must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,while failing to mention the critical issue of identification.this omission further solidifies the court treatment of identification as a fact to be determined by the preponderance of the evidence standard rather than an element subject to the higher standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt 
finally,the court subsequent statement that beats every time,although delivered in the course of explaining the required unanimity of a jury verdict,could only have reinforced the court improper instruction on the standard of proof.people johnson,dep t see bollenbach united states.particularly in a criminal trial,the judge last word is apt to be the decisive word.united states hughes,cir t he impact of the quoted statement must have been considerable,coming as it did just a few moments before the jury retired and prefaced with,in the final analysis.united states shamsideen,cir distinguishing hughes in part because jurors were given a written copy of full charge and challenged instruction was not the last word before deliberations 
brown argues that by distinguishing two categories,facts and elements,and giving different burdens of proof for each without explaining that elements are themselves essential facts,the charge advises the jury to engage in a process of making factual determinations by a preponderance of the evidence and then deciding whether these facts establish beyond a reasonable doubt the elements defined by the court as a set of legalistic questions,was there a theft see brief for at,reply brief for at ante at.
whatever risk of confusion this convoluted process generates with respect to the elemental facts particular to second degree,force,and another person preceding demonstrates the near certain use of the to standard for the essential determination of the identity of the robbers.thus,i would hold that,viewed in its entirety,this jury charge undoubtedly created a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood it could decide the only disputed fact at a mere preponderance of the evidence.
the court instruction that factual findings can be made to is legally accurate with respect to some factual findings.the prosecution burden of proof does not operate upon each of the many subsidiary facts on which the prosecution may collectively rely to persuade the jury that a particular element has been established beyond a reasonable doubt.united states,cir.likewise,the court explanation that the preponderance standard governs political elections,whereas unanimity is required for a criminal verdict,is also accurate.
but the constitutional touchstone in this context is whether,upon review of the charge as a whole,there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction based on proof insufficient to meet the winship standard.victor,at.and the insertion of accurate statements,even those lifted word for word from the federal reporter,into a jury charge may generate an intolerable risk of confusion,at.indeed,the subsidiary fact doctrine and the reasonable doubt standard are not easily applied by judges,see,united states martinez,cir,cert.denied,d jon newman,beyond reasonable doubt,let alone lay jurors who may hear the rule only once before deliberating.the risk of such confusion,even from a correct statement of the law,is certainly unnecessary.united states delibac,cir per curiam.
the majority holds that it was reasonable for brown counsel to believe that this jury charge is not materially different from charges we previously upheld that instructed that not every fact must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.see ante at,discussing delibac,at united states gatzonis,cir per curiam,cert.denied,d,at.and,as the district court observed,we upheld such instructions despite the absence of an explanation of which facts required proof beyond a reasonable doubt,and which facts need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.brown greene,civ,wl,at,brown iii internal quotation marks omitted 
but as brown points out,at his trial,the court did not merely instruct that some facts,as opposed to elements,need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.see brief for at.rather,it instructed that all or not they were critical to deciding if defendants were guilty of the crime be proved by a preponderance.and the court further instructed that identification was a factual decision subject to this impermissibly low standard of proof.clearly,the identification of petitioner was an ultimate fact essential to his conviction.see,bunkley meachum,cir explaining that identity,like intent,is an essential element.in my view,this presents a constitutionally significant distinction.
moreover,we upheld these instructions in delibac,gatzonis,and only after vigorously disapproving of the language and satisfying ourselves that the charge as a whole adequately conveyed the proper burden of proof to the jury.see delibac,at gatzonis,at,at.and,as explained supra at,while an asserted error in a reasonable doubt instruction may be innocuous or inconsequential when viewed in the context of one jury charge as a whole,the same language may create a constitutional infirmity when surrounded by different language in a different charge.vargas keane,cir see also shamsideen,at discussing importance of totality review in assessing claims that discrete charging language reduced the government burden of proof.despite the similarity of the preponderance instruction in this case to the language in charges upheld in delibac,gatzonis,and,the challenged preponderance instruction,viewed in the context of the court discussion of the jurors role as finders of fact and the critical factual determination of identity,created a high likelihood of confusion about the burden of proof.
indeed,the charge here is comparable to that found constitutionally deficient in callahan lefevre,cir,in which the jurors were charged that if they believed the testimony of the eye witnesses,then they would be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.that charge required conviction if the jury found the facts to be as stated by the eye witnesses even by a preponderance of the evidence.justice hoke,cir see also callahan,at explaining that this instruction allowed,indeed ordered,the jury to bootstrap this belief into proof beyond a reasonable doubt.the district court distinguished callahan,finding that n o such bootstrapping is likely in this case because the subsidiary fact instruction in no way equated the preponderance standard with the reasonable doubt standard,and,in fact,the charge explicitly stated that to factual findings are not established beyond a reasonable doubt.brown iii,wl,at.
while such improper bootstrapping may be only somewhat likely in the case of the facts that compose the elements of robbery,force,ante at,i have no doubt that the jury was instructed to convict if they found the only disputed fact,identity,by a preponderance of the evidence the charge distinguished identity and factual determinations from those elements that had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.thus,its caveat that factual findings made by a preponderance do not satisfy the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not correct the error caused by instructing the jury to apply the preponderance standard to the critical fact of identity.
for this reason,i can not agree with the majority that this charge is saved by the court repeated references to the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.see ante at,a jury charge might instruct times that issues x and y must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but that would not cure any deficiency caused by instructing an improper burden with respect to issue out of the eight references to the proper standard relied upon by the majority,four refer specifically to proof of the elements,a category from which the court instructions exclude the issue of identification.and the court description of the reasonable doubt standard does not clarify the determinations to which it applies 
i recognize that the court charge may also be read to have advised at points that identity must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.the clearest such instruction was its reference to new york identification rule.the court instruction about the jury concern may also be read to convey the proper burden.although this instruction might have been delivered in a manner that adequately emphasized the proper standard for identity,what is clear even from the transcript is that this concern instruction separated the determination of identity from the determination of the elements.thus,i fear that its ameliorative force is much diminished when viewed in the context of the court other instructions distinguishing facts from elements and treating identity as a fact.and in order to be found constitutionally deficient a jury charge need only create a reasonable likelihood,not an absolute certainty,that the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction based on proof insufficient to meet the winship standard.victor,at.in my view,the concern instruction might have done as much harm as good.
elsewhere,the court instructions on the burden of proof refer to identity only implicitly,by advising that the prosecution must prove a defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,and that the presumption of innocence remains until you convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that one or both sic guilt has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.see people newton,mem.explaining that an instruction that the prosecution bears the burden of proving a defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt may imply that this standard applies to the determination of identity.
i agree,of course,that repetition of the correct burden of proof can render a charge adequate in its entirety,despite the inclusion of some objectionable language.shamsideen,at see,bunkley,at affirming denial of habeas petition where inappropriate instruction was given only once and correct burden of proof was stated at least times and otherwise emphasized.thus,in mullings meachum,cir,where,as here,the primary issue before the jury was the identity of the robber,we held that despite an isolated instruction directing use of a preponderance standard for inferring even ultimate facts,the jury charge as a whole adequately conveyed the proper burden of proof because with respect to the critical issue of identification the court instructed five times that it must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at see also,at upholding burden of proof charge because the court emphasized that specific intent,which was the only seriously disputed element,must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
but unlike the charge in mullings,which sufficiently offset the improper burden instructed for unspecified ultimate facts by repeating five times the correct burden of proof for identity,at,the charge at issue here expressly instructed that facts,including identity,may be found by a preponderance and provided the correct standard for identity only on two occasions.
at best,the court gave conflicting instructions on the standard applicable to identity.and none of the correct statements of the prosecution burden was styled as a curative instruction that would alert the jurors that they should disregard the incorrect instruction.bloomer,at.accordingly,i am unable to find that the isolated correct statements of the prosecution burden suffice to overcome the damage done by the court conflicting,incorrect instruction.see also united states birbal,cir holding that although court had correctly instructed several sentences earlier that the defendants can not be found guilty unless the government has met its burden of proof,a t best,these two conflicting instructions,when added to the deficiencies previously catalogued,must have left the jury uncertain of the standard it was charged with applying brackets omitted callahan,at just as one allegedly erroneous instruction can not be viewed in isolation when we attempt to determine whether a jury charge has deprived a defendant of his constitutional rights,neither can a few,isolated,partially correct statements,scattered among numerous misstatements of the law,be held to have undone the damage caused by a crucial,constitutionally infirm instruction,which infected the entire trial.internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court held otherwise,reasoning that because the instructions here merely contained a certain ambiguity as to the precise interaction between the preponderance burden and reasonable doubt burden,but were not diametrically opposed or conflicting as in birbal,the instructions created only a slight risk of jury confusion that was overcome by the charge numerous correct statements of the standard.brown iii,wl,at see also shamsideen,at explaining that when a charge contains two irreconcilable instructions without indicating which of these instructions was entitled to more weight,the supreme court has held that the correct instruction does not suffice to cure the deficiency quoting francis franklin,d.
however the jury was expected to resolve this certain ambiguity with respect to finding the facts that constitute the robbery elements,the jury was advised to find the robbers identity by a preponderance,an instruction that contradicts the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that was elsewhere instructed.a jury charged with conflicting instructions must be uncertain of the standard it was charged with applying.such a jury,it goes without saying,was insufficiently prepared to carry out its constitutional mandate to resolve all reasonable doubts before adjudging the defendants guilty.birbal,at.
in concluding that this charge is constitutionally deficient and that the appellate division,first department,unreasonably concluded otherwise,i am also persuaded by that court opinions in people johnson,dep t the johnson court explained at length the problems created by the trial court to instructions.see id.at,at id.at,at saxe,concurring id.at,at tom,concurring.
the appellate division rejection of brown appeal,however,implies that it found the two charges materially distinct and so perhaps had a reasonable basis for rejecting brown ineffective assistance of counsel claim indeed,the appellate division has often found jury charges to be constitutionally adequate despite the use of some of the language that it disapproved in johnson.people henderson,dep t see also cases cited supra at.
respondents argue that the omission of the disfavored instruction from brown trial saves the charge from the deficiencies identified in johnson.see brief for see also brown iii,wl,at.i disagree.as brown rightly points out,the charge,though obviously correct as far as it goes,united states khan,cir,is discouraged on account of what it implies.see reply brief for at.one of its deleterious implications is its suggestion that a preponderance of the evidence standard is relevant,when it is not.khan,at see also leonard sand et,modern federal jury,instr,cmt.at if the jury is properly charged as to both the presumption of innocence and the reasonable doubt standard,this instruction adds nothing to the charge and may serve only to confuse the jury as to the burden of proof.the trial court here expressly instructed that very implication and wrongly made it applicable to the critical determination of identity.in my view,this charge is constitutionally deficient as is,and its omission of a charge does not render the contrary conclusion reasonable.
to be sure,we have found that a charge instructing,inter alia,that the jurors need not find every fact beyond a reasonable doubt became constitutionally deficient only when combined with the court erroneous instruction that s hould the prosecution fail to prove the guilt of a defendant beyond a reasonable doubt,you may acquit the defendant on the basis of the presumption of innocence.birbal,at.in this case,i find that the court preponderance instruction,when combined with its identification instructions,renders the charge constitutionally deficient.
whether an instruction advising the jury to find facts by a standard of proof less than beyond a reasonable doubt passes constitutional muster necessarily depends on the particular language used and the totality of the charge in this case,i believe the court preponderance charge likely led the jury to think a guilty verdict could be returned on an insufficient standard of proof.nor do i think it reasonable to deny this prospect of confusion.accordingly,i would hold that brown has established the prejudice element of his strickland claim under aedpa.
strickland performance prone 
with respect to the other component of brown strickland claim,the question is whether it was unreasonable for the appellate division,first department,to conclude that counsel performance did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness in light of prevailing professional norms.see,cox donnelly,cir.
counsel conduct must be assessed in light of the facts and law existing at the time.larrea bennett,cir.and brown must overcome a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and might be considered sound trial strategy.strickland washington,d internal quotation marks omitted.
however,a strategic decision is a conscious,reasonably informed decision made by an attorney with an eye to benefitting his client.cox,at internal quotation marks omitted.where counsel,for no strategic reason,repeatedly fails to object to a clearly unconstitutional charge on the key issue in a criminal case,the rejection of an ineffectiveness claim on that basis simply can not be viewed as reasonable.id.at see also henry scully,cir per curiam holding that counsel failure to object could not have been part of any meaningful defense strategy of which we can conceive,and counsel should have requested a missing witness charge because there was no downside to doing so and there was a potential benefit to be gained.and the right to effective assistance of counsel may in a particular case be violated by even an isolated error of counsel if that error is sufficiently egregious and prejudicial.murray carrier,d.
the majority agrees with respondents argument that counsel could have reasonably concluded that the instructions in this case,viewed as a whole,properly conveyed the burden of proof.brief for at,see ante at.i reject this argument for the same reasons i found it unreasonable for the appellate division to conclude that the charge was constitutional.
respondents further argue that counsel performance was within the range of reasonably competent assistance at the time because he could not have predicted that the appellate division,more than two years after brown trial,would find a similar charge unconstitutional in people johnson,dep t.see brief for at.likewise,the majority contends that johnson should not be used as a basis to fault brown trial counsel.ante at.
assessing the state of the law as it existed at the time of brown trial,bloomer united states,cir,as provided in decisions of the supreme court and this court and in new york law,i find that even before johnson it was unreasonable for counsel to fail to object to this jury charge 
since winship,few elements of due process have been clearer than the necessity of informing the jury that,to convict,it must find each defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of every element charged.united states birbal,cir.the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is one of the most ancient and aspects of our criminal justice system.id.at see also victor nebraska,d.this principle is bedrock,axiomatic and elementary.francis franklin,d internal quotation marks omitted gaines kelly,cir holding that rule requiring that a state trial court definition of reasonable doubt satisfy winship applies retroactively because it is a watershed rule of criminal procedure that alters our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.in,well before brown trial,the supreme court first held that a state trial court definition of reasonable doubt violated constitutional due process.gaines,at citing cage louisiana,d per curiam,overruled on another ground,estelle mcguire,d.and in,the court explained that trial courts must avoid defining reasonable doubt so as to lead the jury to convict on a lesser showing than due process requires.victor,at.
by the time of brown trial,we had described an instruction advising the jury that not every fact must be found beyond a reasonable doubt as a clear and previously identified error.bloomer,at see also birbal,at explaining that identification of such an instruction as error in united states delibac,cir per curiam,certainly made it obvious thereafter.we have repeatedly characterized such an instruction as an error,a deficien cy,a flaw,a problem,and language that should be avoided,see bloomer,at,birbal,at,delibac,at united states gatzonis,cir per curiam see also leonard sand et,modern federal jury,instr,cmt.at c ourts have admonished trial judges not to charge that separate bits of evidence need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.citing gatzonis,at,even if not standing alone a constitutional deficiency.indeed,justice saxe concurring opinion in johnson relies on our precedents.see johnson,dep t saxe,concurring larrea,at noting,in the course of holding that counsel can not be faulted for failing to predict a new york court of appeals decision,that the decision had cited only decisions.
the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case has long been a feature of new york law and is codified in the state criminal procedure law.see.proc.law no conviction of an offense by verdict is valid unless based upon trial evidence which is legally sufficient and which establishes beyond a reasonable doubt every element of such offense and the defendant commission thereof.derived from code crim.proc.a defendant in a criminal action is presumed to be innocent,until the contrary be proved and in case of a reasonable doubt whether his guilt is satisfactorily shown,he is entitled to an acquittal.by statute,new york also requires trial courts to instruct juries on this fundamental legal principle.see id.in its charge,the court must state the fundamental legal principles applicable to criminal cases in general.such principles include,but are not limited to,the requirement that guilt be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.and new york law has long made clear that identification must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.see,people whalen,criminal jury instructions new york,reasonable doubt ed.last visited august,t he people must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crime including that the defendant is the person who committed that crime proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you so firmly convinced of the defendant guilt that you have no reasonable doubt of the existence of any element of the crime or of the defendant identity as the person who committed the crime.footnotes omitted,witness.
by,if not earlier,new york courts identified as error an instruction charging the jury in words which could have been understood as applying the preponderance of evidence rule rather than the requirement of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.people rodriguez,dep t,appeal dismissed.and new york courts have long recognized that a ny diminution of the people duty to prove a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt is unacceptable and improper.people bailey,dep t holding that a charge instructing that there must be a preponderance in order to establish guilt resulted in improperly diminishing the people statutory burden of proving defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt see,people cotto,dep t holding that the use of the words reasonable certainty in the charge on reasonable doubt,depending on the content of the charge as a whole,may have a tendency to mislead or confuse the jury,and were improperly used in the charge in the present case.
in light of the preceding authorities,i find that by it was outside the range of reasonably competent assistance to fail to object to a burden of proof instruction advising the use of the preponderance standard for factual findings such as the critical issue of identity.because not every instruction that some facts may be found by proofless than beyond a reasonable doubt results in a constitutionally deficient charge,see supra at,i acknowledge that counsel need not be faulted for failing to object immediately at the court first mention of the to standard.nevertheless,once such an improper instruction was given,counsel was obligated to pay close attention to the remainder of the charge to ensure that the proper standard was adequately conveyed and to object because it was not although the instructions here were not as repeatedly erroneous as those at issue in cox,the error went to the key issue in the case,id.at,and indeed,the key issue in every criminal case,see,justice hoke,cir in all cases,the jury must resolve whether the evidence supports the factual propositions that the prosecution is attempting to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.in the absence of a strategic reason and respondents offer none,counsel failure to object to this clearly unconstitutional charge simply can not be viewed as reasonable.cox,at.accordingly,i would further hold that the appellate division unreasonably concluded that counsel performance was not deficient.see id.at.
conclusion 
the trial court jury instructions should not have diminished the prosecution burden of proving brown guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,and brown counsel was obligated to object when they did.in my view,counsel failure to do so was unreasonable,and so was the state court rejection of brown claim.for these reasons,i would reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for the entry of judgment conditionally granting brown the writ of habeas corpus.
there are too many such references to repeat them in detail.to give one example,the prosecution said,in summation the question is if the evidence you heard proves the defendants guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.trial tr.
see also t he presumption of innocence remains until you convinced.beyond a reasonable doubt describing reasonable doubt standard i t the people obligation to prove a defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.what is your concern is did the people prove beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of a robbery and the accuracy of the identification so,there are three elements,each of which must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
see also mullings meachum,cir upholding charge that stated a n inference in circumstantial evidence may be made providing that the inference asked to be drawn is strong enough so that you could find that it is more probable than not that the fact to be inferred is true.
indeed,immediately after the to statement,the trial judge in this case said that the elements must be established beyond a reasonable doubt if they going to be established at all.the charge then referred to the beyond a reasonable doubt standard seven additional times.moreover,as noted above,both the prosecution and the defense referred to the beyond a reasonable doubt standard numerous times during opening and closing arguments.
in the past,we have encouraged trial judges to give both parties a written copy of the proposed jury charge before instructing the jury.see united states birbal,cir.it appears that the trial judge here did not do so.providing a copy of the written instructions in advance makes it easier for the lawyers to ensure that the charge is free of erroneous or confusing language.this goal is presumably shared by both the defense and the prosecution after all,the prosecution would like to protect from successful appeal the convictions that it secures.
as we have already indicated,the election example is the section of the charge where the trial judge said f or centuries elections have been closely decided.beats every time and yet,for years now,juries,the same pool of people who ca agree on a candidate,have been unanimously deciding cases.so,how does that happen it happens,obviously,because within the jury deliberation context,people sometimes change their minds you can change your mind if somebody by reason,logic and reliance on the record of this case can cause you to change a position that you may have originally held.
the dissent focuses on another argument that the jury may have believed that it could find identity under a to standard.see post,at.but the charge appears to state in at least two places that identity must be found beyond a reasonable doubt.first,the charge states what is your concern is did the people prove beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of a robbery and,equally if not more importantly,the accuracy of the identification of burwell and brown as the person or persons involved in the crime.second,the charge states that,under new york one witness identification rule,the testimony of one person is sufficient for there to be a conviction,provided that the testimony is sufficiently persuasive and credible that it permits the jury to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.counsel for both sides also made numerous statements to the same effect.see,trial tr.you have to decide whether or not hammer proved beyond a reasonable doubt not only was a crime committed,but did brown and,for that matter,burwell commit the crime.
brown devotes part of his brief to people johnson,dep t,a case in which the appellate division reversed a conviction because of a charge that contained a statement similar to the to instruction,the election example and another problematic instruction,the charge.the majority opinion criticized all three parts of the charge,although it not entirely clear whether the majority would have reversed if the charge did not contain the instruction,which is not present in this case.see id.at.in any event johnson should not be used as a basis to fault brown trial counsel,since it was decided two years after brown trial.
because it is essential to consider the jury charge in its entirety and not just challenged language in isolation,see united states shamsideen,cir,my analysis takes the whole charge into account.i recite here in context only those portions of the charge that are particularly troublesome.in my view,the flaw in the majority analysis stems from its consideration of the court to instruction and references to reasonable doubt in isolation without engaging in the totality review that is required.
see penal law a person is guilty of robbery in the second degree when he forcibly steals property and when.he is aided by another person actually present.
unlike brown counsel,johnson counsel objected to the and point as confusing to the jury.see johnson,at,at.in overruling this objecti
