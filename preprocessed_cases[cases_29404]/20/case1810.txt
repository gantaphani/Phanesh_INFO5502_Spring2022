nunn and jill barclay were passengers in mccloud car.nunn was in the front seat and was shot several times.jill barclay was in the backseat,but was not wounded.both testified that mccloud pulled into a parking lot near an hangout and picked up jill barclay.they told the jury that as mccloud pulled out of the lot,goudy and a shorter accomplice approached on either side of the car and fired several shots,killing mccloud both testified that goudy was the man on the passenger side of the car.nunn said goudy wore a brown or beige corduroy jacket,was around five feet eight to five feet ten inches tall,had an afro hairstyle and wore a cap on his head.jill barclay said goudy wore a dark sweatshirt,had a hairstyle that was partially covered by the hood from the sweatshirt.both witnesses said they saw goudy and three other men earlier in the evening at a nearby club called the oasis.
jackie barclay,jill sister,and latonya young testified that they witnessed the shooting from across the street.jackie barclay and young had also been at the oasis that night and both said they saw goudy and three other men.after the oasis closed,both went to the club.jackie barclay testified that she was talking with some friends outside the club when she saw goudy and another man approach mccloud vehicle.she said goudy was around six feet tall and wore a dark jacket,dark pants or jeans,and had braids in his hair that were partially covered by his hood.the shooter on the driver side was shorter,wore a brown uniform,and had no facial hair.latonya young told the jury that goudy was the shooter on the driver side,that he was around five feet eight inches tall with braids and a ponytail and wore no hat or hood.young also testified in court that a recording of goudy car alarm was the same alarm she heard in the oasis parking lot that night.
a roommate of goudy,kaidi harvell,was the state primary witness and testified that he had been with goudy in anderson on the night of the shooting.he told the jury that he,goudy and goudy two brothers,romeo lee and lamont thomas drove up from indianapolis together that night to go to some bars.harvell said that goudy and lee coveted the tires and rims on mccloud car and had been talking about jacking them.after the group left the oasis,they headed toward the club with other locals,where goudy and lee planned to steal mccloud car.according to harvell,he and thomas were instructed to drive around the block while goudy and lee would steal the car.harvell told the jury that goudy shot into the driver side of mccloud car,and that he wore a brown prison coat,black cap and gloves.lee shot into the passenger side.
in addition to the evidence produced at trial,the government possessed three police reports that outlined statements by jill and jackie barclay,young,harvell,and another witness who did not testify at trial named donzetta clay.the first report describes a phone call to police from jill barclay in which she said she saw one of the gunmen at an indianapolis mall.she stated that she thought he kept looking at her over his shoulder and that she later saw him outside attempting to look at her license plate.she later identified this man as harvell and said she was positive he was one of the gunmen.the report additionally describes a photo lineup viewed by the barclay sisters and young.all three positively and without hesitation identified harvell as the gunman on the driver side of mccloud car,and said he wore brown clothing.the second police report details an lineup viewed by nunn,jill and jackie barclay,and donzetta clay.clay and the barclay sisters identified harvell nunn identified a as the shooter.the third report contains a statement from harvell indicating that he had been in contact with one of goudy alibi witnesses.he says he talked with her and that she wants to change her story.
the government did not disclose any of these statements to goudy,even though they implicate harvell and conflict with harvell version of events contradict young statement at trial that goudy was the driver side shooter,and conflict with nunn description of the gunmen.though it does not seem that the was intentional,none of this information was heard by the jury at goudy trial.
goudy was convicted on december.goudy counsel learned of the police reports in october,when the government disclosed the information they contained during romeo lee subsequent murder trial.by that time,goudy direct appeal was pending in the indiana supreme court,which denied his petition to reopen the record.
in addition to the undisclosed evidence contained in the police reports,the jury did not hear a confession given by romeo lee,goudy brother.while in prison in arizona on another charge,lee told goudy counsel and a private investigator that he and harvell had been the two shooters.lee said he and his brother were often confused for each other because of their similar looks.in his confession,lee said harvell was the gunman on the driver side of mccloud car and that he wore brown work clothing.lee said that he was on the passenger side of the car and wore a black raiders jacket.he said the shooting was the culmination of a verbal altercation between harvell and mccloud that began at the oasis earlier that evening.
when authorities transported lee from arizona to indiana to testify at goudy trial,lee appointed counsel advised him to assert his fifth amendment right not to testify.when called,lee refused to answer any questions on and the court struck what little testimony he had given.the prosecution later used the confession at lee own trial to convict him of the murders.neither party offers an explanation for counsel failure to introduce lee confession.while goudy petition suggests the possibility that counsel was unaware that the confession was and admissible under indiana rule of evidence b,the record is not clear as to exactly why counsel never attempted its admission.at any rate,the jury never heard lee version of events.
goudy appealed his conviction,claiming among other things that the trial court erred in rejecting goudy request for an review of the police reports to determine whether they contained exculpatory information.the indiana supreme court rejected goudy arguments.after receiving the police reports from lee counsel,goudy filed a petition with the supreme court to supplement or expand the record on appeal.the supreme court denied goudy petition,but noted that the documents were not available to goudy counsel and that he acted with diligence.goudy state,at.the court suggested goudy seek relief.
goudy then petitioned for relief,asserting that the failure to disclose the evidence in the police reports was a violation of the rule in brady maryland,d.goudy also argued that the failure to introduce lee confession denied him a fair trial.
the court of appeals of indiana denied goudy petition.the court held that goudy waived his claim regarding the suppressed evidence because he could have asserted it on direct appeal.and while it labeled counsel conduct deficien t,the court did not engage in a detailed analysis of whether goudy counsel was constitutionally ineffective.goudy state,at.it instead rejected goudy second claim on the basis that he suffered no prejudice as a result of his counsel failure to introduce lee recor
