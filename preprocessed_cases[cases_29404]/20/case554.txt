background 
our recitation of the following facts established at petitioner state trial presents the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution.see fama comm r of corr,cir.ponnapula played an important role in fraudulently obtaining a million loan from the bank of india the bank.the scheme was orchestrated by petitioner brother,ponnapula sanjeeva prasad.prasad owned the prasad organization,an umbrella organization with several operating entities that purchased hotels for quick resale at a profit.ponnapula operated three of these hotels and renovated others using his two construction companies.other employees of the prasad organization included vijay dandapani,prasad first assistant mahesh shetty,the chief financial officer pasha ponnapula pasha,petitioner other brother and pat white,dandapani assistant.
to raise cash to purchase hotel properties,prasad,dandapani,shetty,and white prepared a series of fraudulent applications to obtain loans from six different banks,at times channeling the proceeds of one loan to cover the outstanding balance of the other loans.as detailed below,the million loan that served as the basis of petitioner conviction was part of this overall scheme.
i.the million loan 
in,the prasad organization main operating entity,the zurich corporation zurich,used proceeds from a loan that was fraudulently obtained from the bank of credit and commerce international to purchase a hotel and an adjacent parking lot near laguardia airport in flushing,new york.later that same year,zurich applied for a million loan,again using falsified documents,from the bank of india to purchase a hotel in tennessee million loan.
the bank agreed to lend zurich the million,but conditioned the disbursement of the proceeds on zurich first repaying its existing million debt to the bank.in order to satisfy this requirement,prasad decided to take out a million loan from the bank using the parking lot near laguardia airport as collateral.
because the million loan would push zurich credit above the company limit with the bank,prasad took several steps to mask his and zurich involvement in the loan application.the loan would be taken out in the name of hospitality realty corporation hrc,a shell corporation of the prasad organization that was legally distinct from zurich.prasad split the titles of the hotel and the parking lot and,in january,transferred the parking lot from zurich to hrc.to avoid listing prasad as a stockholder or officer of hrc,dandapani and prasad designated ponnapula as both one hundred percent stockholder and president of hrc.they chose ponnapula because he had a real company and had a better ability than pasha to field any questions.finally,because prasad first name is ponnapula,petitioner name appeared on the loan application documents as murali krishna,rather than murali krishna ponnapula.
dandapani,shetty,and white prepared the loan application package on behalf of hrc,including a false representation about hrc experience in acquiring and renovating hotels and an inaccurate personal financial statement for ponnapula that reflected his personal worth to be over million.dandapani forged petitioner signature on both the application and the personal financial statement.
dandapani later informed ponnapula that he was listed as the borrower on the loan but that it was a prasad loan.dandapani advised ponnapula that his last name had been omitted from the documents to prevent the bank from discovering his relationship with prasad.furthermore,dandapani told ponnapula that a personal financial statement had been submitted on his behalf,but did not tell him that the value of his personal wealth had been exaggerated.dandapani also warned him that the bank had been told that the purpose of the loan was to purchase the parking lot,a lot that ponnapula knew hrc already owned.finally,dandapani told ponnapula to expect calls from the bank regarding the loan.
after the loan application had been submitted,the bank requested more information with respect to ponnapula personal finances.accordingly,dandapani and ponnapula met with ponnapula personal banker,david moore of northwest georgia bank,and requested that he act as a reference.subsequent to this meeting,moore sent a reference letter to the bank on behalf of hrc and ponnapula.
the bank approved the loan for the purpose of providing working capital for the operation of the parking lot.according to the bank officer who evaluated the loan application,his decision to approve the loan was based on a package of factors,including petitioner personal guaranty,his reported personal worth of million,and hrc alleged activity in renovating and acquiring hotels.
after the loan was approved,ponnapula and dandapani traveled to new york for the closing.at the closing,dennis krasner,an attorney for the bank,handed ponnapula documents from the closing binder one at a time and identified each document for him.ponnapula looked at the documents,but did not read them,and then signed them as murali krishna.in his capacity as president of hrc,ponnapula signed various papers,including a loan agreement,stating that the loan proceeds would be used by hrc to operate the parking lot a promissory note and a letter directing the proceeds to be disbursed to hrc.in his personal capacity,ponnapula signed a guaranty for million and an affidavit stating that he was familiar with the property and that he was president of hrc.
after the closing,the loan proceeds were disbursed to hrc.as planned,the funds were immediately transferred to zurich and used to pay down the million owed to the bank.zurich thereafter received the million loan from the bank.
in september,hrc fell behind on the interest payments to the bank.at about the same time,dandapani told ponnapula to direct any inquiries from the bank regarding the default to him or prasad.in early,prasad told the bank that he would assume responsibility for the loan,but prasad subsequently left the united states and has not returned.the bank contacted ponnapula directly by letter and phone on several occasions requesting payment and,after months of failing to respond to the bank requests,ponnapula promised to work on a repayment plan.in the spring of,dandapani and pasha proposed separate plans for repayment of the loan,both of which were ultimately rejected by the bank.after supporting pasha plan in a letter dated may,ponnapula never contacted the bank again.
by may,after the loan had gone into litigation,approximately was paid on the account.after ponnapula was convicted,the bank sold its interest in the parking lot and recovered million of the million loan.
ii.other fraudulent loan applications 
in addition to the evidence directly linking ponnapula to the million loan,the state rebutted ponnapula defense of lack of knowledge and intent by presenting evidence at trial that ponnapula helped prasad fraudulently obtain three other loans worth millions.
for example,in its application for the million loan that was the catalyst for the million loan,zurich listed one of ponnapula construction companies,majestic construction majestic,as a major supplier for zurich.although majestic was not a supplier at all,much less a major supplier,ponnapula was prepared to respond as a supplier if the bank asked him any questions.
in another loan application submitted in,dandapani forged ponnapula signature on a personal guaranty for a million loan from a different bank,the state bank of india million loan.he instructed pasha to tell ponnapula that he was listed as a guarantor.after the million loan went into default,the state bank of india directly contacted ponnapula.although his signature on the personal guaranty had been forged,ponnapula did not deny signing the guaranty and later sent a proposal for the management of the property,which was rejected.
also in,the prasad organization applied for a million loan from branch banking trust to be secured by property owned by cox trailers,a company in which the prasad organization had a majority interest million loan.branch banking trust made approval of the loan conditional on an acceptable environmental report on the property by a professional firm.after an independent firm found unacceptable results,ponnapula suggested to prasad and dandapani that his assistant,robert price,could create a fake environmental report that would pass muster with the bank.the name of the inspection firm appeared on the report as edwards environmental services,based on ponnapula assurances to dandapani and prasad that the firm could be shown to be a valid environmental inspection firm.price concocted a false report that was accepted by the bank and the loan was approved.
iii.state and district court proceedings 
at the close of trial,the jury returned a guilty verdict,convicting ponnapula of grand larceny in the first degree and falsifying business records in the first degree for his participation in obtaining the million loan.the trial judge set aside the conviction and dismissed the indictment on the basis that the evidence was insufficient to prove ponnapula knew that the application contained false information.the first department of the appellate division found the evidence sufficient and reversed.people ponnapula.on remand,the trial court sentenced ponnapula to concurrent terms of imprisonment of one to three years on the larceny count and one year on the falsifying business records count.
petitioner appealed his conviction,arguing,in relevant part,that the evidence regarding the amount of the taking and his intent to commit larceny was insufficient and that the state withheld exculpatory and impeachment evidence from the defense in violation of brady maryland,d,and giglio united states,d.the appellate division rejected these claims,people ponnapula,and his application for leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals was denied,people ponnapula.after the district court denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review a district court denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus de novo,see clark stinson,cir,cert.denied,d,and its factual findings for clear error,see amadeo zant,d.the circumstances under which we may grant the writ are strictly limited to those where an adjudication on the merits in state proceedings resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.we presume that the state court factual findings are correct unless they are rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.see e.
i.the sufficiency of the evidence 
ponnapula claims that the evidence was insufficient to establish his knowledge or intent to commit larceny because he was never directly told that the loan application contained materially false information.in addition,he contends that,as a matter of new york law,his pledge of the parking lot as collateral offset the amount taken from the bank and,as a result,the state failed to prove that he stole in excess of million.thus,he claims that he should have been convicted of a lesser degree of larceny,if at all.
in a challenge under to the evidentiary sufficiency of a state criminal conviction,we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the state and the applicant is entitled to habeas corpus relief only if no rational trier of fact could find proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on the evidence adduced at trial.see jackson virginia,d fama,at.petitioner bears a very heavy burden in convincing a federal habeas court to grant a petition on the grounds of insufficient evidence.see quirama michele,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
when considering the sufficiency of the evidence of a state conviction,a federal court must look to state law to determine the elements of the crime.quartararo hanslmaier,cir.under new york law,the degrees of larceny are defined by the size of the taking committed by the defendant.grand larceny in the first degree requires a theft of property that is valued in excess of million.penal law mckinney.in addition to the monetary threshold,the government must prove that the defendant specifically intended to deprive the victim of the property and did so by,inter alia,false pretenses or false promise.penal law mckinney.
larceny by false pretenses is committed when,with the intent to deprive an owner of his property,a defendant intentionally makes a false representation about a past or presently existing fact upon which the victim relied in parting with his property.see penal law a people norman.a defendant is guilty of larceny by false promise when,pursuant to a scheme to defraud,the defendant obtains property of another by means of a representation that he would in the future engage in particular conduct,and when he did not intend to engage in such conduct.penal law d.
evidence of larcenous knowledge and intent 
appellant argues that the evidence did not establish that he knew the documents contained materially false information and therefore he lacked larcenous intent or knowledge.as the district court recognized,the appellate division exhaustively analyzed the evidence presented at trial,see ponnapula,and our independent review of the record reveals sufficient evidence to infer petitioner knowledge and intent to further prasad fraudulent scheme.
ponnapula does not dispute that he signed a personal guaranty,but argues that dandapani never informed him that his personal worth had been misrepresented.the jury could infer,however,that ponnapula knew that the bank would not have accepted his guaranty on such a large loan unless dandapani had exaggerated ponnapula personal worth in the application.moreover,signing the personal guaranty without the intent to repay the loan,if necessary,constitutes larceny by false promise.ponnapula lack of intent to repay was evidenced by his awareness that his personal resources would be inadequate to cover such a sizable loan.furthermore,he ignored the default notices for months and then relied on dandapani and pasha to renegotiate the terms of the loan.ponnapula ended communication with the bank after pasha repayment plan was rejected and,instead of securing funds to repay the bank,sought loans with other banks for different projects.as the appellate division found,the jury could reasonably conclude that defendant signed the guaranty merely because it was required,not because he ever truly intended to repay the loan.see ponnapula,at.
further evidence of petitioner knowledge of the fraud was established by his awareness that the loan was meant for prasad but that the bank had been misled to believe that hrc would use the proceeds to purchase the parking lot.ponnapula furthered these deceptions by dropping his last name when signing the closing documents,a strategic decision that dandapani and prasad made to distance ponnapula from prasad,and by accepting the position of president and sole stockholder in hrc.although petitioner contends that the bank ultimately discovered his relationship to prasad and that hrc already owned the lot,ponnapula intent to deceive the bank in making the false representations is not negated by the bank independent research.fi
