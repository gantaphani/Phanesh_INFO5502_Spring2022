petitioner tito abrante seeks habeas review of his massachusetts state convictions.the district court orally denied abrante habeas petition but granted a certificate of appealability as to all issues.we affirm the district court denial of habeas relief.
we relate the facts of the underlying crime as they were found by the massachusetts appeals court mac,supplemented with other record facts that are consistent with the state court findings.see lynch ficco,cir.under aedpa,we must accept the state court findings of fact unless abrante convinces us,by clear and convincing evidence,that they are in error.id.quoting mccambridge hall,cir en banc d and e.
in the early morning of december,a series of armed robberies was committed in springfield,massachusetts.abrante nephew,fernando perez,robbed three victims at gunpoint and shot and critically injured a fourth,an police officer,while attempting to rob him.abrante drove perez in abrante car from robbery to robbery.he also conceived of the crime spree and provided perez with a gun.
both perez and abrante were arrested for the string of robberies.while abrante was in jail,he told four inmates of his involvement in the crimes.these inmates eventually informed the police of abrante admissions,and two of the inmates,nelson maldonado and jesus tolentino,testified at abrante trial all four of the inmates eventually received favorable dispositions of their cases 
on april,a massachusetts superior court jury convicted abrante of i three counts of armed robbery,ii four counts of use of a firearm while committing a felony,iii armed assault with intent to murder,iv armed assault with intent to rob,v assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon,and vi discharging a firearm within feet of a dwelling.the mac affirmed the convictions,and the supreme judicial court denied abrante application for further appellate review.on april,abrante filed a motion for a new trial,which the trial judge denied without a hearing.the mac affirmed the trial judge denial of the motion,and no further appellate review was granted.
abrante filed his petition for habeas corpus on february.on december,the district court held a hearing and ruled from the bench in favor of respondent.abrante then filed an application for a certificate of appealability,which was granted in its entirety.
on appeal,abrante makes the following four arguments the state established an agency relationship with the inmate informants in violation of abrante sixth and fourteenth amendment right to counsel abrante right to due process was violated by the admission of inmate informant testimony abrante received ineffective assistance of trial counsel and the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,is unconstitutional on its face and as applied in this case.
we review de novo the district court decision to grant or deny habeas relief under aedpa,cir citing healy spencer,cir.
the mac previously adjudicated abrante first three federal claims.aedpa governs these claims and specifies different standards of review for state court conclusions of law and findings of fact.respecting abrante claims that challenge legal conclusions,we may not grant his petition for habeas relief unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.as to abrante challenges to state court findings of fact,habeas relief is only appropriate when the state court decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.a state court adjudication is contrary to clearly established law if the court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by the supreme court or confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from its precedent.gomes brady,cir quoting williams taylor,d alterations in gomes.an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law occurs if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.aspen bissonnette,cir citing horton allen,cir.given this standard,the state court decision is not vulnerable unless it evinces some increment of incorrectness beyond mere error.foxworth amand,cir citing mccambridge,at.the state court interpretation or application of federal law must be objectively unreasonable.furr brady,cir citing horton,at.
violation of right to counsel claim 
abrante first claims that the state established agency relationships with inmate informants who then elicited admissions from him without the presence of counsel in violation of his sixth and fourteenth amendment rights.abrante argues that the mac finding that no agency relationship existed between the informants and the police before the informants heard his admissions was an unreasonable factual determination.he also characterizes the mac finding as a violation of supreme court precedent.we disagree.
we first address abrante argument that the state court decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.in affirming the trial court denial of abrante motion for a new trial,the mac found that abrante had provided no evidence of any agreement between the inmate informants and police that existed before the informants heard abrante admissions.commonwealth abrante,wl,at,table under aedpa,we presume these findings to be correct,and abrante has not offered clear and convincing evidence that would lead us to conclude that they are unreasonable in light of the evidence presented to the state court.d and e 
abrante argues that tolentino bail reduction from to and tolentino subsequent disappearance show that tolentino had an agreement with the police to provide information against abrante.the circumstances abrante alleges,however,do not show that any agreement existed with the police before tolentino heard abrante admissions about his crimes.evidence that tolentino met with springfield police officer joselito lozada on january,on matters which abrante concedes were unrelated to him,is not to the contrary.
as to maldonado,abrante offers nothing more than the coincidence that maldonado was moved to abrante cell in november,the same month that the united states attorney declined to prosecute maldonado after being informed that maldonado would be prosecuted by the state.abrante suggests that the timing of these two events as well as the timing of perez trial in that same month and subsequent police requests for information about abrante from maldonado suggests a particularly strong relationship of agency between the state and maldonado.this is mere speculation.
abrante also argues that the government solicited evidence about abrante from maldonado,tolentino,and melendez,and that the mac finding that there was no solicitation was unreasonable.first,we must note that the mac did not make a finding that there was no solicitation.it made no finding at all on this point.rather,the court concluded that even if it were to assume,arguendo,that police had told the inmates that they were seeking information about abrante,abrante claim that an agency relationship existed would still fail.abrante,wl,at.
abrante has not offered clear and convincing evidence of any contact between the government and the informants beyond that described by the mac and he has similarly failed to demonstrate that the mac legal conclusion was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.a police officer asking an inmate whether abrante had already discussed his case with that inmate does not create an agency relationship that could implicate the sixth amendment.see,united states taylor,cir holding that i n the absence of any express or implied quid pro quo underlying the relationship between the informant and the government,and in the absence of any instructions or directions by the government,informant was not a government agent.
we also reject abrante argument that the state cour
