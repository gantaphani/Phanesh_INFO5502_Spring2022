eric johnson was convicted in wisconsin state court of two counts of intentional homicide and sentenced to life imprisonment on both counts.after exhausting the appellate process and review in state court,johnson filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal court.the district court denied his petition,finding that it was barred by the statute of limitations,and that equitable tolling did not apply.johnson appeals,and we affirm.
background 
on the morning of september,while sitting in the back seat of a car,eric johnson shot to death george cole and torrance jackson,who were seated in the front seat.a detective dispatched to the scene testified that cole,sitting in the driver seat,had a gunshot wound to the left side of his face and an exit wound on the right side of his head.jackson,sitting in the passenger seat,had a gunshot wound to the back of his head,with a majority of his head missing.one of the police detectives testified that johnson confessed to meeting with cole and jackson in order to sell jackson a shotgun,going to a bank with them,getting into a disagreement with jackson,shooting jackson in the head and then shooting cole in the head because cole saw him shoot jackson.at trial,johnson testified in his own defense,blaming a fourth individual named earl for the shootings.the jury apparently believed johnson confession because,on december,it found him guilty of two counts of intentional homicide while armed.on january,the trial judge sentenced johnson to serve a life sentence on each count,to be served consecutively.on november,the wisconsin court of appeals affirmed johnson conviction.johnson then filed a petition for review with the wisconsin supreme court,which was denied on february.
on june,johnson filed his first petition for relief in state trial court,arguing that he had received ineffective assistance of trial counsel,and that he had failed to raise that issue on direct appeal because his appellate counsel was ineffective on july,the trial court dismissed his petition based on state knight,holding that in order to bring a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,defendant must file petition in appellate court,and directing him to file his petition in the state appellate court.johnson had ninety days to appeal that decision,see.stat,but he did not.instead,on october,as the trial court had directed,he filed his petition in the state appellate court.on october,the wisconsin court of appeals,in state ex rel.rothering mccaughtry,mandated that habeas corpus petitions based on ineffective assistance of postconviction as distinguished from appellate counsel be filed in a trial court.relying on rothering,on november,the court of appeals dismissed johnson petition and directed him to his petition in the state trial court.johnson had days to appeal this decision to the wisconsin supreme court,see.stat,but he did not do so.instead,on january,johnson filed his petition for the third time in the state trial court,which denied it on the merits on january.on march,johnson appealed the trial court decision,and on may,the court of appeals affirmed.on june,johnson filed a petition for review with the wisconsin supreme court which was denied on july.then,on february,johnson filed the present habeas petition,which the district court denied,finding that it was barred by the statute of limitations and that equitable tolling did not apply.the district court denied johnson request for a certificate of appealability,which he renewed in this court,and which we granted on january.
ii.analysis 
statute of limitations 
the district court denied johnson petition,finding that it was barred by the statute of limitations period applicable to a state prisoner seeking habeas corpus relief under.see d.this period commences on the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.d a.thus,johnson state court conviction became final on february,the date the wisconsin supreme court denied direct review of his conviction.where,as here,the petitioner state court conviction became final prior to the statute effective date,april,the period begins on april.see fernandez sternes,cir.johnson did not file the present habeas petition until february,nearly three years after the period began to run.
at first glance it appears that johnson claim is.but,under section d,the time which a properly filed application for state review or other collateral review is pending is excluded from the limitation period.a state petition is pending between the date of one appellate court decision and the petitioner filing of a further appeal,thereby tolling the period of limitation.see fernandez,at time following an appellate court decision,and preceding a timely application for discretionary review is excluded from the calculation under d.thus,all of the time between january,when johnson filed his third petition,and july,when the wisconsin supreme court denied his request for review,is excludable.
however,on appeal,johnson argues that all of the time to seek appellate review within the state system,even where he never filed for such review,should be excluded from the countable year.there are two crucial time periods at issue.first,johnson seeks to exclude the period in which he could have appealed from the trial court july,decision,although he did not do so,instead letting days elapse until he his petition in the court of appeals.second,johnson seeks to exclude the days he had to appeal from the november,court of appeals decision,even though he did not do so and instead let days elapse until he his petition in the trial court in support of his position,johnson points to several other circuits which have held that a collateral action is pending in state court for the period during which further review could have been sought,even where such review is not actually sought 
this court has yet to consider this precise issue.we have observed,however,that it is sensible to say that a petition continues to be pending during the period between one court decision and a timely request for further review by a higher court provided that such a request is filed.fernandez,at.in fernandez,we reserved the question whether time provided for filing a petition or appeal to a higher court is treated as time during which an application is pending,if the time expires without a filing.id.however,in gutierrez schomig,cir,we held that the limitations period for filing a federal habeas petition was not tolled during time in which petitioner could have filed a petition for certiorari review of denial of state relief in the united states supreme court.surprisingly,the government did not try to persuade us to extend our holding in gutierrez to the present facts.even more surprising is the fact that the government confessed error in its response brief,stating that johnson habeas petition was timely filed,and requesting remand to address his ineffective assistance of counsel arguments.at oral argument,the government oscillated in its position,initially repeating its statement that the petition was timely filed,and then agreeing that it might not be timely filed.
regardless of which position the government chooses to advocate,we will make an independent judicial assessment of whether the district court correctly dismissed johnson petition based on the statute of limitations.see sibron new york,d c onfessions of error are,of course,entitled to and given great weight,but they do not relieve this court of the performance of the judicial function.quoting young united states.we need not decide today whether to extend gutierrez because we conclude that johnson first two petitions were not properly filed as required under section d.
under section d,we only exclude the time which a properly filed application for state review or other collateral review is pending.an application is properly filed when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings.artuz bennett,d.applic able laws and rules include the court and office in which it must be lodged id.see also tinker hanks,cir quoting same.w
