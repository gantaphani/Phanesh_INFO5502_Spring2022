introduction 
dale stewart appeals from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of ohio denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.in september of,stewart pled guilty in an ohio state court to two counts of sexual battery,and he was sentenced in october of to consecutive terms on each count,for a total of eight years imprisonment.after an initial appeal resulted in a remand to the trial court for resentencing,stewart served a subpoena upon the butler county probation department that sought the production of,among other items,the victim impact statements that the trial court had considered at his original sentencing hearing.the trial judge granted the state motion to quash this subpoena,and neither stewart nor his counsel has ever been allowed to review the victim impact statements.stewart then was resentenced in august of to the same two consecutive terms of imprisonment.
after exhausting his state remedies,stewart filed a habeas petition in federal district court pursuant to,alleging,inter alia,that he was denied due process of law because he was not given the opportunity to review,rebut,and explain the entire body of information that the sentencing court relied upon to justify its imposition of an prison term.the district court denied the habeas petition but,on the same day,granted stewart motion to expand the habeas record and ordered the state of ohio to file,under seal,the presentence report and victim impact statements from stewart case.the custodian of these documents has thus far refused to comply with the district court order,and these documents do not appear in the record on appeal.the district court also subsequently granted a certificate of appealability as to stewart due process challenge,and this is the sole claim presently before us.
as explained below,we agree with the district court that there is no clearly established federal constitutional right to full disclosure of all information used by a trial judge in determining a defendant sentence.nonetheless,we recognize,as did the court below,that there is a clearly established federal due process protection against a trial court reliance on materially false information at sentencing.unlike the district court,we find ourselves unable to ascertain whether this latter sort of due process violation might have occurred here,where a portion of the materials used in determining stewart sentence has been withheld from federal court review,and where the limited record before us suggests a reasonable possibility that at least some of this sentencing information might have been erroneous.consequently,we reverse the district court order denying stewart petition for a writ of habeas corpus and remand for additional proceedings,with further instructions that the writ should be granted if the state fails to supplement the record as ordered by the district court within days of the date of this opinion.
ii.factual and procedural background 
on august,the prosecuting attorney for butler county,ohio,filed a bill of information charging dale stewart with two counts of sexual battery in violation of ohio a.at his arraignment on september,stewart pled guilty to both counts.the trial court sentenced stewart to consecutive terms of four years imprisonment on each count,fined him,and adjudged him a offender.stewart appealed,and the ohio court of appeals remanded the case for resentencing upon finding that the trial court had failed to specify the basis for a sentence greater than the statutory minimum.
before resentencing,stewart subpoenaed the butler county probation department to provide him with a number of materials,including the victim impact statements that the trial court had reviewed and considered at his initial sentencing.the trial court granted the state motion to quash the subpoena and,on august,resentenced stewart to the same term it had originally imposed.
on august,the ohio court of appeals affirmed this sentence.in so ruling,the court rejected as speculative and not supported by the record stewart contention that the trial court had impermissibly rel ied upon the secret information contained in the victim impact statements.state stewart,ohio app d.instead,the state appellate court stated that it had reviewed the the presentence report psi,psychological evaluations,and victim impact found that,while the trial court had considered the victim impact statements,the facts ultimately relied on by the trial court in sentencing stewart were otherwise reflected in the psychological evaluations and the psi.id.because stewart and his counsel had been given access to these latter materials,the ohio court of appeals concluded that the trial court had not abuse d its discretion in denying stewart access to the victim impact statements.id.although stewart challenge rested in part upon federal due process grounds,the state appellate court did not discuss the united states supreme court and federal appellate decisions that stewart cited in support of this claim,but instead stated in cursory fashion and with citation only to ohio court rulings that we find no violation of due process.id.at.on january,the supreme court of ohio dismissed stewart appeal as not involving any substantial constitutional question.
after unsuccessfully seeking relief in the state courts,stewart commenced this federal habeas proceeding on march,filing a petition under in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.in an opinion filed on november,the district court adopted a magistrate judge report and recommendation that stewart petition be denied,but issued a certificate of appealability as to stewart due process claim.the district court also granted stewart motion to expand the habeas record,ordering the state of ohio to file,under seal,the psi and victim impact statements that had been included in the record on stewart direct appeal to the ohio court of appeals.regrettably,the custodian of these,we were informed at oral argument,is the trial judge who presided over stewart thus far refused to comply with the district court order and,as a result,these items are not contained in the record on appeal.
iii.analysis 
a.the standards governing federal habeas review of stewart due process challenge 
as a general matter,we review a district court decision regarding a writ of habeas corpus de novo.ege yukins,cir.factual findings made by the district court are reviewed for clear error unless the factual determinations are made based on state court documents,in which case the factual findings are reviewed de novo.id.
because the federal habeas petition in this case was filed after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,the provisions of aedpa govern here.see hicks straub,cir,cert.denied,d.in particular,the controlling aedpa provision states 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established law if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court cases or if it confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from this precedent.mitchell esparza,d per curiam quoting williams taylor,d see also bell cone,d.t he unreasonable application prong of d permits a federal habeas court to grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of petitioner case.wiggins smith,d quoting williams,at.at see also bell,at.at.however,i n order for a federal court to find a state court application of supreme court precedent unreasonable,the state court decision must have been more than incorrect or erroneous,but rather must have been objectively unreasonable.wiggins,at.at citations omitted.
section d limits a federal court habeas review to the clearly established federal law as set forth by the supreme court at the time the state court rendered its decision.see williams,at.at see also lockyer andrade,d.yet,while the principles of clearly established law are to be determined solely by resort to supreme court rulings,the decisions of lower federal courts may be instructive in assessing the reasonableness of a state court resolution of an issue.see williams bowersox,cir dickens jones,d.
compliance with d does not require citation of supreme court,it does not even require awareness of supreme court cases,so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the decision contradicts them.early packer,d per curiam see also mitchell,at.at.however,where the state court decides a claim on the merits but does not articulate the reasons for its decision,we are obligated to conduct an independent review of the record and applicable law to determine whether the state court decision is contrary to federal law,unreasonably applies clearly established law,or is based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.daniels lafler,cir quoting harris stovall,cir.we emphasized in harris that this independent review is not a full,de novo review of the claims,but remains deferential because the court can not grant relief unless the state court result is not in keeping with the strictures of the aedpa.harris,at.
in this case,when the ohio court of appeals rejected stewart federal due process challenge,it did not articulate a basis in federal law for doing so.instead,it cited only an ohio statute permitting a trial court to withhold victim impact statements at its discretion,as well as two state court cases applying this statute,without any discussion of any possible federal constitutional questions.under harris,then,deference is owed only to the result reached by the ohio court of appeals,and not its reasoning,and this court must conduct an independent review of the record and the law to determine whether the state court ruling comports with the requirements of d.id.we now turn to this inquiry.
b.the ohio court did not reach a decision contrary to clearly established federal law in rejecting stewart claim that he was entitled to the disclosure of all information used to determine his sentence.
the due process claim advanced in stewart federal habeas petition rests,at least in part,upon the proposition that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment ensures his opportunity to review,rebut,and explain all of the,in particular,the victim impact the ohio trial judge considered in determining his sentence.on this theory,the trial court violated stewart right to due process by relying upon the victim impact statements without disclosing them to him or his counsel.stewart contends that this right to full disclosure is recognized in a number of supreme court rulings.accordingly,a review of these decisions is in order.
stewart first points to townsend burke,an appeal from a state court denial of habeas corpus relief.the defendant in that case pled guilty to charges of robbery and burglary and was immediately sentenced in the same proceeding to a term of imprisonment,all without the benefit of counsel.as grounds for its sentencing decision,the trial court recited a number of prior charges brought against the defendant,but failed to acknowledge that one of these charges had been dismissed and that the defendant had been acquitted of two others.in finding a due process violation,the supreme court reasoned that the defendant sentence rested on a foundation which was extensively and materially false,and which the defendant had no opportunity to correct by the services which counsel would provide.townsend,at.at.the court concluded that s uch a result,whether caused by carelessness or design,is inconsistent with due process of law.see also united states tucker,d following townsend in overturning a sentence founded at least in part upon misinformation of constitutional magnitude,where the sentencing judge had considered two prior convictions that had subsequently been invalidated for violation of the defendant right to counsel.
townsend and its progeny are generally viewed as having established a due process requirement that a defendant be afforded the opportunity of rebutting derogatory information demonstrably relied upon by the sentencing judge,when such information can in fact be shown to have been materially false.collins buchkoe,cir see also arnett jackson,cir.citing the general rule that a violation of due process exists when a sentencing judge relies upon erroneous information internal quotation marks and citations omitted,cert.denied,d united states taylor,cir w hen a trial judge relies on materially false or unreliable information in sentencing a defendant,the defendant due process rights are violated.internal quotation marks and citation omitted united states curran,cir it is well settled that a defendant has a due process right to be sentenced upon information which is not false or materially incorrect.
yet,we do not read townsend and its progeny as having clearly established the considerably broader principle that stewart seeks to invoke,that all information relied upon by a sentencing court must be disclosed to the defendant,whether or not it is later determined to be materially false.to the contrary,the federal appellate courts that have considered this issue have uniformly concluded that townsend and tucker do not recognize such a federal due process right to full disclosure.in curran,at,for example,the first circuit opined that it was unclear whether due process compels an opportunity to inspect and challenge the information to be relied upon by the sentencing court,and observed that there was no judicial precedent which holds that the due process clause requires disclosure of all information relied upon by the sentencing court.similarly,in united states nappi,cir,the third circuit found that the district court had violated.by relying on a state presentence report at sentencing without disclosing this document to the defendant or his counsel,but nonetheless concluded that this error was not of constitutional dimension absent a showing that the information in the report was inaccurate or false,or that the district court mischaracterized any of the information it cited from the report.see also united states hamad,cir i t remains unclear whether the constitution gives sentencing courts a free hand to rely on,to be more dramatic,that increase an individual sentence,advisory committee notes to amendments it is not a denial of due process of law for a court in sentencing to rely on a report of a presentence investigation without disclosing such report to the defendant or giving him an opportunity to rebut it.
indeed,when confronted with a case in which a district court relied on ex parte communications from victims of a bank robbery in determining a defendant sentence,a panel of this court stopped short of recognizing a federal due process right to disclosure of these communications,and instead held,in a split decision,that the district court had violated.by citing the victims letters at sentencing without disclosing them to the defendant or his counsel.united states hayes,cir.in so ruling,the panel majority observed that rule is intended to protect the right to due process by requiring disclosure of most information relied upon at sentencing,but acknowledged and expressly agreed with the first circuit determination in curran that neither rule nor the due process clause requires that absolutely everything be disclosed.id.at.
notably,the dissenting judge in hayes was careful to distinguish between the majority explicit holding in this case,that the sentencing court violated rule in failing to turn over the letters or a summary of their contents,and a more broad assertion,not explicitly relied upon by the majority,that the actions violated constitutional due process.at batchelder,dissenting.in the dissent view,it was rule,and not constitutional due process,that provide d the basis for the majority decision,and due process d id not compel the result reached in that case.see also united states meeker,cir finding that a district court reliance at sentencing on letters from victims that the defendant had no prior opportunity to review violated rule,a procedural rule that the sixth circuit has recognized as protect ing the right to due process by requiring disclosure of most information relied upon at sentencing quoting hayes,at hili sciarrotta,cir observing that the due process right not to be sentenced on the basis of information that is materially false is protected by affording the defendant notice of and an opportunity to respond to information on which the court intends to rely in imposing sentence.
our recent decision in hamad,supra,reaffirms this distinction between the dictates of rule and the due process clause.in that case,the district court received and considered,but did not share with the defendant,a number of documents that reflect ed poorly on the defendant.hamad,at.pursuant to rule,the district court provided the defendant with a summary of these documents,acknowledging that the underlying materials contained a great deal more information,but opining that the summary was adequate to prepare the defendant for the sentencing hearing while also protecting the confidentiality of sources.id.at.
upon surveying the pertinent supreme court decisions,including townsend,that address the scope of a defendant constitutional protections at sentencing,we concluded that t he upshot is this while a defendant may not have the constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him at sentencing,it remains unclear under modern sentencing practices what due process right he has to know who these witnesses are and what they have said,to respond meaningfully to the accusations or otherwise to ensure that the accusations are accurate.id.at.we found it unnecessary,however,to determine the scope,or even the existence,of this due process right,where we could instead follow the path of least constitutional resistance by construing rule in a manner that avoided any potentially serious due process question.id.at.in particular,we interpreted rule to require,in cases where a to a promise of confidentiality and the nature of the offer the defendant sufficient information to form a meaningful response,that a district court must either obtain permission to disclose the confidential information or refrain from using this information at sentencing.id.at.
from hayes to hamad,then,we have remained unwilling to recognize the broad due process right to full disclosure that stewart urges upon us here.neither have our sister circuits found that the due process clause grants such an entitlement.thus,even if we could look to our own precedents or the decisions of other circuits,as opposed to only supreme court rulings,in determining the clearly established law on this subject,it could not be said that the state court ruling in this case was contrary to or an unreasonable application of any clearly established principle of federal law recognizing a defendant due process right to full disclosure of the information relied upon by a sentencing court.
stewart fares no better in his appeal to the decision in gardner florida,d,as a source of the posited due process right to full disclosure.in that case,a state trial court imposition of a death sentence was based in part upon information in a presentence investigation report that was not disclosed to the defendant or his counsel.the supreme court held that the defendant was denied due process of law when the death sentence was imposed,at least in part,on the basis of information which he had no opportunity to deny or explain.gardner,at.at.similarly,stewart argues in this case that he was sentenced on the basis of information that he had no opportunity to deny or explain.
yet,the decision in gardner is replete with references to the unique demands and requirements of capital sentencing.at the outset of its analysis,for example,the court emphasized that death is a different kind of punishment from any other which may be imposed in the country.at.at.thus,while the court recognized the states interest in providing an assurance of confidentiality to potential sources of information in order to enable investigators to obtain relevant but sensitive disclosures from persons unwilling to comment publicly about a defendant background or character,it nonetheless found that this interest was outweighed in capital cases by the need to ensure the reliability of information that provides the basis for a death sentence.at.at.similarly,in discounting the state argument that trial judges can be trusted to exercise their discretion in a responsible manner,even though they may base their decisions on secret information,the court emphasized the importance of giving counsel an opportunity to comment on facts which may influence the sentencing decision in capital cases.at.at.
accordingly,gardner can not be viewed as the source of a clearly established due process right to full disclosure of sentencing information in a case such as the present one.indeed,the supreme court itself has characterized gardner as holding that t he due process clause does not allow the execution of a person on the basis of information which he had no opportunity to deny or explain.simmons south carolina,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.stewart has not cited,nor has our independent review of the case law revealed,any decision in which gardner was invoked to find a due process violation in a sentencing proceeding.thus,gardner does not set forth the clearly established federal law governing stewart due process claim,nor did the ohio court of appeals act unreasonably in declining to extend the ruling in gardner to reach the sentencing proceeding in this case 
to be sure,there is a certain degree of logic to stewart argument that a true due process protection should focus on the process used at sentencing,as opposed to the more substantive question whether the information relied upon by the sentencing court was materially false or incorrect.as one judge long ago asked upon reviewing the decision in townsend,how can a due process guarantee against a sentence predicated on misinformation be viable,and not rendered meaningless,if the defendant has no way of determining that the sentencing judge was misadvised baker united states,cir winter,concurring.and,as noted,this court has construed.as safeguarding a defendant right to due process by requiring disclosure of most information relied upon at sentencing.hayes,at see also united states prescott,cir to make a defendant due process right meaningful,a sentencing court must assure itself that the information upon which it relies when fixing sentence is reliable and accurate.we recognize,then,that there is much to be said for the rule advocated in stewart brief on appeal namely,that a defendant should be afforded the opportunity to rebut or explain evidence that i s utilized by the sentencing judge to impose sentence.
yet,the brute fact remains that no supreme court,indeed,no federal appellate recognized a clearly established due process right to such an opportunity.it follows that the ohio courts did not act contrary to clearly established federal law,nor did they unreasonably apply this law,in rejecting stewart claim of a due process entitlement to disclosure of the victim impact statements used in his sentencing.
c.a remand is necessary to properly assess stewart claim that he was denied due process through a sentencing determination that rested in part upon materially false information.
while,as explained,no clearly established federal law ensured stewart an opportunity to review,rebut,and explain all of the information relied upon by the state trial court in determining his sentence,this does not conclude our inquiry.rather,we still must determine whether the challenged state court decision comports with the more narrow,and clearly established,due process protection against sentencing determinations that rest in part upon materially false information.see townsend,supra,at.at.although stewart submissions on appeal and in the court below have focused principally upon a posited due process right to full disclosure,he also appears to his counsel confirmed at oral his due process challenge encompasses the more limited principle announced by the supreme court in townsend.in particular,stewart contends that the state trial court sentencing decision was impermissibly influenced by materially false or misleading information contained in the victim impact statements that were withheld from him and his counsel.we agree that the record provides some support for this claim,but find ourselves unable to determine whether such a due process violation occurred here,where the state has not produced the victim impact statements that are essential to meaningful federal court review of this issue.
as discussed earlier,townsend establishes the principle that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment is violated when a defendant is sentenced on the basis of materially false information.townsend,at.at see also tucker,at.at.stewart contends that this principle is applicable here,because the trial judge justified his sentence,at least in part,on the basis of information that i likely was culled from the victim impact statements reviewed by the sentencing court,but yet ii was contradicted by other evidence in the record.for instance,stewart points to the trial court reference at sentencing to four victims,whereas only two victims were mentioned in the bill of information filed by the prosecutor and at the subsequent hearing at which stewart entered his guilty plea.additionally,the trial judge made statements at sentencing indicating that stewart criminal activity spanned perhaps as much as a period,but the bill of information stated only that stewart offenses occurred o n or about.stewart asserts that the sentencing court statements regarding the number of victims and the time span of his criminal activity could only have come from the victim impact statements,and the state has not pointed to any other portion of the record from which this information might have been obtained 
if the victim impact statements were indeed the source of this information,and if this information were deemed materially false,then stewart seemingly could establish a violation of the due process right recognized in townsend.it is clear from the record that the trial judge specifically considered the victim impact statements in sentencing stewart.moreover,false information about additional victims and additional time periods during which stewart engaged in criminal activity certainly would appear to be material,particularly where the trial judge repeatedly referred to this information in determining stewart sentence.as observed in townsend,at.at,w e are not at liberty to assume that items given such emphasis by the sentencing court,did not influence the sentence which the prisoner is now serving.
unfortunately,we are unable to determine under the present record whether the ohio court of appeals acted contrary to or unreasonably applied clearly established federal law by virtue of its failure to overturn a sentence that might have been based in part upon materially false information that stewart had no opportunity to challenge.while stewart posits that the sentencing court determinations regarding the number of victims and the time span of his criminal activity must have been based upon false information contained in the victim impact statements,the only way to test this assertion is to review the victim impact statements themselves.by the same token,we have no way to confirm the state contrary assertion in its appellate brief that all of the facts ultimately relied upon by the trial court in sentencing stewart were otherwise reflected in the psychological evaluations and the psi which the defense had received,where neither the victim impact statements nor the psychological evaluations and psi are part of the record on appeal under these circumstances,we can not say whether the victim impact statements necessarily were the source of any materially false information relied upon by the sentencing court,or whether any such information instead could have been gleaned from sources that stewart and his counsel had an opportunity to review and challenge at sentencing.
to be sure,the ohio court of appeals did do what we,it stated that it had reviewed the victim impact statements,and concluded that while the trial court had considered these materials,the facts ultimately relied upon by the trial court in sentencing stewart were otherwise reflected in the psychological evaluations and the psi.stewart,at.the district court,in turn,cited this state court finding in determining that any due process violation was harmless.not surprisingly,the state points to these determinations by the state appellate court and the district court alike in urging us to affirm the district court denial of stewart due process claim.
yet,while the state court factual findings are cloaked with a presumption of correctness,see e,our deference to the state court on this score does not demand that we its findings without any independent examination of the record.rather,stewart is entitled to habeas relief under the aedpa standards if the state court decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.because the federal court record does not contain any of the pertinent materials reviewed by the ohio court of appeals in making its,the victim impact statements,the psychological evaluations,and the we nor the court below can possibly determine whether the state court findings were unreasonable in light of a missing evidentiary record.instead,we are left with only the parties competing assertions that the trial court sentencing determination was or was not based in part on information that was uniquely culled from the victim impact statements.
although we can not possibly resolve this dispute without access to the complete evidentiary record,it can at least be said that stewart position appears more consistent with the limited record that we have been given.this record,in particular,includes the sentencing court repeated references to the victim impact,more generally,to the harm suffered by the victims,information that likely is traceable to the victim impact well as its express acknowledgment that it had considered these statements in determining stewart sentence.thus,while federal habeas review of a state court factual findings presumably is not triggered by bare speculation that these findings might be open to question in some respect,e providing that the presumption of correctness of a state court factual findings may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence,we are confident that stewart has made a threshold showing of the need for such an inquiry here.it follows that the state must provide the record that is essential for such,the evidence presented in the state court proceeding that formed the basis for the pertinent state court factual findings,see d so that the district court may assess the reasonableness of these findings on remand.see f imposing a duty upon the state to produce the pertinent record where the applicant for habeas relief is unable to do so.
another panel of this court ordered similar relief in collins,supra,a habeas action with facts somewhat analogous to those presented here.the defendant in that case had been convicted of rape,and the trial judge relied at sentencing upon information that the defendant had raped another victim.collins,at.the defendant was not accorded an opportunity at sentencing to rebut this information,but asserted in support of his habeas petition that the information was false.id.upon noting the absence of any finding of fact regarding the truth or falsity of the derogatory matter relied upon,this court found itself unable to say whether the
