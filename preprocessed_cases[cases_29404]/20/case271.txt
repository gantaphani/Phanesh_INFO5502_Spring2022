this case requires us to determine whether an application for state relief was pending for purposes of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.under aedpa,state prisoners seeking federal habeas corpus review generally must file a petition under within one year of the date on which their state convictions became final.see d.before pursuing relief in the federal courts,however,state prisoners first must exhaust all available state remedies.see b.recognizing the potential conflict between aedpa exhaustion requirement and its statute of limitations,congress provided that t he time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral relief with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward the limitations period.d.
appellant john currie seeks federal habeas review of his state conviction on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel.the timeliness of his petition depends on whether his earlier application for state review was pending during the gap between disposition in the trial court and currie motion for leave to appeal.the district court concluded that it was not,and dismissed currie petition as barred by aedpa statute of limitations.we review the district court interpretation of the statute de novo.united states michaud,cir.we now join our sister circuits in holding that an application for relief is pending from the time it is first filed until finally disposed of and further appellate review is unavailable under the particular state procedures.bennett artuz,cir,aff on other grounds,d.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court.
in,a massachusetts jury convicted currie of first degree murder,based on his role in an attempted robbery that ended in the death of a state police officer.massachusetts law provides for direct and extremely broad plenary review by the supreme judicial court sjc in such cases,trigones attorney general,which are classified as capital.see.laws ch.on direct appeal,the sjc is authorized to order a new trial or enter other appropriate relief if it concludes that the verdict was against the law or the weight of the evidence,or because of newly discovered evidence,or for any other reason that justice may require.id.
if the sjc affirms a capital conviction on direct it did in currie review is circumscribed.in particular,strictly limits appellate review of any motion for a new trial filed after the sjc decision on direct appeal in a capital case.if such a motion is denied by the trial court,the petitioner must apply to a single gatekeeper justice of the sjc for leave to appeal to that court,and no appeal shall lie unless the appeal is allowed by a single justice on the ground that it presents a new and substantial question which ought to be determined by the full court.id.section does not specify a time limit for filing a petition for leave to appeal,and during the relevant time period the prevailing rule was that capital prisoners could apply to the gatekeeper justice at any time.see mains commonwealth.the sjc since has held that such prisoners must seek leave to appeal within days of the trial court judgment.however,it made clear that its new rule applied only prospectively.mains,at hereinafter,in the interests of consistency and finality,we shall require that a gatekeeper petition pursuant to,be filed within thirty days of the denial of a motion for a new trial.
currie filed his first motion for a new trial in,some five years after the sjc affirmed his conviction on direct appeal.proceeding pro se,he argued that the trial court impermissibly restricted the jury consideration of evidence that currie was intoxicated at the time of the robbery.the superior court denied the motion on the ground that currie claims were available at trial and on direct appeal,and so were deemed waived.see commonwealth festa,explaining that issues not raised at trial or on direct appeal are waived for purposes of review.
currie applied to a single justice of the sjc for leave to appeal the trial court ruling.he also requested that counsel be appointed to assist him on appeal,and the court granted that request.rather than pursue currie application for leave to appeal,however,his new counsel filed an amended motion for a new trial in the superior court.the amended motion asserted three new grounds for relief,all of which alleged violations of currie right to effective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.the superior court rejected the motion on its merits,and again currie sought leave to appeal from the gatekeeper justice.following briefing and argument,the application was denied in may of.
congress enacted aedpa in,amending the procedures governing federal habeas corpus review.under aedpa,petitions for federal review of state convictions allegedly imposed in violation of the constitution or federal law are subject to a statute of limitations that typically runs from the date the petitioner conviction became final.d for prisoners like currie,whose state convictions became final before aedpa was passed,the limitations period commenced on aedpa effective date,april.gaskins duval,cir.thus,absent tolling,currie had until april,to file a petition under.id.
in the wake of aedpa,currie set about preparing a petition for federal review,focusing on the three allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel raised in his first amended new trial motion.in the course of his research,however,currie discovered a new claim that he had not previously presented to the state courts that his jailhouse confession was obtained by coercion,in violation of the fifth amendment.under aedpa,currie could not seek federal relief on the basis of that claim unless he first exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state.b a 
accordingly,on april,currie again proceeding pro se filed a second motion for a new trial,arguing that both trial and appellate counsel erred in not adequately challenging the trial judge admission of the confession.then,on april,he filed a petition,raising the issues of ineffective assistance of counsel set out in his first amended new trial motion,as well as the new issue raised in the second new trial motion.currie acknowledged that his second new trial motion was still pending in the massachusetts superior court,and requested that the federal district court stay his petition until the superior court acted on the motion.the district court refused,citing the absence of any provision in the statutes or caselaw for the stay of an unexhausted petition pending exhaustion.currie matesanz.july.on july,the district court dismissed currie petition without prejudice.id.
the superior court denied currie second new trial motion on october,on the ground that currie could have raised the issues in his earlier motion.after some procedural missteps currie wrote to the clerk of the sjc seeking advice on how and when to appeal the trial court judgment.the clerk informed him that he could apply to a single justice of the sjc for leave to appeal,and that there was no time limit for such an application.
on july,nine months after the superior court denial of his second new trial filed an application with a single justice of the sjc,seeking leave to appeal the superior court ruling the application was denied on march.five days later,on march,currie filed the instant petition under,raising essentially the same claims as were set out in the earlier petition that was dismissed without prejudice.
the commonwealth moved to dismiss the petition as untimely the magistrate judge agreed,and issued a report and recommendation concluding that currie petition was barred by aedpa statute of limitations.the magistrate judge treated currie july,application for leave to appeal to the sjc as a separate application for review rather than as a continuation of the earlier proceedings on his second new trial motion.since that application was not filed,properly or otherwise,until july,the magistrate judge reasoned,it could not possibly have been pending before that date.thus,the statute of limitations was tolled while currie new trial motion was pending before the superior april,to october,again while the application for leave to appeal was pending before the july,to march.nothing was pending,however,in the gap between those two proceedings.therefore,currie petition was filed almost ten months late 
the district court accepted the magistrate judge recommendations,and dismissed currie petition as.the court issued a certificate of appealability,as required by c.this appeal followed.
currie petition was filed on march,almost three years after aedpa effective date.however,aedpa provides that the limitations period is tolled while a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.d.the commonwealth concedes that currie second new trial motion was properly filed in the massachusetts superior court on april.the operative question,therefore,is how long that motion was pending.currie contends that it was pending until the gatekeeper justice denied his application for leave to appeal on march,thus extinguishing the possibility of appellate review under the governing state procedures.we agree.
every circuit to address the question has held that a properly filed application for state review is pending from initial filing in the trial court until final disposition on appeal.see melancon kaylo,cir fernandez sternes,cir swartz meyers,cir bennett artuz,cir,aff on other grounds,d mills norris,cir taylor lee,cir nino galaza,cir barnett lemaster,cir.thus,the application is pending,not only when it actually is being considered by the trial or appellate court,but also during the gap between the trial court initial disposition and the petitioner timely filing of a petition for review at the next level.melancon,at 
we agree that i t is sensible to say that a petition continues to be pending during the period between one court decision and a timely request for further review by a higher court.fernandez,at.the common understanding is that an action or suit is pending from its inception until the rendition of final judgment.black law dictionary ed.a judgment usually does not become final until the completion of appellate review or the expiration of time for seeking such review.see d stating that aedpa statute of limitations begins to run when the challenged state judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.it follows that an action remains pending through the appeals process.see swartz,at tolling the period of limitation between the time a state court denies relief and the timely appeal or request for allowance of appeal is consistent with the plain meaning of the statutory language.
that view is consistent with the exhaustion requirement of c.the purpose of state remedy exhaustion is to afford the state courts,which have an equal responsibility with the federal courts to vindicate federal constitutional rights,the first opportunity to remedy a constitutional violation.dickerson walsh,cir citing fay noia,d.the supreme court has held that state courts also must have a full opportunity to address constitutional claims.boerckel,d.thus,state prisoners can not simply present their claims to the state trial court they must invoke one complete round of the state established appellate review process.id.
aedpa tolling provision complements the exhaustion requirement by protecting a state prisoner ability later to apply for federal habeas relief while state remedies are being pursued.duncan walker,d gaskins,at applying the tolling provision during the grace period for prisoners whose convictions became final before aedpa effective date encourages respect for the principle of comity and compliance with the requirement that,ordinarily,a state prisoner must first exhaust his state court remedies before seeking federal habeas relief.by interpreting the term pending in d to include the time before a appeal,we enable state prisoners to give the state courts a full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues,at,without fear of thereby sacrificing the opportunity for federal review.a more restrictive reading,by contrast,would inevitably lead to the filing of protective federal petitions.nino,at accord melancon,at if the time between a disposition but before a timely filed appeal is not tolled,a habeas petitioner is likely to file a protective federal petition before he has fully exercised all state appeals if there is a possibility that the right to federal habeas might be extinguished.bennett,at observing that contrary rule would force appellants into federal court prematurely.in short,tolling the statute of limitations during the gap between initial disposition and appeal not only furthers principles of comity by giving state appellate courts full opportunity to review state prisoners federal constitutional claims,but also lightens the dockets of federal courts by avoiding the need for state prisoners to file protective federal petitions before uncertain state appellate procedures have been exhausted.mills,at.
here,currie followed the procedures set forth in.laws ch,for capital prisoners seeking to appeal a denial of review.this case,therefore,falls within the rule that an application for relief is pending from the time it first is filed with the state trial court,until the final disposition of a timely appeal or request for allowance of appeal accordingly,currie second new trial motion was pending throughout the gap between the superior court judgment and the single justice decision to deny his application for leave to appeal.
the commonwealth does not dispute the general rule we now adopt.instead,it offers two reasons why we should find that rule inapplicable here.first,the commonwealth insists that a application for leave to appeal and,presumably,any actual appeal to the sjc authorized by the gatekeeper justice is not an appeal at all,but instead is akin to a new collateral proceeding.that argument borders on the frivolous,given that states that no appeal shall lie from the decision of the superior court denying a motion for a new trial unless the appeal is allowed by a single justice of the sjc.laws ch,emphasis added.undaunted by the statutory language,the commonwealth maintains that review is not in the nature of an appeal because capital prisoners have no absolute right to appeal,but may do so only if the gatekeeper justice determines that the issue presented in the motion for a new trial is new and substantial.id.true enough,but the fact that an appeal is discretionary does not make it something other than an appeal.in order to obtain certiorari review in the united states supreme court,for example,a petitioner must convince four justices that the case involves,at a minimum,an important federal question.similarly,in order to obtain appellate review of a district court denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus,the petitioner must convince either the district court or the court of appeals that he or she has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c.in either case,the appeal must be authorized under a certain standard before it can proceed,but no one seriously would suggest that it thereby is converted into a new proceeding rather than an appeal from the judgment below.
relatedly,the commonwealth argues that review is not an appeal because an application for leave to appeal is filed as an original proceeding with the single justice session of the sjc and a ny records below that a party wishes to be considered are filed by that party rather than transmitted by the trial court.those factors suggest,at most,that the gatekeeper proceeding before the single justice is not itself an appeal.that is beside the point.in capital cases,an application for leave to appeal is a necessary step toward perfecting a appeal to the sjc.it is,therefore,part of the appeal process in precisely the same way that a petition for certiorari is part of the process of any appeal to the supreme court,or an application for a certificate of appealability was part of the process in this appeal 
the commonwealth second argument has more force.it suggests that the cases discussed hold that an application for state
