background 
factual background 
in may of,benitez pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute more than grams of marijuana,in violation of,a and b b vii,and one count of conspiracy to launder money,in violation of a a i and h.benitez sentencing hearing took place in august of.although there was no interpreter present at benitez plea hearing,an interpreter was on hand at his sentencing hearing in case benitez did not understand something that was said.
at the sentencing hearing,the district court considered the government motion for a downward departure based on benitez cooperation in the investigation of the drug conspiracy in which he participated.the government outlined the testimony that benitez had given at the trial of two coconspirators.benitez attorney,john beason,was then asked if he wished to be heard.beason replied your honor,before would inform the court that i was told last night that i was fired from this case and he wished me not to represent him any longer.so am i to still speak on his behalf if the court knows that fact the court responded by asking benitez how he wished to proceed.after benitez conferred with the interpreter,the interpreter said that benitez did not want beason to represent him.benitez also declined to speak for himself,indicating through the interpreter that he felt very upset,very nervous.
the district court then asked whether benitez wanted beason to speak on his behalf at this time.benitez replied no,and his interpreter followed up by stating well,he can speak,but i do want him to represent me any longer.the court explained that by speaking,he would be representing you and telling what good about you and your position here.benitez responded through the interpreter,saying no,i do not want him to represent me.
the court then asked beason to remain where he was,and addressed beason directly i want you here for just a little while longer.i want the record to reflect that you were on your feet and you were prepared to make comments,i presume that they were in support of the government motion for a downward departure for your client beason replied very much so,your honor.
the district court proceeded by granting the government motion.it then asked benitez if he wanted to say anything on his own behalf before the court imposed the actual sentence.benitez said i do feel good.i ca speak.at this point,the following colloquy between the court and benitez took place 
the court you do not wish beason to speak on your behalf is that right 
defendant benitez am i going to get sentenced still even though he wo represent me 
the court right,right.
defendant benitez might as well just have him speak for me,then.
the court you might me 
the interpreter go ahead and have him speak for me.go ahead and have him speak for me.
the district court concluded the hearing by sentencing benitez to two terms of imprisonment,to be served concurrently,in addition to four years of supervised release,a fine,and a special assessment.beason then requested that he be relieved from representing benitez on appeal,reasoning that if he should choose to appeal i know he going to allege ineffective assistance of counsel.the court granted the request,but also stated i want the record to reflect that you have,with benitez permission,spoken on his behalf,accepted the papers,and turned those papers over to him and executed your responsibilities as benitez permitted you in this proceeding this morning.at this point,the following exchange occurred 
the court is that correct,benitez 
beason you have to answer yes.
defendant benitez yes.
procedural background 
benitez did not pursue a direct appeal.but on september,acting through counsel,he filed a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to.benitez argued that he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to counsel during the sentencing hearing,he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the phase of the sentencing hearing for which he had counsel,he was deprived of his fifth amendment right to due process of law when the district court imposed a sentence while operating under a misapprehension of law,his sentence was calculated in violation of blakely washington,d,and he received ineffective assistance of counsel because beason failed to file a timely notice of appeal.
the district court denied benitez motion on the basis that the same was barred by the statute of limitations contained in.it also noted that even if it were to consider the merits of benitez claims for relief,the motion would be denied.with respect to benitez claim that he was denied the right to counsel during his sentencing hearing,the district court concluded that although the record evidences some confusion on benitez part as to his counsel role at sentencing,there is no evidence that he was without counsel during the proceeding.the court further determined that all of benitez other claims for relief were completely without merit.
benitez subsequently filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure,contending,among other things,that he was entitled to equitable tolling based on the failure of his counsel to timely file his motion.the district court denied the motion,concluding that even assuming equitable tolling applies,the outcome of the case does not change because benitez claims lacked merit.nevertheless,the court issued a coa on benitez claim.this court subsequently declined to expand the coa as to benitez claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when beason failed to file a notice of appeal after benitez was sentenced.benitez claim regarding his right to counsel during his sentencing hearing is thus the sole issue presently before us.
ii.analysis 
statute of limitations 
a motion filed pursuant to is subject to a statute of limitations,with the limitations period beginning to run from the latest of four possible dates.the only two that are potentially relevant in the present case are 
the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final or the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court,if that right has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review 
although benitez claim based on blakely washington,d,is not before us,we note that any sentencing claim would now be governed by united states booker,d.moreover,booker has not been made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.humphress united states,cir.
benitez judgment became final on september,the date that marked the expiration of the time period plus intervening weekends and a federal holiday when he could have filed a timely appeal of his august,judgment and commitment order.see fed.b united states,cir concluding that,as a general matter,the time limitation for appealing a criminal judgment contained in rule b of the federal rules of appellate procedure governs when a judgment of conviction becomes final for the purposes of f.benitez filed his motion on september,two days after the limitations period lapsed.the district court therefore determined that benitez motion was untimely.
as the government points out,the district court primary ruling of time barred has never been found to be in error.neither the parties nor the district court,however,addressed the merits of whether benitez is entitled to equitable tolling,despite its availability where a motion to vacate is filed after the limitations period contained in.see dunlap united states,cir holding that f is not jurisdictional in nature and that equitable tolling is therefore available.the district court instead concluded that benitez would not be entitled to relief even if it assumed that equitable tolling applied.nevertheless,it issued a coa on the issue of whether benitez was denied the right to counsel at his sentencing hearing.
if benitez claim were clearly without merit,we could ignore the fact that his motion was untimely filed.see pough united states,cir concluding that the analysis can be bypassed where the merits of a case can be resolved in a straightforward manner and will also result in the denial of the motion.but as discussed below,we do not believe that benitez claim can be so easily disposed of on the merits.
right to counsel 
standard of review 
a prisoner in custody under sentence of a federal court claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate,set aside,or correct the sentence.a.we review a district court denial of a motion de novo,but examine its findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard of review.mallett united states,cir.
a defendant facing the possibility of incarceration has a sixth amendment right to counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process,and a sentencing hearing is one type of critical stage at which the right to counsel attaches.king bobby,cir quoting united states wade,d.the right to counsel can be waived,but only where such waiver is knowing,voluntary,and intelligent.id.citing johnson zerbst.a violation of a defendant right to counsel at a critical stage is a structural error,and is therefore not subject to an analysis of whether the error was harmless or prejudicial.united states,d concluding that a sixth amendment violation of the right to counsel of choice is not subject to analysis united states barnett,cir noting that a defendant is not required to demonstrate prejudice when there is a structural error,such as a violation of the right to counsel.
benitez argues that he was denied the right to counsel because,despite having expressed dissatisfaction with beason and informing the district court that he did not want beason to represent him,the district court failed to ascertain the basis for benitez dissatisfaction.he also claims that beason abdicated his responsibility to comment on the government downward departure motion,and that the district court erred by failing to take steps to ensure that benitez was assisted by counsel in making an argument for a more extensive downward departure.
in response,the government contends that benitez had counsel with him during the entire sentencing proceeding,and that beason was fully prepared to address each of the items relative to sentencing,including the government motion.the government thus contends that benitez right to counsel is not even at issue in the present case.it instead frames the real issue as whether benitez has a right to make his own decisions and to determine when his counsel will or will not speak on his behalf.in reviewing benitez motion,the district court took a similar view 
it is beyond question that benitez had counsel during the sentencing phase of his proceeding.benitez counsel was prepared and willing to speak on benitez behalf regarding the downward departure motion,however,when called upon to do so,benitez prevented his counsel from speaking and asked that his counsel be discharged.benitez did not indicate that he wanted new counsel,never asked the court to appoint another attorney,never asked to represent himself,and did not ask for an adjournment to find another counsel while the record evidences some confusion on benitez part as to his counsel role at sentencing,there is no evidence that he was without counsel during the proceeding.
contrary to the district court analysis,we do not believe that the fact that beason was present at the sentencing hearing and prepared and willing to speak on benitez behalf is dispositive of benitez claim.we note,moreover,that the facts of this case do not fit comfortably within the various strands of existing sixth amendment jurisprudence.in particular,what makes this case therefore hard to that benitez was represented by privately retained as opposed to counsel although some evidence in the record suggests that he may have actually been eligible for a attorney,did not affirmatively request new counsel or to represent himself,but did clearly state at the beginning of the hearing that he did not want beason to represent him,and at a later point in the hearing authorized beason to speak on his behalf.these facts,when taken together,led both the government and the district court to conclude that benitez right to counsel was not implicated.
the district court,however,failed to recognize that the sixth amendment is implicated where a criminal defendant seeks to change the status of his representation.this kind of change of status usually arises in one of two ways a defendant seeks to invoke his right to,see,united states mcbride,cir concluding that the defendant had successfully invoked the right to where he knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel,or a defendant seeks to substitute his counsel,see,united states green,cir holding that a defendant persistent,unreasonable demand for dismissal of counsel and appointment of new counsel functioned as a valid waiver of the right to counsel.
self representation 
a defendant seeking to assert his right to must take affirmative steps to apprise the court of his desire to proceed in this manner.united states cromer,cir holding that the district court was not required to warn the defendant about the consequences of waiving the right to counsel where the defendant personally participated in the of a witness but continued to receive substantial assistance of counsel,concluding that a defendant must clearly and unequivocally assert his right to proceed pro se.when a defendant does so,the court is then required to determine whether the attempted waiver of the right to counsel is knowing and intelligent.mcbride,at reiterating the principle that where a district court is faced with an accused who wishes to represent himself,the court must ask the defendant a series of questions and should make an express finding on the record that the accused has knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel.
the record in the present case clearly demonstrates that benitez did not attempt to waive his right to counsel by requesting.to the contrary,benitez repeatedly declined to address the court on his own behalf,stating that he did not feel well or that he was too nervous.brewer williams,d noting that courts must indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver of the right to counsel.this court cases addressing the right to are therefore inapplicable in the present case.
substitution of counsel 
as with an assertion of the right to,a defendant wishing to substitute counsel must bring any serious dissatisfaction with counsel to the attention of the district court.united states iles,cir requiring the defendant to show his hand by alerting the district court of his desire to substitute counsel.once a defendant does so,the district court is obligated to inquire into the defendant complaint and determine whether there is good cause for the substitution.id.at it is hornbook law that when an indigent defendant makes a timely and good faith motion requesting that appointed counsel be discharged and new counsel appointed,the trial court clearly has a responsibility to determine the reasons for defendant dissatisfaction with his current co
