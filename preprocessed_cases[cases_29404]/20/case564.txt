petitioner tony clanton,convicted of hobbs act and federal firearm offenses,appeals from orders of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,edward korman,judge,denying his petition pursuant to to vacate his conviction on the ground of,inter alia,ineffective assistance of counsel,and denying his motion for reconsideration of that denial.the district court denied the petition in a order citing the reasons stated in the government brief it denied the motion for reconsideration for reasons endorsed on a letter submitted by the government in response to the reconsideration motion.on appeal,clanton contends principally a that the district court initial order simply adopting the government arguments did not comply with the requirement of that the court state its findings of fact and conclusions of law,and b that the form of the denial of reconsideration violated the precedents of this court stating that it is inappropriate to decide a motion by endorsement on a party briefs or other supporting or opposing papers.although we find the district court initial order troublesome,we conclude that any defect in the form or content of that initial decision was cured by the order resolving the motion for reconsideration.and because the placement of the latter order on papers submitted by the government caused clanton no prejudice,we affirm.
background 
clanton was arrested in after negotiating with an undercover police officer uc for the sale of guns and,instead of selling guns,robbing the uc at gunpoint of the buy money and jewelry.when other officers approached,clanton also attempted to shoot the uc.he was indicted on four counts,including two counts relating to his assault on the uc,one count of obstructing interstate commerce by robbery of the uc,in violation of the hobbs act,and one count of using a gun during and in relation to a crime of violence,to wit,the hobbs act offense,in violation of c.pursuant to a plea agreement with the government,clanton pleaded guilty to the latter two counts,and the remaining counts were dismissed.
the presentence report psr prepared on clanton calculated that,under the sentencing guidelines guidelines,his criminal history category was iii,taking into account,inter alia,the fact that at the time of his federal offenses he was on probation following his conviction of state crimes.clanton was sentenced principally to months imprisonment.
in his plea agreement,clanton had agreed not to appeal his sentence if the prison term imposed was in the range of months.following imposition of the month sentence,he attempted to appeal.before he filed a brief,however,the government moved for summary affirmance,which was granted.
clanton attempts to vacate his conviction pursuant to 
in may,clanton petitioned under for an order vacating his convictions.his principal contentions were a that the inclusion in his criminal history category of a point for violation of his state probation was erroneous because when he was sentenced for the present offenses,the state authorities had not commenced probation violation proceedings against him b that the indictment was vindictive because,after he failed to cooperate with the prosecutors,the government augmented the charges that had been asserted in the criminal complaint and c that his attorney rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance because he failed to make plausible pretrial motions and instead recommended a plea of guilty.the district court ordered the government to show cause within days why clanton motion should not be granted it granted clanton days from receipt of the government response in which to file a reply.
by letter dated july,the government argued that clanton claims were meritless.letter from assistant united states attorney ausa christopher gunther to judge edward korman dated july,july letter.after describing the charges against clanton,the investigation and events that led to those charges,and the calculation of his guidelines criminal history category see july letter at,the government argued that clanton attacks on the indictment and on his sentence were procedurally barred see id.at,and that,in any event,his arguments were meritless see id.at.
as to both the challenge and the charge of a vindictive indictment,the government stated,first,that clanton can not raise these claims for the first time in his petition because they should have been raised on direct appeal july letter at,and that they were procedurally barred due to his failure to raise them on his direct appeal id.the government argued also that clanton challenge lacked merit because n othing in the sentencing guidelines suggests that state authorities must actually commence violation proceedings before a defendant is subject to the point enhancement for committing a crime while on release on probation.id.at.the government argued that clanton challenge to the indictment was frivolous because it is common practice for the government to seek additional charges when a case is presented to the grand jury.see id.
finally,the government argued that clanton claim was based on an entirely conclusory allegation 
clanton lone complaint with his attorney performance is that the attorney did not file any motions on his behalf.but clanton can not identify any motion or application that would have been raised by a responsible attorney,much less a motion that would probably have changed the outcome of the prosecution.in effect,clanton merely complains that defense counsel did not raise the same frivolous arguments set forth in clanton petition.because no competent attorney would raise such arguments and because these arguments could not have affected the outcome of clanton case,the ineffective assistance claim must fail.
id.at.clanton filed a reply to the july letter on august.as to the government argument that his claim was conclusory and that he had failed to identify any colorable motion that could have been raised by a responsible attorney,clanton contended that his attorney should have made a jurisdictional challenge on the ground that there was an insufficient nexus between the robbery and interstate commerce.
in an order dated august,filed on august,august order,the district court denied clanton petition,stating only as follows the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is denied for the reasons stated in the of the attorney.august order.
clanton promptly moved for reconsideration.elaborating on his contention that his attorney should have made a motion challenging federal jurisdiction,he argued that he had neither sold nor intended to sell any guns,and that the undercover officer,with whom he had entered into the sham negotiations,had merely pretended to be a gun buyer.he argued that his offenses thus had no connection with interstate commerce,and that he therefore a could not be guilty of a hobbs act violation,and b could not be guilty of the alleged offense of using a firearm during and in relation to a hobbs act violation 
in this case,the individual who came to buy guns from the petitioner was not a registered gun dealer by profession.nor was petitioner actually intending on selling any guns to him.the individual was pretending sic to be a gun buyer,and therefore his actions can not affect interstate commerce one way of sic another w hen a government agent engages in a conspiratoral sic activity,such activity can not be considered a consummated criminal act because the agent was only pretending to be doing a business.so,too,here,since the purported gun buyer was not actually serious about commerce,any delay or interruption of the purported transaction can not effect sic interstate commerce,neither directly,nor indirectly.the supreme court has held that the legitimate law enforcement function of crime prevention does not include the manufacturing of crime.see sherman united states,d.
clanton motion for reconsideration dated august,at emphasis in original.clanton contended that his attorney should have moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that clanton conduct was solely a local matter and that there was no federal jurisdiction.
the government responded to these arguments by stating,in pertinent part,as follows 
clanton argues that the uc status as an undercover purchaser of handguns is insufficient to meet the jurisdictional requirements of the hobbs act.this contention is frivolous.first,trafficking in handguns in new york state necessarily has an effect on interstate commerce because no handguns are manufactured in new york state.second,the uc was demonstrably in the business of purchasing handguns,albeit in an undercover capacity.the uc was assigned to a bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms task force for the specific purpose of making undercover gun buys.indeed,clanton sold the uc a handgun just a few days before the robbery.third,the that the uc brought to the site of the robbery was specifically earmarked for the intended purchase of three additional handguns from clanton,as the uc would have testified and as taped conversations between the uc and clanton confirm.in sum,clanton depleted the uc funds intended for the purchase of handguns that traveled in interstate commerce the hobbs act requires nothing more.
clanton also argues that the uc status as a government agent somehow alters the commerce analysis.the second circuit rejected this very argument in united states jones,cir,which upheld hobbs act jurisdiction over the defendant armed robbery of buy money from an undercover narcotics detective 
accordingly,clanton counsel did not perform ineffectively by declining to pursue an attack on the indictment that was foreclosed by the settled law of this circuit.to the contrary,in the face of the overwhelming case against clanton,which featured the audiotaped armed robbery of an undercover officer,clanton attorney quite properly focused on negotiating a disposition of the case that spared clanton a plea to the most serious attempted murder charges against him.in short,clanton counsel performed effectively.
letter from ausa gunther to judge korman dated september,september letter,at.
in an order dated november,endorsed on the last page of the government september letter endorsed november order,the district court denied clanton motion for reconsideration,stating as follows 
the motion for reconsideration is denied for the reasons stated on page s of this letter,and for the additional reason that the petitioner was guilty of the included offense of attempting to affect commerce.see united states jannotti,cir,d.
endorsed november order.
b.this court issuance of a certificate of appealability 
clanton moved in this court for a certificate of appealability to permit him to appeal the decisions of the district court.such a certificate is required by c,as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.we granted the certificate,outlining the following issues 
whether the district court one sentence dismissal of clanton motion for the reasons stated in the of the attorney complied with the requirements of,see t he court shall determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto and whether the district court memo endorsed denial of clanton motion for reconsideration complied with the requirements articulated by this court in barrett united states,cir per curiam although handwritten endorsement orders may be an expeditious method of disposing of a variety of motions,care must be taken,especially where a party is proceeding pro se,to ensure that the order and its consequences are communicated clearly.
clanton united states,cir.our certificate also noted that we had granted a certificate of appealability in another case on the related issue of whether a district court may dismiss a petition without providing an order which indicates that the court conducted a thorough review and independent analysis of the petition.see rudenko costello,cir.we appointed counsel to represent clanton on this appeal.
chief judge korman objection to the certificate of appealability 
in april,chief judge korman filed a memorandum opposing this court issuance of a certificate of appealability.he stated 
i t is my view that there is no basis for concluding that the summary denial of the petition means that the judge failed to conduct a reasoned method of inquiry into relevant questions of fact and law,capellan riley,cir internal quotations and citation omitted 
chief judge korman memorandum dated april,at.he also argued that the present certificate of appealability was erroneously granted in light of the supreme court decision in slack mcdaniel,d 
i call attention to a recent supreme court holding that suggests that the court of appeals erroneously granted the certificate of appealability in this case because it failed to find as a threshold matter that the underlying petition made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right as required by c.slack mcdaniel,d.
chief judge korman memorandum dated april,at emphasis in original.
chief judge korman memorandum was sent to this court by district judge david trager in connection with our consideration of the appeals consolidated sub nom.rudenko costello,and referred to in the certificate of appealability that was granted in the present case.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,clanton,limiting his substantive discussion to the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to file requested motions during the criminal prosecution,argues that the district court denial of his petition for the reasons stated in the government did not comport with either the requirements of that section or the precedents of this court,and that the court endorsed denial of reconsideration violated the principle enunciated by this court in barrett united states,cir per curiam,which criticized the rendering of a decision by means of an endorsement on a party brief or other supporting or opposing papers.clanton asks that we reverse the district court denial of his motion and remand the matter for a hearing on the petition,determination of the issues,and findings of fact and conclusions of law.clanton brief on appeal at.the government,in opposition,asks that we affirm the denial of the motion.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that although the district court initial denial of the petition was uninformative,the statements in the court denial of the motion for reconsideration were sufficient to cure that deficiency.we also conclude that,as the court endorsement of its denial of reconsideration on the government letter did not cause clanton any prejudice,the location of that endorsement does not provide a basis for appeal.
preliminarily,however,we note our rejection of chief judge korman view that the certificate of appealability in this case was improvidently issued.in rudenko costello,cir rudenko,decided today with regard to denials of petitions filed by state prisoners for habeas corpus under,we discussed at some length the requirement that the district court,in deciding a case,provide an explanatory statement that is sufficient to reveal the rationale for its decision.that requirement is based on a number of institutional concerns,including the need of the court of appeals for sufficient information to conduct a meaningful appellate review of the district court decision,and the need for sufficient information to apply the aedpa standard for determining whether or not a disappointed habeas petitioner will even be granted a certificate of appealability allowing him to obtain appellate review.those concerns were pertinent to the present case,and for the reasons stated in parts,and of rudenko,we conclude that the granting of the present certificate of appealability to clanton was proper.
a.the district court adoption of the state position 
a federal prisoner motion to vacate his conviction is governed by,which provides in part as follows 
unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief,the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the united states attorney,grant a prompt hearing thereon,determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto.
we have interpreted the requirement that the court make findings of fact and conclusio
