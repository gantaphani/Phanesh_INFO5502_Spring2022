richard cagle,a north carolina prisoner convicted of murder and sentenced to death,appeals the district court dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.he claims that the absence of a key witness,ineffective assistance of counsel as to a motion to sever,ineffective assistance of counsel as to mitigation,and the lack of a jury instruction as to voluntary intoxication deprived him of a fair trial and sentence.having reviewed his claims with care,we find them to be without merit and affirm the district court.
richard cagle was a drifter who went from town to town under various names and with various women,dancing in bars and trying to stay a step ahead of the law enforcement agencies looking for him.on the evening of november,he was living with his girlfriend,jamie kass,at a motel in fayetteville,north carolina when he decided to visit a gay nightclub across the street.he there encountered the victim,a man named dennis house.cagle and house were playing pool when kass joined them later in the evening,bringing with her two magazine salesmen she had befriended,michael scott and ryan jones,who worked together and were also staying at the motel.
the group eventually returned to the motel.house drove.the other four walked,and on the way,cagle told them that house had about and a pound of marijuana in his home,and that they should rob the four of them termed rolling a fag.back at the motel,the group drank and smoked marijuana.whenever house left the room,the conversation about rolling a fag picked up again.eventually,the four men climbed into house truck to continue the party at his home,a trailer some distance away,while kass stayed behind.house and cagle got in the truck first.scott and jones lingered to get a knife from kass.
the drinking,marijuana smoking,and plotting continued in house trailer.at some point when house was in another room,scott pulled jones aside to tell him the plan that cagle would seduce house into giving him oral sex,and that jones would stab house in the back while he was distracted.cagle then picked up house cat and slammed its head against the wall and against a fish tank,splitting open its skull and tossing its body behind the couch.jones hid in the bathroom.when house started performing oral sex on cagle,jones emerged and stabbed house in the back.
thus far,there is rough agreement on the facts between the parties.but here the account splits,and we proceed with the facts as accepted by the jury and affirmed by the supreme court of north carolina,based substantially on the testimony of ryan christopher jones.state cagle.
after stabbing house that first time,jones dropped the knife,and cagle picked it up.house said,why are you guys doing this i give you anything.cagle then stabbed him in the chest three or four times.scott started punching him in the head and tried to hit him with a bowling ball.cagle dropped the knife and hit him with something that looked like a fireplace poker or pool cue.the three men then ran to the back room,where cagle said,go finish him,go kill him.but instead,they left through the front door,with jones grabbing the knife on the way out and cagle taking a camera.
house ran to his neighbor roger house,where he said roger,they are trying to kill me and died,the fatal wound coming from a stab in the chest.cagle,scott,and jones planned an alibi and,reaching a house down the street,tried to get the woman there to let them in to call a cab.she refused and called the police.a sheriff came and,seeing the blood on cagle pants,arrested the three.
during the police interviews that followed,jones stated from the first that he had stabbed house in the back once,but that cagle had struck the fatal blows to house chest.cagle denied ever picking up the knife and claimed jones was the killer.and scott story shifted.at first,he told the officers that cagle alone had used the knife.when one of the officers pointed out the inconsistency between his account and jones,scott amended his story,stating that jones had struck the first blow with the knife and cagle the rest.
ultimately,jones accepted a plea agreement in return for his testimony against scott and cagle,who were tried jointly for murder,robbery,and conspiracy at the cumberland county superior court in may and june.in defense,they tried to show that it was jones,not them,who had inflicted the fatal wounds.neither testified,but they called a number of witnesses to testify to jones dishonesty,and one,a cellmate of jones,who testified that jones had bragged about killing house by stabbing him repeatedly.nonetheless,the jury convicted cagle of murder on the basis of premeditation and deliberation,and cagle and scott both of felony murder,robbery with a dangerous weapon,and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon.
a capital sentencing proceeding followed in june,see,with the same jury and judge,and the two defendants again tried together.neither testified.cagle attorneys presented mitigation evidence showing that cagle had been physically and sexually abused by his mother male friends as a child that he came from a family with a history of alcohol abuse and violence that he committed the crime under the influence of a mental or emotional disturbance and that he was in the borderline range of mental retardation.the jury accepted all of these mitigating factors and made findings accordingly.but it nonetheless recommended,and the judge imposed,a sentence of life imprisonment for scott,and death for cagle.
on direct appeal,the north carolina supreme court affirmed the convictions and sentences,state cagle,and the united states supreme court denied certiorari,cagle north carolina,d.seeking state relief,cagle filed a motion for appropriate relief mar in cumberland county superior court.after holding an evidentiary hearing,the court denied all of cagle claims,and the north carolina supreme court affirmed.state cagle.turning to federal relief,cagle filed a habeas petition under in the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina,which the district court dismissed.cagle appealed.
four issues remain in contention in this case.first,cagle claims that newly available change of heart and change of story from his,michael the jury capital sentence and entitles him to a new sentencing proceeding.second,cagle claims he received ineffective assistance of counsel during both the guilt and penalty phases of trial because his attorneys failed to sever his case from scott,thus discouraging scott from testifying in cagle favor.third,cagle again claims ineffective assistance,this time because his attorneys approach to mitigation at sentencing focused exclusively on his troubled history,and not at all on his redeeming traits of character.fourth,cagle claims he was entitled to a jury instruction as to voluntary intoxication during the guilt phase of trial.
the state mar court considered and rejected the first three claims after an evidentiary hearing at which it heard testimony from cagle attorneys,scott attorneys,and scott himself,among others.the state trial court considered and rejected the fourth claim at a charge conference during trial.the north carolina supreme court affirmed its mar and trial courts on all four claims.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,we uphold those courts rulings unless they are based on an unreasonable determination of the facts or contrary to,or involv ing an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d we also presume the courts factual findings to be correct unless the habeas petitioner proves otherwise by clear and convincing evidence,id.at e.we review the district court,which also rejected all four claims,de novo.see allen lee,cir en banc.
we first address the claim that michael scott changed story entitles cagle to resentencing.just after the sentencing jury returned with its recommendations,cagle,michael scott,said in allocution that neither he nor cagle had ever stabbed dennis house.at the mar hearing,scott repeated that claim and said that ryan jones,the turned state witness,was the real killer.true,scott testified,he had initially told investigators that cagle was the killer.but that was because he and jones,friends from their work together as magazine salesmen,had agreed when they fled the scene to lay the blame on cagle if they were caught.he had decided to come clean after reading the gospel of john while in jail awaiting trial.he had told his lawyers then that he wanted to testify on cagle behalf,but they had discouraged him from doing so.now,he testified,he was finally telling the truth.
characterizing this testimony as evidence unavailable to the defendant at the time of trial with a direct and material bearing upon the defendant eligibility for the death penalty or the defendant guilt or innocence.c,cagle moved in the state mar court for resentencing and a new trial although he limits his claim on habeas to resentencing.the mar court refused.a petitioner must meet seven requirements to proceedings based on new evidence,the court reasoned,and scott testimony failed four of them it was not newly discovered or newly available,more than a means by which to contradict a former witness or to impeach or discredit him,probably true,or of such a nature as to show that on another trial a different result will probably be reached.state bishop.as to the first,the court did not regard a favorable testimony,after staying silent throughout trial and sentencing,to be newly discovered or available.as to the second,the court pointed out that the testimony served to do no more than contradict,impeach,and discredit jones.and as to the third and fourth,the court found that scott was an opportunistic liar,with nothing to lose by exonerating cagle and not much prospect of moving a jury on retrial or resentencing.
cagle makes three arguments against this ruling now.first,he claims that the mar court abandoned the applicable state statute,which required only direct and material evidence unavailable to the defendant at the time of trial,in favor of a stricter test drawn from north carolina case law.compare.c with bishop,at.but this argument obviously transgresses the principle that it is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine determinations on questions.estelle mcguire,d.cagle tries to rescue the argument by claiming a federal due process right to have state courts fairly apply the criminal law laid down by their own legislatures.but this principle has no limit and the mar court interpretation of state statutes and case law presents no federal question.
second,cagle argues that the mar court conclusions about scott testimony were based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.d.in particular,cagle assails the mar court core finding that scott was an opportunistic liar whose testimony would not sway a reasonable jury.but for a federal habeas court to overturn a state court credibility judgments,the state court error must be stark and clear.see id.e protecting state courts factual judgments unless disproved in federal court by clear and convincing evidence.indeed,federal habeas courts have no license to redetermine credibility of witnesses whose demeanor has been observed by the state trial court,but not by them.marshall lonberger,d.here,scott by all accounts told three different stories of cagle role in dennis house murder one in which cagle alone used the knife,a second in which cagle and jones both used it,and a third in which jones alone used it.obviously no fewer than two of his stories were unworthy of belief.under such circumstances,the state court was entitled to its skepticism about scott testimony,and we have no warrant to intrude.
finally,cagle points to a series of cases in which the supreme court,acting on the principle that the constitution guarantees criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense,holmes south carolina,d quotation omitted,overturned the verdicts or sentences of state trial courts for excluding the testimony of defendants key witnesses.see holmes,d green georgia,d per curiam chambers mississippi,d washington texas,d.in this vein,cagle emphasizes how overwhelmingly the state case depended upon ryan jones,and how in particular the jury decision to sentence cagle to death hinged on believing jones claim that cagle inflicted the fatal wounds.scott testimony would have given the jury a firm only firm basis,from the only other eyewitness besides cagle which to question that belief,cagle argues.in short,the testimony was so important that denying him a new sentencing proceeding in which to present it amounted to denying him his clearly established constitutional right to mount a defense.d.
in the cases cagle cites,the defendant right to present a complete defense was abridged by evidence rules that infringe d upon a weighty interest of the accused and were arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they were designed to serve.holmes,at.quotation omitted.neither factor is present here.
first,the state mar court decision not to sentencing for the sake of scott testimony did not infringe upon a weighty interest that is clearly established under federal law.it is one thing to exclude a defense witness testimony during conviction or sentencing proceedings the issue in holmes,green,chambers,and washington,and quite another to decline to conviction or sentencing proceedings so that a former might testify in them.once conviction and sentencing is complete,the presumption of innocence has passed.see herrera collins,d.the presumption of finality on the other hand is strong.see wainwright sykes,d.and just north carolina courts,but federal courts as generally loathe to proceedings for testimony from a,regarding such testimony with great suspicion.see,united states freeman,cir united states dale,per curiam united states,cir united states jacobs,cir see also united states bales,cir.
second,the state mar court decision was not arbitrary or disproportionate.the mar court found scott to be an opportunistic liar whom no reasonable jury would view,as we have already explained,to which the court was very much entitled.in addition,the mar court held that scott potential testimony was not newly discovered because cagle counsel were aware of it at trial scott had simply invoked his fifth amendment privilege not to testify at that time.and the court regarded scott testimony as merely duplicating other testimony that was offered at trial and that also tended to contradict jones.by contrast,holmes,green,chambers,and washington all featured penetrating evidence of actual innocence excluded under rules that serve no legitimate purpose or that are disproportionate to the ends that they are asserted to promote.holmes,at.see also green,at.the excluded testimony was highly relevant and substantial reasons existed to assume its reliability.chambers,at.same washington,at.same.the mar court decision not to cagle sentencing was reasonable,and nothing about it involved deficient or a violation of clearly established federal law.see d,e.
scott change of story also sets in motion the first of cagle two ineffective assistance of counsel claims the claim that cagle attorneys should have found a way to sever his trial from scott so as to smooth the way for scott to testify in cagle favor.cagle must show both deficient performance and a reasonable probability of prejudice to prevail.strickland washington,d.
this claim has evolved somewhat over the course of proceedings.initially,cagle chief argument was that his attorneys did not move to sever prior to the guilt phase of trial.but there was a fatal problem with this argument cagle attorneys did argue adamantly and vigorously,in the state mar court words,cagle and scott should be tried separately counsel simply did so in the course of opposing the state joinder motion rather than through their own motion to sever.cagle now complains that they failed to adequately specify the basis for their opposition by telling the judge what scott would say on the stand.but a look at the transcript reveals that cagle attorney told the judge exactly what the issue was initially,scott made a statement to law enforcement officers the morning after he was arrested,and that statement did n
