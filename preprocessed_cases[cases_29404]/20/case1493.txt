patrico ramonez ramonez appeals the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus naming his custodian,mary berghuis berghuis,as respondent.ramonez is in custody pursuant to a conviction in michigan state court.as he did on direct appeal,ramonez argues that his trial counsel frederick moore moore failed to investigate and call at trial three witnesses to the alleged crime,charles tames charles,rene tames rene and joel big bun hackett hackett.ramonez asserts that moore performance was thus constitutionally deficient,prejudicing his defense in violation of the sixth amendment as applied to the states through the fourteenth.
both the state trial court and the michigan court of appeals found that moore representation of ramonez met the constitutional standard for effective assistance of counsel set out by strickland washington,d.because it is clear that the michigan court of appeals application of the strickland standard for a defense counsel duty to investigate was unreasonable,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to grant a conditional writ of habeas corpus.
background 
on march,a michigan state jury convicted ramonez of home invasion.comp.laws a assault with intent to do great bodily harm id.and aggravated stalking id.h.those convictions arose from a complaint by christina fox fox,ramonez and mother of two of his children.
fox testified at trial that at or april,she and the two children were asleep in the living room of her house when she heard a knock on the door.after cracking the front door,fox saw that it was ramonez knocking.as her relationship with ramonez had been violent and they had separated some years earlier,fox became frightened upon seeing ramonez and attempted to slam the door shut.ramonez,however,forced the door open,knocking fox to the ground in the process.
according to fox,she then found herself lying on the floor between the foyer and the living room,where ramonez pinned her down,began to strangle her and threatened her life.by kicking ramonez,fox was able to free herself and take off running for the front door before he punched her again,knocking her over.fox was nonetheless able to make it out to her front porch.once outside she encountered charles,rene and hackett at the bottom of the stairs to her porch.attempting to flee,fox lost her footing and fell on the stairs.ramonez again pinned her to the ground,while one of the other three covered her mouth to muffle her screaming.finally the altercation ended after fox saw lights go on nearby,and the four men let her go and drove away 
after the prosecution rested,ramonez and moore brought before the judge their disagreement as to moore decision not to call any witnesses on ramonez behalf and ramonez intention to testify despite moore advice.ramonez wanted to call charles,rene and hackett to testify to his story of what happened that day.ramonez complained that he had told moore about those witnesses months earlier,but moore had failed to communicate with them moore stated that it was his strategic decision not to call any witnesses,and the judge decided he was disinclined to interfere with counsel judgment.
with no other witnesses in his defense,ramonez felt compelled to testify on his own behalf.ramonez testified that on the day in question he did go to fox house to check on his children.he claimed that fox voluntarily invited him into her house,but once inside ramonez did not see his kids and,believing that fox appeared to be high,he became angry.ramonez then pushed her against a he denied choking fox took off running out the front door.she then fell on the front steps,where rene attempted to help her to her feet.fox then ran off.
after the jury guilty verdict,the trial court sentenced ramonez to concurrent terms of to years for the home invasion conviction,to years for the assault charge and to years for the aggravated stalking conviction.ramonez appealed on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds,asserting moore failure to investigate and to call rene,charles and hackett.to facilitate the evaluation of that claim,the michigan court of appeals remanded the case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing.
at the hearing moore testified that he was aware of rene,charles and hackett prior to trial,but he never made contact with them.moore defended his decision not to call them based on what he characterized as his trial strategy to focus on the action inside fox home.he believed that the three witnesses could not testify to that action because they were never inside the house.moore plan had been to rely on to point out discrepancies in fox story and discredit her testimony.even so,moore did attempt to reach charles but only charles just three or four days before trial,but he did not succeed in speaking with two simply exchanged phone messages.
each of charles,rene and hackett testified at that hearing.charles is ramonez son,rene his stepson and hackett an acquaintance of the three other men from work.each testified that the three were driving in a car with ramonez on the night in question,ultimately arriving at fox house.there was some inconsistency in their testimony rene remembered stopping at a bar first,while charles did not remember if they made any other stops and hackett recollection was that they did not make any other stops.each then testified that he observed ramonez go up to fox front door,where fox then invited him inside each affirmatively stated that ramonez did not force his way into the house.
all three witnesses testified that even from their vantage point in the car they could see the interaction between ramonez and fox inside the house through the hackett allowed that he may have lost sight of them for some two minutes.each said that he witnessed yelling and a physical altercation between fox and ramonez,but that ramonez did not choke or punch fox.all testified that the three men got out of the car and went up to fox porch where the altercation was continuing outside the house.their stories differed somewhat as to what then occurred outside the house,with hackett simply saying that fox ran off,rene remembering fox falling and one of them helping her up and charles remembering having words with fox and attempting to help her off the ground before she fled.all three affirmed that they would have been willing to testify even if the prosecutor had threatened to charge them as accessories to the crime.
at the conclusion of the hearing the trial court denied the motion for a new trial on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds.applying state law that mirrors the strickland analysis,the court found moore decision not to call the witnesses reasonable because of his trial strategy to focus on what occurred inside the house and his expectation that the witnesses could not offer competent testimony in that regard,due to what he thought was their limited vantage point outside the house.and as to prejudice,the trial court found that hackett was not a particularly helpful witness and that rene was an incredible witness,so that the witnesses testimony could not have changed the outcome of the trial.
as to ramonez ineffective assistance of counsel claims,the michigan court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment on essentially the same reasoning other claims made at the state level are not the subject of this federal habeas effort.ramonez application for leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court was denied,making that intermediate appellate court opinion the final state court decision on his claims.on the ensuing collateral attack under the district court below rejected ramonez petition for a writ of habeas corpus,finding that the michigan court of appeals decision was at least a reasonable application of strickland.on august,the district court granted ramonez motion for a certificate of appealability to this court.
we review de novo a district court denial of a writ of habeas corpus dando yukins,cir.and where as here the district court has reviewed only trial transcripts and other court records,any factual determinations by the district court are also reviewed de novo id.
federal court examination of a habeas petition by a prisoner in custody pursuant to a state court judgment is circumscribed by aedpa,in this instance more specifically under this part of section d 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
under that first contrary to clause of section d,we may grant the writ only if the state court decision was based on a conclusion of law opposite to that reached in supreme court precedent dando,at.and as to the other alternative,williams taylor,d teaches 
under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.
to issue a writ on that ground,the federal court must find the state court application of supreme court precedent objectively unreasonable,not merely incorrect or erroneous wiggins smith,d.
finally,section e requires us to presume that state court fact determinations are correct.to overcome that presumption,the statute requires the petitioner to demonstrate any state court error by clear and convincing evidence.
michigan court of appeals application of strickland 
strickland,at.sets forth the familiar test for evaluating a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel to prevail the petitioner must establish both that defense counsel performance was constitutionally deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense sufficiently to undermine the reliability of the trial id.that first element requires the petitioner to show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness strickland,at,for which purpose we must id.at.internal quotation marks omitted 
indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that is,the defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.
and as to the prejudice element,strickland,id.at.instructs 
the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.
for those purposes combs coyle,cir has held that b oth the performance and prejudice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of law and fact.they are thus not findings of historical facts mcghee yukins,cir that are subject to the section e presumption of correctness for state court factual findings.
as ramonez does not dispute,the michigan court of appeals correctly articulated the strickland standard,so there is no issue under aedpa contrary to supreme court precedent prong.hence the only question is whether that court applied the strickland standard reasonably in coming to its judgment that moore investigation leading to his decision not to call the three witnesses,and that decision itself,were sufficient for constitutional purposes.
on that score ramonez asserts that moore decision to limit or more accurately,not to pursue at all until it was too late any investigation regarding the three potential witnesses was objectively unreasonable,leading to an uninformed and therefore unreasonable decision not to call those witnesses at trial.strickland,at.set forth a defense counsel duty to investigate 
as the court of appeals concluded,strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.in other words,counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.in any ineffectiveness case,a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances,applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgments.
and towns smith,cir dispels any doubt that a lawyer strickland duty includes the obligation to investigate all witnesses who may have information concerning his or her client guilt or innocence.
in its effort to apply that standard,the district court stated that while it would have found moore performance deficient due to his failure even to speak with the three witnesses before trial,it could not say that the michigan court of appeals contrary conclusion was an unreasonable application of strickland,thus making it unchallengeable under aedpa.in so finding the district court considered it within reason for the michigan court to conclude,based on the information available to moore before trial and in conformity with his chosen trial strategy,that moore made a reasonable professional call not to interview the witnesses and not to call them at trial.
even given the required deference to the michigan court of appeals,the district court restraint in those terms does not withstand analysis.as the district court opinion makes clear,the state court focused largely on the notion that moore decision not to call the three witnesses was rooted in what it perceived to be a reasonable trial of focusing on undermining fox credibility as to what happened between her and ramonez inside the because the three witnesses were never inside the house,moore thought that they could add little to that effort.but that belief was grounded on a fatally flawed foundation,for if moore had only engaged in the of interviewing the witnesses,he would have learned that they could testify as to what took place in the house,and that their testimony would have supported ramonez version of events.
that being so,the state court ignored the central teaching of strickland,as reaffirmed by wiggins,at,that the investigation leading to the choice of a trial strategy must itself have been reasonably conducted lest the strategic choice erected upon it rest on a rotten foundation.towns,at internal quotation marks omitted made that same point 
a purportedly strategic decision is not objectively reasonable when the attorney has failed to investigate his options and make a reasonable choice between them.
in evaluating moore decision to limit his investigation as to the three witnesses or more precisely,not to investigate them at all,berghuis contends that the decision not to interview the witnesses was reasonable in light of fox testimony in the preliminary hearing that the assault occurred inside the house.on that basis she urges that moore was justified in concluding,without bothering to speak to the witnesses,that they would have nothing to add to his case.
but that argument is at odds with other crucial parts of the record.months before trial ramonez began insisting to moore that the three witnesses were present at the time and could tell him what really happened at fox house.at the same preliminary hearing on which berghuis relies,fox testified that ramonez kicked in her door to gain entry to the house.such asserted action was clearly not inside the house,such as to render the observers outside the house unable to verify or dispute the parties divergent versions.moreover,fox also testified at that same hearing that three men witnessed the assault continue outside on her front porch even stating that one of them assisted ramonez by covering her mouth to keep her from yelling.if moore was seeking to show that fox was embellishing her story of the altercation with ramonez,why would he not also have found it useful to look into this part of her tale with such information available to him,how could he rationally have conc
