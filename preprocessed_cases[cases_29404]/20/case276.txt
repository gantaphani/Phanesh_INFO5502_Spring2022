this case requires us to address the interaction between two avenues of relief from a federal conviction and sentence,which permits a motion to set aside a sentence allegedly imposed in violation of the constitution or federal law,and rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,which permits a motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.in particular,we must decide whether the statute of limitations for motions imposed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,stat,aedpa,either is tolled during the pendency of a rule motion based on newly discovered evidence,or,in the alternative,does not commence until the possibility of relief under rule is exhausted.
like the district court,we conclude that the statute of limitations for a motion begins to run upon the completion of a prisoner direct appeal from the judgment of conviction,notwithstanding any subsequent proceedings under rule.we also agree with the district court that there is no statutory basis for tolling the limitations period while the prisoner seeks relief under rule.finally,assuming the availability of equitable tolling,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the circumstances of this case do not present any grounds for application of that doctrine.
on june,a federal grand jury returned a superceding indictment against alfred trenkler and thomas shay,charging them with illegal receipt and use of an explosive in violation of d and i,and conspiracy to commit an offense against the united states in violation of an original,sealed indictment had been issued against both men on december.trenkler moved to sever the cases,and shay was tried first.at his trial,shay sought to call robert phillips as an expert witness.phillips was prepared to testify that shay suffered from a mental disorder that caused him to tell lies,making his various incriminating statements unreliable.the district court excluded phillips testimony on the ground that it did not satisfy the standards for expert testimony set forth in rule of the federal rules of evidence.shay was convicted,and on appeal he argued that the district court erred in refusing to admit the testimony.we agreed,holding on june,that it was a clear error in judgment for the district court to exclude the testimony under any plausible interpretation of rule.united states shay,cir.on remand,the district court rejected the government argument that.provided an alternate basis for excluding phillips testimony,and ordered a new trial for shay.shay eventually pled guilty,and was sentenced to years in prison.
at the same time that shay was appealing his conviction,trenkler trial was proceeding in the district court.shay incriminating statements were introduced against trenkler,as they tended to show that shay had been involved in the bombing and had not acted alone.trenkler trial counsel did not attempt to use phillips testimony to undermine shay statements,believing that any effort to introduce the doctor testimony would be futile in light of the district court refusal to admit it at shay trial.trenkler was convicted on all counts of the indictment on november,and sentenced to life in prison.we affirmed his conviction on july.united states trenkler,cir trenkler i.he did not file a petition for certiorari.
on december,trenkler moved for a new trial under rule,which permits such a motion to be filed up to three years after a verdict when it is based on newly discovered evidence.trenkler argued that our decision in shay rendered phillips testimony newly discovered evidence within the meaning of rule.he explained that,although he was aware of phillips testimony at the time of his trial,he did not know until our decision on june,that the testimony was admissible.the district court denied the motion,reasoning that trenkler trial counsel belief that the testimony would not be admitted did not make it unavailable,and that our conclusion that the testimony was admissible in shay case did not render it newly discovered.we affirmed in an unpublished opinion issued on january.united states trenkler,wl cir,trenkler ii.
trenkler then filed the instant motion under to set aside his conviction on the ground that his trial counsel failure to offer phillips testimony violated his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.after aedpa,such a motion generally must be filed within one year of the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.for prisoners whose convictions became final before aedpa was enacted,we have held that the limitations period expires on april,one year after the statute effective date.rogers united states,cir.the district court concluded that trenkler motion was subject to that deadline,his conviction having become final in,when we affirmed it in trenkler accordingly,it dismissed the on january.this appeal followed 
trenkler argues that a timely filed rule motion affects statute of limitations in one of two ways.first,he contends that a conviction is not final for purposes of until the prisoner has exhausted the possibility of relief under rule.second,he argues that even if the limitations period commences at the conclusion of appellate review of the judgment of conviction,the statute of limitations is suspended during the pendency of any subsequent rule motion by virtue of tolling provisions imported from other sections of aedpa.if we reject those statutory arguments,trenkler proposes a third ground for relief,arguing that the doctrine of equitable tolling excuses his failure to file his motion within the period.
we analyze trenkler claims in turn.we review the issues of statutory interpretation de novo,united states michaud,cir,and the district court denial of equitable tolling for an abuse of discretion,delaney matesanz,cir explaining that district court rejection of equitable tolling on the facts is reviewed for abuse of discretion borden paul revere life ins,cir f ashioning or withholding equitable relief rests uniquely within the discretion of the trial court.
trenkler first argument focuses on when the statute of limitations began to run.here,the relevant accrual date is the date on which trenkler conviction became final within the meaning of.although trenkler accepts the prevailing view that a conviction becomes final upon the completion of direct review,he insists that the proceedings before the district court and this court with regard to his rule motion were part of his direct appeal.accordingly,he argues that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until january,when we affirmed the district court denial of his rule motion.
although we have not addressed the question directly,we consistently have treated rule motions filed after the opportunity for direct appeal as a form of collateral attack on a conviction rather than part of the process of direct review.thus,in dirring united states,cir,we held that the district court did not err in refusing to appoint counsel to prosecute the defendant rule motion for a new trial.we explained that 
appellant had counsel through appeal,as required by the criminal justice act,c.we do not construe that phase to include motions for a new trial.nor do we so interpret the sixth amendment.there must be an end.after final conviction the appointment of counsel must rest in the discretion of the court.
id.we reaffirmed that holding in united states tajeddini,cir per curiam,abrogated on other grounds by roe,d,stating that a federally convicted defendant is not entitled under the criminal justice act,or the sixth amendment,to appointment of counsel on a motion for a new trial.that rule,we continued,applies to any rule motion based on newly discovered evidence and filed after the opportunity for direct appeal has expired,regardless of whether the defendant pursued a direct appeal and lost,or simply neglected to file a notice of appeal within the applicable period we do not see why the convicted defendant who foregoes a direct appeal and whose conviction has become final should be treated differently from the defendant who has chosen to appeal with respect to entitlement to counsel,on a collateral attack of that conviction.see also united states lee,holding that right to counsel does not extend to rule motion based on newly discovered evidence and filed after direct appeal united states birrell,cir same kitchen united states,cir noting that rule motion filed after completion of direct appeal plainly is collateral in the usual sense of that term quoting united states woods,cir.
only the sixth circuit has addressed the precise question whether rule motions are included in the process of direct review when they are based on newly discovered evidence and filed after direct appeal either has or could have been taken.in johnson united states,cir,it held that such delayed rule motions should be treated as collateral challenges to the judgment of conviction and,as such,do not affect the finality of a judgment for purposes of the aedpa.id.at.the court found support for that conclusion in rule b of the federal rules of appellate procedure.see id.at.rule b provides that a defendant notice of appeal in a criminal case normally must be filed within ten days of the entry of judgment.subsection b a modifies that general rule,stating that if a defendant files a rule motion within the period the notice of appeal need only be filed within ten days of the entry of the order disposing of that motion.subsection b c then provides that a valid notice of appeal is appeal from an order disposing of a rule motion filed in accordance with subsection a.rule b thus effectively incorporates rule motions into the process of direct appeal,but only when they are filed within ten days of entry of the judgment of conviction.the lack of any analogous provisions to so incorporate motions based on newly discovered evidence and filed outside the period strongly suggests that such motions are not properly considered part of the direct appeal.
that inference is strengthened when one considers the practical effects of trenkler proposed rule.presumably,treating delayed rule motions based on newly discovered evidence as part of the process of direct review would mean that no conviction could be deemed final for purposes of until the expiration of the period for filing such motions.or,perhaps,a prisoner conviction could become final if the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of conviction and the supreme court denied certiorari,and then lose its finality if the prisoner later claimed to have discovered new evidence,only to become final again once the rule motion was adjudicated.either possibility is unacceptable.the first approach severely undercut s congress intent in enacting the aedpa by greatly extending the time in which a petitioner may properly bring a challenge.johnson,at.the second permits every defendant seeking to file an untimely motion to do an around the aedpa limitation period by filing a timely,but ultimately meritless,rule motion.id.
we will not adopt an interpretation of the term final in that so clearly conflicts with the purpose of the aedpa statute of limitations.accordingly,we hold that a rule motion for a new trial is not part of the direct appeal from a judgment of conviction unless incorporated into that appeal by virtue of rule b.therefore,trenkler direct appeal consisted only of his appeal to this court in trenkler i,and his conviction became final either on september,when we issued our mandate in that case,or on december,when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expired as both dates predate aedpa,the limitations period began to run on aedpa effective date,april.
trenkler argues that even if the statute of limitations began to run on aedpa effective date,it was tolled during the pendency of his rule motion.he offers two bases for that conclusion.
statutory tolling 
first,trenkler suggests that we should import into the tolling provision contained in d.section d prescribes a limitations period for petitions filed by state prisoners under,the counterpart of.like motions filed under,petitions for release from state custody generally must be filed within one year of the date the conviction became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.d a.however,d provides that the statute of limitations for petitions is tolled while a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.trenkler asks us to read a similar tolling provision into for federal prisoners filing rule motions for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.congress,he argues,did not intend to adopt different rules for federal and state prisoners its failure to include an explicit tolling provision in to mirror that in d was simply an oversight that we should correct here.
we decline that invitation.it has long been settled that w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.russello united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the omission in of the tolling language that is present in d gives rise to a negative inference that the statute of limitations for is not tolled while federal prisoners pursue other forms of relief.see united states prescott,cir rather than providing support for tolling under,we believe that d counsels against tolling in the present case.
trenkler argued in his brief that the interpretive canon described in russello has no application here because in a world of silk purses and pigs ears,aedpa is not a silk purse in the art of statutory drafting.lindh murphy,d.as trenkler counsel acknowledged at oral argument,that argument was largely foreclosed by duncan walker,d,in which the supreme court relied on that same canon in interpreting d moreover,even without resort to russello,we would find ample cause to conclude that congress decision to provide for tolling in d but not was an intentional one.federal habeas corpus review of state convictions under implicates principles of comity that are inapplicable in the context of federal review of federal convictions under.comity dictates that when a prisoner alleges that his continued confinement for a state court conviction violates federal law,the state courts should have the first opportunity to review this claim and provide any necessary relief.boerckel,d see also b requiring state prisoners to exhaust available state remedies before filing petition for federal relief.as the supreme court explained in duncan,the tolling provision contained in d reflects congress attempt to promote the exhaustion requirement while preserving a meaningful opportunity for state prisoners to seek federal review.at.at.in the absence of an explicit tolling provision,state prisoners could obtain relief in federal court only in the unlikely event that they were able to exhaust all available state review within the limitations period for petitions.
federal prisoners like trenkler do not face the same problem.nothing in aedpa obligated trenkler to exhaust the opportunity for relief under rule before seeking review of his conviction and sentence under.he was free to file a motion immediately without fear that it would be dismissed for failure to exhaust available remedies.we acknowledge,however,that the availability of relief under rule and under aedpa can create some uncertainty for federal prisoners who,like trenkler,must decide whether to seek relief under rule or.on one hand,the strict statute of limitations for motions counsels in favor of pursuing that avenue of relief first.on the other hand,the standard for relief under rule is likely more enticing to a prisoner than the provisions of.prescott,at.under rule,the district court has broad discretion to grant a new trial if the interests of justice so require.fed.proc.section,by contrast,authorizes the district court to grant relief only if it finds that the judgment was rendered without jurisdiction,or that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack,or that there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional right
