petitioner derrick fulton appeals from the may,judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york mae,judge adopting the report and recommendation of a magistrate judge andrew baxter,judge denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.fulton contends that the district court erred in deferring to the state court determination that he failed to preserve his ineffective assistance of counsel claim by not raising it on direct appeal in his state court proceedings.we agree.we also conclude that,upon further development of the factual record,fulton may be able to demonstrate constitutionally unreasonable performance of his counsel during the plea process.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the cause for further proceedings.
background 
on february,an oneida county,new york grand jury charged fulton with two counts of burglary in the first degree,in violation of penal law,one count of robbery in the first degree,in violation of penal law and two counts of robbery in the second degree,in violation of penal law,a.as fulton now recounts,before trial,the state prosecutor offered him a plea agreement under which he would have received a term of imprisonment and a term of supervision.fulton avers that his trial counsel failed to discuss with him the pros and cons of accepting the plea offer and provided no guidance about whether he should accept the plea offer or proceed to trial.app.fulton aff.fulton rejected the plea offer and proceeded to trial.
at his jury trial in may,fulton presented no evidence.the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts.
in august,the state court sentenced fulton,a second felony offender,to twenty years imprisonment and five years supervision on each of the two burglary counts,and fifteen years imprisonment with five years supervision on each of the two counts of robbery in the second degree.these four sentences were to run concurrently.the state court also sentenced fulton to twenty years imprisonment with five years supervision on the count of robbery in the first degree,to be served consecutively to the other prison terms.all told,fulton received an effective sentence of forty years imprisonment and five years supervision.on fulton counseled direct appeal,the appellate division affirmed fulton conviction and sentence,and the new york court of appeals denied leave to appeal.see people fulton.dep t,leave denied.
proceeding pro se,fulton then moved the state trial court under criminal procedure law to vacate his conviction.he argued principally that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing adequately to advise him regarding the plea offer.the state court denied fulton motion to vacate,resting its decision on the directive in c that the court deny a motion to vacate a judgment when the errors claimed are and therefore could have been raised on direct appeal.the court ruled that fulton ineffective assistance claim was,and,because fulton failed to raise it on direct appeal,the claim could not serve as grounds for relief.the state court also commented that fulton received constitutionally effective assistance of counsel and that were it to rule on the matter,it would hold that his ineffective assistance claim was meritless.the appellate division denied leave to appeal this decision.see people fulton,no.ka app.div.dep t.
still proceeding pro se,fulton next petitioned the united states district court for the northern district of new york for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,again contending,among other things,that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.a magistrate judge accepted the state court finding that fulton claim was procedurally defaulted under c and concluded that this default constituted an independent and adequate state ground precluding federal habeas review.over fulton objection,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation,denied fulton petition,and dismissed the action.
in,our court granted fulton pro se motions for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and for a certificate of appealability on the following issues whether the district court erred in deferring to the state court determination that fulton ineffective assistance claim was procedurally defaulted and whether fulton stated an ineffective assistance claim.order,fulton rock,ecf.we also ordered,for purposes of his appeal,that fulton be appointed counsel.id.
discussion 
procedural default under 
we review de novo the district court denial of fulton petition for a writ of habeas corpus.harris kuhlmann,cir.
in habeas proceedings concerning a state prisoner,a federal court is required to presume that a state court factual findings are correct and to place on the petitioner the burden of rebutting this presumption by clear and convincing evidence.see e.a federal habeas court also may not review a related state court decision if that decision rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.cone bell,internal quotation marks omitted.this prudential rule applies whether the state law ground is substantive or procedural.coleman thompson.in line with these directives,the district court concluded that fulton had failed to rebut the presumption that the state court correctly found that fulton ineffective assistance claim was and therefore barred by c.on that basis,the district court ruled that the independent and adequate state grounds doctrine barred its review of fulton ineffective assistance claim.
a federal habeas court may examine the state ground for decision to determine whether it is independent of the federal claim and adequate to preclude federal habeas review.see whitley ercole,cir.ordinarily,we assess the adequacy of a state ground of decision by examining whether the rule upon which the state court relied is firmly established and regularly followed.downs lape,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in exceptional cases,however,the exorbitant application of a generally sound rule renders the state ground inadequate and will not prevent a federal court consideration of the federal question presented.lee kemna.an evaluation of whether a case presents such exceptional circumstances begins by scrutinizing three considerations 
whether the alleged procedural violation was actually relied on in the trial court,and whether perfect compliance with the state rule would have changed the trial court decision 
whether state caselaw indicated that compliance with the rule was demanded in the specific circumstances presented and 
whether petitioner had substantially complied with the rule and,therefore,whether demanding perfect compliance with the rule would serve a legitimate governmental interest.
cotto herbert,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in assessing the contours of a state court denial of collateral review because of a petitioner failure to raise an issue on direct appeal,we focus on the second of the cotto guideposts.see,clark perez,cir.the second cotto factor considers whether state case law indicates that compliance with a procedural rule was required under the specific circumstances of the case.id.at emphasis added.here,the state court based its decision on the procedural rule articulated in c.section c requires the state court to deny a motion to vacate a judgment when,a lthough sufficient facts appear on the record of the proceedings underlying the judgment to have permitted,upon appeal from such judgment,adequate review of the ground or issue raised upon the motion,no such appellate review or determination occurred owing to the defendant unjustifiable failure to raise the issue on direct appeal.as we have commented in the past,t he purpose of this rule is to prevent section from being employed as a substitute for direct appeal when the defendant was in a position to raise an issue on appeal or could readily have raised it on appeal but failed to do so.sweet bennett,cir quoting people cooks,brackets in original.but the weight of state case law suggests that new york courts do not ordinarily apply c to bar claims of ineffective assistance based on conversati
