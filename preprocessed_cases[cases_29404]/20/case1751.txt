petitioner kevin nigel stanford was convicted in a kentucky state court of capital murder,first degree robbery,first degree sodomy,and receipt of stolen property.he was sentenced to death.his conviction and sentence were upheld on direct appeal and through state proceedings.stanford then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court,which denied his petition.we affirm the district court denial of stanford habeas petition.
background 
in,baerbel poore worked as an attendant at a checker gasoline station in southwestern jefferson county,kentucky.working alone one evening,she read the gas pumps in preparation for closing the station for the night.stanford,then seventeen years old,lived in the vicinity of the checker station and knew poore.on january,he and david buchanan decided to rob the station.troy johnson,their accomplice,agreed to drive the car but refused to participate in the robbery.
as poore finished reading the pumps,stanford approached her with a gun and,together with buchanan,forced poore inside the station convenience store.once inside,buchanan attempted to open the store floor safes while stanford took poore to a restroom and raped her.buchanan soon joined stanford in the restroom,where they continued to rape and sodomize poore.
when stanford left the station,he took poore with him.driving poore car,he drove her a short distance to an isolated area.buchanan and johnson followed in johnson car.when the cars stopped,buchanan exited johnson car and approached poore.he saw stanford standing just outside the open driver door and poore smoking a cigarette in the back seat.suddenly,stanford shot poore in the face at point blank range.he then shot her a second time in the head.
after he murdered poore,stanford returned to the gas station to steal cigarettes.total proceeds from the robbery of the checker station included approximately cartons of cigarettes,two gallons of gasoline,and a small amount of cash.
in august,over their objections,stanford and buchanan were jointly tried before a jury in the courtroom of jefferson circuit judge charles leibson.the jury found stanford guilty of the capital murder of poore,first degree robbery,first degree sodomy,and receipt of stolen property valued in excess of.judge leibson sentenced stanford to death for his capital murder conviction and years imprisonment for robbery,sodomy,and receipt of stolen property.buchanan could not receive the death penalty because he was prosecuted as.he was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder,and imprisonment for rape,sodomy,and robbery.johnson was convicted in juvenile court for his role as the getaway driver.
stanford conviction was upheld on direct appeal and in proceedings.in,the kentucky supreme court affirmed his capital conviction.see stanford commonwealth.and,in,his conviction became final when the supreme court affirmed his conviction and sentence.see stanford kentucky,d.after his direct appeal failed,stanford filed a motion to vacate pursuant to.first,the jefferson circuit court and,then,the kentucky supreme court rejected his motion and affirmed his capital sentence.see stanford commonwealth.in,the supreme court denied certiorari on stanford claims.see stanford kentucky,d.
stanford federal habeas litigation began when he filed his petition in the western district of kentucky in january.that petition raised separate claims of error.in august,the district court denied his habeas petition and granted a blanket certificate of probable cause cpc.in january,stanford timely appealed the district court denial and dismissal of his habeas petition to this court.
ii.certificate of appealability 
after the district court entry of judgment and issuance of a cpc,the supreme court considered how provisions contained in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,should be applied in habeas actions initiated prior to aedpa enactment but for which appeals were filed after aedpa enactment.see slack mcdaniel,d.the court held 
when a habeas corpus petitioner seeks to initiate an appeal of the dismissal of a habeas corpus petition after april,the effective date of aedpa,the right to appeal is governed by the certificate of appealability coa requirements now found at c.this is true whether the habeas corpus petition was filed in the district court before or after aedpa effective date.
id.at.applying slack,this court has stated that with respect to appeals initiated after the effective date of aedpa in habeas proceedings commenced prior to that date,law governs the appellate court review of the trial court ruling while aedpa requirement of a certificate of appealability governs the right to appeal.mackey dutton,cir.
under c,a coa may issue only upon a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.also,a coa must indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required.see c.where appeals are initiated after aedpa effective date,but a district court granted a cpc rather than a coa,the reviewing court may consider an issue raised on appeal so long as that issue satisfies the statutory coa standards set forth in c.see mackey,at.
even though the district court originally issued a cpc,we need not undertake coa analysis of the issues raised by stanford on appeal.in january,the district court reconciled slack and its progeny with the procedural history of stanford habeas petition.because stanford filed his habeas petition before aedpa effective date but filed his notice of appeal after aedpa effective date,the district court determined that a coa was required.therefore,it sua sponte issued a coa for all issues raised by stanford in the petition for writ of habeas corpus filed in the district court and presented to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit in the appeal currently pending before that court.stanford appeals fourteen of his habeas claims and,since a coa issued for each claim,we review all fourteen.
iii.standard of review 
because stanford habeas petition was filed in january,prior to the effective date of aedpa,we apply the version of when reviewing the district court denial of his habeas petition.see lindh murphy,d.under analysis,w e review a district court denial of habeas corpus relief de novo,but we review any findings of fact made by the district court for clear error.combs coyle,cir.a state court factual findings are entitled to complete deference if supported by the evidence.id.under this presumption of correctness,a petitioner has the burden of establish ing by convincing evidence that the factual determination by the state court is erroneous.coe bell,cir quoting mcqueen scroggy,cir.this presumption only applies to basic,primary facts,and not to mixed questions of law and fact and also applies to implicit findings of fact,logically deduced because of the trial court ability to adjudge the witnesses demeanor and credibility.mcqueen,at.
habeas review is not a broad exercise of supervisory power,but is limited to constitutional error.see eberhardt bordenkircher,cir.to be eligible for habeas relief on any given claim,a state prisoner first must fully and fairly present his claim,as a matter of federal law,to state courts.see picard connor,d.merely raising an issue as a matter of state law will not satisfy the exhaustion requirement.see riggins mcmackin,cir.so long as the petitioner has fully and fairly presented his federal claim to the state highest court,that claim will be totally exhausted even if the state courts do not consider the claim on the merits.see harris rees,cir.
where a petitioner has not fully and fairly presented a federal claim to the state highest court or when state courts have held that consideration of petitioner claim is barred due to the procedural default in state court,a federal court ordinarily will not consider the merits of that claim unless the petitioner can show cause to excuse his failure to present the claims appropriately in state court,and actual prejudice as a result.see coleman thompson,d teague lane,d.the one exception to this rule is where a petitioner submits new and reliable evidence that a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of an innocent individual.in cases involving probable innocence,courts address the merits of the defaulted claim to avoid a fundamental miscarriage of justice.see schlup delo,d.
iv.discussion 
a morgan claims 
stanford contends that,pursuant to the supreme court holding in morgan illinois,d,he was unconstitutionally denied a right to his jury.specifically,he alleges three constitutional violations.first,he argues that the state trial court refusal to ask or allow defense counsel to ask voir dire questions constituted constitutional error.second,he argues that the district court erred in concluding that he was not entitled to the benefit of morgan.and,third,he argues that his counsel failure to his jury constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.he is not entitled to habeas relief on any of these morgan claims.
in witherspoon illinois,d,the supreme court determined that it was proper to ask prospective jurors about their views concerning the death penalty during voir dire in capital cases.such death qualifying questions would ensure the impartiality of jurors by allowing the state to properly exercise challenges for cause against potential jurors unwilling to return a capital sentence.see id.at.in morgan,defense counsel was given the parallel ability to identify those jurors who would always impose the death penalty.morgan held that on voir dire the court must,on defendant request,inquire into the prospective jurors views on capital punishment because a prospective juror who would always impose the death penalty must not be empaneled.morgan,at.if even one such juror is empaneled and the death sentence is imposed,the state is disentitled to execute the sentence.id.at.
i voir dire 
two types of voir dire were conducted during stanford trial.first,the court conducted individual voir dire,after which counsel asked questions.and,second,counsel conducted general voir dire in open court.
at the commencement of individual voir dire,stanford counsel filed defendant proposed voir dire questions concerning capital punishment,a series of questions,six of which were.the trial court said that it would be asking all of the individual voir dire questions of the jury and that it would inquire into two areas death qualification and personal commitments.immediately thereafter,stanford counsel inquired as follows we have tendered proposed questions to the capital phase which i take it are overruled the trial judge responded yeah.during individual voir dire,the trial court asked only one capital question do you have any conscientious scruples against imposing the death penalty,such that you could not consider it under the circumstances in this or any other case and regardless of what the evidence may be 
it is not known whether the court would have permitted stanford counsel to ask questions during general voir dire.his counsel never sought permission to ask such questions and,in the end,did not ask any questions during general voir dire.
ii morgan applicability 
the parties dispute morgan applicability.first,they dispute whether stanford morgan claim is cognizable on habeas review.and,second,they dispute whether morgan,decided in,applies retroactively to stanford,whose conviction became final in.whether morgan applies retroactively is a question of first instance.
as an initial matter,we agree with the district court conclusion that the morgan issue is cognizable on habeas review because the kentucky supreme court reached the merits of the that issue.see stanford commonwealth.furthermore,since the morgan issue was properly raised in stanford habeas petition and certificate of appealability,it is now before this court.that said,we leave the question of whether morgan should be applied retroactively for another day.we neither accept nor reject the district court holding that morgan created a new rule of law that,under teague lane,d,could not be retroactively applied to stanford case.
for the sake of argument,we assume that morgan applies retroactively to stanford case,meaning that he was entitled to ask questions of his jury venire panel.morgan requires a trial court to permit questions during voir dire only where a defendant counsel requests that such questions be asked.morgan does not,however,specifically require that defendant counsel be permitted to ask questions during individual voir dire.under morgan,a defendant right to his jury could also be satisfied during general voir dire.we adopt the sound analysis of the kentucky supreme court 
simply put,the rulings and discussions of record concerning the list of questions proposed by the defendants never addressed the propriety of asking the questions during the general voir dire.we can find no rulings on the merits of the questions nor any hint of how the court would have ruled had appellant counsel attempted to ask the questions of the jurors during the collective voir dire.as the trial court did not make any rulings adverse to the appellant during his counsel questioning of the jury,we can find no error prejudicial to appellant why,however,counsel chose not to explore the veniremen predilection for imposing the death penalty,is a question which can not be attributed to any action or failing of the trial court.
stanford commonwealth,at internal citations and quotations omitted.
even applying morgan retroactively as stanford requests,the trial court refusal to permit questions during individual voir dire would not constitute federal constitutional error.because his counsel was not precluded from asking questions during general voir dire,stanford is not entitled to habeas relief on his first two morgan claims.
iii ineffective assistance of counsel 
as an alternative to his claim that the trial court violated his morgan right to his jury,stanford argues that his counsel failure to the jury during general voir dire constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.we hold that this claim fails too.
in strickland washington,d,the supreme court articulated a test for ineffective assistance of counsel.there are two components to the strickland test 
first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.
strickland,at.strickland specifically holds that the two prongs of its test need not be applied in order or in totality.see id.at.for instance,if a defendant could not make the requisite showing on the performance prong,the court need not undertake analysis under the prejudice prong.stanford morgan ineffective assistance of counsel claim does not satisfy either prong of the strickland test.
to demonstrate ineffective assistance under the performance prong,a defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances at the time of counsel conduct,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.id.at.internal quotation and citation omitted.stanford has not overcome that presumption.morgan does not mandate that questions be asked of potential jurors in every case.instead,morgan holds that a defendant has the right to his jury upon request.by premising a defendant right to upon defense counsel making a request to,morgan suggests that there are instances where defense counsel might choose not to ask questions as a matter of strategy.pursuant to morgan,failure to a jury is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel.
stanford presents no evidence to counteract our presumption that his counsel failure to ask questions during general voir dire constituted trial strategy.the record is silent as to the rationale behind his counsel performance.thus,we can do no more than speculate as to some of the reasons why stanford counsel might not have asked questions during general voir dire.first,he may have mistakenly but honestly believed that,when judge leibson excluded his questions during individual voir dire,judge leibson was excluding those questions for all stages of voir dire,including general voir dire.second,counsel may not have wanted to ask questions during general voir dire because he did not want individual jurors to hear one another answers to questions.perhaps he was afraid that a prospective juror espousing death as a punishment would influence other jurors.third,by the time general voir dire occurred,defense counsel may have been satisfied with the composition of the jury and confident in its ability to honestly and ably perform its duties.and,fourth,if the jury pool was satisfactory,defense counsel may have calculated that asking additional questions might aid the prosecution in deciding how to use its peremptory challenges.see brown jones,cir counsel decision not to ask potential jurors whether they would automatically vote to impose the death penalty appears to be a tactical decision,because it seems reasonable for trial counsel to want to focus the jury on the idea of the death penalty as little as possible.
since our scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential,strickland,at,and stanford has presented no evidence to rebut the presumption that counsel failure to ask questions during general voir dire constituted sound trial strategy,we reject his ineffective assistance claim under strickland performance prong.
alternatively,stanford does not satisfy the prejudice prong of the strickland test.to demonstrate ineffective assistance under the prejudice prong,t he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.in making the determination whether the specified errors resulted in the required prejudice,a court should presume,absent challenge to the judgment on grounds of evidentiary insufficiency,that the judge or jury acted according to the law.id.the assessment of prejudice should proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably,conscientiously,and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision.id.at.t he question is whether there is a reasonable probability that the sentencer including an appellate court,to the extent it independently reweighs the have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.id.we also must ask whether the trial was fundamentally fair and whether counsel errors likely undermined the reliability of and confidence in the result.see lockhart fretwell,d.
under strickland prejudice prong,stanford counsel failure to ask questions during general voir dire did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.first,there is no evidence that any potential jurors were inclined to always sentence a capital defendant to death.second,nothing in the record indicates that counsel failure to ask questions led to the impanelment of a partial jury.third,considering the totality of the evidence,there is no reasonable probability that,even if defense counsel erred,the sentencer would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.see strickland,at.as is required pursuant to.ann,the kentucky supreme court reviewed stanford death sentence on direct appeal and determined that the death sentence was supported by the evidence,the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances warranted death.see stanford,at.stanford trial was fundamentally fair and counsel failure to the jury did not undermine the reliability of and confidence in the result.see brown,at holding,on similar grounds,that counsel failure to a jury did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel under strickland prejudice prong.
we reject stanford claim that the failure of his trial counsel to ask questions constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.
b bruton claim 
next,stanford argues that the district court erred by finding that the admission of david buchanan confession,as recounted by detective jerry hall to the jury,constituted a harmless violation of the bruton rule.we agree with the district court.
in bruton united states,d,the supreme court held that admission of a confession implicating the defendant violated the defendant sixth amendment rights to confrontation and where the did not testify at trial.see id.at.if the confession clearly implicated the defendant for the crimes charged,even a limiting instruction could not remove the taint caused by the lack of opportunity to confront the witness.see smith estelle,cir.hence,where a bruton situation exists,the court may protect the defendant sixth amendment rights by exclusion of the confession,severance of the trial,or redaction of the confession to avoid mention or obvious implication of the defendant.see richardson marsh,d.
bruton violations can occur even where a defendant name is redacted or replaced from a confession.in hodges rose,cir,the sixth circuit held that admission of a redacted statement containing the word blank in place of the defendant name violated the bruton rule.although the other party is referred to as blank in the redacted statement,the circumstances of the case and other evidence admitted virtually compel the inference that blank is the defendant.id.at.and,in gray maryland,d,the supreme court discussed the danger of redacting a confession by simply removing a defendant name t he obvious deletion of a defendant name may well call the jurors attention specially to the removed name.by encouraging the jury to speculate about the reference,the redaction may overemphasize the importance of the confession accusation.
where a bruton violation occurs,a court must then determine whether that violation is harmless.the court must decide whether the minds of an average jury would have found the state case against a defendant significantly less persuasive had the incriminating portion of the statement been excluded.hodges,at quoting schneble florida,d.relief may be granted on collateral review only if the trial error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.under this standard,habeas petitioners are not entitled to habeas relief based on trial error unless they can establish that it resulted in actual prejudice.brecht abrahamson,d internal quotation and citation omitted.an erroneous admission of a confession can constitute harmless error where the defendant claiming a bruton violation confessed to full participation in the crimes.see cruz new york,d gilliam mitchell,cir.
the confession of stanford,david buchanan,was read into evidence by detective hall during the defendants joint trial.buchanan never testified.the confession was redacted so that stanford name was replaced by the other person wherever it appeared.despite this redaction,the district court found that buchanan confession directly incriminated stanford in violation of bruton.from the confession,the jury learned that the other person requested that buchanan bring the gun to the robbery,carried the gun during the commission of the offenses at the checker gas station,sodomized the victim,and shot the victim twice.
the district court found that the jury would reasonably have concluded that the other person was stanford,while the state argues that the jury could also have reasonably concluded that the other person was calvin buchanan.at trial,the defense theory was that calvin buchanan,david uncle,killed poore.calvin buchanan name was mentioned several times during the trial,but it is not likely that a jury would have believed him to be the other person.it was stanford and not calvin buchanan who sat as a defendant before the jury,and david buchanan statements about the other person were placed into evidence by the prosecution,which the jury knew was pushing for the conviction of stanford as the shooter.
based on our decision in hodges,which was supported later by the supreme court in gray,it appears that the district court was correct that the replacement of stanford with the other person in buchanan confession did not prevent a bruton violati
