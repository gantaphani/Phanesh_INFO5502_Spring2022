william charles morva appeals the district court dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,and challenges several aspects of his capital convictions and death sentence.first,morva argues that the virginia circuit court refusal to appoint a expert compels relief under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d.but because morva has identified no clearly established federal law requiring the appointment of a nonpsychiatric expert,we reject this claim.
next,morva asserts three related claims regarding his counsel investigation and presentation of mitigating evidence in his capital sentencing hearing.reviewing these claims through the deferential lens of d,we find neither deficient performance nor resulting prejudice under strickland washington,d.last,we determine whether morva has shown cause to excuse his procedurally defaulted claim that counsel was ineffective for stipulating at the guilt phase of trial that morva was a prisoner in lawful custody at the time of the alleged capital murder.finding the underlying claim insubstantial under martinez ryan,d,we hold that he has not.
accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment.
in the summer of,morva was in jail awaiting trial in montgomery county,virginia,on burglary,robbery,and charges.he had been in jail for approximately one year when he escaped and committed the crimes we address in this appeal.we set out the relevant facts of morva crimes,as recited by the supreme court of virginia 
morva was scheduled to go to trial on august.in the evening on august,he informed the jail personnel that he required medical attention due to an injury to his leg and forearm.during the early morning hours of august,sheriff deputy russell quesenberry,who was in uniform and armed with a glock caliber pistol,transported morva to the montgomery regional hospital located in montgomery county.morva was wearing waist chains,but deputy quesenberry did not secure morva allegedly injured arm.
upon arrival at the hospital,morva kept trying to walk on deputy quesenberry right side even though he was ordered to walk on deputy quesenberry left side.quesenberry was required to have morva walk on his left because quesenberry wore his gun on his right side.quesenberry observed that morva limping was sporadic and sort of went away.also,nurse melissa epperly observed morva walking as if he were not injured.
after the hospital treated morva,morva requested to use the bathroom.deputy quesenberry inspected the bathroom and allowed morva access.while in the bathroom,morva removed a metal toilet paper holder that was screwed to the wall.as deputy quesenberry entered the bathroom,morva attacked him with the metal toilet paper holder,breaking quesenberry nose,fracturing his face,and knocking him unconscious.morva then took quesenberry gun.prior to leaving the bathroom,morva confirmed that quesenberry gun was ready to fire,ejecting a live round from the chamber.
after escaping from the bathroom,morva encountered derrick mcfarland,an unarmed hospital security guard.morva pointed quesenberry gun at mcfarland face.mcfarland stood with his hands out by his side and palms facing morva.despite mcfarland apparent surrender,morva shot mcfarland in the face from a distance of two feet and ran out of the hospital,firing five gunshots into the electronic emergency room doors when they would not open.mcfarland died from the gunshot to his face.
in the morning of august,morva was seen in montgomery county near huckleberry trail,a paved path for walking and bicycling.corporal eric sutphin,who was in uniform and armed,responded to that information by proceeding to huckleberry trail.
andrew duncan observed morva and then later observed corporal sutphin on huckleberry trail.four minutes later,duncan heard two gunshots,less than a second apart.david carter,who lived nearby,heard shouting,followed by two gunshots,and saw corporal sutphin fall to the ground.
shortly thereafter,officer brian roe discovered corporal sutphin,who was dead from a gunshot to the back of his head.corporal sutphin gun was still in its holster with the safety strap engaged.officer roe confiscated corporal sutphin gun to secure it and continued to search for morva.
later that day,officer ryan hite found morva lying in a ditch in thick grass.even though morva claimed to be unarmed,officers discovered quesenberry gun on the ground where morva had been lying.morva dna was found on the trigger and handle of quesenberry gun.
morva commonwealth morva i.after a trial,the jury found morva guilty of assault and battery of a officer,escape of a prisoner by force or violence,three counts of capital murder and two counts of using a firearm in the commission of a murder.
we begin with a brief discussion of virginia capital sentencing scheme.
under virginia law,a capital sentencing hearing proceeds in two stages.see tuggle netherland,d per curiam.first,the jury decides whether the commonwealth has proved at least one of two statutory aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant future dangerousness and the vileness of his capital offense conduct.ann,c.in evaluating the aggravating factor of future dangerousness,the jury is limited to considering the defendant criminal record,his prior history,and the circumstances surrounding the commission of the capital offense,c.if the jury fails to find an aggravating factor,it must impose a sentence of life imprisonment if,however,the jury finds one or both of the statutory aggravating factors,it has full discretion to impose either the death sentence or life imprisonment.see,c d tuggle,at.
although virginia juries are not instructed to give special weight to aggravating factors or to balance aggravating and mitigating evidence,swann commonwealth,juries are constitutionally required to consider relevant mitigating evidence in determining a sentence in a capital case,eddings oklahoma,d.
prior to trial,morva moved for the appointment of mark cunningham,a expert,to rebut the commonwealth claim that morva was a future danger to society and to provide the jury with an assessment of the likelihood that morva would commit violence if he were sentenced to life in prison.morva i,at.the circuit court denied the motion,stating that virginia law barred as irrelevant cunningham testimony regarding the environment and structure of a facility as well as testimony regarding rates of violence among individuals similarly situated to the defendant.morva later moved for reconsideration,supported by a letter from cunningham,but the motion was denied.
morva also sought the appointment of a expert and a mitigation specialist,which the circuit court granted.the court appointed bruce cohen,a forensic psychiatrist scott bender,a neuropsychologist and leigh hagan,a psychologist.all three experts prepared evaluations.cohen and bender diagnosed morva with schizotypal personality disorder cohen and hagan,however,noted that there was no evidence indicating that morva was experiencing an extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the capital offenses,or that he was unable to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.see also showing in bender evaluation that he did not find to the contrary rather,he did not consider the issue.
at the sentencing phase,the commonwealth tendered evidence of both statutory aggravating factors.morva called thirteen witnesses,including bender and cohen.while cohen testified to morva absence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance and his ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct,the doctor also testified that morva schizotypal personality disorder mitigated against imposing the death sentence.the jury ultimately found both aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt and imposed the death sentence on each of the three capital murder convictions.
on direct appeal and as relevant here,morva challenged the circuit court denial of his motion to appoint cunningham as a expert.the supreme court of virginia found no abuse of discretion,affirmed morva convictions and sentences,and subsequently denied rehearing.two justices dissented from the majority decision on the issue,finding that the circuit court denial of morva motion result ed in a fundamentally unfair trial in the sentencing phase because absent cunningham testimony and assessment,morva was not permitted the means to effectively respond to the commonwealth assertions of future dangerousness.morva i,at koontz,dissenting.
the supreme court denied further review.
morva then sought relief in the supreme court of virginia.his petition raised,in relevant part,three of the claims before us now.the warden filed a motion to dismiss,supported with exhibits and affidavits,including bender,cohen,and hagan evaluations.morva moved repeatedly to supplement the record and for discovery,the appointment of experts,and an evidentiary hearing.the court denied morva motions and dismissed the habeas petition,finding no ineffective assistance.
morva subsequently filed a federal habeas petition under,raising the claims on appeal here.the district court held two hearings,permitted supplemental briefing,and later issued a memorandum opinion dismissing the petition.the court found that morva was not entitled to relief under aedpa deferential standard.it also held that morva failed to show cause for his defaulted claim.
this appeal followed.
morva presents five claims.first,he contends that the virginia circuit court denial of his motion to appoint a expert violated his eighth and fourteenth amendment rights.next,morva raises three related claims regarding counsel investigation into his childhood,family background,and history counsel presentation of mitigating evidence and counsel assistance to the experts.finally,morva appeals the denial of relief on a separate claim,raised for the first time in the district court,regarding his counsel decision during the guilt phase of trial to stipulate to morva status as a prisoner in a state or local correctional facility,who was imprisoned,but not yet had gone to trial,and who was in lawful custody at the time of the charged offenses.
we consider each argument in turn,reviewing de novo the district court denial of morva petition for a writ of habeas corpus.gray zook,cir.
we turn first to morva claim.because the supreme court of virginia adjudicated this claim on the merits,we may not grant morva habeas relief unless the court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.gordon braxton,cir quoting d.
our evaluation of a state application of clearly established federal supreme court precedent depends on the specificity of the clearly established law.w here the precise contours of a right remain unclear,state courts enjoy broad discretion in their adjudication of a prisoner claims.woods donald,d per curiam second alteration in original quoting white woodall,d.similarly,when the supreme court has not yet confront ed the specific question presented by a particular case,the state court decision can not be contrary to any holding of the supreme court.id.quoting lopez smith,d per curiam.
a state court determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court decision.harrington richter,d quoting yarborough alvarado,d.thus,t he question under aedpa is not whether a federal court believes the state court determination was incorrect but whether that determination was unreasonable a substantially higher threshold.schriro landrigan,d.
the supreme court of virginia did not unreasonably reject morva claim that he was constitutionally entitled to a expert.morva improperly frames the court alleged error as an unconstitutional prohibition on his right to present mitigating evidence.but this presents the issue at too high a level of generality.woods.at.rather,morva challenges the supreme court of virginia decision that due process did not require the appointment of a nonpsychiatric expert particularly where other experts had been provided because he did not make the required showing under virginia law.
we conclude that the supreme court of virginia reasonably applied clearly established federal law in rejecting morva challenge.notably,the supreme court has never addressed a capital defendant right to a nonpsychiatric expert.the court has only ruled on an indigent defendant due process right to a psychiatrist when he makes a preliminary showing that his sanity at the time of the offense is likely to be a significant factor at trial.ake oklahoma,d.since ake,the supreme court ha s flatly declined to resolve the question of what,if any,showing would entitle an indigent defendant to assistance as a matter of federal constitutional law.weeks angelone,cir.
absent federal precedent on the issue,the supreme court of virginia has crafted a rule to determine when due process requires a nonpsychiatric expert.in husske commonwealth,the court announced the particularized need standard an indigent defendant who seeks the appointment of an expert witness,at the commonwealth expense,must demonstrate that the subject which necessitates the assistance of the expert is likely to be a significant factor in his defense,and that he will be prejudiced by the lack of expert assistance,citation omitted quoting ake,at.to satisfy this burden,the defendant must demonstrate that the expert would materially assist him in the preparation of his defense and that the expert absence would result in a fundamentally unfair trial.id.
we have said that the husske standard is congruent with the requirements of the federal constitution.bramblett true,app x,cir see also page lee,cir finding that north carolina test,which mirrors virginia,is surely a reasonable interpretation of ake.thus,the supreme court of virginia did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law in requiring morva to show a particularized need for his requested expert.
turning to the supreme court of virginia application of the husske test to morva case,we find no constitutional violation warranting habeas relief under d.the court first addressed the three cases on which morva relied in support of his claim gardner florida,d,skipper south carolina,d,and simmons south carolina,d and found they did not dictate the result he urged.morva i,at.the court then discussed virginia precedent on the relevance of evidence to a assessment and,finding irrelevant and therefore inadmissible an essential part of cunningham proffered testimony,his testimony regarding prison life,prison security,and statistics on similarly situated defendants instances of violence in prison,concluded that the circuit court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying morva motion because morva did not satisfy the test.id.at.
the supreme court of virginia conclusion that gardner,skipper,and simmons do not support the constitutional rule morva asserts is neither contrary to,nor involves an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.gardner concerned a court imposition of the death penalty on the basis of a confidential presentence report that was never disclosed to the defense.at plurality opinion.vacating and remanding the case for resentencing,the supreme court announced that the imposition of a death sentence on the basis of information which the defendant had no opportunity to deny or explain is unconstitutional.id.at plurality opinion emphasis added finding a due process violation id.at white,concurring in the judgment finding an eighth amendment violation id.brennan,concurring in part and dissenting in part joining the plurality due process reasoning.
the court relied on this general principle years later in skipper,when it considered a capital defendant right to present mitigating evidence regarding future dangerousness when the prosecution asserts that aggravating factor,lest the defendant be sentenced to death on information he was never allowed to challenge.at.the court holding,however,was narrow 
t he only question before us is whether the exclusion from the sentencing hearing of the testimony petitioner proffered regarding his good behavior during the over seven months he spent in jail awaiting trial deprived him of his right to place before the sentencer relevant evidence in mitigation of punishment.it can hardly be disputed that it did.
id.at emphasis added.
finally,simmons announced yet another narrow expansion of a capital defendant right to introduce mitigating evidence.the court there held that when the defendant future dangerousness is at issue,and state law prohibits the defendant release on parole,due process requires that the sentencing jury be informed that the defendant is parole ineligible.simmons,at plurality opinion id.at,concurring in the judgment where the state puts the defendant future dangerousness in issue,and the only available alternative sentence to death is life imprisonment without possibility of parole,due process entitles the defendant to inform the capital sentencing jury by either argument or instruction that he is parole ineligible.
these cases do not clearly establish a capital defendant right to a nonpsychiatric expert.see white.at c learly established federal law for purposes of d includes only the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of this court decisions.alteration in original quoting howes fields,d.confined as we are under aedpa,we conclude that the supreme court of virginia decision regarding a right whose precise contours remain unclear,is neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of federal law.woods.at quoting white.at.
the supreme court of virginia separate determination that morva failed to show a particularized need for the expert also does not run afoul of clearly established law.the court classification of evidence as irrelevant and therefore inadmissible is not unreasonable under supreme court precedent.nor is the court similar determination regarding statistical evidence of similarly situated inmates and instances of prison violence.
a defendant constitutional right to present mitigating evidence related to his character,criminal history,and the circumstances of his offense does not upset a state court broad discretion in determining the admissibility of other,nonindividualized evidence.see lockett ohio,d plurality opinion nothing in this opinion limits the traditional authority of a court to exclude,as irrelevant,evidence not bearing on the defendant character,prior record,or the circumstances of his offense.see also johnson texas,d lockett and its progeny do not bar a state from guiding the sentencer consideration of mitigating evidence.indeed,we have held that there is no constitutional requirement of unfettered sentencing discretion in the jury,and states are free to structure and shape consideration of mitigating evidence second alteration in original.thus,the supreme court of virginia did not unreasonably apply supreme court precedent by deeming irrelevant evidence that did not relate specifically to morva character,background,criminal record,or the circumstances of his offense,evidence regarding general prison life and security offered to show that morva opportunities to commit criminal acts of violence in the future would be severely limited in a maximum security prison.burns commonwealth.
finally,the supreme court of virginia did not unreasonably decide the facts.morva contends otherwise,but he does not identify the alleged factual error.we assume he takes issue with the court finding that the inadmissible evidence of general prison life and security was essential to cunningham proffered testimony.morva i,at.but cunningham own statements to the circuit court compel this finding.in his letter,he wrote that an individualized assessment is only meaningful if it takes into account the person future setting,if known,and the frequency of serious violence by people with similar characteristics in similar settings.his declaration also noted that the proffered data and evidence are necessary and critically important to a reliable violence risk assessment.accordingly,we hold that morva claim does not warrant federal habeas relief.
next we consider morva nondefaulted claims.first we determine the appropriate standard of review.then we turn to the merits.
the district court applied d to morva nondefaulted claims,and we review that decision de novo.gordon,at.for aedpa deferential standard to apply to the state court dismissal of these claims,the court decision must qualify as an adjudicat ion on the merits under d otherwise,de novo review is proper.id.alteration in original quoting d.whether a claim has been adjudicated on the merits is a inquiry,winston pearson winston ii,cir,but a claim is not adjudicated on the merits when the state court makes its decision on a materially incomplete record,gordon,at quoting winston kelly winston i,cir.a record may be materially incomplete when a state court unreasonably refuses to permit further development of the facts of a claim.id.quoting winston ii,at.morva argues that the state court denial of the appointment of experts and an evidentiary hearing resulted in a decision on a materially incomplete record.we disagree.
although the supreme court of virginia precluded some factual development as to counsel investigative decisionmaking,the court did not act unreasonably.the record was substantial and contained sufficient evidence to answer the strickland inquiry.moreover,the record provided reasons for counsel decisions not to interview or call certain witnesses at the sentencing phase,and included cumulative information about morva background that counsel received through witness interviews.and trial transcripts show the extent of mitigating evidence presented to the jury.
moreover,there is no doubt that the supreme court of virginia considered this substantial record in ruling on morva claims.see morva warden of sussex i state prison morva ii,discussing the nature of submitted affidavits regarding morva background and character,and evaluating the quality and implications of morva evidence.
we therefore review morva remaining nondefaulted claims under aedpa highly deferential standard.under aedpa,we defer to the state court judgment,and under clearly established supreme court precedent,the state court defers to counsel presumptive sound trial strategy.strickland,at judicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential.it was morva burden before the state court to show both that counsel performance was deficient that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that he suffered prejudice as a result by showing a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.the likelihood of a different result must be substantial,not just conceivable.richter,at.
surmounting strickland high bar is never an easy task,id.at quoting padilla kentucky,d,and e stablishing that a state court application of strickland was unreasonable or contrary to clearly established federal law under d is all the more difficult,id.this standard effectively cabins our review to a determination of whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied strickland deferential standard.id.
morva asserts that counsel was ineffective in failing to adequately investigate his background,history,character,and mental illness provide all available information to the experts to ensure accurate evaluations and adequately present the available mitigating evidence to the jury.although morva identifies these as three distinct claims,his briefs address them together,and we will resolve them as such.the court found that morva failed to satisfy both strickland prongs.we first review the court decision on deficient performance,before considering whether morva met his burden as to prejudice.
regarding deficient performance,the supreme court of virginia held that counsel investigation and presentation of mitigating evidence did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.see morva ii,at calling counsel investigation exhaustive,finding that counsel spoke with the affiants on whom morva claim relies,and characterizing the affiants testimony as quoting lewis warden of fluvanna corr.similarly,the court found that counsel adequately assisted the experts.id.at finding that morva failed to show an indication of true mental illness to alert counsel.
the supreme court of virginia decision on deficient performance does not warrant federal habeas relief.as to the investigation,morva challenges trial counsel alleged failure to investigate morva multigenerational family history by conducting little or no investigation of morva immediate family and only cursory interviews with morva mothers family members.appellant br.at.the record shows,however,that counsel hired a mitigation expert and interviewed many of the affiants who did not testify at trial and on whom morva relies to show ineffective assistance,including morva mother,sister,paternal,one of his brothers,and two of his aunts.notably,morva mother affidavit provides a thorough account of morva father hungarian background and american immigration and of her own family history,and it also states that she shared a good deal of information contained in th e affidavit with morva capital defense team through several conversations with them over a period of more than a year,id.at.
while morva complains that counsel could have interviewed other family members and spent more time gathering information from those family members that were interviewed,he points to no supreme court case establishing that counsel effort constitutes deficient performance or that counsel decision not to pursue this line of mitigating evidence was constitutionally unreasonable.see strickland,at a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that is,the defendant must overcome the presumption that the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.quoting michel louisiana.
indeed,clearly established federal law supports the supreme court of virginia deference to counsel performance in this instance.see wiggins smith,d strickland does not require counsel to investigate every conceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely the effort would be to assist the defendant at sentencing.strickland,at finding that when counsel has reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful,counsel failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable.given the doubly deferential standard of aedpa,we can not conclude that the supreme court of virginia unreasonably applied strickland when it held that counsel investigation into morva family history was not outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.at.
regarding the presentation of mitigating evidence,morva has not shown that counsel performed deficiently.the jury heard from thirteen witnesses,including the experts who evaluated morva.witnesses testified to morva absent parents and his tumultuous relationship with them,including that his mother was at times homeless and unable to care for him morva own nomadic lifestyle and homelessness as a young adult his ongoing health problems his nonviolent and compassionate nature and his odd,somewhat fantastical beliefs and behavior.
these sympathetic and humanizing facts compose the bulk of the affidavits morva presented to the supreme court of virginia to show inadequate investigation and presentation of mitigating evidence.that the mitigating evidence morva insists should have been presented at trial is merely cumulative to the evidence actually heard by the jury further undercuts morva claim for deficient performance.see wong belmontes,d per curiam rejecting the view that counsel should have presented additional humanizing evidence about the defendant difficult childhood and positive attributes,and stating that a dditional evidence on these points would have offered an insignificant benefit,if any at all.
the same can be said about the additional evidence that morva says counsel should have provided to the experts.bender and cohen found that morva suffered from schizotypal personality disorder.in reaching this diagnosis,they conducted interviews with morva,his mother,and his sister performed diagnostic tests and evaluations of morva and considered a plethora of documents from counsel,including reports of interviews with morva acquaintances.morva presents no evidence that counsel should have believed these sources were insufficient for the experts to conduct a reliable and accurate evaluation,or that providing the cumulative evidence that morva identifies would have materially altered their assessments of his mental condition.
morva contends that it was objectively unreasonable for counsel to fail to provide the experts certain family medical records and the names of three acquaintances who he claims had invaluable insight into his mental state.appellant br.at.but bender and cohen learned,through their evaluations and interviews,of morva maternal family history of schizophrenia.and morva did not show the supreme court of virginia how his three acquaintances relationships with him gave them invaluable insight into his mental health at the time of the capital offenses,or that counsel should have known of their value to the defense.thus,the court did not unreasonably apply strickland or its progeny when it held that morva failed to substantiate his claim that counsel performed deficiently.
as to prejudice,the supreme court of virginia found that morva has not demonstrated what impact,if any,the new evidence had on his actions,and concluded that the information does not mitigate morva actions.morva ii,at.the court also found that morva failed to show that the mental health experts who examined morva in preparation for trial and sentencing would have changed the ir expert conclusions if they had received the additional information from counsel.id.at.these decisions are not unreasonable.
on appeal,morva presents a cumulative prejudice argument.he contends that the inadequate investigation of his history deprived the jurors of a complex,multifaceted description of him as a human being.appellant br.at.additionally,he claims that had counsel given the experts all known history and the contact information of morva close acquaintances,there is a reasonable probability that the mental health experts would have diagnosed morva with a more serious mental illness.id.at.in turn,counsel could have had an explanation for the jury that morva mental illness was a cause of the violence,reducing his moral culpability and providing a strong argument for life in prison rather than a death sentence.id.at.
this claim fails.first,morva arguments relate to the jury finding that his conduct was vile,but it does nothing to combat the future dangerousness aggravating factor.and the jury imposed the death penalty not only on the basis of what morva had done,but also on the probability that he might commit violent crimes in the future.
second,morva fails to show a reasonable likelihood that the evidence of his family history and the anecdotal evidence of his mental state had it been presented would have resulted in a life sentence.his argument regarding the probability of a different diagnosis is too speculative given the record and the lack of any support from the experts.see pooler sec y.dep t of,cir finding no d error with the state court determination that the defendant did not show prejudice because he failed to demonstrate that the experts would have changed their opinions had they conducted more psychological evaluations or been provided with his records quoting pooler state,so d,per curiam roberts dretke,cir finding that the prisoner failed to establish strickland prejudice in part because there is no evidence in the record suggesting that the expert would change the psychiatric diagnosis in his report based on a review of roberts undisclosed medical records 
further,the record lacks the alleged red flags that would have point ed the experts to a more serious mental illness.appellant br.at quoting rompilla beard,d.cohen thoroughly explained the eight out of nine symptoms indicative of schizotypal personal
