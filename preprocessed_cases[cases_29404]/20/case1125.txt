carlton turner applies for a certificate of appealability coa from the denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.because he can not make a substantial showing of the denial of a federal constitutional right,we deny a coa.
the evidence presented at trial established that turner shot and killed his parents in their home and placed the bodies in the garage.he confessed,and his claim of contradicted previous claims that he had nothing to do with the murders.a jury found him guilty of capital murder and sentenced him to death.
during voir dire,the prosecutor discussed with prospective jurors the issue of parole eligibility.during interviews with at least six prospects,after stating that the court would not allow the jury to consider parole eligibility in deciding punishment,the prosecutor speculated that parole consideration was barred because the legislature could change the parole laws at any time,thereby making it inapplicable to turner.the prosecutor went on to attest that he had seen several parole law changes during his tenure.turner trial counsel did not object.
in the sentencing phase,the court instructed the jury that texas parole law required turner to serve at least forty years before being eligible for parole,but that the jury was not to consider turner parole eligibility in determining his sentence.the court did not speculate on whether the parole law might change.
turner conviction was affirmed on direct appeal.turner state,cert.denied,d.turner timely filed a state petition for writ of habeas corpus.deciding that a hearing was unnecessary,the state habeas court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law recommending that all relief be denied.the texas court of criminal appeals denied relief in an unpublished order based on those findings and conclusions and its own review of the record.ex parte turner.turner filed a federal habeas petition based on seven grounds,including that the prosecutor comments violated his rights under the sixth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments.the district court rejected turner constitutional claims and declined to grant a coa.
on appeal,turner raises all seven issues asserted in the district court,seeking a coa first,he claims he was denied his right to a fair and impartial trial by the prosecutor statements.second,he claims that he was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel when his lawyer failed to object to the prosecutor statements during voir dire.third,he claims that the court instructions to the jury that it was not to consider parole eligibility deprived him of his right to a fair trial.fourth,he asserts that the court instructions at sentencing contained vague and undefined terms that violated his right to a fair trial.fifth,he claims that the texas death penalty statute violates his right to a fair trial by not informing jurors that failure to reach a unanimous verdict on any issue will lead to life imprisonment.sixth,he claims that the dallas county venire selection process violates his right to an impartial jury containing a representative of the community.seventh,he asserts that the cumulative effect of these violations denied him due process.
in ruling on a request for a coa,we are constrained by statute.absent a coa,we have no jurisdiction to entertain the merits of turner claims on appeal.cockrell,d.under the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,a petitioner must show that the state court resolution of his case was either contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d to grant a coa,we need not decide the ultimate merits of the underlying issue in the petitioner favor,but rather we ask only whether he has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.id.c.
a petitioner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court resolution of his constitutional claim or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further,at.our role is to determine not whether turner is entitled to relief,but whether the district court conclusion that the state court adjudication was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law is one about which jurists of reason could disagree or as to which jurists could conclude that the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.
turner argues that the prosecutor statements to jurors during voir suggested that turner might not serve forty years before becoming eligible for a violation of his rights under the due process clause of the fifth amendment.he relies on simmons south carolina,d,in which the court ruled that due process affords a criminal defendant the right to answer future dangerousness allegations by asserting that he will not be eligible for parole.turner asserts that simmons recognizes a due process right to provide the jury with accurate information regarding parole eligibility,which can not be undermined by inaccurate information from the state.
the district court rejected turner claim,noting that the state habeas court had found that the factual basis for the claim was incorrect.the state habeas court found that the prosecution statements actually reinforced the instruction that turner would serve at least forty years,and that the prosecutor confirmed to the jurors that the minimum period applied.state hab.find.on habeas review,federal courts must presume that the state court factual findings are correct,and turner has not attempted to present clear and convincing evidence that the findings were erroneous alternatively,the district court noted that the state habeas court had concluded that simmons applies only in situations in which a defendant is statutorily ineligible for parole,and the district court found that this conclusion was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.
in simmons,a majority,in two separate plurality opinions,held that a defendant must be allowed to rebut a state showing of future dangerousness with accurate information regarding his ineligibility for parole,at least where the only alternative sentence is life without parole.see simmons,at.id.at,concurring in the judgment.three of the seven justices who concurred in the judgment noted,however,that the state may also though it need not inform the jury of any truthful information regarding the availability of commutation,pardon,and the like.see id.at,concurring in the judgment.
several years later the court revisited the issue in the context of a defendant who was eligible for parole at the time of sentencing.in ramdass angelone,d,a majority,in two plurality opinions,concurred in the judgment that simmons applies only where there is no possibility of parole if the jury decides the appropriate sentence is life in prison.id.at.id.at,concurring in the judgment.thus,the current state of federal law as elaborated by the supreme court is that due process requires a jury to be able to consider a defendant parole eligibility only where the alternative punishment is life without parole.
the state court found that turner argument was not factually correct and that the prosecutor statement that the law might change merely confirmed the trial court instruction that turner would not be released for forty years.because turner has not demonstrated that this factual finding is clearly erroneous,we deny a coa.
alternatively,even if turner could show that the state court finding was erroneous,he would need to demonstrate that the state court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.as discussed above,under the supreme court precedents,a defendant has a due process right to present parole eligibility to the jury only where he is not eligible for parole at the time of sentencing.the court intended to limit simmons application
