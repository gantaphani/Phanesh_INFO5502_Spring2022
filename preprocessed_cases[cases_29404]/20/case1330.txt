the jury that convicted richard hodgson of attempted murder never heard the testimony of an eyewitness,virginia smith,who would have stated that,as she stood a few feet away from hodgson during the shooting for which he was charged,she could see his hands and could confirm that he did not draw a gun.the state has conceded in this court,moreover,that hodgson trial counsel knew that smith would testify to that effect if called.we therefore agree with the district court that hodgson received ineffective assistance of counsel,and that the state court contrary conclusion involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.d.
late at night on april,alicia hernandez and scott anderson were shot as they stood outside a home in southwest detroit.hernandez was hit once in the leg,and anderson was hit three times,with one bullet grazing his temple.
within a month,the state of michigan charged hodgson with the attempted murders and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a felony.at hodgson trial,in november,both hernandez and anderson implicated him as the shooter.hernandez,who was years old at the time of the shooting,testified that she had been standing outside with several other people when hodgson and several of his friends walked down the street.hodgson asked her where he could find her brother,lorenzo hernandez,with whom he had fought previously.when she refused to tell him,the two began to argue.at that point,she heard someone yell,shoot the bitch,and saw hodgson pull a gun from his waistband.she turned to run,but after a few steps she was shot in the leg and fell to the ground.all told,she heard roughly ten shots.hernandez testified that,although she did not actually see hodgson fire the shots because her back was turned,the shots had come from the direction where hodgson was standing.
anderson account was similar.he testified that hodgson arrived with three or four other men and began arguing with hernandez.hodgson said,shoot the bitch,and then pulled a pistol from his waistband.anderson turned and ran,but was quickly hit with three bullets.he estimated that he heard or shots in all.like hernandez,anderson testified that he did not actually see hodgson fire the shots.he added that he could not say whether the bullets had come from the direction where hodgson was standing,because his back was turned when the shots were fired.
thomas anderson,scott anderson brother,corroborated the two victims accounts.he testified that he was standing near his brother when he observed hernandez and hodgson arguing,and then saw hodgson pull a gun from his waistband.he further testified that,although he was running away from hodgson when the shots rang out,he could tell that the shots came from the direction where hodgson was standing.
ubaldo mendoza,hernandez father,testified that he later overheard hodgson talking about the shooting as he waited in a office.mendoza testified that hodgson,who was unaware that mendoza was hernandez father,said that he had been looking for hernandez brother and became angry when hernandez refused to divulge her brother location.mendoza recounted that hodgson said that someone in the crowd had yelled,just shoot the bitch,and that he then shot hernandez in the leg in order to scare her.hodgson added that he had shot someone else as well.
veronica adamson,who was a friend of hernandez at the time of the shooting but had fallen out with her by the time of the trial,testified that she had observed the shooting from across the street.she testified that she heard the gunshots but could not see whether anyone had a gun.she also testified that she had heard someone say,shoot the bitch,but could not identify who said it.adamson conceded that she had told the police that she heard hodgson say,shoot the bitch,and had seen him shoot a pistol.she testified,however,that she had lied to the police in order to help hernandez.she also testified that she lied to the police by telling them that she had heard hodgson group bragging to one another after the shooting by the time of the trial,she was not sure what she had heard.adamson acknowledged that she was acquainted with hodgson and was friends with a few of his friends,and that her friendship with hernandez had soured after the shooting.
one prosecution witness,robert singleton,offered the defense some support.singleton testified that on the night of the shooting he was sitting in a car parked two or three houses down the street from the one that hernandez was standing in front of.he saw hodgson and five or six of his friends walk by,and saw hodgson begin to argue with hernandez.he testified that he heard someone say shoot this bitch.at that point,someone came out from the side of the house singleton was parked in front of.singleton heard two or three gunshots,and when he looked to the side he saw someone dressed in black shooting a firearm.singleton then ducked down,but he estimated that he heard four or five shots total.singleton said that he did not see hodgson shoot anyone.singleton testified that all of the shots sounded the same,but he conceded that he had previously told the police that it sounded like more than one gun was being fired.he also testified that he did not hear who had said,shoot the bitch,but acknowledged that he had told the police that hodgson had said it.he attributed the inconsistency to having overheard other witnesses saying that hodgson had said,shoot the bitch.finally,singleton testified that he did not see hodgson shoot anyone.
after presenting these witnesses,the prosecution asked the defense to waive the presentation of the remaining witnesses from the prosecution witness list.the defense agreed,with the exception of virginia smith,a witness who had appeared for the first day of trial but was absent on the second.the judge issued a bench warrant for smith,but she was not located.hodgson counsel did not seek an adjournment,and the defense did not offer any witnesses.
defense counsel closing argument focused on the physical evidence,which offered some support for singleton account of the shooting.police officers found five shell casings from a handgun four houses down the street from where hernandez and anderson were is,roughly where singleton had testified he saw a shooter.no shell casings were found in the area where hodgson stood during the shooting.
the prosecution closing argument urged the jury to find that hodgson had fired the shots at hernandez and anderson.the prosecutor acknowledged that the jury could find that shots had been fired from down the street,but he stressed that several witnesses had remembered hearing ten shots,and that only five casings were recovered from down the street.he also urged the jury to convict on an theory,arguing that hodgson had encouraged the other shooter,either by yelling,shoot the bitch,or by drawing his own pistol.
the jury convicted hodgson on all charges.the trial court sentenced him to a total term of to years imprisonment.
during his direct appeal to the michigan court of appeals,hodgson raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,arguing that counsel had erred by failing to locate and present several exculpatory witnesses.as a result,the court of appeals remanded the case to the trial court for evidentiary hearings pursuant to people ginther.
accordingly,between january and may,the trial court held five hearings at which hodgson presented evidence from several new witnesses.as a general matter,much of the new evidence presented at the hearings tended to implicate another man,robert wyatt,as the shooter.wyatt apparently ran in the same circles as hodgson.he died in february hodgson trial but before the evidentiary hearings.
several of the witnesses at the,henry fields,edwardo hinton,and his brother michael friends of hodgson who had congregated on the night of the shooting at a nearby house,as part of a group that included hodgson and wyatt.fields testified that hodgson left the group to serve legal papers on hernandez aunt,who was the mother of his child,and to confront hernandez brother.fields testified that he followed hodgson around the corner with wyatt,whom he had seen shooting a pistol earlier in the evening.they stopped several houses away from where hernandez and hodgson were arguing.wyatt then pulled out his pistol and fired between four and six shots in the direction of hernandez and hodgson.fields testified that he went to jail two days after the shooting and was not contacted by hodgson trial counsel.he also stated that he would have testified at hodgson trial had he been asked.
edwardo hinton testified that he was part of a group of friends who accompanied hodgson to the site of the shooting.he testified that he could see that hodgson was not armed when the shots were fired.as hinton ran away,he encountered wyatt holding a gun in his hand.hinton also testified that he had seen wyatt with a gun earlier in the evening.hinton testified that he did not come forward with this information prior to trial because he was incarcerated shortly after the shooting.he indicated,however,that he would have testified had he been asked.michael hinton testified that he saw wyatt with a gun in his pocket after the shooting,and that he had seen wyatt with a gun earlier in the evening.he also testified that,earlier in the evening,wyatt had said that he planned to do something.
another witness,joseph probe,recounted a car ride with wyatt in july.during that car ride,probe testified,wyatt admitted that he had fired shots into the crowd that had gathered around hodgson,because he thought that hodgson was in danger.wyatt then asked probe to pressure witnesses not to testify at hodgson trial,because he feared that they might implicate him in the shooting.probe also testified that he left the state a few days after his conversation with wyatt,because he had violated the conditions of his parole.he did not go to the police or tell hodgson about his conversation with wyatt.
hodgson also presented testimony from vicki close,an employee of the michigan department of corrections.she testified that,as part of her job,she had read mail sent to hodgson brother,michael,while he was incarcerated.she recounted reading two or three letters,signed by rob,in which the writer apologized that hodgson had been charged for a shooting that the writer had committed.close testified that the letters probably arrived in.
hodgson also called virginia smith,who had been designated as a prosecution witness at trial but failed to appear.smith testified that she was with a group of her friends,including hernandez,when hodgson arrived with a group of his friends.smith testified that when the shooting started she was roughly two feet away from hodgson.she could see his hands and she could see that he did not have a gun.smith testified that shots came from down the street.she also testified that she spoke with hernandez shortly after the shooting.according to smith,hernandez said that she was not sure who had shot her because she could not see.smith testified that she heard someone say,shoot this bitch,just after the shooting started.she explained that she missed the second day of hodgson trial because she had gotten drunk the night before and was too hung over to wake up the next morning.she stated that she was never contacted by hodgson trial counsel.
hodgson trial counsel,kerri mitchell,also testified.mitchell was unable to recall many details of his representation of hodgson.mitchell did recall having several conversations with hodgson about trial strategy and what witnesses to call,but could not remember any specific details of those conversations.he had been unable to review the record to refresh his recollection,because he had given his case file to another lawyer after hodgson conviction.he suggested that hodgson himself might have had a better memory of those conversations.
the trial court rejected hodgson claim.the court found that hodgson had not demonstrated that mitchell knew about the witnesses about whose omission he complained,or that mitchell could have located the witnesses through reasonable efforts.the court noted that hodgson had presented no evidence that he had given mitchell the names of any of the eyewitnesses.the court also noted that several of the witnesses were incarcerated during the trial,that one had fled the state as a result of a parole violation,and that some might have been afraid to come forward.the only exception was virginia smith,who had been named as a prosecution witness.but the court reasoned that mitchell could not be blamed for failing to call smith,because she had absented herself from the trial.and as to mitchell trial strategy,the court concluded that mitchell had made a reasonable choice to focus his arguments on the physical evidence.
the michigan court of appeals affirmed in february.with regard to hodgson claim,the court reasoned that the record is devoid of any evidence that mitchell was made aware of or could have discovered the witnesses who would have allegedly identified wyatt as the shooter.the court also concluded that mitchell had followed a reasonable strategy in focusing on the physical evidence.the court further held that mitchell was not to blame for failing to present virginia smith testimony at trial,because she failed to appear after being subpoenaed.moreover,the court concluded,the absence of smith testimony was not prejudicial because it would have been cumulative of other testimony to the effect that hodgson did not have a gun.finally,the court rejected hodgson request for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.
one judge concurred in the judgment.she reasoned that the evidence produced at the evidentiary hearings would not have affected the outcome of hodgson trial,in light of the testimony at trial regarding the number of shots fired and the statements attributed to defendant and the fact that the case was submitted to the jury on an aiding and abetting theory in addition to the theory that hodgson was the shooter.
the michigan supreme court denied hodgson application for leave to appeal in december.
in october,hodgson filed a motion for relief from judgment with the state trial court.among other things,his motion sought to bolster his claim with additional evidence and to assert another claim for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.
with regard to his claim,hodgson proffered the affidavit of theresa,an eyewitness who had been interviewed by an investigator retained by hodgson appellate counsel in anticipation of the evidentiary hearings.in her statement to the investigator,explained that she was a friend of hodgson and that she had witnessed the shooting from a spot on the sidewalk near hernandez and anderson.according to,wyatt opened fire from down the street after daniel note,a member of hodgson group,had said to shoot the bitch.saw hodgson duck and run after the shooting began,and did not see him draw a gun.she recalled hearing approximately six to eight gunshots coming from down the street.in her statement,stated that she did not come forward during hodgson trial because she was afraid that wyatt would retaliate against her.after hodgson was convicted,however,she went to the police in an attempt to exonerate him.in her affidavit,added that she had contacted mitchell and expressed her willingness to testify on hodgson behalf,but that mitchell never contacted her about testifying.she also attested that she had moved away from michigan in october and thus had not known about the evidentiary hearings taking place in hodgson case.
hodgson proffered four other affidavits in support of his bid for a new trial.three deese,alma smith,and melissa claimed to have heard hernandez admit that hodgson had not shot her and that she had fabricated her trial testimony.the fourth that anderson had told her that he knew that hodgson had not done the shooting,but that he and others planned to identify hodgson as the shooter because they did not like him and hoped to get him out of the neighborhood.williams also attested that,after hodgson was convicted,wyatt twice admitted to her both that he was the shooter and that hodgson had been convicted for something hodgson did not do.
without holding an evidentiary hearing,the trial court d
