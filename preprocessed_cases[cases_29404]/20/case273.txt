on april,roy white white sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court for relief from his conviction in massachusetts state court for second degree murder.he now appeals the march,dismissal with prejudice of his habeas petition,as well as a september,order denying a motion for relief from the dismissal.in addition,he appeals two orders by the district court,issued on september,and may,each denying a motion for reconsideration.we hold that we do not have jurisdiction to consider the dismissal of white habeas petition,and we affirm on the merits the order denying relief from the dismissal as well as the orders denying white two motions for reconsideration.
a.the dismissal of white habeas corpus petition 
following a conviction for second degree murder in massachusetts state court in,white was sentenced to life imprisonment.his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal.commonwealth white.after a failed attempt to obtain a new trial in state court,see commonwealth white,white filed a writ of habeas corpus in the district court on april,arguing that his murder conviction was obtained in violation of his constitutionally guaranteed right to due process of law because the jury had been given instructions in violation of sandstrom montana,d.on march,while his habeas petition was pending,white failed to return to prison from a furlough program and became a fugitive.on february,a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that white petition be dismissed with prejudice.white fair,doc,collings,mag.the magistrate judge based his determination on the fact that,as a fugitive from justice,the petitioner was not entitled to invoke the powers of the court.id.at see molinaro new jersey,d.
on march,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation and dismissed the petition.the district court did so by a handwritten note in the margin of the magistrate judge report,stating f or the compelling reasons stated in this report plaintiff petition is hereby dismissed.white fair,doc.march,note by wolf,hereinafter dismissal.the order was not set out on a separate document as required by rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.
white correspondence with the court 
subsequently,white was apprehended and returned to massachusetts in july.the parties disagree both as to whether white understood at the time of his that his habeas petition had been dismissed with prejudice and as to whether he took any action to try to revive the dismissed petition.white claims that he believed that his habeas claim had been put on hold pending exhaustion of state remedies and that,to that end,he filed a petition for rehearing,as well as later apparently a motion for a new trial,in state court.white also offered evidence to this effect for the first time only in a motion for he prepared and mailed a motion to vacate the order of dismissal of his habeas petition in august.
in any case,the parties agree that white corresponded with the district court in june and august of.on june,white sent a letter to district court judge andrew was not the judge who had dismissed his habeas him to instruct the clerk office to send him his file,so that he could submit appropriate motions to this court for review and disposition.in the same letter,white stated that he had serious reason to believe that fundamental constitutional rights are at stake in this case and that it should have not been dismissed with prejudice in the manner that it was.on june,white filed a motion with the district court,seeking to waive copying costs on certain documents.on august,white wrote again to judge caffrey,asking for a ruling on his motion to waive copying costs.he stated that t he requested documents are integral to new motions to this court that would seek a thorough reconsideration of this matter.the transferred record does not indicate what action,if any,was taken on white requests.in any event,white did not follow up his correspondence with the court with any motions or appeals.
white motion for relief from the dismissal 
it was not until april,that white filed a motion for relief from the dismissal pursuant to rules and of the federal rules of civil procedure.see rule,rules governing section cases in the united states district courts applying federal rules of civil procedure to habeas corpus actions.while recognizing that his motion was filed ten years after the last activity on his habeas action,white argued that the district court nevertheless had jurisdiction to review the dismissal of his habeas petition because no final judgment had been entered and the time for appeal had thereby not begun to run.white based this argument on the fact that the district court order dismissing his case had not been entered on a separate document.
on september,the district court denied white motion for relief from the order of dismissal.white fair,doc,wolf,hereinafter order.the court assumed,without finding,that no separate document had been filed dismissing white habeas petition.relying on bankers trust mallis,d,and wang laboratories,applied computer sciences,cir,the court nevertheless determined that it lacked jurisdiction to hear white motion,because the absence of a separate document did not affect the finality of the judgment and the parties had waived the separate document requirement where both had understood that final judgment had been entered.the court further reasoned that,even if it did have jurisdiction to reconsider its decision,it was inappropriate to do so given that the dismissal was a permissible and appropriate exercise of the court discretion,molinaro,at,and that the public interest would not be served when claims of unconstitutional conduct were reconsidered years after the events in question.
white motions for reconsideration 
white did not file a notice of appeal challenging the order,but instead filed a motion for reconsideration on october,hereinafter the first motion for reconsideration.he argued in this motion that,contrary to what the district court had found,he had not understood that the dismissal was final and therefore could not have waived the separate document requirement.the district court denied the motion.white fair,doc,wolf,hereinafter order.on october,white filed a motion to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal of the order to november,which was allowed by the court.he then filed a timely notice of appeal on november.
on the same day,white also filed a motion for reconsideration of the order hereinafter the second motion for reconsideration,claiming that evidence discovered since that order showed that in july or august of white had filed a motion to vacate the dismissal,counteracting any inference of waiver.on may,the district court denied white second motion for reconsideration.white fair,doc,may,wolf,hereinafter order.white timely appealed on june.we consolidated this appeal with white appeal of the denial of his first motion for reconsideration.
on appeal,white asks us to review the district court determinations in the dismissal,in the order denying relief from the dismissal and in the two orders denying white motions for reconsideration.on february,we asked white to show cause why we have jurisdiction to consider the dismissal and the order.we then determined on march,that the appeal could go forward because we had jurisdiction at least as to the denials of the motions for reconsideration.reserved for this panel was the question of whether jurisdiction exists to review the dismissal and the order we take up the relevant jurisdictional questions as we review each order.we hold that we do not have jurisdiction to review the dismissal,but find that white actions were sufficient to create jurisdiction as to the order.we nevertheless affirm the order on its merits,as well as affirm the denials of white motions for reconsideration.
a.the dismissal 
rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure provides that a notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.a motion for relief under rules or may toll the time for appeal until the entry of the order disposing that motion,but only if the motion is filed within days after the final judgment is entered.fed.a a stating that the time to file an appeal runs from the entry of the order disposing a rule motion if the rule motion was filed no later than days after the judgment was entered.b,e stating that a motion for a new trial or a motion to alter or amend judgment must be filed within days after entry of judgment.on its face,white appeal of the dismissal is thus untimely.as we have stated,white instead relies on rule separate document requirement to argue that his appeal is timely.although the lack of a separate document does not affect the finality of the judgment the final judgment must issue on a separate document before the time for appeal begins to run.
previously,we have announced a clear rule that waiver of the right to judgment entered on a separate document will be inferred where a party fails to act within three months of the court final order in a case.fiore.county cmty.mental health,cir en banc.in fiore,we held that the plain language of rule,as well as supreme court precedent in united states indrelunas,d,and bankers trust,d,dictated a mechanical application of the separate document requirement in all final orders.at.we nevertheless concluded that an inference of waiver was also permitted where the parties failed to take any action in the case for three months or more 
if we were to hold without qualification that a judgment is not final until the court issues a separate document,we would open up the possibility that long dormant cases could be revived years after the parties had considered them to be over.we hasten to shut off that prospect we believe it appropriate,absent exceptional circumstances,to infer waiver where a party fails to act within three months of the court last order in the case a party wishing to pursue an appeal and awaiting the separate document of judgment from the trial court can,and should,within that period file a motion for entry of judgment.this approach will guard against the loss of review for those actually desiring a timely appeal while preventing resurrection of litigation long treated as dead by the parties.
at internal citation omitted.white attempt to seek appellate review of the dismissal,coming fourteen years after final action on his habeas petition,is precisely the type of resurrection of litigation long treated as dead by the parties that we sought to prevent with our holding in fiore.
white nevertheless makes four arguments for why fiore should not govern this case.first,he argues that our decision in fiore the dismissal and therefore can not be applied retroactively to his delay in seeking an appeal of that order.this argument is without merit.even assuming that fiore does not apply to white delay from to,the year in which fiore was decided,white continued to let the case lie dormant another five years through,and only sought appellate review in.
second,white contends that fiore should not govern habeas cases,given the strong policy articulated by the supreme court in favor of reaching the merits of habeas corpus petitions.however,none of the cases cited by white to support this proposition speak to the situation we have here,which involves an apparent abandonment of the right to appeal a habeas petition denial.any preference for reaching the merits of a writ of habeas corpus goes to the question of whether or not the district court should have dismissed white original petition with prejudice.our focus here,however,is not the dismissal itself but the delay in appealing the dismissal.we see nothing in the precedent cited by white to convince us that a long delay in appealing the denial of a habeas petition should be excused on the grounds that the merits can not otherwise be reached.
third,white suggests that fiore is inconsistent with the policy and purposes of rule as articulated in the supreme court rulings.although white is not explicit in pointing us to the specific rulings he has in mind,we take him to be referring to indrelunas and bankers trust,both of which directed courts to apply mechanically the rule separate document requirement.bankers trust additionally found,as we acknowledged in fiore,at,that relaxing the technicality of the rule was permissible in circumstances where a separate document was not entered but appellant nonetheless filed a notice of appeal without objection from the appellee.at.interpreting bankers trust to permit relaxation of the separate document requirement only in circumstances where it would effectuate the right of appeal,several of our sister circuits have rejected the fiore approach as inconsistent with a mechanical application of rule.see hammack baroid,cir united states haynes,rubin schottenstein,zox dunn,cir en banc explaining that,on the rule question,the en banc court was convinced by panel reasoning in vacated rubin schottenstein,zox dunn,cir,which included a footnote rejecting the fiore waiver rule.
unlike our sister circuits,we do not take the position that indrelunas and bankers trust preclude all findings of waiver against the appealing party.we specifically stated so in fiore we see no conflict between this conclusion and supreme court precedent suggesting that rule s technical requirements should be relaxed only to assist an appeal,not to foreclose one.at.the separate document requirement was designed to assist a party actively seeking an appeal by eliminating confusion as to the definite date by which the party would have to file the notice of appeal.see bankers trust,at.stating that t he separate document requirement was thus intended to avoid the inequities that were inherent when a party appealed from a document or docket entry that appeared to be a final judgment of the district court only to have the appellate court announce later that an earlier document or entry had been the judgment its purpose was not to enable a party to appeal a decision years later,when that party had shown no inclination to do so in a timely fashion.we thus decline,especially in the context of a delay in appealing what was admittedly a final judgment,to revisit our holding that w hen a party allows a case to become dormant for a prolonged period of time,it is reasonable to presume that it views the case as over.fiore,at.see also falls stamping and welding int l union,united auto.workers,cir finding that,although facts were distinguishable,w hat can be extracted from bankers trust and applied here is the general principle that the requirements of rule may be waived under certain circumstances and that in determining the appropriateness of waiver,the court in bankers trust emphasized a application of rule rather than a technical application as long as no parties have been misled 
finally,white asserts that his actions following the dismissal evidence the fact that he intended all along to challenge the court order and therefore rebut any inference of waiver under fiore.we have already detailed the limited actions white took regarding his habeas petition following his capture and return to prison.we put aside for now white claim that he prepared and mailed a motion to vacate the dismissal in august of,as we find that his claim,introduced only in his second motion for reconsideration,is not admissible at this stage.see infra part d.as to the evidence that white corresponded with the district court in,we are unconvinced that his letters were sufficient to overcome an inference of waiver,especially when they were written some three years after the dismissal and were not followed up with any motions or appeals in federal court for another seven years.similarly,even if we credit white assertion that he initially thought he could revive his federal habeas petition only after exhausting his state remedies,he has provided no credible explanation for why he continued to delay seeking federal relief,even after this correspondence indicated an intention to do so.
moreover,whatever confusion white may have had as to the status of the dismissal,it did not stem from the fact that the judgment was not entered on a separate document.fiore holding was anchored in the broader principle that judgment on a
