in,cesar roberto fierro was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of nicolas castanon.the conviction was based,in part,on fierro written confession.before trial,fierro unsuccessfully sought to suppress the confession on the ground that it was obtained by holding his mother in a mexican jail until he admitted to the murder.after a direct appeal and after two petitions for relief,fierro filed a third petition in texas state court based on evidence that detective al medrano,the el paso police officer who obtained the confession from fierro,lied in his testimony during the suppression hearing.the state habeas court found that medrano had indeed presented materially false testimony,but the texas court of criminal appeals denied fierro petition because it found the false testimony harmless after receiving authorization from this court,fierro then filed a successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the western district of texas.the district court dismissed the petition because it was and,alternatively,because the factual predicate for the petition could have been discovered earlier through the exercise of due diligence.
the question we address here is whether the district court erred in holding that fierro successive habeas petition is barred by the statute of limitations under the and effective death penalty act aedpa,d.we conclude that the petition was filed outside the applicable statute of limitations.we further conclude that fierro has not demonstrated that equitable tolling of the limitations period is warranted in this case.accordingly,we affirm the district court dismissal of fierro petition 
although the facts of this case have been well documented during the course of the extensive proceedings in state and federal court,some background is required to place the issue before us in context.in,the state of texas charged petitioner cesar roberto fierro with the murder of nicolas castanon,an el paso taxicab driver,based on the statement of an alleged eyewitness.the eyewitness,geraldo olague,told the police that he and fierro were riding in castanon cab when fierro suddenly shot castanon in the back of the head.according to olague,fierro removed the body from the cab and took castanon watch and wallet.fierro and olague then drove the cab across the mexican border and abandoned it in juarez.
relying on olague statement,el paso police detective al medrano retrieved fierro from a nearby jail on august,and questioned him.while fierro was in police custody,he signed a statement in which he confessed to castanon murder.before his trial for capital murder,however,fierro moved to suppress the statement,arguing that he had confessed involuntarily.according to fierro testimony at the suppression hearing,medrano told fierro during the interrogation that mexican police had raided his mother residence in juarez that morning and had taken her and fierro into custody fierro also testified that medrano advised him that the police would detain his mother and in the juarez jail until he confessed to castanon murder.fierro thus asserted that he confessed to the murder only to secure the release of his mother and 
to refute fierro testimony,medrano testified at the suppression hearing that he was unaware of the arrest of fierro mother in juarez when he interrogated fierro thus,medrano asserted that he could not have told fierro about the raid on his mother house or about her detention in the juarez jail.medrano conceded that he met juarez police commandante jorge palacios for breakfast on the morning of the raid,but medrano maintained that palacios told him only where fierro could be found.
accepting medrano account,the trial court rejected fierro argument that his confession was involuntary and admitted the confession into evidence at trial.based on fierro confession and olague eyewitness testimony,a jury convicted fierro of castanon murder and sentenced him to death in february.on direct appeal,the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed the trial court ruling on the voluntariness of fierro confession.see texas fierro.represented by his appellate counsel,fierro raised the same claim concerning the voluntariness of his confession in a petition for relief in state court and in his first federal habeas petition.relying primarily on the trial court credibility determinations during the suppression hearing,the state habeas court,the texas court of criminal appeals,the federal habeas court,and this court rejected fierro claim.see fierro lynaugh,cir,cert.denied sub nom fierro collins,d.
in,fierro retained new counsel and filed a petition for relief in state court based on the discovery of new evidence relating to the voluntariness of his confession during the evidentiary hearing in the state habeas court,fierro presented a police in the el paso police investigative was completed by detective medrano on august,the report documents a telephone conversation between medrano and palacios at that morning in which palacios stated that they had raided the house of fierro parents this morning and had in custody the mother of the suspect,cesar fierro,her name being socorro reyna,and her common law husband,alfredo murga.according to the report,palacios also told medrano that fierro was then in custody in an el paso jail 
based on this evidence,the state habeas trial court found that medrano testimony at the suppression hearing regarding the nature and extent of cooperation between the el paso police and the juarez police in this case was false and that medrano did have information that the defendant mother and had been taken into custody by the juarez police with the intent of holding them in order to coerce a confession from the defendant.the court concluded t hat there is a strong lik e lihood that the defendant confession was coerced by the actions of the juarez police and by the knowledge and acq u iescence of those actions b y medrano.the court therefore recommended a new trial.
the texas court of criminal appeals adopted the state habeas court factual findings and agreed that fierro due process rights were violated by medrano perjured testimony.ex parte fierro,cert.denied,d.a majority of the court nevertheless denied fierro relief because,given olague testimony and the lack of any real reason to doubt his credibility,it is more probable than not that the outcome of applicant trial would have been the same absent the confession.id.at.
after an unsuccessful petition for certiorari in the supreme court,fierro filed a motion in this court on october,seeking a stay of his execution and authorization to file a successive habeas petition.the panel granted the motion on november,but fierro did not file his habeas petition in the district court until february.the district court accepted the state habeas court findings of fact concerning medrano false testimony at the suppression hearing but ultimately dismissed fierro petition as barred by the statute of limitations governing successive petitions under the aedpa.alternatively,the district court dismissed the petition because the factual predicate for the perjury claim could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence at trial.on may,the district court granted fierro a certificate of appealability on both of these issues.
the sole issue that we address in this appeal is whether fierro successive habeas petition is barred by the statute of limitations established under the aedpa.the state contends that the statute of limitations expired no later than november,and that fierro february,petition is therefore untimely.fierro maintains that his petition was timely for two reasons.first,fierro argues that he satisfied the aedpa statute of limitations by filing a motion for authorization in this included the essential elements of his habeas one year of the final judgment on his state petition.second,fierro argues that the limitations period should be equitably tolled in this case because it would be an indefensible sort of entrapment to bar a petition filed in accordance with a scheduling order issued by the district court at the state request.
agreeing with the state,the district court dismissed fierro petition as barred by the statute of limitations because it found absolutely nothing that would excuse the untimely filing.we review de novo the district court dismissal of a habeas petition on procedural grounds.see emerson johnson,cir.we review the district court denial of equitable tolling for an abuse of discretion.see molo johnson,cir.
the initial question here is whether fierro has actually met the time requirements of the applicable statute of limitations.under the aedpa,state prisoners have one year in which to file petitions for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.see d.where a petitioner state court conviction became final before the enactment of the aedpa,the statute of limitations begins to run on the date of the aedpa is,april.see united states flores,cir.in the present case,fierro murder conviction became final in,well before the aedpa was enacted.thus,the aedpa statute of limitations began to run with respect to fierro instant petition on april.because the statute is tolled during the pendency of state court petitions for relief,however,the statute did not begin to run on fierro petition until november,the date on which the judgment on his state habeas petition became final.see d.it follows that the limitations period expired on november,and that fierro february petition was filed outside this period.
fierro nevertheless contends that his petition is not barred.he argues that his october,motion in this court for authorization to file a successive habeas petition effectively initiated the federal habeas proceeding and thus satisfied the statute of that a habeas petition must be filed in the district court,not in the court of appeals.specifically,fierro argues that his motion for authorization should be deemed an application for a writ of habeas corpus that was filed within one year of the state court judgment because the motion is indistinguishable from and is an indivisible part of his habeas petition and the motion gave the state notice of the grounds for the petition.in this regard,fierro observes that the motion included all of the elements of a habeas petition required by rule c of the rules governing section cases,including a jurisdictional statement,a statement of facts,a statement of his claims,and legal authority supporting those claims.because fierro did not raise this argument in the district court,however,we review only for plain error.see lackey johnson,cir.
although this issue is one of first impression,both the language of the aedpa and analogous caselaw compel the conclusion that a motion for authorization to file a successive petition is not itself an application for a writ of habeas corpus.as a consequence,the filing of such a motion does not satisfy the statute of limitations under the aedpa.as an initial matter,the provision governing successive habeas petitions implicitly recognizes a distinction between a motion for authorization and an application for a writ of habeas corpus.specifically,b a establishes that before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court,the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.see also b c providing that a circuit court may authorize the filing of a second or successive application if the petitioner makes a showing that the relevant criteria are met.the statute thus clearly contemplates that the actual application will be filed in the district court rather than in the circuit court.indeed,the rules of appellate procedure explicitly require the petitioner to file an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court.see fed.a 
cases addressing whether the aedpa governs a particular petition have similarly concluded that a habeas case is pending only if an actual habeas petition has been filed in the district court.for example,we have held that the relevant date for determining the applicability of the aedpa to habeas corpus petitions is the date that the actual habeas corpus petition is filed.williams cain,cir emphasis added see also nobles johnson,same.in reaching this conclusion,we rejected the contention that a motion to stay execution or a motion to appoint counsel initiates a habeas corpus proceeding.see williams,at.although a motion for authorization to file a successive habeas petition may include a discussion of the merits of the underlying claims and other elements of an actual petition,the motion is not itself a petition,because it does not call for or even permit a decision on the merits.holman gilmore,cir discussing the status of a motion for appointment of counsel.like a motion for appointment of counsel,a motion for authorization is a prelude to a collateral attack but is not itself a collateral attack.id.at.
because fierro motion for authorization is merely a preliminary motion that does not itself initiate habeas proceedings,it can not satisfy the statute of limitations established under the aedpa.we therefore conclude that the district court did not err,much less plainly err,by holding that fierro filed his february habeas petition outside the limitations period 
fierro next argues that,even assuming his petition was filed outside the limitations period,the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled because both the parties and the district court initially operated under the assumption that the statute did not bar his petition.relatedly,fierro also argues that due process requires the enforcement of the district court scheduling order,which set the deadline for filing fierro petition outside the limitations period,because he relied on that order in filing his petition.the state responds that its request for the scheduling order was not based on the assumption,implicit or explicit,that fierro petition was timely.because fierro failure to file his petition within the limitations period was the result of his own legal error,we conclude that fierro has not demonstrated that the circumstances of this case are sufficiently exceptional to warrant equitable tolling.
we have recognized that the limitations period for filing habeas petitions established in d is not a jurisdictional bar and is therefore subject to equitable tolling.see davis johnson,cir.although equitable tolling is a discretionary doctrine that turns on the facts and circumstances of a particular case,we ordinarily draw on general principles to guide when equitable tolling is appropriate.fisher johnson,cir.as a general rule,equitable tolling operates only in rare and exceptional circumstances where it is necessary to preserve a plaintiff claims when strict application of the statute of limitations would be inequitable.davis,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.equitable tolling thus applies principally where the plaintiff is actively misled by the defendant about the cause of action or is prevented in some extraordinary way from asserting his rights.coleman johnson,cir citation omitted.as a consequence,neither excusable neglect nor ignorance of the law is sufficient to justify equitable tolling.id.
in united states patterson,cir,we applied equitable tolling because a district court order unintentionally misled the prisoner.in patterson,the district court granted a pro se prisoner request to dismiss his petition without prejudice over the government objection so that the prisoner could retain a lawyer.see id.observing that the prisoner and the district court apparently were under the mistaken impression that a later petition would not be time barred,we held that equitable tolling applied because the prisoner relied to his detriment on the district court decision to dismiss for the express purpose of allowing later refiling id.at.in contrast,we held in melancon kaylo,cir,that equitable tolling was not appropriate where a state court erroneously entered the return date for a pro se prisoner supervisory writ to the louisiana court of appeals because the prisoner then waited more than four months to file his federal habeas petition.id.
applying these principles to the present case,we conclude that equitable tolling is not appropriate becaus
