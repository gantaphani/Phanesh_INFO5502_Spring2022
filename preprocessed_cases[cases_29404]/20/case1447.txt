a jury convicted jasubhai desai of murder,and the trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment.in affirming his conviction,the michigan court of appeals rejected desai claim that the admission of a hearsay statement of a violated his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth and fourteenth amendment.in reviewing desai federal habeas application,the district court came to a contrary conclusion and ordered the state to release him from custody or grant him a new trial.
in defending the district court decision,desai does not claim that he is currently being held in custody in violation of the confrontation clause,given the twin realities that his statement was and that the clause does not apply to statements.see davis washington,d.he instead makes the following attack on his conviction.prong one the state courts unreasonably applied supreme court precedent at the time of his trial and during direct review,because the confrontation clause at that time covered statements,see ohio roberts,d,and the state courts misapplied roberts.prong two in accordance with the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa and teague lane,d,davis should not be applied retroactively to defeat his claim.because congress has given us authority to release from custody only inmates who are currently being held in violation of the constitution,because that is not the case with respect to desai and because neither aedpa nor teague otherwise advances desai application for relief,we reverse.
on november,james osborn,an officer with the woodhaven,michigan,police department found the lifeless body of anna marie turetzky in the front seat of a car in the parking lot of a best western motel.someone had strangled her.
in the early,turetzky began working as a nurse in a medical clinic with desai,a medical doctor.in or so,the two formed a partnership to build a clinic in trenton,michigan.as the office manager for the new clinic,turetzky recruited new patients,handled public relations,oversaw personnel and managed the clinic finances.by all accounts,the relationship between desai and turetzky,while financially beneficial,was strained and at times physically violent.in an effort to reduce the tension,turetzky agreed to work out of the trenton clinic,and desai agreed to work out of a new clinic the partnership opened in monroe,michigan.
the new arrangement apparently did not solve the problem,and the conflict,including physical threats and threats of litigation,continued.in september,desai and turetzky entered into an agreement in which desai agreed that he would repay his portion of the money that the partnership had borrowed from turetzky for the creation of the monroe clinic.turetzky was last seen alive on november.
in,after an initial investigation of the crime came up empty,lawrence gorski told woodhaven police officers that approximately six weeks after the murder,stephan adams,an employee in the medical clinic,told him that he murdered turetzky.after gorski testified in state grand jury proceedings and hearings in and,the wayne county prosecutor charged adams and desai on the theory that desai had hired adams to kill turetzky in order to become the sole owner of the businesses.
desai and adams were tried jointly in september before separate juries.during the trial,the juries heard about the rocky,and at times physically violent,relationship between desai and turetzky,the threats of litigation in early by desai to dissolve the partnership,an inquiry from desai to daniel landau less than one year before the murder about whether landau was interested in earning money as a hitman,ja,and adams confession to gorski.
the desai jury convicted him of murder,and the adams jury failed to reach a verdict.in view of the hung jury and in exchange for adams nolo contendere plea to the charge of solicitation to do great bodily harm in an unrelated case,the prosecution dismissed the remaining charges against adams and did not retry him.
the court sentenced desai to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.desai appealed to the michigan court of appeals,which affirmed his conviction,people desai,wl,at,and the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal,people desai.
on november,desai filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court challenging,among other aspects of the trial,the state court admission of the hearsay statement against him on the ground that it violated the confrontation clause.the court granted the petition for four related reasons adams statement amounted to hearsay because it was given to a friend the supreme court intervening decision,crawford washington,d,applied only to testimonial hearsay statements the supreme court decision in roberts remained the established law with respect to hearsay statements and the michigan state courts unreasonably applied roberts in permitting the government to introduce adams statement.
in all criminal prosecutions,the confrontation clause says,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.when desai objected to the admission of adams hearsay statement during the trial,supreme court precedent established that hearsay statements like adams implicated a defendant confrontation rights.see roberts,at.under the roberts test,adams hearsay statement,like an testimonial statement,could be admitted only if the individual was unavailable to testify and if the statement bore adequate indicia of reliability.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a statement possessed adequate indicia of reliability,the court explained,if it fit within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or if it offered other particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
roberts,however,is no longer good law in two respects.since desai trial,the court has overruled the roberts test for admitting testimonial hearsay,requiring the prosecution with a few historical exceptions not applicable here either to establish that the defendant has had a chance to confront the declarant or to forego relying on the statement at all.see crawford,at.and the confrontation clause no longer applies to statements.see davis,at.the second change in law,in particular,presents a challenge for desai petition.he concedes that adams statement,which was made to a friend gorski,amounts to a statement,see united states gibson,cir,and he concedes that the confrontation clause no longer applies to statements.all of which prompts this question may a habeas applicant obtain relief on the basis of a state court allegedly unreasonable application of a supreme court precedent roberts that no longer is good law see 
no,we conclude,for several reasons.first,before and since the passage of aedpa,the point of the great writ has been to release individuals from custody or other equivalent consequences of a conviction because they are currently being held in violation of their constitutional rights.as the first subsection of the statute says 
the supreme court,a justice thereof,a circuit judge,or a district court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.
a emphasis added.by its terms,relief thus is available only to state prisoners who currently are being held in violation of an existing constitutional right,not to inmates who at one point might have been able to show that a supreme court or lower court precedent would have granted them relief.the same is true with respect to the other statutory vehicle for challenging one custody by a c.the writ of habeas corpus,it says,shall not extend to a prisoner unless h e is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.
second,as a practical matter,correcting violations of extant constitutional standards is all that the statute ever could meaningfully require of a least when it comes to a constitutional challenge to the admission of evidence.even if desai could show that he is entitled to a new trial because the state courts misappli
