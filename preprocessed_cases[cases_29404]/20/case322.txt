in june,marcos poventud was convicted of attempted murder in the second degree,attempted robbery in the first degree,assault in the first degree,and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.he was sentenced to to years in prison.poventud ultimately succeeded in having his conviction vacated,but the prosecution appealed,and poventud was denied bail.rather than await a new trial in custody,poventud pled guilty to a lesser charge for which the penalty was a sentence a jail term that poventud had already served.
in may,poventud brought the instant action under,alleging brady violations against the officials who conducted his original investigation and prosecution.in july,poventud stayed this proceeding pending the outcome of a motion to invalidate his guilty plea.poventud later withdrew the state motion without prejudice and resumed this suit.in june,defendants moved for summary judgment.the district court batts,granted the motion in march,ruling that poventud claims are barred under heck humphrey,d.see poventud city of new york,civ.dab,wl,at.
we disagree.because poventud is no longer in custody,and therefore can no longer bring a federal habeas suit,heck narrow exception to otherwise broad coverage does not apply.poventud may bring suit under regardless of any defenses which might arise based on his subsequent guilty plea to the lesser charge.accordingly,we vacate the district court decision granting summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the parties dispute various points in the factual record.when,as here,we review a grant of summary judgment dismissing a complaint,we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all ambiguities in his favor.colavito organ donor network,cir.
in march,younis duopo was robbed and shot in the head or neck by two men sitting in the back seat of a livery cab that duopo was driving through the bronx.later,frankie rosado,a detective,found a wallet on the floor of the cab by the front passenger seat.somehow the nypd crime scene unit had missed the wallet.the wallet contained a pair of old photo cards belonging to francisco poventud,brother of the.when investigators showed duopo a photo array containing one of the photos of francisco poventud who allegedly looks nothing like his brother,duopo positively identified it as a picture of his assailant.at the time,however,francisco poventud was incarcerated and could not possibly have committed the crime.detectives then showed duopo photo arrays containing a picture of marcos poventud.only upon seeing marcos photo for the fourth time did duopo identify marcos as the shooter.marcos was arrested,identified by duopo at a,and indicted,along with a,robert maldonado,whom duopo also identified.investigators left no record of the false identification of francisco poventud they also did not disclose it to defense counsel or to the bronx county prosecutors and they did not preserve the photo array.
marcos poventud learned all of this only during the retrial of robert maldonado.in december,poventud filed a motion under to vacate his conviction on the ground that the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence.the new york supreme court for bronx county granted this motion in october.the prosecution filed a notice of appeal successfully argued that poventud be denied bail and offered him immediate release in exchange for a guilty plea to a,class e felony charge of attempted robbery.by this time,poventud had been incarcerated for nearly nine years.poventud testifies that during his imprisonment he endured gruesome and repetitive physical and sexual abuse that he attempted suicide and that he suffered from depression and stress disorder.in january,poventud accepted the terms of the plea bargain and went home.
poventud now contends that he was deceived into pleading guilty.he alleges that the assistant district attorney knew,but did not disclose,that the district attorney office had decided not to perfect its appeal.poventud alleges further that the ada withheld crucial information from the defense.when he learned of these omissions,poventud stayed the instant federal suit and moved in state court to have his guilty plea vacated as involuntarily given.the new york supreme court for bronx county granted an evidentiary hearing on the question of voluntariness,but poventud withdrew his motion without prejudice.he says he did this after learning that he had multiple myeloma,after nearly dying from kidney failure,and after undergoing bone and stem cell transplants and chemotherapy.poventud asserts that he thought the stress and infection risks of a new trial,together with the possibility,however remote,of returning to jail,would kill him.after withdrawing his state motion,poventud resumed this federal action under,in which he alleges violations of his federal due process and fair trial rights under brady maryland,d.he also sues the city of new york for failing properly to train its officers.
the district court found that,because plaintiff guilty plea was to conduct that necessarily required his presence at the scene of the crime,success on a claim arising out of the suppression of evidence relevant to his alleged misidentification would logically imply the invalidity of his guilty plea.poventud,wl,at.this being so,the court continued,poventud could survive summary judgment under heck only by showing that the challenged conviction has been reversed,expunged,invalidated,or called into question.id.poventud could do none of this,the court concluded,either as to his first conviction or to his guilty plea.moreover,poventud decision not to pursue in the state court an available remedy by which he could invalidate his guilty plea does not relieve him of his obligation to demonstrate its invalidity if he is to avoid the bar established in heck.id.at.the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review grants of summary judgment de novo.see anemone metro.transp,cir.
we conclude that heck does not bar poventud claims.under the law of this circuit,a plaintiff asserting the unconstitutionality of his conviction or incarceration must have access to a federal remedy.normally that remedy is through a action.if,however,the plaintiff is in custody,heck may apply and require that the plaintiff assert his claim first in a habeas petition.as poventud is no longer in custody,heck does not bar his claims under.the district court erred,then,in granting summary judgment against him on the basis of heck.the law of this circuit in this matter derives from the interplay of two supreme court decisions heck humphrey itself,and the subsequent spencer kemna,d.
heck and spencer 
the petitioner in heck was a state prisoner who sought relief under.earlier,heck had twice sought and failed to secure relief under the federal habeas statute.in upholding the dismissal of heck claims,the supreme court held that when the success of a claim would necessarily require the plaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of his conviction or confinement,the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal,expunged by executive order,declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination,or called into question by a federal court issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.heck,at.in other words,the court continued,
when a state prisoner seeks damages in a suit,the district court must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence if it would,the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.
id.at.this statement tracked the fact pattern in heck,which involved a state prisoner that is,someone still in custody.in a footnote,and in dicta,the court suggested,however,that the rule should similarly apply to plaintiffs no longer in custody we think the principle barring collateral attacks is not rendered inapplicable by the fortuity that a convicted criminal is no longer incarcerated.id.at.
in a concurrence,justice souter,joined by three colleagues,expressed reservations about denying relief to plaintiffs seeking damages under for unconstitutional convictions or imprisonment who,because they were no longer imprisoned,could have no relief under habeas.extending heck favorable termination requirement to plaintiffs not in custody,justice souter wrote,would deny any federal forum for claiming a deprivation of federal rights to those who can not first obtain a favorable state ruling.id.at souter,concurring.a better way to read the majority opinion is as saying nothing more than that now,after enactment of the habeas statute and because of it,prison inmates seeking damages must satisfy a requirement.id.emphasis added.
four years after heck,justice souter repeated these views in another concurrence.spencer,at souter,concurring.this time he was joined by four justices.three joined justice souter concurrence,which stated again in dicta,as the case ultimately turned on other grounds that a former prisoner,no longer in custody,may bring a action establishing the unconstitutionality of a conviction or confinement without being bound to satisfy a requirement that it would be impossible as a matter of law for him to satisfy.id.at and justice stevens,in dissent,went out of his way to adhere to justice souter position.id.at stevens,dissenting.
the law of the circuit 
our court has adopted justice souter dicta in spencer.in jenkins haubert,we reversed the dismissal of a former inmate challenge to the validity of two prison disciplinary hearings.cir.we held that a suit by a prisoner challenging the validity of a disciplinary or administrative sanction that does not affect the overall length of a prisoner confinement is not barred by heck.id.at.to hold otherwise,we noted,would contravene the pronouncement of five justices that some federal remedy either habeas corpus or must be available.id.emphasis added.in leather eyck,decided the same day as jenkins,we held that heck did not bar the suit of an arrestee who was convicted but fined rather than imprisoned for driving while impaired.cir.because leather is not and never was in the custody of the state,we explained,he,like jenkins,has no remedy in habeas corpus.having escaped the jaws of heck,leather should therefore be permitted to pursue his claim in the district court.id.at.
since jenkins and leather,we have repeatedly affirmed that heck requirement applies only to plaintiffs who are in custody,and that all other claimants those who have no remedy in habeas may pursue their claims under.see mckithen brown,cir over time,heck implicit exception to otherwise broad coverage has been carefully circumscribed.huang ex rel.yu johnson,cir in light of our holding in leather,and in light of the fact that the spencer concurrences and dissent revealed that five justices hold the view that,where federal habeas corpus is not available to address constitutional wrongs,must be,we conclude that huang section claim must be allowed to proceed.quoting jenkins,at green montgomery,cir we have held that heck acts only to bar suits when the plaintiff has a habeas corpus remedy available to him,when he is in state custody.because it does not appear that green is presently in state custody,his action is not barred by heck.internal citations omitted.
the facts in this case differ somewhat from the facts in the cases just cited,but not in a way that is material to the issue before us.after poventud original conviction was vacated,but before that vacatur was affirmed on appeal,poventud pled guilty to a lesser,related offense this fact,however,does not alter the underlying principle that a claimant who can not seek relief under habeas must be able to seek it under.poventud guilty plea may or may not supply defendants with a defense that no violation occurred.but it does not entitle them to summary judgment under heck.
to repeat,the law of this circuit makes clear that a plaintiff alleging civil rights violations in connection with his conviction or imprisonment must have access to a federal remedy either under habeas or under.because poventud is not in custody,he has no remedy under habeas.he must be able,therefore,to pursue relief under.
we would end here,but for the apocalyptic tone of the dissent,which requires a brief answer.among its many flaws are the following.
first.contrary to the dissent assertion,the majority does not rely principally on leather.it relies at least as much on jenkins.it does so because jenkins,an opinion written by judge walker and concurred in by judge miner and judge sack most clearly embraced,and most thoroughly recited the history behind,the proposition that we reaffirm today that some federal remedy either habeas corpus or must be available.at.to be sure,the panel in jenkins also had other grounds for its decision.id.we do not rest our holding solely on our tally of votes on the supreme court for justice souter view of heck.and it is true,as the dissent points out,that jenkins dealt with prison discipline rather than a conviction.but that,for purposes of the case before us,is a distinction without a difference.the court in jenkins did not limit its endorsement of justice souter position to the facts before it.it stated that endorsement as a general proposition and,having done so,made it one basis for its holding.
it is significant,moreover,that jenkins and leather which dealt with an actual criminal conviction,and not only with conditions of confinement came down the same day.as is well known,the normal practice,when two panels are dealing with closely related issues at the same time,is for the panels to communicate with each other to ensure,if at all possible,that the opinions are consistent.one can therefore assume that,together,jenkins and leather reflected the law of the circuit at the time,and that the law was,as jenkins stated it,that some federal remedy either habeas corpus or must be available.at.significantly,within a year,this view was affirmed again in green montgomery,which stated that heck acts only to bar suits when the plaintiff has a habeas corpus remedy available to him,when he is in state custody.at kearse,calabresi,katzmann.less than a year after green,this position was stated yet again in huang johnson.at in light of our holding in leather,and in light of both the spencer majority dictum and the fact that the spencer concurrences and dissent revealed that five justices hold the view that,where federal habeas corpus is not available to address constitutional wrongs,must be,jenkins,at,we conclude that huang section claim must be allowed to proceed.feinberg,winter,cabranes.
within a period of two years,then,four unanimous panels of the second circuit,including a majority of active judges sitting throughout that time affirmed the position of the circuit that heck bar on relief applies only when federal relief can be sought under habeas.these panels so ruled because,as the jenkins court noted,to do otherwise would contravene the pronouncement of five justices that some federal remedy either habeas corpus or must be available.at.and this is the principle the majority follows today.indeed,this position is so clearly the current law of the circuit that the majority considered this case a candidate for disposition by summary order on this ground only,rather than on the alternate ground discussed below.
second.the dissent suggests,nonetheless,that jenkins,leather,green,and huang and the judges who participated in those three decisions flew in the face of a supreme court holding that remained the law despite subsequent supreme court dicta to the contrary.if that were true,these opinions would have been wrong and one would have expected that fact to have been raised at the time.the supreme court in heck decided a case in which habeas was available.in dicta,in a footnote,which was completely unnecessary to the decision in heck,there is language suggesting that the holding might well be extended to a future case where habeas was not available.heck,at.it was to distance himself from this dicta that justice souter wrote his concurrence.and,when one of the justices who had joined the heck footnote changed her mind,see spencer,at ginsburg,concurring,it became clear that the heck dicta no longer commanded the support of a majority of supreme court justices.
in such circumstances,where there is no supreme court holding in one direction,and there are powerful statements by a majority of the justices in an opposite direction it is perfectly appropriate though not required for a lower court to embrace the position adopted albeit in dicta by that majority.this is precisely what the panels in jenkins,leather,green,and huang did.
third.the dissent claims that in doing this,the jenkins,leather,green,and huang courts improperly altered the law of the circuit without going in banc.there is no need,however,to discuss today what the circuit law was before the supreme court decided heck and spencer.for,even assuming,very much,arguendo that the dissenter is correct as to our circuit law it is readily accepted that a panel of this court may depart from a prior decision when that earlier decision rationale is overruled,implicitly or expressly,by the supreme court.in re sokolowski,cir per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.as far as we can determine,our court has not clearly decided whether such undermining must happen in a holding by the supreme court,or whether clear dicta also suffices in any event,had anyone cared to disagree with jenkins or leather or green or huang on the ground that they deviated from prior holdings,the time to say so was when those four cases were decided.accordingly,one would have expected a request for in banc reconsideration at that time.there was no such request,which comes as no surprise given the unanimity of support in those cases for the position we reaffirm today.the dissenter obviously disagrees,as is his right,with the position our court then took.but,given those holdings,we would think it preferable for the dissent to state that disagreement by concurring in today result and expressing distaste for the settled law that requires such a concurrence.
fourth.quite apart from whether the absence of habeas,by itself,means that a action may lie,the dissent is incorrect in its statement that this action calls into question poventud second conviction.it does nothing of the sort.it asserts that his constitutional rights were violated by the state through a brady violation.under heck,this could not have been brought up prior to the quashing of his first conviction because a finding of a brady violation would undercut that conviction.but once that conviction was quashed,the brady violation if one were established,and if it injured poventud would constitute an independent infringement of poventud constitutional rights,regardless of his subsequent conviction.
to give a dramatic example suppose a defendant is tortured viciously,confesses,and is convicted on the basis of that confession.under heck,he can not,while in jail on that conviction,bring a action for being tortured because that would undercut the conviction.but once his conviction is quashed through habeas or in other ways,he is free to assert that he was tortured and seek a remedy.does the dissent really believe that this becomes less true if that defendant later freely confesses,even to the same crime at that point,the claim for damages for torture in no way undercuts the second,and only existing,conviction and hence is in no way barred by heck.
at core,this is what poventud claims today.he seeks damages for the harm caused by a brady violation in connection with his first invalidated conviction he makes no claims at all with respect to his second outstanding conviction.see appellant br.seeking damages only for punishment he suffered in excess of the imprisonment he accepted as part of his plea,the lawsuit,if successful,would not be inconsistent with that plea.as noted earlier,whether there was such a violation,and whether there were such damages,will be determined in a trial.but whatever the result of that trial,poventud subsequent guilty plea is not undermined by his action.
finally,the dissent makes the extraordinary argument that habeas might be available to poventud because his inability to bring a action alone may constitute a collateral consequence sufficient to overcome a mootness challenge and support a habeas petition.this argument,which has not been made by anyone in this case,is circular.it posits a result the unavailability of relief and on the basis of that result creates the premise for that result.it is,in short,absolutely ptolemaic in the uselessness of its epicycles.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the district court judgment and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
marcos poventud new york state conviction for holding up a driver was vacated by the courts of new york on a brady violation,and he was released from custody in after pleading guilty on lesser charges to the same at the same place and time,on the same date.he has sued prosecutors and police,under,for achieving his conviction for a crime that he committed as he has conceded under oath and in open court.the united states district court for the southern district of new york batts,dismissed the complaint on the ground that,under heck humphrey,d,he can not sue under unless the conviction has been overturned.i would affirm.the only errors in this case have been introduced on appeal.
the majority holds that heck is no bar to a civil suit once the sentence has been served,regardless of whether the conviction was overturned.the majority relies on a concurrence in heck and dicta in other supreme court cases,and on second circuit case law that has accrued along these lines.
i respectfully dissent.my objection goes deep,to the root of the error in second circuit cases that prefer dicta in heck to its holding a holding that confirmed longstanding second circuit law.as the majority opinion states,concurrences in heck and spencer kemna,d posited the idea that heck might not bar a civil claim for damages notwithstanding that the claim necessarily called into question an undisturbed criminal conviction,if habeas is unavailable to challenge the conviction under the federal constitution.spencer precipitated a circuit split,with some circuits recognizing a few narrow exceptions to heck,and others countenancing no exception at all.the majority opinion follows and extends a line of cases in this circuit that can not be located on either side of that circuit split.the majority opinion holds that heck is a bar to suit under only until the convict is released from custody because habeas is no longer available to a person at liberty and this stretch is widened to discount a plea of guilt to lesser charges on the same crime.
the majority opinion thus places at risk of constitutional litigation for decades prosecutors and police who obtained convictions of persons who indisputably or even admittedly committed the crimes charged.
i would affirm the district court judgment.the unconstitutional conduct for which poventud seeks damages is the failure to disclose the identification of another person as having committed the crime.the premise of that claim that poventud was denied the opportunity to effectively challenge his identification as the perpetrator necessarily implies the invalidity of the unchallenged,subsisting conviction that was entered on poventud plea of guilty to that crime.heck therefore bars poventud from asserting his claim.
in,a jury convicted poventud of attempted murder in the second degree,attempted robbery in the first degree,and criminal possession of a weapon in the first degree,in connection with the armed robbery and shooting of younis duopo as he was driving a livery cab.the time and place were approximately on march,between oliver place and marion avenue in the bronx.the conviction and the to year sentence were affirmed on appeal.see people poventud,dep t.
in,the new york supreme court,bronx county,vacated the conviction and ordered a on the ground that the prosecution had withheld potentially exculpatory evidence.this ruling was highly solicitous of poventud rights in fact,the evidence withheld might as easily be viewed as inculpatory.
after the,photo id of poventud brother francisco was found in a wallet in duopo vehicle.when shown the photograph of francisco,duopo opined that it looks like the perpetrator,or looks a lot like him.a.the majority calls this a positive identification see op.at.after it was ascertained that francisco was and had been in prison,duopo positively identified marcos poventud,as he later did in a and for a third time in the courtroom.a.the state court ordered a on the ground that brady was violated by the state failure to disclose duopo observation that francisco photo resembled the perpetrator.see people poventud,misc d.
poventud claims that he looks nothing like his own brother which would certainly make duopo observation uncanny,and that it is just one of those coincidences that his jailed brother photo id was left at the scene of the crime.
poventud had the opportunity to test those explanations before a jury on retrial.instead,poventud pled guilty to attempted robbery in the third degree.at his hearing,he admitted to holding up duopo as he was driving a livery cab at approximately on march,between oliver place and marion avenue in the bronx.the plea colloquy thus resolved the issue duopo identification of poventud was sound.a.poventud was to one year in prison and,because he had already served nine years,was released.
upon release from prison,poventud filed a motion challenging the voluntariness of his plea,but later withdrew the motion.he then filed this damages action under alleging that the prosecution brady violation deprived him of a fair trial.see brady maryland,d.judge batts ruled that poventud claims were barred by heck humphrey,d,and dismissed the case.see poventud city of,civ.dab,wl,at.
even before heck,our circuit like many others barred claims that necessarily implied the invalidity of outstanding convictions and did so regardless of whether the plaintiff remained in jail.the seminal case was cameron fogarty,cir,which explained why a plaintiff outstanding conviction for possession of stolen property barred his damages action for false arrest under the rule,equally applicable to actions asserting false arrest,false imprisonment,or malicious prosecution,was and is that the plaintiff can under no circumstances recover if he was convicted of the offense for which he was arrested.id.at emphasis added.cameron extended that principle to actions,observing the right to bring suit under is designed both to allow an injured person to obtain compensation for the loss of his civil rights and to deter public officials from further violation of such rights.at.yet,neither interest is more than minimally implicated where the claimant was convicted.see also singleton city of,cir dismissing malicious prosecution claim brought under on the same grounds.
the rule was given broad application.in roesch otarola,cir,we explained that a plaintiff who seeks to challenge his conviction must pursue the criminal case to an acquittal or an unqualified dismissal,or else waive his section claim.id.at.we later held that this bar applied to brady violations,amaker weiner,cir,as well as related claims under,and,id.at and,as discussed infra at,several courts in this circuit have held and we have affirmed that the bar applies even if the subsequent guilty plea is to a lesser charge.see mcneill people of city state,cv ngg,wl,at,summarily aff,app x cir papeskov brown,civ.ss,wl,at june,sotomayor,summarily aff,cir see also stein cnty.of westchester,d.
none of these cases turned on whether the plaintiff was incarcerated or at liberty when suit was filed,or suggested that this consideration had any weight or bearing.in most of these cases,the plaintiff was not in custody.see,roesch,at singleton,at mcneill,wl,at papeskov,wl,at stein,d at.
these decisions consistently and methodically applied the rule that plaintiffs may not use to call into question an outstanding criminal conviction,a rule that avoided the prospect of harassment,waste and endless litigation,contrary to principles of federalism.singleton city of,cir.
the majority relies on leather ten eyck,cir calabresi,and cases that cited or followed it but these cases could not have undone the law of this court without review in banc see united states king,cir.in any event,our circuit law,as it was settled before leather,was validated and confirmed by the supreme court in heck humphrey,d.while heck was serving a sentence for voluntary manslaughter and his direct appeal was still pending,he brought a action alleging that prosecutors and police officers had destroyed exculpatory evidence.id.at.the supreme court affirmed the dismissal of the claim because civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments,and because success on the plaintiff claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence.id.at.to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment,a plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal,expunged by executive order,declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination,or called into question by a federal court issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.id.
this requirement is animated by the values of finality and consistency,and a strong judicial policy against the creation of two conflicting resolutions arising out of the same or identical transaction.id.at citation and quotation marks omitted.heck,which strengthened and validated our existing precedent,remains the rule until if ever the supreme court alters its holding.
a circuit split has opened as to whether some exceptions to heck may be permitted on the basis of dicta signed by five justices three of whom are no longer on the court.the majority opinion patches together the various concurrences and passages of dicta,identifying the justices some active,some retired who wrote or signed the opinions.see op.at discussing spencer kemna,d souter,concurring.in a nutshell,these justices posited that a former prisoner,no longer in custody,may bring a action establishing the unconstitutionality of a conviction or confinement without being bound to satisfy a requirement that it would be impossible as a matter of law for him to satisfy.spencer,at souter,concurring emphasis added.while some circuits carve out a narrow exception to heck holding based on the spencer concurrences,the majority in our case adopts a view that would have no basis even in supreme court dicta.
several courts of appeals have concluded as i do that the spencer concurrences can not override heck binding precedent.see,entzi redmann,cir gilles davis,cir randell johnson,cir figueroa rivera,cir.
these opinions heed the supreme court admonition that,even if binding precedent appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions,the court of appeals should follow the case which directly controls,leaving to this supreme court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.agostini felton,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.we adhere to that rule it is not within our purview to anticipate whether the supreme court may one day overrule its existing precedent.united states santiago,cir.
other circuits have nevertheless held that spencer dicta does allow for unusual and compelling circumstances in which heck holding does not absolutely foreclose a claim.see,burd sessler,cir cohen longshore,cir wilson johnson,cir powers hamilton cnty.public defender comm n,cir guerrero gates,cir harden pataki,cir.
but even the courts that recognize certain narrow exceptions to heck emphatically reject the idea that the rule in heck no longer applies once a convict exits the prison gates.the seventh circuit,for instance,recently dismissed a claim by a released convict who argued that must be made available if habeas relief is not.see burd,at holding that heck applies where a plaintiff could have sought collateral relief at an earlier time but declined the opportunity and waited until collateral relief became unavailable before suing.likewise the ninth circuit the fact that a criminal defendant is no longer in custody and thus can not overturn his prior convictions by means of habeas corpus does not lift heck bar.guerrero,at and the sixth circuit it seems unlikely that justice souter intended to carve out a broad heck exception for all former prisoners.powers,at.
our court has gone its own way,without adhering to either side of this broad circuit split.this circuit first invoked the spencer dicta in leather ten eyck,cir calabresi,to allow an individual fined for drunk driving to seek damages in federal court even though he chose to forgo an appeal in state court.a year later,the spencer dicta was adopted as a holding,in a broadened and generalized form,in green montgomery,cir calabresi,heck acts only to bar suits when the plaintiff has a habeas corpus remedy available to him,when he is in state custody.id.at.the majority present opinion builds on this error.
the final segment of the majority opinion cites several second circuit opinions to argue for a spurious consensus.two of those cases allowed claims to proceed when the plaintiff challenged conditions of confinement rather than the fact or duration of confinement.see jenkins haubert,cir walker,sims artuz,cir kearse.these uncontroversial decisions are straightforward applications of supreme court precedent.see preiser rodriguez,d.another case cited by the majority,huang ex rel.yu johnson,cir winter,is likewise inapposite.see id.at considering whether new york law required court to credit a juvenile for time spent in a different institution on an unrelated charge see also huang ex rel.yu johnson,cir per curiam dismissing case after new york court of appeals held that government agency properly calculated juvenile sentence.the majority devotes considerable space to these dissimilar cases,see maj op.at,and counts on fingers the judges involved in their dispositions,see id.at.it is true that these opinions cited the spencer dicta with approval,expressing support for a very narrow exception that the majority opinion here expands immoderately and adopts as a holding.but i decline to argue over dicta distilled from dicta especially when the supreme court,ten sister circuits,and numerous cases in this circuit counsel otherwise.see supra at.
the majority holding that heck is inapplicable because poventud was no longer in custody when he filed suit relies as i have shown on justice souter dicta in spencer kemna,d,which the majority opinion presumes to elevate as the better rule.see op.at.the justices are free to choose the better rule or a worse one,for that matter but we are not.in heck,the court made its choice perfectly clear.
heck involved a challenge by a plaintiff in custody,but the opinion left no doubt that its holding applied regardless of whether the plaintiff was in custody or at liberty 
we hold that,in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment,or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid,a plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal,expunged by executive order,declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination,or called into question by a federal court issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.a claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has not been so invalidated is not cognizable under.
heck,at.the majority here presumptuously concludes that heck holding is expressed with careless overbreadth,and is not intended to apply to all actions including those filed by released convicts 
heck reasoning confirms that its holding means what it says.favorable termination is an absolute prerequisite to actions that seek damages arising from unlawful incarceration we do not engraft an exhaustion requirement upon,but rather deny the existence of a cause of action.id.at.since no cause of action exists under so long as the plaintiff stands convicted of the crime,it can not matter whether a plaintiff whose conviction subsists is in custody or at liberty,or has or could have pursued habeas relief.
the incompatibility between heck holding and justice souter dicta is acknowledged by justice souter expression of his views in terms of disagreement reciprocally,the majority opinion in heck rejected justice souter bid to narrow its holding 
justice souter also adopts the principle that one can not use the device of a civil tort action to challenge the validity of an outstanding criminal conviction,but thinks it necessary to abandon that principle in those cases of which no example comes to mind involving former state prisoners who,because they are no longer in custody,can not bring postconviction challenges.we think the principle barring collateral attacks a longstanding and deeply rooted feature of both the common law and our own jurisprudence is not rendered inapplicable by the fortuity that a convicted criminal is no longer incarcerated.
id.at emphasis added internal citation omitted.
the majority in our case deprecates this footnote as dictum,op.at though it is unclear to me why this would make it less compelling to the majority,whose entire argument here rests on nothing else.i disagree the passage does not address some ancillary issue it responds directly to justice souter criticism,emphasizing that the scope and rationale of the holding are broad enough to be unaffected by whether the plaintiff is in jail or not.a dictum is an assertion in a court opinion of a proposition of law that does not explain why the court judgment goes in favor of the winner.barclays capital,cir quoting pierre leval,judging under the constitution dicta about dicta.as illustrated above,heck made clear that the rule did not impose an exhaustion requirement and did not turn on the availability of habeas relief or whether the plaintiff is still in jail.heck,at.just as a court may state in binding terms what the rule is,it may also state in terms equally binding what the rule is not.
in any event,footnote ten only reinforces what heck holding makes plain a claim for damages that necessarily implies the invalidity of an outstanding conviction is not cognizable under.heck,at.
the concurrences in heck and spencer could not narrow or redefine or otherwise alter the supreme court holding.unlike plurality opinions,in which the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgment on the narrowest grounds,marks united states,d,a majority opinion dictates the precise contours of the court holding.see abramowicz stearns,supra,at.critically,this is so even if a justice concurring in the judgment would have preferred instead to resolve the case on a narrower ground.id.likewise,the majority here concedes,as it must,that supreme court dicta does not outweigh circuit precedent only an intervening supreme court decision will have that effect.see op.at citing meacham knolls atomic power,cir and consol.edison of,udgi,cir.
the majority opinion runs counter to the several values that animate heck and our jurisprudence.
the supreme court has long expressed concerns for finality and consistency and has generally declined to expand opportunities for collateral attack.heck,at.the majority opinion posits a rule that makes the opportunity for inconsistent collateral attack eternal.
