thomas michael larry was sentenced to death after a north carolina jury found him guilty of murder and robbery with a firearm.larry unsuccessfully challenged his conviction and sentence in state court,both on direct appeal and in collateral proceedings,and then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.the district court denied larry petition.we granted larry a certificate of appealability to consider two issues whether the state court erred by rejecting his request for a murder jury instruction and whether he is ineligible for capital punishment because of mental retardation.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court judgment.
we begin with a summary of the facts pertaining to larry underlying crimes,as articulated by the north carolina supreme court 
the evidence at trial tended to show that on january,at approximately,larry robbed a food lion employee who had access to the safe,saw larry standing in the front part of the store and asked if she could help him.he said that she could open the safe for him and that if she did not,she was a dead woman.he pointed a small black revolver at her.pennell went to the safe and opened it.larry took at least from the safe and put it in a box.he put the box under his arm and went outside.throughout the robbery,he pointed the gun at others in the store,telling them not to move.
the murder victim,robert buitrago,an police officer,was a customer waiting in line at a register when the robbery occurred.one witness,chastity adams,saw larry point the gun at buitrago and say,if you move,you dead.the cashier for buitrago line had her back to larry but heard him say,do move or i kill you.larry ran from the store,and buitrago chased him.when buitrago caught up with larry outside the store,near the front doors,a struggle ensued,and larry fatally shot buitrago with the handgun.some witnesses said there was one shot,and some said there were two or more shots.buitrago died from a single gunshot wound to the chest.larry fled on foot.
after witnesses identified larry as the perpetrator,police obtained arrest warrants and subsequently found larry hiding in a residence in.state larry,
after the close of evidence,the trial judge excused the jury and conducted a charge conference.during this conference,larry asked the judge to instruct the jury on murder.in response,the prosecutor stated 
i think out of an abundance of precaution,the court should probably instruct on second degree.i say that for this reason there was testimony from one individual that the defendant appeared surprised w hen he was confronted by officer buitrago.and based on that,the jury could find that he did actually premeditate the murder or deliberate upon the murder,just fired instinctively.
ultimately,the trial judge denied larry request for a murder instruction and instead instructed the jury on murder and robbery with a firearm.with respect to murder,the judge instructed the jury that it could find larry guilty under either one of two theories or both malice,premeditation,and deliberation or felony murder.after deliberating,the jury found larry guilty of murder under both theories,and it also found him guilty of robbery with a firearm.larry,at.
the north carolina supreme court summarized the facts regarding the sentencing phase of larry trial as follows 
at the sentencing proceeding,the state presented evidence that larry previously had been convicted once for common law robbery and three times for armed robbery.the jury found as four separate aggravating circumstances that larry previously had been convicted of a violent felony.the jury also found as an aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed while larry was engaged in the commission of a robbery.the jury found the statutory mitigating circumstances that the murder was committed while larry was mentally or emotionally disturbed and that larry capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was impaired.the jury also found five nonstatutory mitigating circumstances as well as the catchall mitigating circumstance.however,the jury recommended a sentence of death.the court sentenced larry to death for the murder conviction and to a consecutive term of forty years imprisonment for the armed robbery conviction.larry,at.
larry appealed his conviction and sentence to the north carolina supreme court arguing,inter alia,that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury on murder.however,the state supreme court held that the trial court did not err because the evidence did not support a murder instruction since there was positive,uncontradicted evidence of each element of murder.larry,at.the state supreme court thus affirmed larry conviction and sentence,id.at,and the united states supreme court denied his petition for certiorari,larry north carolina,d.
thereafter,larry filed a number of collateral,challenges in state court.he filed his first motion for appropriate relief mar in state superior court in the first mar.the superior court denied larry first mar,and the north carolina supreme court denied his petition for certiorari.state larry.
after larry filed his first mar,the north carolina general assembly passed a law prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded individuals.see.the statute defines mental retardation as s ignificantly subaverage general intellectual functioning,existing concurrently with significant limitations in adaptive functioning,both of which were manifested before the age of.id.a.the statute defines s ignificantly subaverage general intellectual functioning as a n intelligence quotient of or below.id.the statute also provides that a n intelligence quotient of or below on an individually administered,scientifically recognized standardized intelligence quotient test administered by a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist is evidence of significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning.id.a.the statute defines s ignificant limitations in adaptive functioning as s ignificant limitations in two or more of the following adaptive skill areas communication,home living,social skills,community use,health and safety,functional academics,leisure skills and work skills.id.a.
in cases,as here,where a capital defendant had been sentenced to death prior to the statute effective date,another state statute authorized defendants to file an mar to seek relief from their capital sentence on the basis of mental retardation.see.repealed.in these cases,the capital defendant bears the burden of proof and must establish mental retardation by a preponderance of the evidence.see see also id.
in light of north carolina new statute,larry filed a second mar the second mar in state superior court on january,the second mar court.in his second mar,larry claimed that he was mentally retarded within the meaning of state law and,therefore,ineligible for capital punishment.the second mar court held an evidentiary hearing in june,see,to consider larry mental retardation claim.
at the hearing,the second mar court heard from a number of witnesses.larry expert,clinical forensic psychologist brad fisher,testified that larry received a full scale score of on the intelligence test and that larry put forth his best effort on the test.however,fisher admitted that he did not test larry for malingering.fisher also testified that larry suffered significant limitations in more than two adaptive skill areas.
in contrast,the state expert,clinical psychologist and forensic psychologist mark hazelrigg,testified that larry received a full scale score of on the intelligence test.hazelrigg also stated that the test was outdated.moreover,hazelrigg stated that he administered a specific test to check for malingering,and he concluded that larry put forth an adequate amount of effort on the,but probably not his best effort.additionally,based on larry performance on the street skills survival questionnaire the sssq and other evidence,hazelrigg concluded that larry was impaired in only two adaptive skill areas,namely,he suffered mild impairment in the areas of health and safety,and functional academics hazelrigg concluded that larry was not mentally retarded within the meaning of north carolina law.
with respect to the first prong of north carolina mental retardation law,the second mar court concluded that larry failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he had an of or below in reaching this conclusion,the second mar court noted that hazelrigg tested larry for malingering when he administered the exam.the second mar court also noted that hazelrigg stated that the test was outdated.turning to the second prong of north carolina mental retardation law,the second mar court concluded that larry failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he suffered significant limitations in at least two adaptive skill areas in light of these two findings,the second mar court denied larry second mar,and the north carolina supreme court denied his petition for certiorari.state larry.
in july,larry filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.see.along with his petition,larry filed a motion asking the district court to hold the federal habeas proceedings in abeyance pending the outcome of his third state the district court denied larry motion and referred the case to a magistrate judge.
larry then moved to expand the record to include two new pieces of evidence his june full scale score of on the,fifth edition intelligence test and a north carolina superior court decision,which,according to larry,found the sssq to be an unreliable measure of adaptive skills.the magistrate judge denied larry motion to expand the record and recommended that his petition be denied larry filed objections to the magistrate judge recommendation.after reviewing larry objections de novo,the district court denied his petition and dismissed the action.the district court also denied larry application for a certificate of appealability.
we granted larry motion for a certificate of appealability to consider,inter alia,claims he raises under beck alabama,d,and atkins virginia,d.
in beck,the supreme court held that capital defendants have a constitutional right to a offense instruction when the evidence unquestionably establishes that the defendant is guilty of a serious,violent leaves some doubt with respect to an element that would justify conviction of a capital offense.beck,at.at the same time,however,a defendant is not entitled to have the jury instructed as to lesser degrees of the crime simply because the crime charged is murder.bates lee,cir quotation marks omitted.rather,due process requires that a lesser included offense instruction be given only when the evidence warrants such an instruction,and t he federal rule is that a lesser included offense instruction should be given if the evidence would permit a jury rationally to find a defendant guilty of the lesser offense and acquit him of the greater.hopper evans,d quotation marks omitted.
in atkins,the supreme court held that the eighth amendment prohibits the execution of mentally retarded criminals.at.the court concluded that a national legislative consensus against the execution of mentally retarded offenders had developed,and it identified two reasons consistent with that consensus to justify a categorical exclusion of the mentally retarded from execution the justifications for recognizing the death penalty,retribution and deterrence do not apply to mentally retarded offenders and the diminished capacity of mentally retarded offenders places them at greater risk of wrongful execution.id.at.the court noted that t o the extent there is serious disagreement about the execution of mentally retarded offenders,it is in determining which offenders are in fact retarded.id.at.continuing,the court observed that n ot all people who claim to be mentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom there is a national consensus however,instead of defining that range,the court expressly left to the states the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences.id.quoting ford wainwright,d.
we review the district court denial of larry petition de novo.see tucker ozmint,cir.however,under,the scope of our review is highly constrained.jackson johnson,cir.we may only grant larry relief if the state court adjudication of his claims resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,d.
the contrary to and unreasonable application clauses of d have independent meanings.tucker,at.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law under d when it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by the united states supreme court,or confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from that precedent,williams taylor,d.
a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under d if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from the supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case.williams,at.this standard is quite deferential the state court application of clearly established federal law must be objectively unreasonable,and a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.robinson polk,cir quoting williams,at.moreover,when assessing the reasonableness of the state court application of federal law,the federal courts are to review the result that the state court reached,not whether its decision was well reasoned.wilson ozmint,cir quotation marks omitted.
similarly,a petitioner alleging that a state court based its decision on an unreasonable determination of the facts under d must satisfy a demanding standard the question is not whether a federal court believes the state court determination was incorrect but whether that determination was substantially higher threshold.schriro landrigan,d.moreover,e provides that a state court factual decisions shall be presumed to be correct and that the petitioner bears the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e 
with these principles in mind,we turn to larry claims larry contends that the north carolina supreme court adjudication of his claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,beck and its progeny within the meaning of d.he argues that the court erred because it did not expressly inquire whether the evidence warranted a murder instruction but,instead,viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and only inquired whether the evidence supported a murder instruction.we disagree with larry characterization of the state court decision.
at the outset of its analysis,the north carolina supreme court correctly identified beck and hopper as the law governing larry claim,noting that a lesser included offense instruction must be given if the evidence would permit a jury rationally to find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense and acquit him of the greater.larry,at quoting state strickland,quoting beck,at.see also larry,at citing hopper.continuing,the court noted that under state law t he test in every case involving the propriety of an instruction on a lesser grade of an offense is not whether the jury could convict the defendant of the lesser crime,but whether the state evidence is positive as to each element of the crime charged and whether there is any conflicting evidence relating to any of these elements.larry,at emphasis added quoting state skipper.in other words,i f the state evidence establishes each and every element of murder and there is no evidence to negate these elements,it is proper for the trial court to exclude murder from the jury consideration.bates,at quoting state flowers.applying this test in larry case,the court reviewed the evidence and concluded that it did not support a murder instruction because there was positive,uncontradicted evidence of each element of murder.larry,at emphasis added.larry argument fails to appreciate the significance of this holding.
under north carolina law,murder is the unlawful killing of another human being with malice and with premeditation and deliberation.state bonney.murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice but without premeditation and deliberation.state thibodeaux,quotation marks omitted.consequently,when the north carolina supreme court inquired whether there was uncontradicted evidence of each element of murder,see larry,at,it necessarily considered whether the evidence of premeditation and deliberation was uncontroverted,it considered whether the evidence would support a finding that larry acted without premeditation or deliberation.
though larry argues that it was unreasonable for the state court to conclude that the evidence of premeditation and deliberation was uncontradicted,larry does not dispute that he carried a loaded gun into the store,pointed the gun at buitrago,threatened to shoot him if he moved,and then a short time later shot him in the chest as the two men struggled just outside the store.petitioner br.at reply br.at.rather,the gravamen of his claim is that certain facts contradict the conclusion that he acted with premeditation and deliberation at the exact moment he pulled the trigger.he points to the following facts in support of his argument he did not harm anyone in the store,even though he brandished a gun and made several threats to shoot anyone who tried to stop him the shooting occurred during a struggle,while larry was fleeing the scene one witness testified that larry looked surprised by buitrago actions only a matter of seconds passed between the time buitrago struck larry with the wine bottle and the shooting he only fired one shot after firing,he made no effort to ensure that buitrago was dead he did not know buitrago was a police officer and one of the state prosecutors stated that a jury could find that larry did not premeditate or deliberate.in other words,because he did not pull the trigger inside the store at the same time he verbally threatened to shoot buitrago,and instead shot buitrago moments later during a struggle outside the store,larry contends the north carolina supreme court could not reasonably have determined that the evidence of premeditation and deliberation was uncontradicted.we do not agree with this argument.
under north carolina law,premeditation means the defendant formed the specific intent to kill the victim for some period of time,however short,before the actual killing.state misenheimer.deliberation means that the intent to kill was formed while defendant was in a cool state of blood and not under the influence of a violent passion suddenly aroused by sufficient provocation.id.significantly,however,cool state of blood does not mean an absence of passion and emotion.id.quotation marks omitted.rather,under state law,a defendant may deliberate,may premeditate although prompted and to a large extent controlled by passion at the time.id.quotation marks omitted.indeed,i f the design to kill was formed with deliberation and premeditation,it is immaterial that defendant was in a passion or excited when the design was carried into effect.id.emphasis added quotation marks omitted.thus a killing committed during the course of a quarrel or scuffle may yet constitute first degree murder provided the defendant formed the intent to kill in a cool state of blood before the quarrel or scuffle began and the killing during the quarrel was the product of this earlier formed intent.id.additionally,it is sufficient that the processes of premeditation and deliberation occur prior to,and not simultaneously with,the killing.state holder.
in light of north carolina law,and the undisputed fact that larry verbally threatened to shoot buitrago while they were inside the store,it was not unreasonable for the state court to conclude that it was uncontradicted that larry formed an intent to kill with premeditation and deliberation.nor was it unreasonable for the state court to conclude that after larry formed that intention nothing happened in the succeeding moments sufficient to alter his mental state or contradict a finding that he shot buitrago with premeditation and deliberation.
contrary to larry contention,then,the state court did consider whether the evidence would support a murder instruction.in turn,since united states supreme court precedent only requires that a state court give a instruction when the evidence warrants such an instruction,see hopper,at,we conclude that the north carolina supreme court adjudication of larry claim was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,federal law within the meaning of d 
we now turn to larry mental retardation claims.as noted above,larry contends that he is mentally retarded and therefore ineligible for capital punishment.in pursuing this argument on appeal,larry presents claims under both d and d.however,he is not entitled to relief on any of these claims.
larry presents three primary claims under d.first,he argues that the second mar court erred by reading north carolina mental retardation statute,as requiring him to establish an of or below to prevail on his mental retardation claim.according to larry,a person could be mentally retarded within the meaning of even if they have an greater than because the statute provides that a person is merely evidence of mental retardation vel non.
we express no opinion on the merits of this claim because it does not fall within the proper scope of our federal habeas review.i t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine determinations on questions.in conducting habeas review,a federal court is limited to deciding whether a conviction violated the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.estelle mcguire,d wright angelone,cir it is black letter law that a federal court may grant habeas relief only on the ground that the petitioner is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.quotation marks omitted.because this particular argument rests solely upon an interpretation of north carolina statutory law,it is simply not cognizable on federal habeas review.
second,larry argues that requiring him to establish an of or below resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,atkins because persons with scores above may be mentally retarded.in support of this argument,larry notes that some state mental retardation laws do not require defendants to establish any particular score,while other states only require defendants to establish scores of or below.as noted above,however,atkins expressly left to the states the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences.atkins,at.moreover,the supreme court cited north carolina mental retardation statute approvingly in atkins and identified it as a law prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded defendants.see atkins,at.consequently,we hold that requiring larry to establish an of or less is neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,atkins.
third,larry contends that atkins requires every state to employ a particular clinical approach to measuring a defendant adaptive skills.he argues that the clinical approach mandated by atkins requires states to measure a defendant adaptive skills based on how the defendant actually or typically functions in the real world,rather than on the skills the defendant is capable of performing but chooses not to perform.therefore,he argues,the second mar court adjudication of his mental retardation claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,federal law because he believes the second mar court focused on the skills he could perform,rath
