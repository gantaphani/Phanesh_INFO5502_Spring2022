paul winestock,appeals a district court order denying his motion for reconsideration of the denial of post conviction relief.having previously granted a certificate of appealability,see c west supp,we now hold that winestock motion amounted to a successive application for post conviction relief and that the district court therefore lacked jurisdiction to consider it.see west supp.accordingly,we vacate the order denying reconsideration and remand with instructions to dismiss.in addition,we deny authorization for winestock to file a second or successive application.see b west supp.
winestock was convicted of two offenses.in,this court affirmed winestock convictions.see united states winestock,cir.per curiam unpublished table decision,cert.denied,d.two years later,we affirmed the sentence imposed by the district court after it granted winestock motion for resentencing based on a retroactive amendment to the sentencing guidelines.see united states winestock,cir.per curiam unpublished table decision,cert.denied,d.
in,winestock sought post conviction relief pursuant to west supp.relying on apprendi new jersey,d,winestock alleged that the indictment against him was defective and that his sentence was unlawful.when the government maintained that winestock had waived these claims by failing to raise them on appeal,winestock asserted,inter alia,that any waiver was attributable to ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court denied relief on the ground that apprendi does not apply retroactively the court also ruled,in the alternative,that winestock had waived his claims and that this waiver could not be excused based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
winestock moved for reconsideration,arguing that the court erred in refusing to apply apprendi retroactively,his appellate lawyer provided ineffective assistance by failing to raise winestock apprendi claims,and the same lawyer performed deficiently by failing to disclose that he had been imprisoned and disbarred.the district court denied this motion.
winestock appealed the order denying relief and the order denying reconsideration.as to the first order,we denied a certificate of appealability and dismissed the appeal.see united states winestock,wl cir per curiam.thus,only the appeal from the order denying reconsideration is now before us.
the ultimate question here is whether winestock motion for should have been treated as a successive collateral review application this question is important because,as we will discuss more extensively below,review of successive applications is available only in limited circumstances.in order for these limitations to be effective,courts must not allow prisoners to circumvent them by attaching labels other than successive application to their pleadings.see calderon thompson,d.
this responsibility comports with the longstanding practice of courts to classify pro se pleadings from prisoners according to their contents,without regard to their captions.see united states emmanuel,cir.this practice has acquired greater significance since the enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,pub,stat,and the prison litigation reform act of plra,pub,tit.viii,stat.these statutes place significant restrictions on prisoner litigation including the limits on successive applications we will discuss below and thus elevate the degree of caution that courts must exercise when determining how to classify prisoner pleadings.see emmanuel,at.with these concerns in mind,we now examine the relevant statutes and rules and how they relate to each other.
motions for reconsideration under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure 
because winestock motion was titled motion for reconsideration,or in the alternative,motion for a certificate of appealability,we begin our analysis by examining the provisions governing motions for reconsideration.we focus on.b,because winestock motion was filed more than ten days after the entry of judgment.see small hunt,cir.
rule b allows a party to obtain relief from a final judgment based on 
mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under rule b fraud whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic,misrepresentation,or other misconduct of an adverse party the judgment is void the judgment has been satisfied,released,or discharged,or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated,or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application or any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.
this rule codifies inherent judicial powers that were previously exercised through a gaggle of writs,which the rule abolishes.see united states beggerly,d plaut spendthrift farm,d.
the powers reflected in rule b are subject to limitations imposed by the rule itself and by precedent.the rule establishes time limits for motions alleging certain grounds for relief.judicial decisions,meanwhile,have described the limits of relief available under particular components of the rule.see,liljeberg health servs.acquisition,d discussing the proper use of the rule b provision.district court decisions granting or denying rule b relief are reviewed for abuse of discretion,although the exercise of discretion can not be permitted to stand if we find it rests upon an error of law.agostini felton,d.
limitations on successive collateral review applications 
we turn now to an examination of the limitations on successive collateral review applications.before the aedpa was enacted,congress and the supreme court restricted judicial consideration of successive applications through statutes,rules,and decisional law.see mccleskey zant,d.these restrictions applied to claims presented for the first time in a second or successive application abusive claims as well as claims that had been presented in previous applications repetitive claims see,rule b,rules governing proceedings.as discussed below,the aedpa codifies some of the limits on successive petitions,and further restricts the availability of relief to habeas.felker turpin,d.
substantive limitations under the aedpa 
as amended by the aedpa,bars successive applications unless they contain claims relying on 
newly discovered evidence that,if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense or 
a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable.
a separate provision,also enacted as part of the aedpa,places similar restrictions on state prisoners seeking to file successive applications under west supp.see b west supp.
an additional limit created by the aedpa provides that any claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was presented in a prior application must be dismissed.id.b.although this rule is limited by its terms to applications,some courts have also applied it to applications.see taylor gilkey,cir charles chandler,cir per curiam.we need not decide here whether to follow this approach.
procedural requirements established by the aedpa 
in addition to enacting the substantive standards we have just described,the aedpa modified the procedures governing successive collateral review applications.as a result of these modifications,a prisoner seeking to file a successive application in the district court must first obtain authorization from the appropriate court of appeals.see b.the court of appeals must examine the application to determine whether it contains any claim that satisfies b for state prisoners or for federal prisoners.if so,the court should authorize the prisoner to file the entire application in the district court,even if some of the claims in the application do not satisfy the applicable standards.see nevius mcdaniel,cir.compare b establishing gatekeeping function for court of appeals with respect to second or successive applicat
