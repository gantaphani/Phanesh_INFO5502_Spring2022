sean sanders filed this petition for collateral relief under supp.iv.sanders claimed that his conviction and sentence for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base in violation of and should be overturned on account of violations of his fifth and sixth amendment rights.the district court dismissed sanders motion as untimely under because it was filed more than one year after sanders conviction became final.because sanders resentencing under fed.pro.b did not renew the clock on statute of limitations,because sanders procedurally defaulted any remaining claims,and because the new rule of criminal procedure announced in apprendi new jersey,d,does not apply retroactively on collateral review,we affirm the district court dismissal of sanders habeas petition.
on september,sean sanders was named in a criminal information.the information alleged that sanders conspired to distribute cocaine and cocaine base in violation of and.sanders subsequently waived indictment and pleaded guilty to the criminal information.on january,sanders was sentenced to months imprisonment and a term of supervised release.the district court also ordered sanders to pay a fine and specially assessed him.the court entered its judgment on january.sanders did not appeal.
on december,in light of sanders substantial assistance in other prosecutions,the government moved for a reduction in sanders sentence pursuant to fed.pro.b.on april,the district court granted the government motion.the court reduced sanders term of imprisonment to months and reduced his fine to.
on december,nearly months after he had originally been sentenced,sanders filed a petition for collateral relief under.sanders claimed that in light of jones united states,d,his original sentence violated his fifth amendment right to due process because the district court did not apply the beyond a reasonable doubt standard in determining the type and quantity of the drugs in question.in addition,sanders claimed that his attorney was ineffective for failing to present this fifth amendment argument to the court.
on january,the district court dismissed sanders petition for relief.the court noted that the judgment of his conviction became final in january,but that sanders did not file his petition for collateral relief until december.the court ruled that sanders petition was therefore untimely under statute of limitations.sanders now appeals.
prior to,there was no time limitation on a federal prisoner ability to collaterally attack his conviction in a motion.see united states torres,cir.this changed in with congress enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,stat.aedpa.aedpa amended to provide a limitations period for the filing of motions.section statute of limitations provides,in relevant part 
a period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section.the limitation period shall run from the latest of 
the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final or 
the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court,if that right has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.
sanders contends that his motion was timely under both subsections and.
sanders first contends his habeas petition was timely under subsection.sanders concedes that if this court construes the date upon which his judgment of conviction becomes final to be january,then his motion is untimely.january,was the date on which the district court entered its judgment from which sanders chose not to appeal.sanders contends,however,that the limitations period did not begin to run until the completion of his resentencing under fed.pro.b.this occurred on april.since sanders filed his motion on december,roughly eight months after he was resentenced,he claims that his motion therefore is timely.
we disagree.congress did not explicitly state in the aedpa when a judgment of conviction becomes final for purposes of subsection.see torres,at.in torres,however,this court held that for purposes of,the conviction of a federal prisoner whose conviction is affirmed by this court and who does not file a petition for certiorari becomes final on the date that this court mandate issues in his direct appeal.torres,at.under the reasoning of torres,sanders conviction became final on the date upon which he declined to pursue further direct appellate review.the district court entered sanders judgment of conviction on january.since sanders did not file a direct appeal,his conviction became final for purposes of subsection on that date.
contrary to sanders assertions,congress did not intend for fed.pro.b motions to prevent convictions from becoming final for purposes.the plain language of b establishes that a modification of a sentence does not affect the finality of a criminal judgment.section b states 
b effect of finality of the fact that a sentence to imprisonment can subsequently be 
modified pursuant to the provisions of subsection c 
corrected pursuant to the provisions of rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure and section or 
appealed and modified,if outside the guideline range,pursuant to the provisions of section 
a judgment of conviction that includes such a sentence constitutes a final judgment for all other purposes.
b emphasis added.
as b contemplates,sanders sentence was modified pursuant to c b.that section permits courts to modify an imposed term of imprisonment to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute or by rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.c b.the plain text of b clearly states that this later modification does not affect the date on which sanders judgment of conviction became final for all other purposes.the conviction which the district court entered on january,included a sentence to imprisonment.therefore that judgment of conviction constitutes a final judgment for all other purposes under b,including the beginning of subsection limitations period 
both sanders and the government emphasize at length various policy arguments to explain why this court should or should not construe subsection limitations period to begin running only after a rule b sentence modification is granted.sanders argues that his interpretation of subsection will streamline court proceedings by allowing defendants to present a single motion,rather than one for claims stemming from their original sentences and another for claims stemming from their rule b resentencings.sanders also argues that his construction of subsection will encourage more cooperation between defendants and the government by removing defendants from the uncomfortable position of having to litigate against the government in their motions,while simultaneously assisting the government in order to obtain its support for a rule b sentence reduction.finally,sanders claims that his interpretation will eliminate the burden on defendants of having to litigate their ineffective assistance of counsel claims under,while simultaneously being represented by that very counsel in their rule b resentencings.
for its part,the government contends that sanders construction would result in many stale claims.it points out that although rule b motions ordinarily must be filed within one year after the sentence is imposed,motions may be made at a later date,sometimes even years afterwards.see fed.pro.b.the government also argues that the efficiency gains from sanders proposed construction of subsection would be de miminis because rule b sentence modifications rarely,if ever,lead to challenges.the government also argues that sanders proposed rule would inadvisably encourage defendants with valid ineffective assistance of counsel claims to persist in being represented by their deficient counsel in their rule b proceedings.
it is not our place,however,to weigh the relative merits of these policy arguments.congress already has considered these very concerns,and it has resolved them with b.we are obligated to follow congress judgment on this matter and apply the plain text of the statute.since sanders rule b resentencing does not affect the date on which the judgment of his conviction became final,sanders motion was not timely under subsection 
sanders next argues that his claims are not under subsection of.see in re vial,cir en banc.even assuming,solely for purposes of this appeal,that sanders is correct,his habeas petition still faces two insurmountable obstacles.
sanders did not argue at his original sentencing that a jury must determine beyond a reasonable doubt the types or quantities of drugs involved in his conspiracy.nor did he raise this claim on direct appeal.as the supreme court has admonished,h abeas review is an extraordinary remedy and will not be allowed to do service for an appeal.bousley united states,d internal citations omitted.where a defendant has procedurally defaulted a claim by failing to raise it on direct review,the claim may be raised in habeas only if the defendant can first demonstrate either cause and actual prejudice,or that he is actually innocent.id.at.internal citations omitted.
sanders first attempts to demonstrate cause.he argues that the legal basis for his claim was not reasonably available to his counsel at the time his plea was entered.he notes further that the supreme court has held that a claim that is so novel that its legal basis is not reasonably available to counsel may constitute cause for a procedural default.bousley,at.citing reed ross,d.
in bousley,however,the supreme court elaborated on just what constitutes a novel claim.in that case,bousley claimed on collateral review that his guilty plea for using a firearm in violation of c was not knowing and intelligent because the district court misinformed him of the nature of the charged crime.bousley claim was based on the fact that,five years after his conviction,the supreme court held in bailey united states,d,that c use prong requires the government to show active employment of the firearm,rather than mere possession.bousley,at.
although the court recognized that its holding in bailey changed the relevant legal landscape,it held that bousley claim was not novel.the court reached this conclusion because other defendants had previously challenged their c convictions on grounds that use required more than the mere possession of a firearm.see bousley,at.
the court further rejected bousley argument that his failure to raise the claim on direct review should be excused because,before bailey,any attempt to attack his guilty plea would have been futile.bousley,at.internal quotation marks omitted.instead,the court stated that futility can not constitute cause if it means simply that a claim was unacceptable to that particular court at that particular time.id.citing engle isaac,d.
under the bousley analysis,sanders simply can not show cause to explain his failure to raise his apprendi argument on direct appeal.the seventh circuit has recently addressed this precise issue,holding that a petitioner procedurally defaulted his apprendi claim when he failed to raise it at his trial in.see united states smith,cir.smith determined that the petitioner claims were not novel because the foundation for apprendi was laid long before.other defendants had been making arguments ever since the sentencing guidelines came into being,and in mcmillan.pennsylvania,d,the court addressed on the merits an argument along similar lines.smith,at internal citations omitted.see also united states nance,cir indeed,as far back as defendants were arguing to this court that the type of drug that they were charged with distributing in violation of was an element of the offense that had to be proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.citing united states edwards,cir.
smith further rejected the petitioner futility argument,which is identical to sanders here.the smith petitioner argued that he showed cause because,prior to apprendi,the federal circuit courts had held that drug quantity under b was a statutory sentencing factor rather than a substantive element of the offense.see,united states powell,cir united states edwards,cir.in light of this contrary precedent,the petitioner claimed that raising his apprendi claims on direct appeal would have been futile.applying bousley,smith rejected this argument.instead,the court recognized that c ause means some impediment,and the petitioner does not contend that any outside force impeded his legal defense.smith,at.
we agree with the seventh circuit analysis.adopting petitioner view of novelty as a cause for procedural default would invite criminal defendants to bypass the preferred procedural avenue of trial and direct appeal in favor of collateral review.collateral review would come in turn to serve as an receptacle for claims which in hindsight appear more promising than they did at the time of trial.bousley did not intend every change in criminal procedure to become the occasion for reopening a judgment.the germ of sanders apprendi claim had sprouted at the time of his conviction and there is no reason why he could not have raised it then.although the court may not have been likely to accept sanders argument,sanders plainly had at his disposal the essential legal tools with which to construct his claim.smith,at.as a result,sanders has procedurally defaulted his apprendi claim.
sanders argument that his claims are not barred under subsection faces an additional,that he seeks to assert a new rule on collateral review in contravention of teague lane,d.new rules of constitutional criminal procedure are generally not applied retroactively on collateral review.united states mandanici,cir internal citations omitted.furthermore,neither the supreme court nor any of our sister circuits have held that apprendi is retroactively applicable on collateral attack in fact,the ninth circuit has recently concluded just the opposite.see jones smith,cir.several district courts have also held that apprendi does not apply to initial habeas corpus petitions.see levan united states,d,listing cases but see united states murphy,d holding that apprendi applies retroactively darity united states,d same.we agree with the ninth circuit and the majority of district courts that apprendi does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review.
in teague lane,the supreme court established a inquiry to determine when new rules of criminal procedure apply retroactively on collateral review.see at.first,the court must determine the date on which the defendant conviction became final.see netherland,d citing lambrix singletary,d.second,the court must decide whether the supreme court ruling indeed constitutes a new rule of constitutional criminal procedure.third,if the rule is new,then it does not apply retroactively unless it falls within one of the two narrow exceptions to the teague bar.
sanders initially argues that apprendi is not subject to teague test because it sets forth a new rule of substantive,rather than procedural,criminal law.to the contrary,apprendi constitutes a procedural rule because it dictates what procedure must be employed to ensure a fair trial.teague,at.apprendi.at the substantive basis for new jersey enhancement is thus not at issue the adequacy of new jersey procedure is.
since apprendi announced a procedural rule,we now turn to the teague analysis.first,as noted above,sanders conviction became final on january.second,apprendi is certainly a new rule of criminal procedure.a new rule is one that was not dictated by precedent at the time the defendant conviction became final.see,at.as of january,the supreme court had yet to decide either jones united states,d,or apprendi new jersey,d,the two cases upon which sanders bases his motion.rather,the leading supreme court case in this area was mcmillan pennsylvania,d.in mcmillan,the court ruled that a state could treat the possession of a firearm as a sentencing factor rather than as an element of a particular offense.see mcmillan,at.as a result,the court held that the state did not need to prove the existence of this sentencing factor beyond a reasonable doubt,and the defendant was not entitled to a jury trial on that particular question.id.at.
since only mcmillan had been decided by the time sanders conviction became final,it is clear that a reasonable jurist in january would not have felt compelled to adopt the rule later set out in apprendi any factor which increased the maximum punishment for an offense must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.this claim is illustrated by the fact that,prior to apprendi,every federal circuit court considered drug quantity to be a sentencing factor for a judge to determine based on a preponderance of the evidence.see,united states powell,cir united states campuzano,cir.as the ninth circuit recognized in jones,apprendi certainly established a new rule that much is clear from the supreme court declaration in jones united states,d,that the issue was,as of,not yet settled.jones,at 
new rules of constitutional criminal procedure are generally not applied retroactively on collateral review.this rule is subject only to the two narrow exceptions discussed in teague.teague first exception addresses new rules which forbid criminal punishment of certain primary conduct and new rules which prohibit a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense.see,at.the first exception clearly does not apply here because apprendi did not place drug conspiracies beyond the scope of the state authority to proscribe.jones,at finding teague first exception inapplicable to petitioner apprendi claim because the state authority to punish petitioner for attempted murder is beyond question.
accordingly,apprendi does not apply retroactively unless it falls within teague second exception.for a rule to qualify,the new rule must be such that,without it,the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.teague,at.improving the accuracy of trial,however,is not sufficient.rather,a rule that qualifies under this exception must not only improve accuracy,but also alter our understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding.sawyer smith,d internal quotations omitted.the supreme court has pointed to gideon wainwright,d,as the type of rule that would satisfy teague second exception.see saffle parks,d.
the supreme court has stated that it is unlikely that many such rules remain undiscovered.whatever the precise scope of this second exception,it is clearly meant to apply only to a small core of rules requiring observance of those procedures that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,at.the court has repeatedly emphasized the rarity of new bedrock rules of procedure.because we operate from the premise that such procedures would be so central to an accurate determination of innocence or guilt,we believe it unlikely that many such components of basic due process have yet to emerge.graham collins,d.indeed,since teague,the court has yet to find a single rule that qualifies under the second exception.see united states mandanici,cir discussing eleven new rules or proposed new rules,which the supreme court has declined to apply retroactively.the new rule announced in apprendi is.the supreme court held both that a jury,rather than a judge,must determine the facts supporting a statutory sentencing enhancement,and that this finding must be made beyond a reasonable doubt,rather than by a preponderance of the evidence.these rules,however,are not the types of watershed rules implicating fundamental fairness that require retroactive application on collateral attack.
as sanders recognizes,a rule which merely shifts the duties from an impartial judge to a jury clearly does not fall within the scope of the second teague exception.see neder united states,d.neder came on the heels of united states gaudin,d,which held that the issue of materiality in false statement prosecutions under must be decided by a jury rather than a judge.neder nonetheless held that a district court failure to submit a finding of materiality to the jury was harmless error.neder,at.
certainly,if having a judge rather than a jury consider an element of the offense amounts only to harmless error,then a new rule mandating a jury to decide an issue rather than a judge can not fall within the scope of the second teague exception.the federal circuit courts have recognized this very point,holding that the new rule announced in gaudin does not apply retroactively on collateral review.see,bilzerian united states,cir united states shunk,cir.as the second circuit explained in bilzerian,the gaudin rule merely shift ed the determination of materiality from the judge to the jury and there is little reason to believe that juries will have substantially different interpretations of materiality than judges.bilzerian,at.the same reasoning applies to sanders case there is little reason to believe that juries will have substantially different interpretations of drug type and quantity than judges.
sanders argues,however,that it is not so much the identity of the as it is the reasonable doubt standard that profoundly implicates both the fairness and the accuracy of criminal proceedings sanders likens apprendi to cage louisiana,d,in which the supreme court announced a new rule that a jury instruction equating the reasonable doubt standard with moral certainty unconstitutionally diluted the reasonable doubt standard.sanders correctly points out that this court has held that cage falls within the second teague exception and applies retroactively on collateral review.see adams aiken,cir.sanders contends that adams is indistinguishable from this case.he also notes that this term the supreme court is reviewing the retroactivity of cage new rule.see tyler cain,d.
even assuming the court applies cage rule retroactively in tyler,the question raised in this case is fundamentally different.tyler turns on the standard of proof under which the entire case against the defendant is submitted to the jury.here,in contrast,sanders can not claim that his entire conviction is tainted.rather,his claim concerns the district court omission of only one element of the offense,quantity.neder,at.as the supreme court explained in johnson united states,d,and neder,at,an instruction that gives a proper reasonable doubt instruction but omits an element of the offense does not necessarily render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair,even though it prevents the jury from rendering a complete verdict on every element of the offense.rather,in those cases the supreme court held that the district court failure to submit an element to the jury was subject to neder and johnson analysis.
we may readily assume that the rule that certain sentencing factors must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt will promote marginally more accurate results.in re winship,d sullivan louisiana,d.in order for a new rule to qualify for the second teague exception,however,it must not only promote accuracy,but also alter our understanding of the bedrock elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding.sawyer,at.a simple comparison between the apprendi rule and the paradigmatic watershed principle announced in gideon wainwright indicates that the former lacks the primacy and centrality of the latter.gideon,which established an affirmative right to counsel in all felony cases,was remarkable in part because of its sweeping breadth.in contrast,apprendi merely applies to the subsection of criminal defendants whose maximum punishment may be increased by a sentencing factor.if a defendant sentence is within the statutory limits,the maximum sentence,then apprendi would not apply.see apprendi.at.
more importantly,we do not read apprendi to hold that the country criminal justice system malfunctioned so fundamentally prior to the year,as to merit the retroactive application of the court new procedural rule.apprendi itself recognized that judges in this country,in accordance with the constitution,had long exercised discretion in imposing sentences within the particular range determined by the legislature.b oth before and since the american colonies became a nation,courts in this country and in england practiced a policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law.id.at citing williams new y
