following his murder conviction in new york state court,petitioner charles hemstreet sought a writ of habeas corpus principally on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel.he claimed that officers investigating the murder had intimidated a potentially exculpatory witness,causing her not to testify at trial,and that counsel had omitted to pursue this issue both at trial and on appeal.based on these allegations,as well as trial counsel failure to supply an alternative explanation for not calling the potentially exculpatory witness,the united states district court for the southern district of new york brieant,granted the petition and this court affirmed.see hemstreet greiner,cir hemstreet i.
shortly after we issued our opinion,the witness contacted the district attorney office responsible for prosecuting the case and recanted her potentially exculpatory statements.we then nostra sponte vacated our opinion along with the district court judgment and,retaining jurisdiction,remanded the case to the district court to evaluate the effect of the recantation.see hemstreet greiner,cir hemstreet ii see also united states jacobson,cir.on remand,the district court,following an evidentiary hearing,adhered to its previous conclusion and,once again,granted the petition.see hemstreet greiner,civ.clb,wl,hemstreet iii because we conclude that hemstreet failed to establish that the state court resolution of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was unreasonable,we reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss the petition.
background 
hemstreet was convicted in january in new york supreme court,county of rockland of the murder in of his business partner,kenneth hiep.on direct appeal,hemstreet counsel challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the verdict.the appellate division affirmed the conviction.see people hemstreet,dep t.hemstreet petitioned that court for a writ of error coram nobis on the ground that he was denied effective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.specifically,he claimed that appellate counsel had failed to pursue a meritorious ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal.the claim against trial counsel was based on his failure to seek a remedy for the prosecution alleged intimidation of a potentially exculpatory defense witness.the appellate division denied the petition because hemstreet had failed to establish that he was denied the effective assistance of appellate counsel.people hemstreet,dep t.hemstreet then filed the petition for a writ of habeas corpus that underlies this appeal,asserting ineffective assistance of appellate counsel on largely the same grounds.
hemstreet petition centers on the alleged intimidation of a potentially exculpatory defense witness,jeanette bucci,by officers investigating the hiep murder.in a june affidavit prepared and notarized prior to trial by an interim attorney of sorts for hemstreet,hemstreet iii,wl,at,bucci swore that on the night of the murder,she had seen hiep,hemstreet,and patrick bentz a friend of hemstreet who was separately convicted of murdering hiep together at a bar where she worked.according to bucci affidavit,the three men left the bar at around that evening but hiep and bentz returned at about without hemstreet.bucci also stated in her affidavit that in she had given essentially the same information to investigators from the district attorney office.
in november detectives visited bucci parents home,and the following day met with bucci at her workplace.according to the detectives notes from that meeting,bucci gave a statement mostly consistent with her affidavit.she added that despite not seeing hemstreet in the bar at,he could have been there.
if true,bucci statements would have supported the defense theory that bentz had taken hemstreet home prior to killing hiep.however,at trial hemstreet attorney informed the court that bucci was refusing to testify or to meet with him because investigators had visited her mother and sister and warned them that,if bucci testified,they were in for a lot of trouble.see hemstreet i,at.trial counsel did not seek to remedy this alleged intimidation other than by asking the court to stop any future threats.see id.
in reviewing hemstreet habeas petition,the district court found that this conduct amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel because n o plausible basis in trial tactics could justify failure to pursue the issue of bucci alleged intimidation by demanding a hearing in the trial court.hemstreet i,at quoting the district court unpublished opinion.likewise,the court found that no tactical decision could justify failure to raise the issue on direct appeal.id.the court granted the petition.it concluded that hemstreet sixth amendment rights had been violated and that the appellate division rejection of his ineffective assistance claim was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.see d.
on appeal we concluded that although t he record does not definitively establish whether the prosecution intimidated bucci,the district court did not clearly err in finding that she became unavailable as a witness to hemstreet because she had been threatened by detectives from the prosecutor office.hemstreet i,at.based on that finding of fact,together with trial counsel failure to provide any alternative explanation for not calling bucci as a witness,we concluded that trial counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.we further concluded that this deficient performance affected the outcome of the trial,and that appellate counsel had an obligation to raise the issue on direct appeal.id.at.
after our opinion was issued,bucci contacted the rockland county district attorney office and asserted that she had in fact never been intimidated by the detectives.hemstreet ii,at.she admitted to having lied in key portions of her affidavit,and explained that she now wanted to make it right.id.based on this recantation,we vacated our earlier decision,and remanded for the district court to reevaluate the case and to allow hemstreet the opportunity to flesh out and otherwise examine bucci new explanation.id.at footnote omitted.
on remand,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing at which several witnesses testified.hemstreet trial counsel,murray richman,testified that he met bucci for the first and only time around the beginning of the defense case,after he had informed the court that she refused to appear.he further testified that at that meeting,bucci confirmed that her family had been visited by detectives and that she would not testify on hemstreet behalf.he stated that bucci seemed really disturbed,and i did want to put a witness on that i did not know what she was going to say.trial counsel daughter,who served as during the trial,and was present for the meeting,testified that bucci appeared genuinely upset.
bucci offered a starkly different account of this meeting.she testified that trial counsel was accompanied not only by his daughter but by hemstreet himself.bucci stated that she spoke privately with counsel and told him she could not testify because she had falsified her affidavit.she explained that on the night of the murder she left work as soon as her shift ended,and thus was not present to witness hiep and bentz return to the bar alone,as she had attested.bucci further denied ever telling counsel or his daughter that the police had threatened her or her family members.
bucci mother testified that she did not remember whether or not the police had visited her in,and she did not remember being threatened.bucci sister testified that she was not present for the detectives visit,but that her mother told her that the police had come to her house asking to speak with jeanette.she stated that her mother gave no indication that the detectives had threatened her.the detectives themselves testified that they only visited bucci mother house in order to locate bucci herself,and that they never threatened bucci or her family members.they explained that their conversation with bucci mother consisted solely of a brief inquiry as to bucci whereabouts.
the district court the testimony of bucci mother and sister,as well as the detectives who interviewed bucci in there was not sufficient evidence to support a finding that the police had actually threatened or intimidated bucci or that their conduct would be regarded by a reasonable individual as threatening.hemstreet iii,wl,at.nevertheless,the district court found that bucci had conveyed clearly to richman a feeling of intimidation,whether or not reasonable.id.emphasis added.
the court reasoned that the only way it could justly deny petitioner habeas petition is if it were convinced that bucci testimony together with her prior exculpatory statements and affidavit at the time of the trial could not have raised a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors.id.at.applying this standard,the court concluded that even if it were to find bucci recantation it did counsel acted unreasonably in failing to compel her testimony based on what he knew at the time.see id.at.
the court further concluded that trial counsel deficient performance prejudiced hemstreet,since bucci exculpatory testimony,even with a possible recantation likely would have raised a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury.id.at.the court found that the outcome of hemstreet direct appeal likely would have been different had appellate counsel raised the issue of trial counsel ineffectiveness.see id.at.
discussion 
standards of review 
we review a district court decision to grant or deny a habeas petition de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.policano herbert,cir gersten senkowski,cir.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,a federal court may grant a habeas petition based on a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court where such adjudication resulted in a decision that involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d see harris kuhlmann,cir.the appellate division rejection of hemstreet coram nobis petition on the grounds that hemstreet had failed to establish that he was denied the effective assistance of appellate counsel,people hemstreet,at,represents an adjudication on the merits for purposes of d.see mosby senkowski,cir jimenez walker,cir.
hemstreet ineffective assistance claim,moreover,necessarily invokes federal law that has been clearly established by the supreme court within the meaning of aedpa.sellan kuhlman,cir.the supreme court set forth the test for such claims in strickland washington,d.to establish ineffective assistance of counsel under strickland,hemstreet must demonstrate that his counsel performance was deficient,and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.strickland,at.the first component requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.id.the second requires a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.
to establish eligibility for habeas relief under aedpa deferential standard,hemstreet must demonstrate that the appellate division application of strickland was not merely incorrect,but objectively unreasonable.loliscio goord,cir quoting williams taylor,d.an objectively unreasonable application involves s ome increment of incorrectness beyond error.sellan,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court summarily concluded that the appellate division denial of hemstreet coram nobis petition was an unreasonable application of strickland because the trial and direct appeal could not reasonably be relied upon as having produced a just result.hemstreet iii,wl,at.although the district court adverted to aedpa deferential standard of review,we are not persuaded that it was correctly applied.we need not determine conclusively whether the district court misapplied aedpa because we find that hemstreet failed to carry the less stringent,though still weighty,burden of proving that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.see,greiner wells,cir noting that because petitioner ineffective assistance claim fails,w e need not consider the propriety of the district court other its application of the heightened aedpa deference of d eze senkowski,cir observing that the heavy burden of showing ineffective assistance is enhanced by the added hurdle posed by the highly deferential review accorded state court adjudications under aedpa citations omitted.because hemstreet can not demonstrate ineffective assistance under strickland,it follows that he can not demonstrate that the appellate division denial of his petition was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law 
under strickland,we indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.united states kurti,cir quoting strickland,at.a principal basis for the district court original decision to grant hemstreet petition,as well as for this court affirmance of that decision,was trial counsel failure to seek relief for the intimidation of bucci,a crucial defense witness.hemstreet i,at.but on remand the district court found insufficient evidence to conclude that bucci actually had been intimidated,and also found that a reasonable person would not have perceived the detectives conduct to be intimidating.hemstreet iii,wl,at.
we believe that these findings,in and of themselves,largely eviscerate hemstreet ineffective assistance claim.nonetheless,the district court relied on bucci allegedly having conveyed to trial counsel a subjective feeling of intimidation,whether or not reasonable,in concluding that counsel had acted unreasonably by failing to pursue the issue.see id.at.to reach that conclusion the district court curiously dismissed,as entitled to little or no weight,id.at,the more direct explanation trial counsel offered for why he decided not to pursue bucci testimony more,that he feared her testimony might not be favorable to hemstreet.instead,the district court relied on trial counsel sparman affidavit,in which he offered no explanation at all for not calling bucci as a witness,along with his representation to the trial court that bucci told him that she had been intimidated see see also sparman edwards,cir per curiam.we previously found this evidence,however inconclusive,sufficient to support a claim of ineffective assistance.hemstreet i,at.but after our remand our understanding of the circumstances surrounding counsel decisions at trial has become more complete.once we accept the district court conclusion that there was no evidence that bucci had actually been intimidated,we are to understand how trial counsel could be faulted for not pursuing the issue.
although we do not believe trial counsel performance was deficient,we are not required to resolve that issue.even assuming such deficiency,the record does not show that hemstreet suffered prejudice from any alleged omissions by his counsel.we therefore conclude that hemstreet can not satisfy the strickland standard as to the assistance he received at trial.see strickland,at.t here is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.hemstreet inability to make this showing means that he also can not demonstrate that his appellate counsel had any obligation to raise the issue of trial counsel ineffectiveness on direct appeal.
even though bucci was not actually intimidated,even though it was unclear what her testimony would have added to hemstreet defense,and even though calling her was,in counsel view,risky,the district court concluded that hemstreet was prejudiced because trial counsel should have,but failed to,compel the testimony of this crucial alibi witness.hemstreet iii,wl,at see id.at.specifically,the court found that in light of bucci affidavit,along with her contemporaneous consistent statements to the police,t he actual innocence of hemstreet can not be ruled out.id.because we disagree that bucci testimony would have been sufficiently probative to alter t
