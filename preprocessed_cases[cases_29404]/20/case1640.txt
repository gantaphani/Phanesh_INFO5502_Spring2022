a jury convicted michael bigelow of kidnapping,felonious assault and arson for his alleged involvement in an attack on a woman in toledo,ohio on june.from his initial arrest to the present,bigelow has insisted that he did not commit the crime and indeed could not have committed the crime because he was residing and working miles away in columbus,ohio on the day of the assault.at each stage in the state court,in his state proceedings,and now in his federal habeas corpus also has claimed that his lawyer,peter rost,did not adequately investigate this alibi defense,most notably by failing to identify three witnesses who could have placed bigelow in columbus on the day of the assault.
in one sense,it is easier to sympathize with rost than with bigelow when it comes to this claim.bigelow lived an itinerant life in columbus he did not remember exactly where he was in columbus on the day of the crime he did not fully communicate all possible leads to rost and apparently did not inform him about his own investigation efforts from prison and rost in fact did pursue many leads,none of which bore fruit.until four days before bigelow trial,it is indeed difficult to rost efforts,frustrating as they were,to advance his client defense.
on the fourth day before the commencement of the criminal trial,however,vernon greenlee,an employee of orkin pest control,called rost and told him that he could place bigelow in columbus on the day of the crime.greenlee call was prompted by a letter that bigelow had written to orkin from prison.realizing the significance of this testimony,rost subpoenaed greenlee and one other orkin employee to testify at the trial.the testimony was helpful because greenlee identified bigelow in court as the man he saw at the home of gary chasen in columbus on june,the day of the assault,but the testimony was vulnerable to impeachment because greenlee worked at the house at issue on two consecutive days.in convicting bigelow,the jury apparently was swayed by the two primary pieces of evidence submitted by the testimony of the victim who was able to pick bigelow out of a lineup and identify him at trial based on brief glances at him during the assault and the testimony of an individual who claimed to see bigelow from the back and side running across a field away from the crime scene.
in rejecting bigelow claim,the state courts and federal district court focused primarily on whether an alibi witness contacted rost during the week before trial and whether rost failed to return the phone call.the state courts found as a matter of fact that rost did not know about any other alibi witnesses before the trial.the district court properly respected this finding in view of the competing evidence on the issue and the rigorous requirements for rejecting such a finding under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat.
the problem with the district court decision is that it did not address the other aspect of bigelow sixth amendment claim rost failure to conduct any additional investigation after the sudden appearance of greenlee four days before trial.while the state urges us to reject this alternative argument on our own,we refuse to do so in view of the seriousness of the claim.once greenlee appeared,rost had ample reasons to himself to finding additional alibi witnesses in the columbus by asking for a postponement of the trial,by hiring an investigator or by traveling to columbus himself to talk firsthand to the other people that might have been working at the same house as greenlee and apparently bigelow on june.had rost pursued any of these options,he likely would have identified three other witnesses,all of whom have since come forward to testify that they saw bigelow in columbus on the day of the attack and none of whom had a prior relationship with bigelow or any other reason to be untruthful.
whether rost failure to take additional action after being contacted by greenlee constituted ineffective assistance deserves consideration by the district court in the first instance and possibly an evidentiary hearing.as the united states supreme court first indicated in strickland washington,d,and reaffirmed just recently in wiggins smith,d,the respect that attorneys strategic decisions in a criminal trial will receive is proportionate to the extent of the investigation they in fact conducted.see strickland,at.s trategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.as the case comes to us,there is no indication that rost performed any further investigation after greenlee came though his alibi testimony was sufficiently important that rost put him on the stand virtually sight unseen.for these reasons and those elaborated below,we vacate the judgment of the district court,remand the case to the district court and allow it to consider in the first instance whether to grant the writ on the basis of this claim.
a.the criminal trial 
on the morning of june,charlotte schrier,a real estate agent,was sitting in her car behind an apartment complex in toledo,ohio,waiting for her next appointment.at some point she felt a tap on her left shoulder,and she heard a man voice telling her not to move as he entered the back seat of her car.although she could detect his presence in the back seat,she obeyed his commands to face forward and not turn around.
at some point,the man instructed her to start the car and proceed out of the complex.after schrier drove a short distance,he asked her to pull over and light his cigarette.schrier did as asked,then resumed driving.while she was driving,the man threatened her multiple times,saying he wanted to injure her physically and see her bleed.
at some point,the attacker asked schrier to pull over again.this time,he got out of the car,opened her door,and pulled her out by the hair.he first instructed her to lean into the back seat,but then told her to get up again.schrier stood up and faced the car,with the attacker behind and to her right.his hand suddenly swung down in front of her face,and she noticed that he was holding a razor blade.pressing the blade into her hand,he told her that he wanted her to cut her own arm.when she hesitated,his arm swung again and he either cut or forced charlotte to cut her arm with the blade.she then turned around to face him,kicked him in the groin and managed to escape.after schrier fled,the assailant apparently set her car on fire.
schrier gave a statement about the attack to detective kulakoski on the day after the incident.she described her attacker,brown pants and tennis his physical male,late to early,or,no facial hair or visible tattoos and a very close,almost haircut.ja.after giving this statement,schrier looked through photograph arrays and did so again on several other occasions,but she never recognized any of the men as her attacker.ja.an initial attempt by police to create a composite sketch of the assailant failed to produce a passable likeness.a police artist later attempted a drawing of the man based on schrier input,the end result of which looked much like her attacker,schrier concluded,prompting police to distribute copies of the sketch to patrol officers and to local media on july.
the next day,police brought bigelow in for questioning based on his resemblance to the man in the drawing.they photographed him,and included his picture in a photo array shown to schrier.she pointed out bigelow photo to detective kulakoski but noted that she did not remember the deep lines in his face and could not be certain that this was her attacker unless she saw him in person.several hours later,schrier identified bigelow in a,and he was detained.bigelow maintained his innocence and rejected a plea offer that included a prison sentence.his case proceeded to trial five months later.
at trial,the state presented charlotte schrier testimony,as well as the testimony of thomas mermer.mermer had been near the scene of the incident and had radioed for help.after doing so,he noticed a man running into the field behind schrier burning car.mermer testified that he could see the man only from the side and behind,ja unlike schrier,the police never showed mermer any photo arrays or asked him to attend a.two weeks before trial,however,mermer saw bigelow giving an interview on television and identified him as the man he saw running into the field on the day of the crime.ja.the state did not introduce any other evidence connecting bigelow to the crime.
the defense claimed that bigelow was in columbus,ohio,miles southeast of toledo,on june,the day of the attack.in support of this alibi defense,it relied on two witnesses.john laughner,the columbus branch manager of orkin pest control,testified that his office records showed that vernon greenlee,an employee of orkin,had worked at the columbus home of gary chasen over a period of two days,including from to on june.ja.greenlee also testified,and he confirmed that he treated the chasen home for termites on the.ja.he testified that a man had helped him move some objects from the garage so he could perform the treatment,and that the man was present when greenlee arrived and when he left.ja.greenlee identified bigelow in court as the man who helped him in the garage on june.ja.his testimony also acknowledged,however,that he had failed to identify bigelow photograph in an array shown to him by police,that he had worked at the chasen home over two consecutive days,not just on the date of the crime,and that he had performed between fifty and one hundred jobs since june of that year.bigelow did not testify.
the jury convicted bigelow of kidnapping,felonious assault and arson,and the trial court sentenced him to consecutive prison terms,which together created a twenty to year prison term.bigelow unsuccessfully appealed his conviction.he then filed a petition for state relief claiming he had received ineffective assistance of trial counsel because his lawyer had not adequately investigated his alibi defense.the state trial court denied bigelow petition,but the appeals court remanded for an evidentiary hearing.after hearing testimony from the three alibi witnesses whom bigelow claimed his attorney should have identified before trial,the court again denied his petition,the appeals court affirmed,and the state supreme court denied review.bigelow filed this suit for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,again claiming ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of his sixth and fourteenth amendment rights.
bigelow allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel 
bigelow first complained about the ineffectiveness of his lawyer in a letter to the state court before trial.the letter prompted the court to conduct a hearing on november,to determine whether bigelow lawyer,peter rost,should be replaced.at the hearing,rost explained the difficulties of representing bigelow and the investigative work he had undertaken on behalf of his client.among the difficulties in supporting the alibi defense were that bigelow could not remember exactly where in columbus he had been on june and that bigelow suffered from a mental illness,which contributed to his inability to aid the defense.ja.
despite these challenges,rost noted that bigelow had provided him with a list of names and possible but one of which rost had pursued by telephone.in particular,rost talked on the telephone to gary chasen,who besides being the owner of indian mound road where greenlee had worked on june,also owned rental property in columbus where bigelow at one point had lived.chasen told rost he could not confirm that bigelow was in columbus on the.similarly,dan watson and deborah gray,who also owned a home in columbus where bigelow had rented a room,were unable to remember whether bigelow was with them on the.at rost request,they checked the records of the telephone line that bigelow shared with them to see if bigelow had placed any calls to his friends or family on that date.the records showed only calls for june and june,but not june.rost followed up on other leads that watson and gray provided,but they too proved unsuccessful.rost next contacted greyhound bus to determine whether bigelow had traveled to columbus around june greyhound informed rost that they did not have passenger records from june.rost then called bigelow physician and dentist in columbus to determine whether bigelow had attended an appointment with either of them on june their records showed he had not.finally,rost searched bigelow personal papers for documentation that could establish bigelow presence in columbus on june,but again to no avail.after hearing about these efforts,the trial judge denied bigelow motion for a change of counsel.
on the day after this hearing,bigelow began his own investigation.he wrote two letters from his prison to orkin pest control,the other to moonlighting landscape and lighting.in both letters,he asked whether anyone at the companies could verify his presence at gary chasen home at indian mound road on june and asked them to contact rost if they had any such information.at orkin,laughner received bigelow letter,checked his records of work performed,and learned that greenlee had in fact been there.he spoke to greenlee,who remembered seeing and talking to bigelow that day.on the evening of thursday,november days before the trial was to begin on monday,november telephoned rost about his recollection of bigelow at the chasen home on june.the phone call apparently did not spur rost into performing any further investigation,though he did subpoena laughner and greenlee and did present their testimony at trial.
bigelow second letter,to moonlighting landscape,also arrived at its intended destination.christine patridge a checked the company records and learned that she,vic timler also a and jay loyzelle an employee had all been at the chasen home on june.like orkin,they had been hired by chasen to help prepare his home and yard for his daughter wedding.all three recalled seeing bigelow on june and either having an extended encounter with bigelow or noticing an idiosyncratic feature of his behavior or appearance.patridge recalled that bigelow talked to her for an extended period of time,and that he was very inquisitive about their landscaping work.ja.timler noticed bigelow oddly trimming a boxwood shrub with scissors and noticed that he was dressed atypically for yard work.ja.loyzelle saw bigelow there both when he arrived in the morning and when he left late in the day,ja,he spoke with bigelow for quite a while and he recalled that bigelow cut his hand and asked for a band aid,ja.
the three witnesses agree that one of them likely patridge contacted gary chasen to tell chasen about bigelow letter and their memories of him being there.chasen,however,told patridge that it was better not to get involved and that she should ignore the letter.ja.nonetheless,patridge claimed that she called rost and left him a message,but she could not remember when she did so and whether she left the message on an answering machine or with rost assistant.ja.rost claimed that he never received any message from patridge and did not learn of the existence of the moonlighting witnesses until he read bigelow state petition.bigelow insisted that he told rost about both the orkin and moonlighting letters.ja.
bigelow essential claim,in both the state and federal proceedings,is that rost failed to satisfy the minimal requirements of effective advocacy because he did not adequately investigate bigelow alibi defense.as a factual matter,bigelow claims that rost knew about the moonlighting landscape lead,either because bigelow told him or because he received the message from christine patridge,and accordingly rost failure to contact these witnesses and present their testimony at trial constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.regardless of whether rost actually knew about the moonlighting employees before trial,bigelow adds that rost failure to investigate adequately still constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.had his investigation been more,had rost obtained court funds for and hired an investigator,traveled to the location of bigelow alibi or at least investigated further once he learned that greenlee could place bigelow at the chasen residence on the day of the undoubtedly would have uncovered the moonlighting employees.the ohio courts rejected these arguments,as did the federal district court,determining that rost assistance was not ineffective under strickland washington.
in reviewing the denial of a habeas petition,we consider the district court legal conclusions anew,applying the same standard of review to the state court decision that the district court applied.see smith hofbauer,cir.that standard of review is supplied by antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,stat.when a state court has already adjudicated a federal constitutional claim,aedpa establishes that the writ of habeas corpus may issue in just two instances if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d or if the state court decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,id.d.
to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,a petitioner must show that his lawyer performance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced the defense.strickland,at.in establishing the first requirement,the petitioner must demonstrate that his lawyer performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness as measured by prevailing professional norms.id.at.judicial review of the lawyer performance must be highly deferential,and indulge a strong presumption that a lawyer conduct in discharging his duties falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,since reasonable lawyers may disagree on the appropriate strategy for defending a client.id.at.while strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts are virtually unchallengeable,strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.in other words,counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.id.at.see also wigginton,cir a failure to investigate,especially as to key evidence,must be supported by a reasoned and deliberate determination that investigation was not warranted.aba standards for criminal justice a ed.defense counsel should conduct a prompt investigation of the circumstances of the case and explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty in the event of conviction.
in establishing prejudice,bigelow must demonstrate a reasonable probability that the result of his trial would have been different but for rost mistakes.strickland,at.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome,but something less than a showing that the outcome more likely than not would have been different,id.at.while the petitioner need not conclusively demonstrate his actual innocence,compare schlup delo,d requiring petitioner to establish more likely than not that a reasonable juror would not have convicted him,with strickland,at.we believe that a defendant need not show that counsel deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome in the case,the focus should be on whether the result of the trial was fundamentally unfair or unreliable,lockhart fretwell,d.
bigelow first claims that rost knew about the moonlighting landscape employees but refused to communicate with them about testifying as alibi witnesses.in the state courts and in the district court,no one has debated whether this allegation,if true,would present a serious sixth amendment claim.for the failure to call a known alibi witness generally would constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.see,matthews abramajtys,cir blackburn foltz,cir.rather,the debate has been joined on the question whether the facts support the claim,an issue that the state courts resolved against bigelow.
in bringing this claim,bigelow thus must overcome the state court factual finding that pete rost was not aware of christine patridge,victor timler,or jay loyzelle as additional witnesses who would support bigelow alibi defense.ja.that is no small task.under aedpa,we presume that the state court factual findings are correct,and the petitioner bears the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e see mitchell mason,cir.
although the record reveals some support for his position,bigelow has not rebutted this presumption of correctness.at the evidentiary hearing,rost testified that bigelow did not tell him about the letter to the landscape company and that he did not know about these potential witnesses.bigelow,however,gave inconsistent testimony.he first stated that he told rost about the letters,and that he remembered doing so because he had put rost home and work phone numbers in the letter presumably so rost would expect any resulting calls.ja.but on,bigelow admitted that he did tell pete about the letters because the other leads,like the people said earlier,were no good that i gave to pete rost.ja.
patridge testimony that she left a message for rost also does not undermine the state court finding.her testimony at the hearing,as an initial matter,conflicted with her affidavit in which she stated that she ignored the letter from bigelow after talking to chasen,who discouraged her from getting involved in the case.patridge also could not remember when she left the message,and given the proximity between the date of bigelow letter to moonlighting november and the date of the trial november,she may well have called after,possibly well after,the trial.and even if she left the message before trial,it requires few inferences to believe that rost did not get the message,whether patridge left it on an answering machine or with rost assistant.in view of the deferential standard of review that applies in this setting,the district court correctly rejected bigelow challenge to this factual finding and correctly rejected this ground for granting the writ.
bigelow next argues that rost failure to investigate after he became aware of the greenlee evidence constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.in the words of bigelow appellate brief 
once defense counsel learned of the orkin witnesses,he had an obligation to on the orkin information and pursue this lead.from orkin,defense counsel learned that bigelow was on the chasen property on june.from orkin,defense counsel knew that chasen had been wrong about bigelow being on the property on june.he now had the tools to refresh chasen memory with this new information.had defense counsel followed up on this information,moonlighting presence at the chasen home,which corroborated orkin testimony,could have been easily discovered.
appellant br.at.bigelow raised the same argument in the district court,traverse to respondent return of writ at,and in state court,mem.for pet r,ja.in some contrast to his challenge to the state court factual finding,bigelow may prevail on this claim if he can show that the state court application of supreme court precedent in this area was objectively unreasonable.wiggins.at.
even though bigelow raised this issue below and in state court,the district court did not address because the issue was obscured by the understandable focus in state court and in the district court on whether rost in fact knew about these other alibi witnesses.in response,the state asks us to affirm the judgment nonetheless,arguing that the claim is meritless.we disagree.the claim is sufficiently serious that it warrants consideration by the district court in the first instance and may even warrant an evidentiary hearing.even after looking at the issue through the prism of aedpa,the state has not shown that bigelow claim under strickland prong one the adequacy of counsel performance or prong two prejudice to the defendant deserves plenary rejection by us.to the ends of facilitating the district court consideration of these issues,we offer some explanation for rejecting the state invitation to reject this claim at this stag
