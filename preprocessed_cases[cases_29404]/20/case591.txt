given the fundamental importance of the right to a jury trial in our justice system,many states have promulgated rules,akin to the federal rules of criminal procedure,prescribing that the waiver of that right be and approved by a court before a defendant enters a guilty plea or proceeds by way of trial.as a general matter,such procedures are diligently followed to ensure a defendant waiver is knowing and voluntary but,on occasion,there are lapses.in this case,petitioner counsel discussed with him generally the right to a jury trial but failed to secure an waiver or to apprise petitioner of all aspects of his jury trial right before proceeding with a bench trial conduct the district court determined established ineffective assistance of counsel under strickland washington,and justified the grant of habeas relief.
on appeal by the commonwealth,we are called upon to decide whether counsel deficiency on these facts gave rise to structural error,such that strickland prejudice might be presumed,or whether petitioner is still required to establish prejudice.because we conclude a showing of prejudice is required,we also have occasion to address the nature of that showing and to modify our holding in united states lilly,cir,in light of intervening supreme court precedent.as we hold the proper prejudice inquiry in this situation is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that,but for his counsel deficient performance,petitioner would have exercised his sixth amendment right to a jury trial,and petitioner here has failed to make that showing,we will reverse the judgment of the district court.
factual background and procedural history 
petitioner george vickers conviction stems from an incident in which vickers punched the victim a single time but that punch caused severe injuries.as reflected in the record from his trial,the victim first encountered vickers at a bar where vickers was socializing with the victim.after a brief stay at the bar,the victim left to catch a bus home.while waiting at the bus stop,the victim was struck from behind in the upper neck,shoulder,and back area,which caused him to stumble.app.though he did not know who shoved him,as he stumbled,he looked up and saw george vickers,who was a step and a half away.app.within seconds of being shoved,the victim was struck over his right eye by what he thought was a closed fist and fell to the ground,unconscious.app.the victim suffered numerous serious injuries,including a fractured skull,brain hemorrhaging,and bruising of the brain,and was in a coma for four days as a result of the blow.vickers was charged with aggravated assault,recklessly endangering another person,harassment,and disorderly conduct.
the issues on appeal all concern the adequacy of the legal representation vickers received in connection with the waiver of his right to a jury trial.pennsylvania law provides that in order for a criminal case to be tried without a jury,t he judge shall ascertain from the defendant whether this is a knowing and intelligent waiver,and such colloquy shall appear on the record.the waiver shall be in writing,made a part of the record,and signed by the defendant,the attorney for the commonwealth,the judge,and the defendant attorney as a witness.code.vickers was originally represented by private counsel,and although his case was placed on the court of common pleas calendar as a bench trial,these procedures were not followed in vickers case.vickers private counsel later withdrew from his representation and,just a few weeks before vickers bench trial was to commence,an assistant public defender was assigned to the case.because the case was already calendared as a bench trial,vickers new counsel presumed,without confirming,that vickers had formally waived his right to a jury trial at an earlier point,and the bench trial went forward as scheduled.the judge who presided found vickers guilty on all counts and sentenced him to seven to fourteen years imprisonment.
following his conviction,vickers filed a petition for relief under pennsylvania relief act pcra.in that petition he claimed,among other things,that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel because trial counsel misled him on his right to have a jury trial,and failed to obtain a valid waiver of that right before proceeding with a bench trial.app.the pcra court held an evidentiary hearing,at which vickers trial counsel and vickers testified regarding counsel representation.
according to the testimony of counsel,when counsel saw the case was already scheduled as a bench trial he assumed there had been a normal waiver at the bar and whatnot like that,and,based on that assumption,did not conduct any investigation to determine what,in fact,occurred with regard to the waiver of vickers jury trial rights.app.counsel also testified,however,that he had spoken with vickers generally,about the right to a jury trial,app,that he advised vickers as to his right to have men and women decide the facts of the case as opposed to a judge deciding the facts,and just the fundamentals,app,and that he understood vickers to be familiar with the criminal justice system because vickers informed him that he had been charged with a felony in a neighboring county the previous year.counsel further testified that he inquired of vickers every time they spoke,including on the day of the trial,whether vickers wanted a jury trial or a bench trial,and vickers consistently wanted to proceed with the scheduled bench trial.
counsel testimony also detailed his strategic discussions with vickers which,in counsel view,had led vickers to opt for a bench trial.for example,counsel testified he told vickers that he believed vickers best chance of prevailing on the felony charge of aggravated assault was to emphasize that this was a case,and to argue that vickers did not have the requisite intent to cause the serious bodily injury necessary to support a conviction a narrow legal issue he told vickers might be lost to a panel of jurors,but might be appreciated by a judge who could more reliably distinguish between the aggravating factors.app.counsel elaborated that he warned vickers that there were risks associated with a bench trial because this courtroom can be a conservative with personal injuries,and that a judge prerogative when they listen to the evidence,app,but he ultimately recommended that vickers pursue a bench trial for strategic reasons.according to counsel,vickers never expressed a preference for a jury trial during these tactical conversations,app,but rather indicated he wanted to go forward with a bench trial,app.
counsel could not recall specifically what he told vickers about his right to a jury trial and did not state and was not specifically asked by vickers pcra counsel if he informed vickers that any jury verdict would have to be unanimous.nonetheless,while counsel acknowledged that he did not go through the whole colloquy form with vickers,app,he confirmed that he firmly believed,as a result of his many conversations with vickers leading up to trial and vickers past experience with the criminal justice system,that vickers was aware of his right to proceed by jury trial instead of a bench trial,understood the difference between the two,and chose to go forward with a bench trial.app.
vickers testimony at the pcra hearing painted a very different picture.vickers testified that he advised his counsel during several phone conversations that it was his intent to take this to a jury trial,app,that he had no understanding at the time of the trial that he was giving up this right,and that he first discovered that he had a constitutional right to a jury trial when doing legal research for his appeal while incarcerated.before that point,according to vickers,he mistakenly thought only a majority of the jury was required to return a guilty verdict but,even on that mistaken assumption,he believed this majority rules system was preferable to relying on the sole discretion of a judge,app,and would have exercised his right to a jury trial had he been given the opportunity.
on,when presented with a guilty plea form that he had signed in in connection with one of his prior convictions,vickers acknowledged he had signed the form and had checked the boxes on it that appeared next to each of the rights attendant to a jury trial,but he asserted he had not read the form.that form provided that,by pleading guilty,vickers was waiving his right to a jury trial and all attendant rights,including the right to have a ll members of the jury finely selected be satisfied that the commonwealth had proven his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on each charge,that is,the vote of all must be guilty before he can be found guilty.app.
the pcra court carefully evaluated the conflicting testimony presented at the hearing and found the testimony of counsel credible and the testimony of george vickers not credible.app.accordingly,the court reasoned that,even though vickers had not waived his right to a jury trial in writing or orally on the record,he was not denied effective assistance of counsel because he made a strategic decision to pursue a bench trial and freely,voluntarily,and intelligently waived his jury trial rights.app.
the pennsylvania superior court affirmed,finding no basis to disturb the pcra court credibility determinations,and concluding,like the pcra court,that because vickers waiver of his jury trial right was knowing and voluntary,he had not established that he received ineffective assistance of counsel app.
his state remedies exhausted,vickers filed a petition for habeas relief pursuant to in which he his claim that counsel was ineffective for proceeding with a bench trial when vickers had not waived his right to a jury trial the district court agreed with vickers,holding that the superior court decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,because,irrespective of the testimony at the pcra hearing,the record reflected that there was no written or oral waiver of vickers right to a jury trial.vickers wenerowicz,wl,at,citing to the familiar test for claims set forth in strickland washington,the district court determined,first,that counsel performance was constitutionally deficient for failing to obtain a formal waiver,and,second,albeit without discussing what prejudice must be shown in this circumstance or whether vickers had made that showing,that vickers also was prejudiced by his counsel deficient performance.vickers,wl,at.accordingly,the district court held vickers was entitled to relief here,and granted him a writ of habeas corpus id.the commonwealth timely appealed,and we appointed amicus curiae to assist vickers in his appellate proceedings 
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under and we have jurisdiction under.because the district court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing,our review of the district court grant of vickers petition is plenary.mcmullen tennis,cir.
iii.analysis 
our review of habeas claims is governed by the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,which instructs that where,as here,a state court has rejected a petitioner claim on the merits,a federal court may not grant the writ unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court precedent,or if it confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from that reached by the supreme court.eley erickson,cir.alteration and citation omitted quoting williams taylor.a decision contains an unreasonable application of clearly established law if no fairminded jurist could agree with the state court decision.harrington richter.
while a determination that a state court analysis is contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law is necessary to grant habeas relief,it is not alone sufficient.that is because,despite applying an improper analysis,the state court still may have reached the correct result,and a federal court can only grant the great writ if it is firmly convinced that a federal constitutional right has been violated,williams,at.see also horn banks,w hile it is of course a necessary prerequisite to federal habeas relief that a prisoner satisfy the aedpa standard of review none of our cases have suggested that a writ of habeas corpus should automatically issue if a prisoner satisfies the aedpa standard.thus,when a federal court reviewing a habeas petition concludes that the state court analyzed the petitioner claim in a manner that contravenes clearly established federal law,it then must proceed to review the merits of the claim de novo to evaluate if a constitutional violation occurred see lafler cooper.
below,we first address whether aedpa deference to the state court denial of relief was warranted,concluding that it was not because the state court analysis was contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent.we then turn to our own de novo review of vickers claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.
aedpa deference 
the commonwealth contends on appeal that the judgment should be reversed because the district court failed to accord appropriate deference to the state court under aedpa,and,applying proper deference,the superior court did not engage in an unreasonable application of strickland.we agree with the commonwealth that the district court erred,but not because it failed to apply aedpa deference.
indeed,as a threshold matter,we conclude that no aedpa deference is warranted here because the superior court failed to apply strickland altogether,resulting in a decision contrary to clearly established federal law.that is,even though the superior court correctly identified strickland as controlling,it concluded there was no ineffective assistance of counsel on the ground that vickers waiver of his right to a jury trial was knowing and voluntary.that,however,is precisely the reasoning that the supreme court held was contrary to strickland in lafler cooper,where the state court had concluded there was no ineffective assistance of counsel merely because it found petitioner rejection of a plea offer to be knowing and voluntary.id.at.declining to accord aedpa deference,the supreme court held that a n inquiry into whether the rejection of a plea is knowing and voluntary is not the correct means by which to address a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,and,because the state court fail ed to apply strickland to assess the claim petitioner raised,its adjudication was contrary to clearly established federal law.id.in vickers case,in other words,the superior court decision was contrary to both strickland and lafler.
this conclusion,however,does not end our inquiry or require that the great writ be granted.instead,as in lafler itself,it merely forfeits the aedpa deference to which the state court denial of relief would otherwise be entitled and dictates that we review vickers strickland claim de novo.see lafler,at breakiron horn,cir.that is,we no longer owe deference to the state court legal conclusions,wiggins smith,but still must presume that factual findings including its credibility findings are correct unless the presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence,breakiron,at jacobs horn,cir.bearing in mind the applicable standard of review,we turn to the merits of vickers claim.
de novo review of vickers claim 
reviewing vickers claim of ineffective assistance of counsel de novo,we consider,first,whether counsel performance was deficient and,second,whether vickers has established the requisite prejudice.
strickland performance prong 
we begin with strickland performance prong.when assessing whether a petitioner has demonstrated that his attorney representation was constitutionally deficient,we look to the facts of the particular case,viewed as of the time of counsel conduct,strickland,at,and evaluate whether counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms,id.at.
vickers has met this standard here because his attorney failure to ensure that he properly waived his right to a jury trial was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.id.at.the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of a criminal defendant sixth amendment right to a trial by jury and that this right may only be ceded by a knowing,voluntary,and intelligent waiver.see schneckloth bustamonte,adams ex rel.mccann.and the importance of this fundamental right is reflected in both the federal rules of criminal procedure and the pennsylvania criminal code,which mandate that all waivers of jury trials be in writing,signed by both parties,and approved by the court on the record.see fed.crim.code.
of course,the touchstone is whether a defendant waiver is knowing and voluntary,so that the failure to comply with these procedures does not per se establish a constitutional violation.see gov t of virgin islands parrott,cir.commonwealth mallory.at the same time,however,compliance provides strong assurance ex ante that the defendant has been fully apprised of his right to a jury trial and that his waiver is not subject to constitutional challenge.as we have previously encouraged of our colleagues in the district court in the context of rule colloquies,such assurances by the defendant himself that his waiver is knowing and voluntary will help insulate a waiver from later attack by a defendant who claims he did not fully understand the nature of the right before he forfeited it and will create a record capable of withstanding subsequent challenges,satisfy the court responsibility,facilitate intelligent appellate review,conserve scarce judicial resources,and enhance the finality of criminal convictions.lilly,at internal quotation marks omitted.under prevailing professional norms,competent defense counsel is expected to ensure a criminal defendant receives the benefit of those procedures.
vickers counsel,on the other hand,did not conduct any investigation to determine whether vickers had been given an appropriate colloquy before his case was scheduled for a bench trial,and simply assumed there had been a normal waiver at the bar and whatnot like that,app.had counsel taken the minimal step of reviewing the case file,the docket,or the trial court record to confirm there had been a formal waiver or had he simply inquired of the trial court,opposing counsel,prior defense counsel,or his own client to verify that a proper waiver had occurred he would have discovered his assumption was in error and he could have ensured,consistent with the pennsylvania code,that the judge engaged in an appropriate colloquy and that vickers waived his jury trial right in writing before proceeding with a bench trial.yet,he did not.nor did counsel review the colloquy form privately with vickers to confirm that vickers was apprised of all attendant aspects of his right before he waived that right.
although we are sympathetic to the difficult position in which counsel was placed when he inherited this case only weeks before trial,prevailing professional norms required and continue to require counsel in this circumstance to verify,through a review of the record or an inquiry with the court or prior counsel,that the client formally waived his jury trial right.see rompilla beard,holding that counsel failure to examine court file on past conviction prior to sentencing constituted deficient performance kimmelman morrison,finding deficient performance where attorney failed to file a suppression motion not due to strategic considerations,but because he was unaware of the constitutional violation.because counsel failed to do so here,his conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.strickland,at.
strickland prejudice prong 
we turn next to the prejudice prong.when assessing strickland prejudice,we typically ask whether the petitioner has shown that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,with a reasonable probability meaning a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.here,however,between the arguments of the litigants and the relevant case law,we are confronted with two discrete ways to frame the prejudice analysis.
vickers argues that because counsel ineffectiveness deprived him of his right to a jury trial and the deprivation of that right constitutes structural error,prejudice under strickland must be presumed and vickers is automatically entitled to relief.the commonwealth,on the other hand,argues that prejudice can not be presumed and the relevant inquiry is whether the outcome of the proceeding would have been different had vickers been tried by a jury rather than a judge below,we address a whether prejudice even arguably could be presumed in this case b if not,what prejudice inquiry is appropriate and c how the proper prejudice inquiry applies to vickers case.
a whether prejudice should be presumed 
turning first to vickers contention that strickland prejudice can be presumed,the supreme court has long held that constitutional errors do not require automatic reversal,and that courts may apply a harmless error analysis to determine whether the mistake affected the outcome of the trial.chapman california.the supreme court has also held,however,that there are certain errors,deemed structural errors that so affect the framework within which the trial proceeds that they can not be subject to harmless error analysis.arizona fulminante.for example,the supreme court has identified the denial of the right to counsel of a defendant choice,united states,the denial of the right to a public trial,waller georgia,and the denial of the right to,mckaskle wiggins,as errors with consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate such that reversal is required without further analysis when they occur,at.see also united states lewis,cir.en banc smith,concurring reviewing categories of cases constituting structural error.
even accepting vickers premise that prejudice may be presumed when counsel deficient performance results in structural error vickers would not be entitled to such a presumption here because no structural error resulted from his counsel deficiency.
whether the deprivation of the jury trial right itself constitutes structural error is a question that neither the supreme court nor this court has squarely addressed.the supreme court has discussed the profound importance of the sixth amendment right to a jury trial,observing that the right reflect s a fundamental decision about the exercise of official power in our criminal justice system.duncan louisiana.and where a defendant has been completely denied the right to a jury trial because neither the trial court nor his attorney informs him of that right,at least one court of appeals has held the error is structural and prejudice should be presumed when evaluating an ineffective assistance claim.see mcgurk stenberg,cir.see also miller dormire,cir.
here,however,vickers does not and can not claim he suffered a total deprivation of his right to a jury trial as a result of his counsel deficiency.indeed,the record is unambiguous that vickers was apprised of his right to a jury trial because the state court found credible vickers counsel testimony that he and vickers discussed his right to a jury trial on multiple occasions a finding we must presume to be correct,even on de novo review,breakiron,at jacobs,at.rather,vickers argues that his waiver was rendered unintelligent and involuntary either because counsel failed to secure an waiver or because counsel did not specifically apprise him of all aspects of a jury trial,he was unaware of the requirement of juror unanimity when he waived.the premise of this second argument is dubious at best,given the pcra court to which we must defer id.even if we engage both arguments,however,they fail on the merits under controlling case law.
we have previously held,consistent with other courts of appeals that have addressed the issue,that an waiver,while probative and strongly encouraged,is not a prerequisite to a knowing and voluntary waiver and,hence,is not constitutionally required.parrott,at united states boynes,cir.united states rodriguez,cir.see also lilly,at noting in the rule context that,while strongly advisable,an waiver colloquy is not a constitutional requirement.as relevant here,then,its omission is not per se constitutional error,much less structural error.
nor has the supreme court or any court of appeals held to date that a defendant must be specifically apprised of the requirement of juror unanimity in order to knowingly and intelligently waive his right.on the contrary,the courts of appeals that have confronted that argument have rejected it.see sowell bradshaw,cir.holding that knowledge of the juror unanimity requirement is not constitutionally required in order for a defendant to give a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to a jury trial ex rel.williams derobertis,cir.holding the constitution requires only that the defendant understand that the choice confronting him was,on the one hand,to be judged by a group of people from the community,and on the other hand,to have his guilt or innocence determined by a judge and even rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,governing the necessary procedures to ensure that a guilty plea is knowing and voluntary,does not require that a defendant be specifically apprised of the requirement but only of his general right to a jury trial,to relinquish that right in connection with a plea waiver.see fed.crim.b c see also united states,cir.concluding that not even a rule violation,let alone a constitutional violation,occurred when defendant was not informed of his right to a unanimous jury as part of his plea colloquy.while this court has not yet opined on whether the failure to apprise a defendant of the unanimity requirement would render a waiver constitutionally infirm,it is sufficient for today purposes to observe that where there is a substantial question that such even results in constitutional error,it assuredly does not result in structural error.see neder united states,explaining that structural errors are a limited class of fundamental constitutional errors that defy analysis by harmless error standards.quoting fulminante,at.
our conclusion that prejudice must be demonstrated,not presumed,in this circumstance is further supported by the approach the supreme court and this court have taken in addressing similar claims in the past.in hill lockhart,the supreme court was presented with an claim based on counsel failure to inform a petitioner of the parole consequences of his guilty plea,and despite petitioner allegation that this lack of complete information about the right that he was relinquishing made his entire guilty plea involuntary and unintelligent,id.at an allegation closely tracking vickers the court explicitly held that a prejudice analysis was necessary before relief could be granted and proceeded to address that prong of the petitioner strickland claim,id.at.
likewise,in united states lilly,we were presented with a claim of ineffective assistance nearly identical to vickers when a petitioner,who had been in the courtroom when counsel waived his right in favor of a bench trial and who had signed a formal waiver form only after the trial,asserted that he had not been fully apprised of his right to a jury trial and thus had not waived it knowingly and voluntarily.at.to determine whether petitioner had established ineffective assistance,we did not simply presume prejudice but performed a traditional strickland prejudice analysis before ultimately concluding that he was not entitled to relief.id.at.thus,while we leave for another day whether a total failure to inform a defendant of his right to a jury trial could give rise to a claim of structural error,mcgurk,at,we hold,consistent with hill and lilly,where a defendant has been apprised of his basic right to a jury trial,counsel failure to inform him of certain aspects of that right does not give rise to structural error.and,absent structural error,there is no colorable argument that prejudice should be presumed in this case.
b determining the proper prejudice test 
having concluded that a showing of prejudice is required,we next address what that showing should be.the commonwealth argues in favor of the approach we articulated in lilly,where we held that a petitioner who was convicted upon a bench trial and claimed prejudice as a result of his counsel failure to ensure a valid waiver must show a reasonable probability that in the absence of counsel advice,another fact finder,a jury would have been reasonably likely to arrive at a different outcome.at.although lilly correctly reflects that we must address the prejudice question as part of our strickland analysis,a trio of supreme court cases explaining the appropriate inquiry in similar circumstances illustrates that a modification to lilly prejudice test is necessary.
first,in hill,as noted above,the court considered an claim based on counsel deficiently informing petitioner of the consequences of his guilty plea.at.when addressing strickland prejudice prong,the court did not focus on whether counsel deficient performance caused the outcome of the proceeding to change,the court did not speculate as to whether petitioner would have been convicted had he gone to trial instead of pleading but instead asked whether counsel constitutionally ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process.id.at.because the appropriate focus went to the process that led to petitioner forfeiting a constitutional right,the court held that the petitioner could demonstrate prejudice if he could show a reasonable probability that,but for counsel errors,he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.id.
in roe,the court applied similar reasoning when addressing the appropriate prejudice inquiry for a petitioner alleging that counsel deficient performance led him to forfeit his right to a direct appeal of his conviction.the court again framed the inquiry in terms of the process leading up to the petitioner decision to forego a judicial proceeding to which he was constitutionally entitled,holding that the petitioner could demonstrate prejudice if he could show that his counsel ineffective performance led to his not pursuing an appeal that he otherwise would have taken.id.at.because the petitioner had been deprived of the proceeding altogether,the court explained that it would be unfair to require a defendant to demonstrate that his hypothetical appeal might have had merit and a showing that but for counsel deficient conduct,he would have appealed was all that strickland requires.id.at.
most recently in lafler,the supreme court confirmed that this analysis,focusing on whether a petitioner lost his ability to exercise a constitutional protection he otherwise would have invoked,is necessary to evaluate prejudice for ineffective assistance claims alleging a defect in the process leading up to a judicial proceeding.at.in lafler,the petitioner claimed ineffective assistance when his counsel advised him against accepting a guilty plea by erroneously insisting that the prosecution would be unable to establish an element of the crime for which he was charged.at.thus,lafler presented the inverse of hill as,rather than being induced to accept a guilty plea as a result of counsel ineffectiveness,the petitioner in lafler alleged that his counsel deficient performance forced him to stand trial and receive a harsher sentence than he would have had he accepted the plea.id.at.
the court explicitly rejected the government argument that there could be no strickland prejudice because a fair trial wipes clean any deficient performance by defense counsel during plea bargaining,and held that the petitioner could show prejudice if he could demonstrate that but for counsel ineffective assistance,he and the trial court would have accepted the guilty plea.id.at.although acknowledging that the t he goal of a just result is not divorced from the reliability of a conviction,the court in lafler made explicit the principle underlying its decisions in hill and that when evaluating prejudice in the cont
