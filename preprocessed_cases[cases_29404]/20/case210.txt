vladimir grigous seeks review of the order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his motion to reopen his removal proceedings.after grigous missed a rescheduled hearing on his removability and asylum claim,the immigration judge ij ordered him removed in absentia.the petitioner then filed a motion to reopen removal proceedings,explaining that his attorney had a scheduling conflict.noting that the petitioner had not given any explanation for his own failure to appear before the court and that his attorney failure to notify the immigration court of the attorney inability to appear was inexcusable,the ij denied his motion.grigous appealed to the bia,claiming that the government had failed to provide him with notice of his hearing date in violation of and that he had not been advised in his native language of the consequences of not appearing at his hearing pursuant to in re,dec bia en banc.the bia summarily affirmed the ij denial of grigous motion to reopen.we deny grigous petition for review.
grigous,a citizen of ukraine,entered the united states on or about september,as a nonimmigrant visitor for pleasure with authorization to remain in the united states until march.he remained in the united states past that date and applied for asylum on february.on june,the government served him with a notice to appear,charging him with inadmissibility as a nonimmigrant visitor who remained in the united states longer than permitted,pursuant to a b of the immigration and nationality act ina,a b.we describe the proceedings before the ij,bia,and the district court below.
a.the ij and bia decisions 
a hearing with the ij was scheduled for february.grigous missed the hearing,and the ij ordered him removed in absentia.on february,an attorney,michael moore,entered an appearance for grigous and moved to reopen on the ground that grigous had been too ill to attend the february,hearing.the ij granted the motion to reopen and continued the hearing until may.for reasons that are not clear from the record,that hearing was rescheduled to august.moore then requested another continuance to accommodate his vacation schedule,and the hearing was rescheduled to august.a notice of that august,hearing date was mailed to moore.
neither grigous nor moore appeared at the august,hearing,and the ij again ordered grigous removed in absentia.on september,grigous,through moore,filed a second motion to reopen the proceedings,explaining that moore was in immigration court in hartford,connecticut,on august,and thus was unable to attend the hearing.the motion to reopen also noted that the ij had ordered removal to the united kingdom,rather than ukraine.
on september,the ij denied grigous motion to reopen.the ij found that grigous had failed to explain grigous failure to appear for the hearing on august,concluding that t o the extent that counsel excuse for his non appearance is justifiable,it does not relieve the respondent of his obligation to appear.the ij also noted that the fact that counsel for the respondent did not notify the boston immigration court of the conflict is inexcusable for he was duly notified of the hearing date and had sufficient time to protect the interest of both his clients by requesting permission not to appear from either court.for these reasons,the ij denied the motion.however,the ij issued an amended removal order correcting the country of removal to ukraine.
grigous appealed to the bia,arguing that he had not received notice of the hearing and that he was never warned of the consequences of his failure to appear in his native language.the bia summarily affirmed the ij decision on may.
grigous habeas petition 
on august,the petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court in connecticut,again challenging his in absentia removal order for lack of notice and appropriate warnings.on march,the district court stayed the petitioner deportation until further notice.because the petitioner was still represented by moore,the attorney who had received notice but did not appear at grigous hearing,the government petitioned the court for a conflict hearing to ascertain whether the petitioner wanted to continue to be represented by moore and whether he wished to waive any ineffective assistance of counsel claim against moore.the district court scheduled a conflict hearing,but continued it because grigous lacked an interpreter.moore then filed a motion for a change of venue,explaining that grigous had moved to massachusetts.
before the rescheduled conflict hearing took place and before the court ruled on the venue motion,the government filed a motion for a stay of proceedings,informing the court that moore had been disbarred from the massachusetts bar on august,for lying on his bar application.the government also noted that moore had previously been a member of the connecticut bar,but he had resigned in conjunction with grievance and criminal proceedings in.although moore had retained his admission to practice in the federal district court in connecticut,civil proceedings were about to commence on that admission as well.because moore was no longer licensed to practice law in any jurisdiction,the government sought to stay proceedings until moore either withdrew from the case or until the civil proceedings on his authorization to practice in the district court had concluded.the government did not object to continuing the stay of deportation until the issue was resolved.
on october,the district court granted the motion for the stay of proceedings and continued the stay of deportation.on october,a new attorney,robert lucheme,appeared on behalf of grigous,claiming to replace moore.lucheme filed a motion for decision,explaining that there is no claim for ineffective assistance of counsel and that any such claim would be procedurally barred in any event.the motion stated that the only issue in this case was whether grigous had received the proper notice of his missed hearing.the government opposed the motion,arguing that t o the contrary,the record,as it stands now,could be subject to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and that,based on the facts of this case,such a claim might not be procedurally barred.the government also expressed concern that grigous new attorney may be working with moore,that moore had not formally withdrawn from the case,and that on the eve of the last hearing,moore had offered the government a signed stipulation dismissing grigous habeas petition with prejudice,an offer that the government did not feel comfortable accepting.lucheme responded with a motion for sanctions,claiming that the government was improperly attempting to discredit him in the proceedings.on january,moore filed a motion to withdraw as counsel.
on january,the district court granted the petitioner motion for a change of venue to the federal district court in massachusetts.because of the change in venue,the court denied as moot lucheme motions for a decision and sanctions and moore motion to withdraw.
grigous obtained a new attorney for his proceedings in massachusetts.however,before any decision was reached by the district court in massachusetts,the government moved to transfer the case to the court of appeals pursuant to section c of the real id act of,div.b,stat,which congress had recently enacted the district court granted the motion and transferred the case to us.pursuant to section c of the real id act,we treat the transferred habeas petition as a petition for review under b.
we review the bia denial of the petitioner motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.see zhang ins,cir.abuse of discretion exists where the bia misinterprets the law,or acts either arbitrarily or capriciously.maindrond ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.where,as here,the bia summarily affirms an ij decision,we review directly the ij decision as if it were the decision of the bia.olujoke gonzales,cir.
