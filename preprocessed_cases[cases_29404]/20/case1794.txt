in,maurice coleman was convicted of the murder and armed robbery of terrell jackson.the sole evidence in the trial against him was the eyewitness testimony of jackson brother and stepdaughter,who were present in the home on the day of the murder.coleman sought habeas corpus relief from his sentence,claiming that he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.he also requested an evidentiary hearing to allow the court to make factual findings and credibility determinations regarding his claims of actual innocence and ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court denied coleman habeas petition and his request for an evidentiary hearing.because we can not meaningfully review coleman habeas petition without more information regarding the content of potential witnesses testimony,we remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing as to his claim of actual innocence.
a.the crime and investigation 
on august,chicago police were called to a house in response to a report of a homicide.the victim,terrell jackson,was found in a second floor bedroom with multiple gunshot wounds.arlander adamson,jackson brother,and gwen thomas,jackson stepdaughter,both claimed to have witnessed the crime.according to the police report and adamson testimony at trial,adamson had been watching television on the first floor when two men entered the house from behind with guns pointed at him.they forced adamson to lie down and then tied his hands behind his back and gagged him.the men then forced adamson up the stairs to the bedroom where jackson was sleeping.they forced adamson to lie down on the floor face down,next to his sleeping brother.jackson woke up as the men slapped him and shouted where the money,where it at and then shot him multiple times.
one of the men then went to the room where thomas was watching television with her baby.she was led to jackson room,where the men forced her to help them look for the money.the room was ransacked but no money was found.one gold chain with a round medallion bearing the initials in diamonds and a ring also bearing the initials in diamonds were allegedly taken in the invasion.the men then allegedly tied up thomas and left.adamson and thomas untied each other and called the police.adamson and thomas gave a general description of the perpetrators to the police.the first man was described as a black male,years old,feet inches to feet tall,pounds,black hair,light complexion,a possible small mustache,and wearing a blue track suit jacket with white stripes on the arms and blue jeans.the second man was described as a black male,years old,feet inches to feet inches tall,medium build,black hair,dark brown skin,mustache and beard wearing a dark cap and blue jeans.
thomas called her cousin,dorothy davis,after the incident.davis was on her way to jackson house when she was stopped by two men in a blue car.they asked if she was going to jackson,she denied she was,and they continued on their way.she gave a description of the males similar to that given by adamson and thomas.
police also interviewed witnesses david and tracey wilkins,who lived next door to jackson.at the time of the incident,david said he saw two black males sitting on the rear porch of jackson home.the two males left and returned several times during the period before the victim was shot.one male ran across to the laundromat and then returned.david brother,tracey,had been at the laundromat across the street,where he saw a black male come into the laundromat and use the phone.approximately minutes later,he saw two males running in the street he assumed they were running because of the rain.the police report states that both brothers gave descriptions of the males similar to those given by adamson and thomas.
several weeks later,on august,thomas and adamson separately picked coleman out of a police lineup.david wilkins also viewed the lineup but did not identify coleman or anyone else as the perpetrator.at a police interview that day,coleman told police he was not sure what he was doing on the day of the murder but that he was probably at his girlfriend house or home alone.he denied any involvement in the murder.
during the investigation,police talked to a man named roy wright two different times.in the first interview,on august,wright gave the police the following information he was coordinating a drug deal with jackson he had picked up two men one man he knew as rip and later identified as coleman,and one man he said he did not know at all on the night of the murder while in his car these strangers discussed a past event where they had killed someone and he dropped them off in front of jackson house.during the second interview,on august,wright also told the police that a few days after the murder,coleman tried to sell him jackson medallion.wright identified coleman in a book of photographs.
before a september,evidentiary hearing,adamson picked out joseph barnes from a photo array and indicated that he thought barnes might be one of the perpetrators.barnes was living in baltimore,maryland at the time,and was extradited to chicago.adamson and thomas separately identified barnes as one of the perpetrators in a lineup.
b.the trial 
coleman and barnes were tried together,with each represented by separate counsel.the sole evidence against coleman at trial was adamson and thomas eyewitness testimony.there was no forensic evidence introduced at trial that tied coleman to the crime.coleman called three witnesses in his defense.dorothy davis testified about the two black males who had stopped her on her way to jackson house.she testified that neither man was coleman nor barnes.
coleman also called two police officers to testify to impeach thomas trial testimony.thomas testified at trial that a chain was pulled off her neck on the day of the murder while she was in her room.two police officers testified that thomas did not report a theft on the day of the crime,and that her bedroom was not searched or dusted for fingerprints.
during the trial,coleman counsel,geary kull,asked for a severance.when asked for reasons why he needed a severance,he asked to speak with the judge ex parte or in camera.the judge refused,and kull did not publicly state his reasons for desiring a severance because he did not wish to disclose his evidence to the state attorney.kull renewed his motion for severance just prior to trial,but the trial judge again refused to have proceedings without the state attorney present.kull then asked to preserve the record for appeal,by putting a statement of his need for a severance under seal.the judge did not read this statement and denied the motion for a severance.
barnes advanced an alibi defense by having a woman testify that she was with him at the time of the crime.this defense was disbelieved when the state presented evidence of his past lies during an extradition hearing.both barnes and coleman were convicted by a jury of murder and armed robbery.
c.the new evidence discovered 
during coleman state proceedings,codefendant barnes submitted an affidavit stating that coleman had nothing to do with the murder.barnes stated his should have been roy wright,and that jackson was a drug dealer and the murder was a result of a drug deal gone wrong.through the affidavit,and at an evidentiary hearing,barnes testified to a detailed sequence of events leading up to the murder.barnes trial attorney,james rhodes,signed an affidavit stating that barnes had told him,during the trial,that coleman had nothing to do with the murder.he also said that after the verdict,barnes expressed dismay that coleman had been convicted.
an investigator for the defense interviewed adamson.adamson admitted that jackson was a drug dealer,that wright had been to jackson home a couple of times on the day of the murder,and that wright and thomas had an intimate relationship.adamson also acknowledged that the robbers were looking for in drug money.
loretta cade,coleman girlfriend and the mother of his child,signed a statement that coleman was with her at the time of the shooting.she also claimed that she gave this information to coleman trial attorney and advised him that she was willing to testify at the time of trial.evelynn cade,loretta mother,signed a statement that she called loretta and coleman on the day of the shooting at approximately or and spoke to coleman for fifteen minutes.she stated that she specifically remembered the day because it was august,and her birthday was august.she also stated that she told this to coleman attorney at the time and that she had been willing to testify.evelyn statement was made in,two days before the order of the state court on coleman motion asserting innocence.loretta gave her statement in,a year and a half later.
coleman challenged his conviction on direct appeal,and filed a state petition.the illinois appellate court affirmed his conviction on july,and the illinois supreme court denied leave to appeal on december.in april,coleman filed a habeas corpus petition under,challenging the validity of his convictions for murder and armed robbery.the district court denied the petition on august,and we granted a certificate of appealability on the question of his procedural default and ineffective assistance of counsel claims.
ii.analysis 
coleman did not raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal or on review of his conviction.for this reason,unless an exception to the procedural default rule applies,coleman ineffective assistance claim is procedurally defaulted.lewis sternes,cir.a procedural default can be avoided if a petitioner can show cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice.holmes hardy,cir.coleman argues that we can reach the merits of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim because a fundamental miscarriage of justice occurred,as he says he is innocent of the crime.see schlup delo.he requested an evidentiary hearing to develop his actual innocence and ineffective assistance of counsel claims,but the district court denied his request.we review the district court denial of a habeas petitioner request for an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion.schriro landrigan.
coleman effort to overcome his default is based on a procedural claim of innocence,and he does not bring a substantive claim of innocence.schlup,at.this means that his constitutional claim is based not on his innocence,but rather on his contention that the ineffectiveness of his counsel denied him the full panoply of protections afforded to criminal defendants by the constitution.id.his assertion of innocence does not by itself provide a basis for relief.instead,his claim for relief depends critically on the validity of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.id.at petitioner claim of innocence is not itself a constitutional claim,but instead a gateway through which a habeas petitioner must pass to have his otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on the merits.internal quotation omitted.
a prisoner asserting innocence as a gateway to a defaulted claim must show that in light of new evidence,it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.house bell,internal quotation and citation omitted holmes,at.this standard is fundamentally different,and lower,than that for a substantive innocence claim because the procedural claim of innocence is accompanied with an assertion of constitutional error at trial.schlup,at.the petitioner must support the innocence claim with new reliable it be exculpatory scientific evidence,trustworthy eyewitness accounts,or critical physical was not presented at trial.id.at.the reviewing court must consider all the evidence,old and new,and based on this total record,make a probabilistic determination about what reasonable,properly instructed jurors would do.house,at citing schlup,at.in making a probabilistic determination,it must be presumed that jurors obey the instructions of the court,including the instruction requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt.schlup,at.
although a claim of actual innocence is rarely successful,schlup,at,an absolute certainty about a petitioner guilt or innocence is not required to satisfy the petitioner burden at the gateway stage.house,at.and the proper inquiry is not whether a particular juror would have the power to convict in light of the old and new evidence,but rather how reasonable jurors would react to the overall,newly supplemented record.id.the actual innocence inquiry may also involve credibility assessments and a consideration of the strength of the government case.id.at.
the district court denied coleman request for an evidentiary hearing because it felt it had the ability to make credibility determinations and no new factual findings are necessary to determine coleman ineffective assistance of counsel claims.because coleman did not pursue his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in his state appeal,the federal court ability to hold an evidentiary hearing is circumscribed.boyko parke,cir.in such a case an evidentiary hearing is warranted only if the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.e b.it follows that a hearing should be granted if it could enable a habeas applicant to prove his petition factual allegations,which,if true,would entitle him to federal habeas relief.schriro,at.here,development of the new evidence presented in coleman case,reviewed in concert with the total information available,could support his claim of procedural actual innocence.an evidentiary hearing is warranted to allow the district court a chance to evaluate the totality of this evidence.
the two pieces of new evidence here are the affidavits of joseph barnes coleman at trial and james rhodes barnes trial attorney.in barnes affidavit,barnes asserts that his should have been roy wright,and that the murder was related to a bad drug deal.according to barnes,he had not met terrell jackson before the evening of jackson murder because the drug deal had been set up using wright and a man named barnett hall as middlemen.barnes stated that he had expected drugs that could be several times as a way of increasing his profit,but when he received jackson drugs,he was disappointed by their lack of quality.he stated that he wanted either a better product or his money back,and so he told wright to get in touch with jackson.wright could not reach jackson and wanted more time to try to talk to him,but eventually wright and barnes went to jackson house,where the murder occurred.in barnes testimony at the state hearing,most of this version of events had been the same,but there is one significant difference.at the hearing,barnes testified that barnett hall came into jackson house during the night of the murder as well,and that hall got shot in the ensuing fight.there is no corroborating evidence of a third offender being present,and hall did not testify to any of these events as he died before the hearing.
we recognize that barnes reputation for honesty is weak.during an extradition hearing prior to trial,barnes lied about living in baltimore at the time of the murder.and,during the trial,he presented a false alibi defense.in addition,barnes claimed in his own hearing that rhodes provided ineffective assistance of counsel by preventing barnes from testifying,which barnes later admitted was not true.in attempting to discredit barnes version of events,the government also places emphasis on the unknown extent of friendship between barnes and coleman.they claim to merely know each other from the neighborhood but were members of warring gangs that did not fight on sight as the opposing gangs were supposedly instructed to do,and barnes placed coleman on a list of acceptable visitors when he spent time in jail in the.the weight of these inconsistencies led the state court to deem barnes testimony incredible and lacking in reliability.
of course,as a general matter,at its evidentiary hearing the district court should accord a presumption of correctness to the state court credibility determination.e araujo chandler,cir.but this deference does not imply abandonment or abdication of judicial r
