sherwood hill appeals the district court dismissal of his pro se petition for relief under west supp for failure to comply with the limitation period for bringing such an action.see d west supp.the district court determined sua sponte that hill pro se petition was untimely and dismissed the action without affording hill notice or an opportunity to be heard.hill contends that he was entitled to respond and,had he been permitted to do so,he could have demonstrated that either a statutory exception or equitable tolling principles protected his petition from dismissal under the limitation period.we vacate the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
hill,a virginia inmate,is serving a year sentence on convictions for rape and malicious wounding.on june,the virginia court of appeals affirmed hill convictions.hill apparently sought no further direct review of his case.he later petitioned the supreme court of virginia for habeas corpus relief,but the court denied his petition on april,
in june,hill filed a pro se application for relief under he raised a number of claims,including an assertion that his confession was involuntary,that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance,that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction,and that his sentence was excessive.as a pro se petitioner,hill was required to use a standard government form to apply for relief under.see local rule.hill responded to all of the questions on the form he was not asked to supply information about the timeliness of his application.
the district court,acting sua sponte,concluded from the face of hill petition that his claims were barred by the limitations period imposed by d and the court dismissed the action.the district court concluded that this period began to run at the latest on april,the date on which the virginia supreme court denied hill petition for collateral review.thus,hill petition,if filed no earlier than june,was untimely.hill was not afforded an opportunity to demonstrate the timeliness of his petition before it was dismissed.
hill promptly filed with the district court what he styled as a notice of appeal.it gave notice of hill intent to appeal,but it also contained cursory factual allegations to support hill view that his petition was timely or that he was entitled to relief from the limitations bar.
on appeal,hill contends that the district court should have afforded him a opportunity to explain why his application was not barred by the limitations provision.for the reasons set forth below,we agree that hill should have been afforded an opportunity to respond prior to the dismissal of his petition,but we limit our holding to the narrow circumstances of this case.
congress has circumscribed the amount of time a state prisoner has to seek relief under from a state conviction a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.d.this limitation period for a habeas claim begins running from the latest of four dates 
a the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review 
b the date on which the impediment to filing an application created by state action in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states is removed,if the applicant was prevented from filing by such state action 
c the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court,if the right has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review or 
d the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
d.therefore,the limitation period begins running when direct review of the state conviction is completed or when the time for seeking direct review has expired,see d a,unless one of the circumstances enumerated by the statute is present and starts the clock running at a later date.see d b d.if no petition for a writ of certiorari is filed in the united states supreme court,then the limitation period begins running when the time for doing elapsed.see harris hutchinson,cir.the running of the limitation period,however,is suspended for t he time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.d.moreover,the limitation period is also subject to equitable tolling in those rare instances to circumstances external to the party own would be unconscionable to enforce the limitation against the party.see harris,at.
according to his pro se petition,hill did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari following the decision of the virginia court of appeals,affirming his conviction on june.hill did not include any information about the timeliness of his claim on the form,which did not ask for any such information,nor did anything on the face of hill petition suggest that he was impeded from filing within the limitation period.thus,the district court concluded the period started running on september,when the time expired for seeking a writ of certiorari from the united states supreme court.
it is not apparent from hill petition when he filed his state habeas corpus petition,which would toll the running of the limitation period under d.we are told only that the virginia supreme court denied the petition on april.the district court concluded that even if hill had filed his state habeas petition immediately after the conclusion of direct review,thereby tolling the limitation period until that petition was denied on april,hill petition was still untimely because he filed it no earlier than june,more than one year after his state habeas proceedings were concluded.
because the statute of limitations is not jurisdictional,a federal habeas court is not to consider the timeliness of a petition.see harris,at.the statute of limitations question is more in the nature of an affirmative defense that constitut es an avoidance of the petitioner allegations apart from the merits of the petition.c in pleading to a preceding pleading,a party shall set forth affirmatively the statute of limitations,and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.todd baskerville,cir considering the applicable statute of limitations to be an affirmative defense in actions brought in forma pauperis under.we conclude that the limitation period contained in d is an affirmative defense that the state bears the burden of asserting.see acosta artuz,cir kiser johnson,cir.
even though the limitations period is an affirmative defense,a federal habeas court has the power to raise affirmative defenses sua sponte,as the district court did in this case.we have approved sua sponte consideration of affirmative defenses by a federal habeas court,although not specifically a statute of limitations defense under d.see yeatts angelone,cir.actions brought pursuant to implicate considerations of comity,federalism,and judicial efficiency to a degree not present in ordinary civil actions.these interests eclipse the immediate concerns of the parties and provide federal habeas courts the discretionary authority to raise affirmative defenses that have not been preserved by the state.see id.at explaining the propriety of considering procedural default defense that the commonwealth failed to raise because of the overriding interests of comity and judicial efficiency that transcend the interests of the parties.the district court sua sponte consideration of a defense not raised by the state is consistent with rule of the rules governing section cases.rule reflects the policy considerations of federalism and judicial efficiency and differentiates habeas cases from other civil cases with respect to sua sponte consideration of affirmative defenses.kiser,at.rule instructs that 
if it plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court,the judge shall make an order for its summary dismissa
