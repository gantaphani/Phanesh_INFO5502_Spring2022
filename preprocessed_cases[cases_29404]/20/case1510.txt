richard cooey,an ohio inmate under sentence of death,filed this action against ted strickland,governor,terry collins,director,and voorhies,warden collectively defendants or state pursuant to,challenging the constitutionality of ohio lethal injection protocol.the issues before us in this interlocutory appeal are whether a death row inmate claim against lethal injection opposed to a precursor properly considered to be a habeas action or one brought pursuant to,whether a death row inmate challenge accrues,for statute of limitations purposes,when execution is imminent or at some earlier stage in state and federal proceedings,and whether res judicata is a bar to a death row inmate claim concerning the means and methods of execution when similar issues were raised,or the specific claim could have been raised,in a previous habeas action.
background 
in,an ohio panel convicted cooey of two counts of aggravated murder,and the panel sentenced him to death.the ohio supreme court affirmed cooey convictions and sentence on direct appeal.see state cooey,ohio,and the united states supreme court denied certiorari on april,see cooey ohio,d.cooey unsuccessfully sought relief pursuant to ohio ann.see state cooey,wl ohio.may.the ohio supreme court declined jurisdiction over his further appeal from this decision.cooey subsequently sought to reopen his direct appeal on the basis of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.the ohio court of appeals denied his request to reopen on the basis of procedural default because cooey had not established good cause for not filing his application to reopen within ninety days of the july,effective date of ohio app.b.the ohio supreme court affirmed.see state cooey,ohio.
in october,cooey filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.the district court denied the petition on september.see cooey anderson.this court granted a certificate of appealability as to two issues and denied relief as to both.see cooey coyle,cir.the united states supreme court denied certiorari on march.ohio originally set cooey execution date for july.
on july,cooey filed a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to.b and a motion for stay of execution.on july,the district court granted cooey motion for a stay of execution and deferred ruling on the rule b motion.both the sixth circuit and the supreme court denied the warden motions to vacate the stay of execution.the district court ultimately denied the rule b motion,and this court denied cooey application for a certificate of appealability from the denial of his rule b motion and his motion for leave to file a second or successive habeas petition.
on june,cooey and another inmate,adremy dennis,filed a complaint alleging that the lethal injection protocol constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.ohio utilizes three drugs in performing lethal injection sodium thiopental,pancurionium bromide,and potassium chloride.the sodium thiopental is designed to anesthetize the prisoner and render him unconscious.next,the pancuronium bromide paralyzes all of the prisoner voluntary muscles but does not affect his sensation,consciousness,or ability to feel pain.finally,the potassium chloride induces cardiac arrest.dennis and cooey asserted that if the sodium thiopental is not administered properly and in sufficient dosage,the prisoner could experience intense pain after being injected with the potassium chloride,but would be unable to convey the sensation due to the paralyzing agent in pancuronium bromide.they also maintained that to subject the prisoner to such excruciating pain while he is still conscious would amount to cruel and unusual punishment.they also alleged that the personnel attending to the executions are inadequately trained and,as such,defendants execution methods would violate a prisoner constitutional rights.
the district court dismissed the complaint because cooey failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.after exhausting them,cooey his complaint on december,on january,defendants moved to dismiss the complaint based on the statute of limitations and res judicata,in addition to arguing that cooey complaint should be construed as a successive habeas petition.on march,the district court denied the defendants motion but granted them permission to pursue this interlocutory appeal.on march,defendants asked the district court to certify for immediate appeal the three arguments made in their motion to dismiss.on april,the district court granted the motion,in part,as to the issue of whether cooey claims are barred by the statute of limitations.defendants then sought permission to appeal the three issues pursuant to b.this court granted the request as to all three issues.
we later granted a stay pending the supreme court decision in hill mcdonough,d,which was decided on june.after that decision,the parties filed supplemental briefs addressing its impact on this case.the parties also submitted second supplemental briefs discussing the impact of recent changes in ohio lethal injection protocol on the issues pending before this court.the matter was argued before this court on december.
ii.analysis 
this court reviews de novo the district court grant or denial of a motion to dismiss under.b.mezibov allen,cir,cert.denied,d.in this analysis,we must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accept all of his factual allegations,and determine whether he undoubtedly can prove no set of facts in support of his claims that would entitle him to relief.columbia natural,tatum,cir.
cooey sought relief pursuant to,alleging that the proposed lethal injection protocol would constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.in their motion to dismiss,defendants argued that cooey claim should have been presented in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under,rather than as a claim.in hill,the supreme court addressed this same issue and concluded that a death penalty plaintiff could raise his challenge in a action.relying on its earlier decision in nelson campbell,d,the court concluded that the plaintiff action was properly brought under because it did not present a general challenge to his execution by lethal injection,but rather limited the challenge to the specific protocol currently used by the defendants.hill.at.in their supplemental brief,defendants acknowledge that hill defeats their argument.
timeliness 
defendants also argue that cooey action is barred by the statute of limitations.the supreme court has held that claims are best characterized as tort actions for the recovery of damages for personal injury and that federal courts must borrow the statute of limitations governing personal injury actions from the state where the action was brought.wilson garcia,d.if a state has more than one statute of limitations for personal injuries,the state residual or general statute of limitations governing personal injury actions is applied to all actions brought in that state.owens okure,d.this court has held that a statute of limitations applies to claims in ohio.banks city of whitehall,cir citing browning pendleton,cir en banc.
on the other hand,as the supreme court recently made clear,federal law determines when the statute of limitations for a civil rights action begins to run.wallace kato,d,wl,at.under those principles,it is the standard rule that accrual occurs when the plaintiff has complete and present cause of action.wallace,at,wl,at quoting bay area laundry dry cleaning pension trust fund ferbar of,d.this occurs when the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.id.quoting bay area laundry,at.
this court has previously stated that u nder federal law,as developed in this circuit,the statute of limitations period begins to run when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know that the act providing the basis of his or her injury has occurred.cir collyer darling,cir ruff runyon,cir same sevier turner,cir.stated differently,i n determining when the cause of action accrues in cases,we look to the event that should have alerted the typical lay person to protect his or her rights.trzebuckowski city of cleveland,cir.we must therefore look at when the harm in question occurred,guided by the principle that a plaintiff has reason to know of his injury when he should have discovered it through the exercise of reasonable diligence.sevier,at.
defendants have the burden of demonstrating that the statutory period had run before cooey filed his action.griffin rogers,cir.we review de novo the district court conclusion that cooey complaint was filed within the applicable statutory period.kelly burks,cir.
cooey was sentenced to death in.his conviction and sentence were affirmed by the ohio supreme court on direct appeal in,and the united states supreme court affirmed in.lethal injection became available as a means of execution in ohio in.in,it became ohio sole method of execution this court denied federal habeas relief in,and the united states supreme court denied certiorari on march.cooey execution date was set for july.
the record also reflects that,at least as early as april,information about the protocol was available upon request.attached to cooey complaint is a letter dated april,from warden haviland disclosing the chemical mixture and equipment to be used see also deborah denno,when legislatures delegate death the troubling paradox behind state uses of electrocution and lethal injection and what it says about us,ohio,explaining that as of,ohio had a vague written policy,but that more specific information was available upon request mary beth lane,how state plans to kill berry execution to take about six minutes cleveland plain dealer february,describing the three drugs in the lethal injection protocol,which a drc policy and state officials explained.a letter from staff counsel for the ohio department of rehabilitation and correction dated may,further describes the procedures used by prison personnel in performing lethal injection and the quantities used under this formulation 
the district court concluded that cooey claim accrued when his execution became imminent and he knew or had reason to know of the facts that gave rise to his specific challenge.in defining when an execution becomes imminent,the district court stated that it was of the view that an execution becomes imminent not necessarily when an execution date is set,but when all other legal challenges to the validity of a death sentence come to an end,when the plaintiff has exhausted all of his state and federal avenues of relief.this occurs when the united states supreme court denies certiorari in the plaintiff habeas corpus proceeding or otherwise issues a decision foreclosing federal habeas corpus relief.in determining when a plaintiff knows or has reason to know the facts giving rise to his specific claim,the district court stated that because ohio protocol is a creation of the ohio department of rehabilitation and correction,and therefore subject to change until the time of execution,
requiring a plaintiff to file his challenge any sooner would be wasteful and possibly absurd,given the possibility that,prior to his execution becoming imminent,a plaintiff could see his conviction or death sentence reversed,or the alteration of the precise execution protocol that plaintiff might seek to challenge as unconstitutional.
applying this test to cooey,the district court concluded that cooey knew or had reason to know of the facts giving rise to the specific allegations he has presented in the instant complaint in may when he received information about the protocol,and that his execution became imminent when the united states supreme court denied certiorari as to his habeas corpus proceedings on march,thus,cooey had two years from that date to file his claim.because cooey filed the instant action on december,three months before the expiration of the statute of limitations,the district court deemed his cause of action was timely.
the district court also commented that,as the protocol was not established by statute or administrative rule,it was subject to change at any time before the execution.because defendants could change the protocol up to the time of an inmate execution,the district court believed that it would be premature to challenge the protocol until the execution was imminent.
on appeal,defendants argue that the statute of limitations began to run in,when lethal injection became available as a means of execution in ohio,or alternatively in,when lethal injection became ohio sole method of execution.defendants assert that it is the issuance of a government order,in this case the protocol,rather than the carrying out of that order,which starts the clock.cooey urges us to affirm the district court conclusion that his claim accrued on march,when the united states supreme court denied certiorari as to cooey first habeas petition and after his execution date was set.
setting an accrual date at the point when the actual harm is inflicted,at the point of execution,is problematic in this context because the inmate claim would not accrue until he was executed,at which time it would also be simultaneously moot.in any event,both nelson and hill establish inferentially that challenges may be brought before the execution is carried out.neither case,however,addressed the appropriate accrual date.thus,the relevant event that should have alerted a lay person to protect his rights must be redefined here.
if the point of infliction is not a viable option,the most logical choice of a triggering event is the point when the death penalty is ordered,upon judgment of conviction and sentence.at least one court has set the accrual date at the conclusion of direct review by the state.see neville johnson,cir per curiam holding,in reliance on a concession by the state,that a challenge to a method of execution may be filed any time after the plaintiff conviction has become final on direct review this is also an attractive choice because it marks the point at which the state has rendered its criminal judgment final and,absent collateral civil proceedings,the point at which the state sets the execution date.furthermore,the inmate can file suit and obtain relief.
the district court conclusion that the accrual date occurs when execution is imminent and all state and federal remedies have been exhausted is problematic for several reasons.first,it subverts the purpose of statutes of limitations,which are designed to promote judicial economy and protect defendants rights.john hancock fin,old kent bank,cir and also noting that the discovery rule has been applied to prevent unjust results when a plaintiff would otherwise be denied a reasonable opportunity to bring suit due to the latent nature of the injury or the inability to discover the causal connection between the injury and the defendant action internal quotation marks omitted.as the supreme court noted in wallace 
under the traditional rule of accrual the tort cause of action accrues,and the statute of limitations commences to run,when the wrongful act or omission results in damages.the cause of action accrues even though the full extent of the injury is not then known or predictable.corman,limitation of actions,footnotes omitted see also,limitations of actions.were it otherwise,the statute would begin to run only after a plaintiff became satisfied that he had been harmed enough,placing the supposed statute of repose in the sole hands of the party seeking relief.
wallace,at,wl,at.
more fundamentally,setting an accrual date at the point of imminency plus exhaustion of federal collateral remedies adds a significant period of delay to a state ability to exercise its sovereign power and to finalize its judgments,which disrupts the vital yet delicate balance between state and federal relations.our federal system recognizes the independent power of a state to articulate societal norms through criminal law but the power of a state to pass laws means little if the state can not enforce them.mccleskey zant,d.furthermore,a state retains a significant interest in meting out a sentence of death in a timely fashion.nelson,at.
of course,f ederal habeas review of state convictions frustrates both the states sovereign power to punish offenders and their good to honor constitutional rights.calderon thompson,d internal quotation marks omitted.for this reason,federal habeas review of state court judgments is limited.as the supreme court observed in calderon 
in light of the profound societal costs that attend the exercise of habeas jurisdiction,smith murray,d,we have found it necessary to impose significant limits on the discretion of federal courts to grant habeas relief.see,mccleskey zant,d limiting a district court discretion to entertain abusive petitions wainwright sykes,d limiting courts discretion to entertain procedurally defaulted claims teague lane,d plurality opinion of,limiting courts discretion to give retroactive application to new rules in habeas cases brecht abrahamson,d limiting courts discretion to grant habeas relief on the basis of trial error.
id.at.the court added that t hese limits reflect our enduring respect for the state interest in the finality of convictions that have survived direct review within the state court system.id.at.citation omitted.
the antiterrrorism and effective death penalty act of reflects congress desire to restore and maintain the proper balance between state criminal adjudications and federal collateral proceedings.see generally rhines weber,d stating that t he enactment of aedpa in dramatically altered the landscape for federal habeas corpus petitions.
there is no doubt congress intended aedpa the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of to advance the doctrines of comity,finality,and federalism.federal habeas corpus principles must inform and shape the historic and still vital relation of mutual respect and common purpose existing between the states and the federal courts.in keeping this delicate balance we have been careful to limit the scope of federal intrusion into state criminal adjudications and to safeguard the states interest in the integrity of their criminal and collateral proceedings.
williams taylor,d see also woodford garceau,d congress enacted aedpa to reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences,particularly in capital cases,and to further the principles of comity,finality,and federalism.internal quotes omitted williams taylor,d stevens,stating that congress wished to curb delays,to prevent retrials on federal habeas,and to give effect to state convictions to the extent possible under law see also id.at.majority opinion.in addition to revising the standards for evaluating the merits of a habeas application,see d providing that a writ of habeas corpus shall not be granted to a state prisoner unless the state court proceedings resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings,the aedpa created a statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition,running from the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.d a.see generally day mcdonough,d noting that u ntil aedpa took effect in,no statute of limitations applied to habeas petitions.the limitation period quite plainly serves the interest in the finality of state court judgments and reduces the potential for delay on the road to finality by restricting the time that a prospective federal habeas petitioner has in which to seek federal habeas review.duncan walker,d internal citation omitted see also acosta artuz,cir the aedpa statute of limitation promotes judicial efficiency and conservation of judicial resources,safeguards the accuracy of state court judgments by requiring resolution of constitutional questions while the record is fresh,and lends finality to state court judgments within a reasonable time.quoted with approval in day mcdonough.
the concerns articulated by the supreme court both pre and,and by congress in the aedpa itself,apply with equal force in this case,which fall s at the margins of habeas.nelson,at.noting that the challenges fall at the margins of habeas.indeed,the court recent decisions in hill and nelson reflect this core concern that federal habeas should not displace a state authority to execute its judgments.in nelson,the supreme court stated that challenges should be brought at such a time as to allow consideration of the merits,without requiring the entry of a stay.at.see also gomez dist.court,d criticizing inmate for filing challenge pursuant to more than a decade after the completion of his direct appeal,and shortly before his execution white johnson,cir per curiam rejecting an inmate challenge where the inmate had been on death row for more than six years.most recently,in hill,the supreme court emphasized that filing a action challenging the constitutionality of certain aspects of a state execution does not entitle the complainant to an order staying his execution as a matter of course.hill.at.the court added that b oth the state and the victims of the crime have an important interest in the timely enforcement of the sentence.id.thus,an inmate intending to assert such a challenge generally must file his suit in sufficient time to allow consideration of the merits,without requiring entry of a stay of execution.id.quoting nelson,at.the nelson court also stated flat out that t he federal courts can and should protect states from dilatory or speculative suits.rutherford mcdonough,cir quoting hill.at.this court adheres to these principles.see,hicks taft,cir,cited with approval in hill ruling that a petition by a death row inmate,filed six days before his scheduled execution,was not entitled to a stay of execution even though the district court had allowed him to intervene if a fellow inmate challenge to ohio lethal injection protocol alley little,cir,reh g en banc denied,cir,cert.denied,d.
thus,since the date the lethal injection protocol is imposed is infeasible,it stands to reason that the next most appropriate accrual date should mirror that found in the aedpa upon conclusion of direct review in the state court or the expiration of time for seeking such review.see d a all of the same concerns articulated by the supreme court and as reflected in the aedpa are relevant here.like federal habeas actions,a challenge implicates values beyond the concerns of the parties.see acosta,at and noting that the aedpa statute of limitation was congress primary vehicle for streamlining the habeas review process and lending finality to state convictions.
thus,under this standard,cooey claim would have accrued in,after the united states supreme court denied direct review.however,ohio did not adopt lethal injection until,or make it the exclusive method of execution until,so the accrual date must be adjusted because cooey obviously could not have discovered the injury until one of those two dates.we need not pinpoint the accrual date in this case,however,because even under the later date,cooey claim exceeds the statute of limitations deadline because his claim was not filed until december.
cooey asserts,and the district court found,that cooey did not have actual knowledge of ohio protocol until may when he received responses to his inquiries from the warden.actual knowledge,however,is not the appropriate measure the test is whether he knew or should have known based upon reasonable inquiry,and could have filed suit and obtained relief.cooey should have known of his cause of action in after amendments to the law required that he be executed by lethal injection,and the information was publicly available upon request.yet,even if we accepted and we would not may,the date when he received the warden response,cooey complaint is still untimely.
cooey also argues that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the nelson decision made a action a possible remedy for cooey.prior to that decision,this court precluded a death row inmate from filing a action challenging his method of execution.see in re sapp,cir in re williams,cir.indeed,in williams,the plaintiff attempted to bring a action raising the same argument now presented by cooey,and this court concluded that the claim must be raised in a habeas action.nonetheless,the plaintiff in nelson was similarly barred by circuit precedent at the time he filed his suit.so long as there remains the possibility of en banc reconsideration and supreme court review,circuit law does not completely foreclose all avenues for relief.harris johnson,cir.this circuit precedent did not prevent lewis williams and john roe from filing their lethal injection actions.see in re williams,cir 
lastly,cooey argues,and the district court found,that the fluid nature of ohio execution protocol requires imminency of execution to be a key factor in the accrual calculus,citing stewart,d.we recently rejected a similar argument in alley.in alley,a tennessee inmate also argued that his claim challenging tennessee lethal injection protocol was not ripe until an execution date was imminent.in rejecting this argument we stated 
alley brief cites stewart,d as prohibiting courts from considering challenges such as the one in our case before a petitioner execution reaches imminence.we reject this reading of this precedent.in that case,unlike in ours,the defendant claim under ford wainwright,d,had originally been dismissed without prejudice.the supreme court ruling merely allowed the claim to proceed in a habeas petition at a later date.the court noted that the lower courts had specifically left open the possibility that the defendant ford claim could proceed in a future filing.id.at.no such procedural history informs the posture of the claim in our case.moreover,we note that claims involving mental competency are inherently different from the petition before us in at least one respect mental competency is subject to variance over time.it is indeed possible that ford petitions could be justified by a change in a defendant mental health.
in contrast,while the lethal injection protocol in this case is subject to change,there was no evidence,until recently,that the protocol had ever been changed.and,furthermore,the recent changes do not relate to cooey core complaints.
during the pendency of this appeal,indeed while the matter was stayed,cooey moved to expand supplemental briefing or to remand to the district court to further address ohio recent changes in its execution protocol,which he claimed is consistent with his claim that the malleable nature of ohio lethal injection protocol means that a action can not be imminent until close to the date of execution.in support,cooey attached a memo written by ohio department of rehabilitation and correction director terry collins,dated june.in that memo collins adopted five recommendations and process changes regarding ohio execution protocol.
ohio recent amendments to its lethal injection protocol resulted from difficulties encountered during the execution of joseph clark on may.when preparing clark for execution,prison officials could find only one accessible vein in clark arms to establish a heparin lock,through which the lethal drugs are administered.two locks usually are inserted.however,once the execution began and the drugs were being administered,this vein collapsed,and clark repeatedly advised officials that the process was not working.officials stopped the lethal injection procedure,and after a significant period of time,were able to establish a new intravenous site.the process then was restarted,and clark was executed.
to avoid similar difficulties in future executions,ohio made several changes to its lethal injection protocol.first,officials removed time deadlines that previously dictated executions begin by a certain hour,and be completed within a narrow time frame.second,prisoners are given more medical examinations prior to execution.third,correctional personnel will make every effort to obtain two sites for heparin locks before proceeding to the execution chamber.fourth,personnel will no longer use high pressure saline injections to check the viability of the intravenous lines.instead,a low pressure drip of saline will be used to keep the line open and confirm its ongoing viability.fifth,correctional personnel will observe each inmate arms and check for signs of intravenous incontinence while the drugs are being administered to the inmate.
as defendants assert,none of these changes relates to cooey core complaints.further,none of these areas were implicated as a basis for cooey expert conclusion that the process presents a risk that cooey will experience pain.rather,heath,cooey expert,criticized the use of pancuronium bromide,the use and dosage of sodium thiopental,the failure to provide a continuous dose of an barbiturate,and the lack of information regarding prison personnel training to prepare and administer the drugs.cooey can not prevail on this basis either.
in sum,we hold that the district court erred in ruling that the statute of limitations had not run on cooey claim because it used an improper test for establishing the accrual date for challenges.
res judicata 
because we conclude that cooey claim fails on limitations grounds,we need not address the state res judicata argument.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we remand this matter to the district court with instructions to dismiss cooey complaint with prejudice as barred by the statute of limitations.
the majority sets forth two rationales for its conclusion that the statute of limitations on cooey claim accrued at the end of the direct review of his conviction and sentence by the ohio supreme court.first,the majority expresses concern that the district court accrual the point when the inmate execution is imminent and all state and federal remedies,including postconviction proceedings,have been exhausted,subverts the purpose of statutes of limitations,which are designed to promote judicial economy and protect defendants rights.op.at citation and quotation marks omitted.the majority other rationale is that the district court accrual date adds a significant period of delay to a state ability to exercise its sovereign power and to finalize its judgments,which disrupts the vital yet delicate balance between state and federal relations.op.at.in essence,however,i believe that these two reasons boil down to the single assertion that the habeas process takes too long.i find this rationale disturbing for the following reasons 
justice and judicial efficiency 
timeliness is important,but justice is more important.although the common saying is that justice delayed is justice denied,there are situations in which the adage does not hold true.i believe that this is one of those situations.judges in criminal cases are allowed to apply the ends of justice exclusion to permit certain delays in a criminal prosecution,notwithstanding the defendant right to a speedy trial.h a see also united states monger,cir finding that the magistrate judge properly granted an ends of justice continuance in a complex criminal trial involving a large quantity of wiretap evidence and multiple coconspirators.i believe that the ends of justice principle is equally applicable to cooey challenge.
cooey and the intervenors in his complaint allege that the protocol used in ohio will violate their eighth amendment right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment.specifically,they contend that the acting anesthetic,thiopental sodium,may fail to induce unconsciousness and that,as a result,they may be conscious when the paralytic agents,pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride,are administered.they assert that if that happens,they will likely suffer excruciating pain from the resulting death by suffocation and a chemically induced heart attack,but that,because the pancuronium bromide paralyzes their voluntary muscles,they will be unable to move or speak.
the interests of justice are great where,as here,the claimants challenge only the method by which their death sentences are carried out,not the validity of their sentences.ensuring that executions comply with the constitution of the united states is a paramount duty for the courts,despite the human and financial costs of protracted postconviction litigation.w hile justice delayed may be justice denied,prompt injustice is not the answer.haitian refugee ctr.smith,cir emphasis added.
the majority looks to aedpa in its analysis of the question.i think this blurs the distinction between federal habeas proceedings and actions,and misapprehends the distinction between the two causes of action.aedpa imposes a statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition.d a.this period promotes finality in judgments.duncan walker,d this provision reduces the potential for delay on the road to finality by restricting the time that a prospective federal habeas petitioner has in which to seek federal habeas review.but a action is not an attack on the validity of the inmate conviction or sentence.cooey concedes in his complaint that he does not seek injunctive relief as a means of attacking his underlying conviction or death sentence.his sentence became final on march,when the supreme court declined to review this court denial of cooey federal habeas petition.cooey coyle,d.instead,he raises a claim that the state method for executing the death sentence will violate his constitutional rights.
the majority faults cooey for failing to bring his challenge earlier,such as in,when ohio made lethal injection one of the methods of execution used in the state,or in,when ohio made lethal injection the sole method of execution.but prior to the supreme court decision in nelson campbell,d,challenges under were barred in this circuit.see in re sapp,cir.holding that a challenge sounded in habeas,not as a civil rights action,cert.denied sub,mcqueen sapp,d.in fact,this court reiterated that position shortly before the supreme court decided nelson.see in re williams,cir concluding that a challenge should be construed as an motion for leave to file a successive habeas petition,which was denied.
despite the above caselaw,the majority in the present case asserts that t his circuit precedent did not prevent lewis williams and john roe from filing their lethal injection actions.op.at.i agree with the district court response to this line of argument the majority is correct that williams and roe tried to bring a claim.the majority neglect s to point out,however,that williams and roe failed.their action,consistent with in re sapp,was construed as an unauthorized successive habeas petition and was never fully heard on the merits.williams and roe unsuccessfully sought rehearing en banc before this court and their request for review by the united states supreme court was denied.williams taft,d.
in the present case,the district court declined the state invitation to hold that cooey was required to bring his challenge prior to nelson.i agree.even if cooey could have brought his civil rights complaint before,which i find dubious,i see no justification for holding that he was required to do so.
i am of the opinion that the district court analysis of cooey complaint and of the state motion to dismiss is thorough,compelling,and frankly more persuasive than the majority analysis.after carefully considering the evidence before it,the district court articulated a reasoned basis for setting the accrual point for purposes at the time when a prisoner execution becomes imminent and the prisoner knows or has reason to know of the facts giving rise to his claim.the district court fixed the point at which an execution becomes imminent as the time when all other legal challenges to the validity of a death sentence come to an end,when the plaintiff has exhausted all of his state and federal avenues of relief.
a inmate knows or has reason to know of the facts of his challenge when he learns the details of the protocol that will be used for his execution.collyer darling,cir under federal law as developed in this circuit,the statute of limitations period begins to run when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know that the act providing the basis of his or her injury has occurred.this latter consideration poses a greater difficulty for ensuring judicial efficiency and stability in ohio because the protocol is a creature of the ohio department of rehabilitation and correction odrc and is not established by statute or administrative rule or regulation.the odrc can change the protocol at any time,regardless of whether an inmate is scheduled for execution.
this concerns me because,as has been evidenced in the aftermath of the joseph clark execution,ohio is free to periodically change its protocol.see reginald fields,ohio revamps procedure,cleveland plain dealer,june,at b describing the extended effort to execute joseph clark after prison officials were unable to find a vein in one arm,the vein in the other arm collapsed shortly after the execution began,and clark informed correctional staff that this is working.no statutory framework determines when or how such changes may occur.nor is there a framework governing when,or even if,such changes will be publicized.
the majority asserts that the protocol changes resulting from the clark execution do not relate to cooey core complaints and were not implicated as a basis for his assertion that he may experience pain.ohio law,however,does not require the odrc to publish any changes to the protocol.the odrc deems some information about the protocol to be public information and on that basis will provide it to the public upon request.but the odrc considers other information nonpublic.
moreover,i am not convinced that ohio protocol changes were merely refinements to the procedure as the state describes them.the switch from saline injections to a saline drip to flush the iv tubing and maintain its viability raises concerns about adequately flushing the tubing between injections so that the drugs do not react with one another before they reach the inmate arm.i see nothing in the protocol or its amendments that addresses the risk of such an occurrence,or what steps would be taken to prevent or remedy it.as we have learned from reading the sometimes voluminous literature that accompanies even the simplest prescription,drug interactions can dramatically alter the efficacy or safety of pharmaceuticals.without any further evidence in the record regarding how the changes affect the risk of violating a inmate constitutional rights,i am unwilling to agree with the majority that the recent protocol changes do not relate to cooey core complaint.
b.when cooey had reason to know of the grounds for his claim 
the majority also contends that cooey was aware of the drug combination and the equipment that would be used as of at least.this assertion rests on the inclusion with cooey complaint of a letter dated april,from james haviland,then the warden of the southern ohio correctional facility,where ohio only death chamber is located,disclosing information about the protocol.haviland letter,however,is addressed to no one and carries no address information for any recipient.from my reading of the letter,i can not ascertain to whom it was addressed or when cooey might have learned of its contents.
in the april,letter,warden haviland provided the names of the intravenous equipment used in executions and the generic names of the pharmaceuticals used to execute the inmate.he did not disclose the amounts of the drugs to be used,or any information about the form in which they were purchased,stored,or administered.further,he did not state whether the drugs were administered individually or all at once,and,if individually,in what sequence.there was also no information provided about the length of the iv tubing used,whether any personnel monitored the tubing for kinks or blockages,or whether the tubing was flushed between the drugs.
in a letter dated may,vincent lagana,odrc staff counsel,responded to an unidentified recipient request for additional information about the protocol by noting that information about training,procedures,and procurement falls outside the scope of the ohio public record law.nonetheless,lagana provided some information about the procedure because the department recognizes that the public has legitimate interests in this subject.this information revealed that the three drugs in the protocol were administered in normal saline concentration,that the thiopental sodium and pancuronium bromide were purchased from a local pharmacy by the
