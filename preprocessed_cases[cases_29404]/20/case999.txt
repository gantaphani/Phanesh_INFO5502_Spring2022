in this motion filed pursuant to,larry donnell fowlkes seeks authorization to file a successive habeas corpus petition pursuant to.in his proposed successive petition,fowlkes seeks to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,a claim under brady maryland,d,and an impartial jury claim.we conclude that all of fowlkes claims have been previously presented in his initial section application.thus,all his claims are barred under section b.even were the claims novel,they would fail the requirements of section b.because fowlkes has failed to make a prima facie showing of merit as required by section b c,we deny his request for authorization to file a successive section motion.
on october,bruce allen and another man forcibly entered the home of albert and ida bowlin.the men stabbed albert in the neck eight times.he passed out,but was later taken to the hospital where he recovered.ida bowlin bled to death on the floor of her kitchen after her throat was cut and she was stabbed in the neck at least five times.the men robbed the couple and left.
in october,a virginia jury convicted larry fowlkes of being,it appears,an accessory before the fact to first degree murder,attempted capital murder,and robbery in connection with the bowlin incident.the key witness for the prosecution at trial was sheila stokes stokes she testified that she overheard a conversation between fowlkes,bruce allen,and shardi moore at her brother house.according to stokes,shardi moore said he wanted some money,and he said,w ell,i know where we can get some money from.and he was talking about some guy over in amelia county.fowlkes replied,w ell,i will take you,but i not going to do nothing.stokes further testified that she saw fowlkes the day after the crime and helped him clean blood out of his car.she also stated that fowlkes later admitted t hey done it,but he did have anything to do with it,and that they had thrown the knife over by the stadium.the jury sentenced fowlkes to years imprisonment.
fowlkes pursued a direct appeal and,later,a state habeas petition,both of which were unsuccessful.in december,fowlkes filed a federal habeas petition pursuant to.in his section motion,fowlkes presented ineffective assistance of counsel and brady claims he also argued,based on new affidavits that supported his alibi that he was actually innocent and thus that the procedural bars applicable to his claims should be excused.the district court dismissed the petition as untimely under section d a and rejected fowlkes actual innocence claim.
on appeal,fowlkes successfully moved to permit supplemental briefing or to remand the case to the district court for additional factual and legal development.in his supplemental briefs,fowlkes presented,inter alia,two new pieces of evidence that are pertinent to the instant motion for authorization.the first was an affidavit of robert barbour barbour dated june,which implicated two different and previously unsuspected men in the bowlin murder.moreover,barbour claimed that the murderer was related to the foreman of fowlkes jury and that stokes had lied in her trial testimony.the second new piece of evidence was an affidavit by stokes dated july.in her affidavit,stokes recants all of her trial testimony and states that she had cut a deal with the prosecution whereby the prosecution agreed to drop certain charges against her if she testified in fowlkes trial.fowlkes argued that this new evidence supported his actual innocence claim and his brady claim.fowlkes also argued that it supported an impartial jury claim,which he raised for the first time in his supplemental briefs.in an unpublished decision,the fourth circuit found no reversible error and denied a certificate of appealability.fowlkes angelone.cir unpublished fowlkes i.the court also stated 
we grant fowlkes motion for supplemental briefing and have considered the issues raised in his supplemental brief we find those claims meritless.we deny his request for remand to the district court.
fowlkes now seeks this court authorization,under section,to file a successive section application.in his successive section motion,fowlkes presents his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,his brady claim,and his impartial jury claim.and,once again,fowlkes advances the stokes and barbour affidavits as proof of his actual innocence.in response to fowlkes section application,virginia has submitted a june,affidavit by stokes wherein she recants her statements made in the july,affidavit submitted by fowlkes.she claims she was tricked into signing the other affidavit and that a ll of the testimony i gave at the trial of larry fowlkes was true.virginia has also presented an affidavit by officer scruggs,the officer in charge of the fowlkes case,who says that stokes called him and told him that she had been tricked into signing a paper that said she lied in the fowlkes trial.
since fowlkes has previously filed a section motion,he may only file a successive section motion if he receives authorization from this court under the standard established in section b c.see b a before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court,the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.according to section b c,t he court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second or successive application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of this subsection.id.b c.section provides the following requirements with respect to a successive petition 
b a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.
a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless 
a the applicant shows that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable or 
b i the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence and 
ii the facts underlying the claim,if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
fowlkes seeks to raise three constitutional claims in his successive petition that he was convicted only due to ineffective assistance of counsel that the prosecution violated brady maryland when it failed to disclose an alleged deal between stokes and the commonwealth attorney for leniency on a criminal charge in exchange for her testimony against fowlkes and that fowlkes was denied his sixth amendment right to an impartial jury when the foreman of his jury was the of the man barbour claimed was the true murderer.
all of these claims fail under section b,as they were raised in fowlkes original section motion.as recounted above,fowlkes raised his ineffective assistance claim and his brady claim before the district court in his original motion.on appeal,fowlkes added the stokes and barbour affidavits.he used those affidavits to argue in support of his actual innocence and brady claims,in addition to his newly added impartial jury claim.thus,on appeal,fowlkes presented the same evidence and claims that he now seeks to present in his successive motion.considering the additional evidence and claims,the court in fowlkes i stated,we find those claims meritless.fowlkes i,wl.because the evidence and claims now pressed by fowlkes have already been raised,considered,and rejected on the merits by this court,fowlkes attempt to resurrect those claims fails under section b 
fowlkes argues that the court in fowlkes i did not actually reach the merits of those claims rather it affirmed the district court on the ground that the additional evidence and claims in his supplemental briefs were not presented at the district court level.it is true that the decision of the court in fowlkes i appears incongruous since it passed on the merits of the claims while at the same time dismissing the appeal on a predicate procedural ground,failure to meet the certificate of appealability requirements.however strange,we are bound by the words of the fowlkes i opinion,for that is the law.while it is undeniably true that,given the court decision to deny a certificate of appealability,the court should not have reached the merits of the claims,it is nevertheless apodictic that the court did in fact address and decide the merits of fowlkes claims.we are accordingly bound by its determination.
we express some surprise at our concurring colleague assertion that we did not reject fowlkes claims as meritless on their merits,but,rather,held only that fowlkes did not make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional assertion,he argues,that is confirmed by the fact that a holding on the merits of those claims would have been contrary to the mandates of aedpa.as he puts it variously,the problem is either with our attribution of unwarranted clarity to the panel opinion in fowlkes or with our imputation of a holding to a portion of the panel opinion that in reality was only dicta.
judge gregory is a good story ruined by eyewitnesses,so the saying goes,of whom he is one.indeed,it might have been,as he postulates,that the panel was referring to the possibility that fowlkes new evidence raised issues only as to the substantiality of the constitutional questions presented,or even that that portion of the opinion in which fowlkes claims were rejected as meritless was really only dicta.but it was not so.
as judge gregory knows,since aedpa was enacted seven years ago,our circuit has ignored that statute mandates that we not proceed to decide the substantive merits of a habeas petition until and unless a certificate of appealability issues and that we not issue a certificate of appealability except upon a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.we have continued to decide the substantive merits of claims presented on habeas without regard to the requirement of a certificate of appealability.and we have declined to require a certificate of appealability as a precondition to decision of the merits of the claims presented in a petition for habeas corpus.
not only have we now openly acknowledged this practice.see swisher true,cir.but,that we have so proceeded and incorrectly has recently been pointed out to us and for us by the supreme court of the united states.see cockrell,d id.scalia,concurring.
the problem,then,would not appear to be with either our imputation of clarity,where such is unwarranted,or our consignment to holding of that which is only dicta.rather,the problem would appear to be with judge gregory understandable reluctance to acknowledge that our circuit has been in error for some number of years now,including the year in which fowlkes appeal was decided,in deciding the merits of claims as to which no certificate of appealability had previously issued.
even assuming,counterfactually,that fowlkes had not raised these claims in his prior section motion,the claims must still be dismissed because they do not meet the requirements of section b b fowlkes ineffective assistance claim would fail under section b b i because the factual predicate for the claim could have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence.the new evidence adduced by stokes and barbour only to his actual innocence,brady,and impartial jury claims none of the new evidence that fowlkes seeks to present supports his ineffective assistance claim.the evidence supporting that claim has been available to fowlkes at least since his trial,and indeed he raised the claim in his state habeas petition and in his first section petition.
fowlkes brady and impartial jury claims fail section b b ii s requirements.the standard under section b b ii is not simply whether the applicant can show a constitutional violation,as fowlkes seems to think,but rather whether but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.b b ii emphasis added.fowlkes brady claim fails under section b b ii because fowlkes can not show that but for the brady violation,no reasonable juror would have voted to convict.while the evidence of a deal would impeach stokes testimony somewhat,a reasonable juror could still have credited it and,on that basis,voted to convict fowlkes.fowlkes impartial jury claim would likewise fail under section b b ii because even if fowlkes could show that the jury foreman was biased,a reasonable jury could still have voted to convict on the evidence before it.thus,fowlkes can not show that but for the bias,he would not have been convicted 
for the reasons stated herein,we deny fowlkes motion for authorization under section.
authorization denied 
i concur with the majority denial of fowlkes motion for authority,but would do so upon alternative grounds.the majority is correct in finding that petitioner claims alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and in contravention of brady maryland were raised in his original section motion before the district court,and are therefore barred under section b.however,the majority unnecessarily relies upon our ambiguous and far from apodictic language in fowlkes i regarding the merits of these claims.furthermore,because the impartial jury claim was never presented before the district court,and because it is hardly clear that we considered this claim on the merits in fowlkes i,i would analyze this claim under section b b.
as the majority notes,fowlkes appeal incorporated the stokes and barbour affidavits,both to supplement his ineffective assistance of counsel and brady claims and to add a new impartial jury claim according to the majority,when we denied a certificate of appealability in fowlkes i,we also reached the merits of each of the claims before the court.the majority reaches this conclusion by citing our dicta in fowlkes i,where we noted,w e have considered the issues raised in fowlkes supplemental briefing and we find those claims meritless.as the majority notes,this seemingly gratuitous finding would appear strange and incongruous,not to mention incorrect,under the appropriate standard for reviewing an application for a certificate of appealability.see cockrell,d.it is precisely in light of these observations by the majority that we should hesitate to attribute unwarranted clarity to this troublesome language.an equally plausible alternative reading of the text of our decision in fowlkes i would follow from a more cautious analysis of the relationship between the terms issues and claims,particularly as our interpretation of this language should be informed by the procedural context of the discourse.thus,given that we were not required to reach the ultimate merits of the legal claims before us in adjudicating the application,and because the antecedent of the term claims is issues,might we not have simply been referring to the petitioner claim that his new evidence raised additional issues in furtherance of his pending application 
petitioner raised the issues presented in order to strengthen his case for the issuance of a certificate of appealability,which would allow subsequent consideration on the merits.hence,our use of the term meritless need not implicate substantive review of the merits of the legal claims presented.instead,we appear to have been passing upon the meritoriousness of the issues presented in support of the application,and noting that even in light of this new evidence,we were not convinced that the application warranted revisiting.the majority is correct that under the law of the case,we are bound by our prior decision in fowlkes however,where the meaning of that decision is unclear,and where we can adopt an equally compelling alternative understanding of the language of that decision,i see no need to assume the worst and reach our shared conclusion by buttressing a flawed basis of decision.
aedpa does not suffer kindly the relitigation of tired claims.although we have
