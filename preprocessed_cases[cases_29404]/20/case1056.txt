coy wayne wesbrook was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for murdering gloria coons and antonio cruz in the same criminal episode.we granted a certificate of appealability coa authorizing him to appeal the district court denial of federal habeas relief.we now affirm the district court denial of federal habeas relief for the reasons that follow.
wesbrook was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in harris county,texas,in june for murdering gloria coons his second wife and antonio cruz in the same criminal event.at trial,the state presented evidence that wesbrook,in addition to murdering coons and cruz,also,on the same occasion,murdered ruth money,anthony rogers,and kelly hazlip.
wesbrook was the only surviving witness to the shootings.he testified at trial that he and gloria coons were married in.they divorced in,but continued to see each other and began living together again at some point.in august,he moved out of the apartment they had shared.around that time,in an unrelated but stressful event,he discovered that his daughter by his first wife had been sexually abused by his first wife boyfriend.
at trial,wesbrook testified in his own defense that he had lunch with gloria coons on november,and that she indicated that she was interested in reconciliation.he went to her apartment that evening,hoping that she would be alone.instead,the other victims were present.wesbrook testified that he began to feel humiliated when gloria flashed her breasts to the group present at the apartment.she had sex with one of the victims and said that she was going to have sex with another of the victims,so he decided to leave.antonio cruz followed him out of the apartment and took the keys to his truck.wesbrook said that he grabbed his hunting rifle from his truck and followed cruz back into the apartment to get his keys.he claimed that,once he was back inside the apartment,the others verbally harassed,threatened,and physically abused him.he said that when someone threw a beer at him,the rifle went off.after shooting all five of the victims,he went outside,announced that he had committed the offense,and then waited for the police to arrive.he told the jury that he just lost it and that he had no intention of killing anyone.
wesbrook father also testified.he told the jury that wesbrook had learning difficulties in school,that he was evaluated by a psychologist when he was around ten years old,and that he dropped out of school in the eighth grade,on the advice of the principal.
the jury convicted wesbrook of capital murder.
at the punishment phase of wesbrook trial,the state presented evidence that wesbrook had cut gloria coons telephone line,threatened to burn the home of his first wife,brenda williams,attempted to burn the home of his after they evicted him,and threatened coons and her friends with a gun.phillip jones,one of wesbrook fellow inmates,testified that,while in jail awaiting trial for capital murder,wesbrook repeatedly talked about wanting to have his,brenda williams,and her husband killed.according to jones,wesbrook planned to give his two cousins his truck in exchange for their killing williams and her husband.in addition,the state presented evidence,including testimony and conversations,that wesbrook was soliciting the murders of three other people 
also at the punishment phase,the defense presented evidence,including wesbrook school records and some medical records.on of the state witness,jones,the defense brought out the fact that wesbrook appeared genuinely to show remorse for the murders he had committed.several of wesbrook former and supervisors testified that wesbrook was a dependable and reliable worker as a security guard and dispatcher for the volunteer fire department.the defense also presented evidence that wesbrook had a close relationship with his young daughter,that his first wife new husband had molested that daughter,and that he was depressed around the time of the shooting.matthew james nail,one of wesbrook fellow inmates in the harris county jail,testified that he and other inmates were concerned about what jones might be doing to wesbrook,because wesbrook seemed weak and vulnerable.nail testified that he never heard wesbrook say anything about a plan to kill witnesses.wesbrook sister testified that he was slow as a child and that he dropped out of school after the eighth grade.a psychologist,whose testimony is described in detail infra,also testified for the defense that wesbrook had a major depressive disorder,with an underlying dependent personality disorder,and that he had poor coping skills.she testified that he was very much at the end of his rope at the time of the murders.
the jury answered the special punishment issue on future dangerousness affirmatively and answered the special issue on mitigation negatively.on the jury findings,the court imposed the death penalty.
wesbrook conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.wesbrook state.the supreme court denied certiorari.wesbrook texas,d.the texas court of criminal appeals denied wesbrook first state habeas application in june.ex parte wesbrook.june.
wesbrook filed his federal habeas petition in december.in june,he filed a successive state habeas application in which he claimed that he is mentally retarded and exempt from execution.the district court dismissed his federal petition without prejudice so that wesbrook could seek relief on his mental retardation claim in state court.the texas court of criminal appeals denied wesbrook successive state habeas application in march.ex parte wesbrook,no.march.
on june,wesbrook filed an amended petition for federal habeas relief,asserting nine claims for relief.the district court granted summary judgment for the state and denied relief and a coa.
wesbrook requested a coa from this court to appeal the denial of relief as to three claims.based on our threshold inquiry,consisting of an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits,cockrell,d,we granted a coa for wesbrook claims that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate fully his neurological impairments he was denied his sixth amendment right to counsel by the state use of an undercover informant to obtain incriminating statements while he was incarcerated and represented by counsel and his due process rights were violated because the trial judge engaged in ex parte communications with the prosecution and acted in a dual role as both an investigator and an adjudicator.wesbrook quarterman.cir,unpublished.
the parties were given the opportunity to submit supplemental briefs on the merits of the claims,but did not submit supplemental briefs.having considered the briefs and based on our review of the record of the state court trial,and the state and federal habeas proceedings,we conclude that the state court decision to deny relief on these claims is not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in the light of the evidence presented,and is neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.we therefore affirm the district court denial of federal habeas relief.
wesbrook is not entitled to federal habeas relief on his claims unless the state court adjudication of the claims 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by th e supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than th e supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law occurs if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from th e supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.the state court factual determinations shall be presumed to be correct,and the petitioner shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e.
in reviewing the district court application of d to the state court decision,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.blanton quarterman,cir.
we now turn to address each of wesbrook claims,beginning with his ineffective assistance claim.
wesbrook contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate fully his neurological impairments.to establish a sixth amendment violation,wesbrook must prove that his counsel rendered deficient performance and that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense.strickland washington,d.counsel performance was deficient if it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.the proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.id.
s trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.in other words,counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.in any ineffectiveness case,a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances,applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgments.
id.at.in assessing counsel investigation,we must conduct an objective review of their performance,measured for reasonableness under prevailing professional norms,which includes a consideration of the challenged conduct as seen from counsel perspective at the time.wiggins smith,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.there is a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,strickland,at,and we may not find ineffective assistance of counsel merely because we disagree with counsel trial strategy.crane johnson,cir.strickland does not require counsel to investigate every conceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely the effort would be to assist the defendant at sentencing.wiggins,at.
to receive federal habeas relief on his ineffective assistance claim,wesbrook must establish that the decision of the texas court of criminal appeals is either contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,strickland.see blanton,at.we now turn to the relevant facts of this case.
at the punishment phase of trial,ann wheeler,a psychologist,testified for the defense.wheeler reviewed records of tests conducted on wesbrook by kennett,a psychologist,when wesbrook was ten years old.according to wheeler,those tests indicated that wesbrook had average to intelligence and suffered from a learning disability,for which he was punished by the school that he attended.she testified further that kennett testing showed that wesbrook suffered from a neurological impairment that caused significant problems with his academic development and hampered his psychological and social development because it made it difficult for him to make friends and caused him to be inept in social interaction.she noted that kennett had recommended further neurological,including an eeg and a full neurological examination by a neurologist.furthermore,kennett found that wesbrook had a mixed dominance,and,which is very unusual and indicates a need for further testing to see whether there are neurological problems that caused the condition.according to wheeler,wesbrook would have been labeled as learning disabled in today terms.
based on limited testing that she conducted on wesbrook,wheeler estimated that his iq is about.she testified that the evidence indicated to her that prior to the murder,wesbrook abused alcohol and was clinically depressed,and that the combination of the depression and alcohol abuse left wesbrook with very poor coping skills.she said that he also suffered from a dependent personality disorder as a result,he was never fully independent and sought out relationships with women who would assume responsibility for him.she said that the fact that wesbrook daughter had been molested,as well as several other significant stressors,likely resulted in a rapid deterioration of his functioning around the time of the murders.she also testified that wesbrook relations with gloria coons were very volatile and that,on the night of the murders,wesbrook was at the end of his rope.
wesbrook argues that his trial counsel were on notice from two early school reports and testing,and he had possible brain damage,but counsel failed to conduct a proper investigation and failed to pursue neurological testing that would have produced significant mitigating evidence.instead,he maintains,his counsel chose to present a flimsy case,based almost solely on the fact that one of the victims took wesbrook truck keys and would not return them to him.wesbrook complains that wheeler did not test his iq and did not conduct the neurological tests recommended by kennett in his report.he also contends that counsel lack of preparation for wheeler testimony resulted in a failure to bring the fact of his severe neurological deficits before the jury,and allowed the prosecution,on,to twist her testimony to portray wesbrook as a sociopath and a future danger,rather than a borderline mentally retarded man with no criminal history.he argues that,had trial counsel done a proper investigation and followed up on the recommendation for neurological testing,he would have been able to provide the jury with an explanation for his bizarre his actions on the night of the murders were attributable to neurological impairment.
the state habeas court concluded that 
counsel was not ineffective for making the reasonable trial decision to refrain from seeking additional psychological evaluations of the applicant,particularly in light of the two psychological evaluations already completed.the evaluations performed by the two mental health professionals indicated that any additional investigation would not have assisted in the applicant defense.
wesbrook maintains that if counsel had conducted a proper investigation,they would have discovered evidence such as that he presented in connection with his second state habeas application in which he claimed to be mentally retarded.in those successive habeas proceedings,wesbrook obtained an expert report from a psychologist,stephen martin.martin report is attached as an exhibit to wesbrook federal habeas petition.in his report,martin stated that wesbrook has damage to the frontal lobes of his brain and that this frontal lobe damage,along with wesbrook low intelligence,made it more difficult for wesbrook to moderate his reactions to emotionally charged situations.martin also stated that frontal lobe impairment has been associated with anger control issues,and that persons who have frontal lobe damage are at greater risk to engage in impulsive and potentially violent behaviors without fully considering the consequences.he expressed his opinion that this clinical information,had it been presented at trial,would have been helpful to the jury in understanding how wesbrook could have engaged in the violent act of murdering five people.
we agree with the district court observation that martin affidavit,upon which wesbrook relies as support for his claim,is largely duplicative of wheeler trial testimony,with the notable exception of martin discussion of wesbrook frontal lobe damage.because the jury had before it,through wheeler testimony,evidence of wesbrook impairments,there is not a reasonable probability that the outcome of the punishment phase would have been different if the jury had been presented with evidence that wesbrook had frontal lobe damage.the state court determination that wesbrook counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to secure additional expert testimony regarding those impairments is not an objectively unreasonable application of strickland.accordingly,the district court did not err in denying federal habeas relief on wesbrook ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
we now turn to consider wesbrook claim that he was denied his sixth amendment right to counsel by the state use of an undercover informant to obtain incriminating statements while he was incarcerated and represented by counsel.
the sixth amendment guarantees the accused,at least after the initiation of formal charges,the right to rely on counsel as a medium between him and the state.maine moulton,d holding that state use of informant to obtain incriminating evidence from defendant about pending charges violated defendant sixth amendment right to counsel,notwithstanding that state was also investigating other charges as to which the sixth amendment right to counsel had not attached.i ncriminating statements pertaining to pending charges are inadmissible at the trial of those charges,notwithstanding the fact that the police were also investigating other crimes,if,in obtaining this evidence,the state violated the sixth amendment by knowingly circumventing the accused right to the assistance of counsel.id.at.however,evidence pertaining to charges as to which the sixth amendment right to counsel has not attached at the time such evidence was obtained,is admissible.id.at.
phillip jones met wesbrook approximately three months before wesbrook trial began,while both of them were incarcerated in the harris county jail.they had a number of conversations in which wesbrook spoke of his desire to have his and her husband killed.after wesbrook was moved to the county jail medical facility in may,jones contacted the police and offered to serve as an informant.the police and the district attorney office agreed to put jones back in contact with wesbrook.the plan was for jones to arrange a meeting between wesbrook and an undercover law enforcement officer,gary johnson,who was posing as a hit man.
jones was placed in wesbrook cell block on june.by that time,wesbrook trial had started.wesbrook told jones he wanted three more people added to the list of persons he wanted to have killed.wesbrook gave jones a list of the names of those he wanted killed and the type of car each person drove.jones arranged to have johnson speak to wesbrook on the telephone,and wesbrook told johnson what he wanted.the next day,wesbrook was placed in contact with johnson again and he told johnson he wanted to call off the plan because he was afraid the call was being taped by jailers.wesbrook conversations with johnson were recorded.
immediately prior to the punishment phase of trial,wesbrook moved to suppress the evidence obtained by jones.the trial court conducted a hearing on the motion.at the hearing,harris county detective harry fikaris testified that jones was working for the state as an informant to obtain evidence for a solicitation of murder case.he admitted,however,that the information and evidence obtained would also be used against wesbrook at the punishment phase of his capital murder trial.at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial judge denied wesbrook motion to suppress and allowed the state to introduce jones testimony and audiotaped recordings of the telephone conversations between jones and johnson at the punishment phase.
on direct appeal,the texas court of criminal appeals held that the evidence obtained by jones,while he was acting as an informant for the state,was inadmissible as evidence of wesbrook future dangerousness in his capital murder trial,because it was obtained in violation of wesbrook sixth amendment right to counsel.at.a majority of the court concluded,however,that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt 
to support a finding of future dangerousness,prosecutors relied on the facts of the crime itself,the unadjudicated extraneous solicitation offense,and several bad acts committed by appellant.aside from evidence of a horrific killing spree that left five people dead,jurors heard from phillip jones,who,before he became an agent for law enforcement,independently discovered appellant efforts to solicit the murders of two individuals.jones testimony about these particular facts was free from any sixth amendment concerns.the jury,at that point,validly possessed a critical indicator of future dangerousness that appellant,despite his incarceration for a brutal multiple homicide,was willing to arrange and condone further murders,this time by proxy.any additional,inadmissible testimony of appellant hopes to expand his list of desired targets was of minimal consequence.in other words,because the jury possessed details of both the crime itself and the solicitation to murder,there is no reasonable likelihood that the inadmissible portion of jones testimony,considered either alone or in context,moved the jury from a state of nonpersuasion to persuasion regarding the issue of future dangerousness.
at.four judges dissented.
the district court held that,in the light of the horrific nature of wesbrook crime,the evidence of his longstanding habit of threatening others with violence,and the untainted evidence of his plot to solicit two other murders,wesbrook had failed to demonstrate that the tainted evidence had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury verdict.see brecht abrahamson,d.
wesbrook argues that the admission of the evidence was not harmless because,aside from jones testimony and the damaging tape recording,the rest of the testimony at the punishment phase consisted of allegations that he had cut his telephone wire and allegedly made some threats,none of which were carried out.wesbrook argues further that the state court failed to identify correctly the appropriate governing legal principle because it applied a sufficiency of the evidence test.he contends that the prosecution use of and reference to the illegally obtained tape recordings in its final argument,and the fact that this evidence substantially bolstered the credibility of an otherwise incredible jailhouse snitch,had a substantial or injurious effect on the jury determination of the future dangerousness issue.
the state points out that,although both of the prosecutors discussed the evidence in their closing arguments,they also discussed at length the facts of the crime and the impact of the murders on the victims families,the violent threats wesbrook made against others,wesbrook mitigating evidence,and his lack of remorse.
wesbrook is entitled to federal habeas relief on this claim only if the texas court of criminal appeals applied review in an objectively unreasonable manner.mitchell esparza,d citations omitted.i n proceedings a court must assess the prejudicial impact of constitutional error in a criminal trial under the substantial and injurious effect standard set forth in brecht abrahamson,d.fry pliler,d.in fry,the supreme court stated 
given our frequent recognition that the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa limited rather than expanded the availability of habeas relief,it is implausible that,without saying so,aedpa replaced the brecht standard of actual prejudice with the more liberal standard which requires only that the state court determination be unreasonable.that said,it certainly makes no sense to require formal application of both tests and brecht when the latter obviously subsumes the former.
id.at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.accordingly,in assessing the reasonableness of the state court application of harmless error review,we must resolve whether the violation of wesbrook sixth amendment right to counsel had a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict at the punishment phase.we conclude that it did not,and that the state court application of harmless error review is neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.the evidence of wesbrook attempts to solicit the murders of his and her husband was uncovered prior to jones becoming an agent for the state.in the light of the evidence that wesbrook murdered five peo
