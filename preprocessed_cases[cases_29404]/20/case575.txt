cesar ramirez appeals from judge mcmahon denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought under.in his petition,ramirez asserted four federal constitutional claims for relief i ineffective assistance of trial counsel,ii erroneous evidentiary rulings amounting to a denial of confrontation rights and a fair trial,iii prosecutorial misconduct amounting to a denial of a fair trial,and iv a sentence violating the eighth amendment.judge mcmahon adopted the report and recommendation of magistrate judge fox,which concluded that ramirez had not raised his claims in the state courts and that the petition should be dismissed.see ramirez attorney,civ,ramirez attorney,civ,report and recommendation.
although we reach a different conclusion as to claim i,we agree with most of the district court analysis.claim iii was presented to the appellate division but not to the new york court of appeals.claim iv was presented only as a new york statutory claim in the new york appellate courts.because new york procedural rules bar petitioner from raising these claims now,either because they have been litigated,see.a.rules a,or could have been raised in earlier proceedings,see.c,they are deemed to have been exhausted for purposes of b,c.see grey hoke,cir.ramirez made no showing of cause and prejudice regarding the failure to present these claims,see wainwright sykes,d,and,therefore,we affirmed their dismissal when we granted a certificate of appealability as to claims i and ii.see ramirez attorney,slip op.at cir.
after review,we agree that claim ii,the trial claim,was not presented to the court of appeals and can not now be pursued in the new york courts.no showing of cause and prejudice having been made,see wainwright,at,we affirm its dismissal.however,with respect to claim i,the ineffective assistance claim,we hold that ramirez letter application to the new york court of appeals for leave to appeal was sufficiently specific under the test established in daye attorney general,cir en banc,to alert that court to the federal nature of ramirez claim.we therefore vacate the dismissal of claim i and remand for further proceedings.
background 
ramirez was found guilty by a new york state jury on seven counts of rape,seven counts of sodomy,two counts of incest,three counts of sodomy,one count of rape,three counts of assault,and one count of criminal possession of a weapon.each of the counts involved brutal conduct toward ramirez daughter.at the time of trial,ramirez,who had previously been convicted of drug trafficking and tax evasion,was under indictment for the murder of his second wife he was later convicted and sentenced.he was sentenced to to years in prison for the crimes at issue here.
after his conviction,ramirez retained new counsel for the appeal.the brief filed on his behalf in the appellate division made six claims of error,four of which are relevant to the present proceeding.point ii alleged a denial of meaningful assistance of counsel point iii alleged evidentiary rulings denying his rights of confrontation and to a fair trial point iv asserted an unfair trial due to additional errors and omissions by the court,defense counsel and the prosecutor and point vi asserted that ramirez sentence was harsh and excessive but sought relief only under new york criminal procedure law c.the second department of the appellate division unanimously affirmed ramirez conviction.see people ramirez,dep t.
on october,ramirez counsel submitted a letter to the new york court of appeals requesting leave to appeal and stating that a more detailed letter application would follow once a judge was assigned to the request.pursuant to court rules,counsel also attached a copy of the appellate division brief.
after the application for leave to appeal was assigned to judge bellacosa,ramirez attorney submitted the promised detailed letter application.it stated by way of introduction 
appellant cesar ramirez seeks to raise two questions of law on an appeal to the court of appeals 
i does defense counsel failure to prepare for his client trial still constitute ineffective assistance per se in new york,or has the rule of people bennett been abrogated by strickland washington 
ii has a defendant received due process of law,in the form of a fair trial,where massive evidence of previous,uncharged crimes is admitted against him at trial while,at the same time,defense counsel displays an appalling lack of preparation 
each of these questions is discussed briefly below.
as reflected in the discussion portion of the letter application,issue i raised the question whether,under new york law,a defendant who shows that his counsel was inadequately prepared for trial need also show that prejudice resulted to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.people bennett,had held that new york law did not require a showing of prejudice where inadequate preparation of trial counsel had been demonstrated.however,the letter application noted that bennett had been decided before strickland washington,d,which held that a showing of ineffective assistance under the sixth amendment to the constitution generally requires both a defective representation and prejudice from it.the letter application ensuing discussion with regard to issue i suggested that the appellate division had apparently affirmed ramirez conviction on the ground that there had been no showing of prejudice resulting from trial counsel lack of preparation.the letter application inferred that this was the ground for affirmance based on an argument made by the prosecutor in that court and a question from the court at oral argument.the letter application then asked that leave to appeal be granted to determine whether bennett reflected current new york law.
the letter application discussion indicated that issue ii posed the question of whether ramirez had been accorded a trial meeting federal due process requirements where the trial court had erroneously,under new york law and the fourteenth amendment,admitted copious evidence of uncharged crimes and other bad acts while trial counsel failed to render even ordinary assistance of counsel.the trial court had ruled that,under people molineux,the prosecution could introduce testimony by ramirez daughter of beatings,threats with weapons,and repeated acts of rape and sodomy.much of this testimony was corroborated by ramirez son.ramirez first and third wives provided further corroboration.as noted,ramirez had murdered his second wife,but the jury was not informed of that fact.
the letter application discussion of issue ii stressed the prejudicial effects of both the molineux rulings and counsel inadequate preparation for,and conduct of,the trial.it stated 
indeed,the molineux line of its heightened risk of prejudice and unfair relies on the assumption that a defendant will have competent,zealous counsel at his side.
unfortunately,that assumption proved inaccurate here.defense counsel failed to interview defense witnesses,failed to obtain some defense documents and neglected to examine others before placing them into evidence.as the trial approached its end,defense counsel had to confess that he had not even studied the indictment see,generally,the summary of defense counsel inadequacies above,at page and see appellant brief at pages.
footnote added.the letter application then added a summary 
in this case a defendant was faced not only with a molineux ruling so broad as to make a fair trial impossible but was burdened with trial counsel who failed to make even the most minimal preparation for trial.he was thereby deprived of his right to a fair trial,because under this combination of circumstances any matter how inevitably be found guilty.
finally,the letter application concluded with an addendum the prosecutor overwhelming evidence argument.this addendum argued that the prosecution case was not strong because,
upon examination,the evidence against ramirez suffers from many defects.briefly,the major witnesses against and alex easily be shown to have been hostile,biased,and dishonest.see appellant brief at.the letters by appellant to his daughter in no way prove rape or sodomy instead,they suggest a consensual relationship between the two.appellant brief at.yet another major witness,cleopatra ramirez,admitted that she had recently spent time at a mental hospital and that her memory was not too good.see appellant brief at.
the addendum concluded 
thus,the prosecution case against appellant consists of much sound and fury,but not necessarily much substance.appellant could not,of course,make this point adequately to the jury because he was hampered both by the trial court adverse rulings and his trial counsel failure to prepare his defense.
on december,judge bellacosa denied leave to appeal,finding that there is no question of law presented which ought to be reviewed by the court of appeals people ramirez,slip op.at.on january,ramirez submitted a pro se letter motion for reconsideration and reargument of the leave application.the sole issue presented in this motion was ineffective assistance of counsel.in support,ramirez listed eight alleged failures of his trial counsel the pro se motion explicitly cited the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution and mentioned the appellate division brief but without referring to a specific section of that brief.on march,judge bellacosa granted reconsideration but once again denied leave to appeal.see people ramirez,slip op.at.
in february,ramirez,pro se,filed the present habeas petition in the southern district.the petition was assigned by judge parker to magistrate judge fox,who issued a report and recommendation of dismissal in september.because his report failed to note that ramirez had raised a federal ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the pro se letter motion for reconsideration of the denial of leave to appeal,judge jones recommitted the matter to magistrate judge fox in march for further proceedings.he submitted a second report and recommendation of dismissal in november,which is the subject of this appeal.
the magistrate judge reasoned as follows.ramirez claim iv,that his sentence violated the eighth amendment,had never been presented to the new york courts and is now procedurally barred in those courts.because no relief is now available in the new york courts,the claim was deemed to have been exhausted,see grey,at,but nevertheless should be dismissed because no showing of cause and prejudice had been made,see wainwright,at.see ramirez,civ,slip op.at,report and recommendation.because the trial and prosecutorial misconduct ii and iii had not been mentioned in either counsel letter application for leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals or in ramirez pro se motion for reconsideration,they too were procedurally barred in new york courts and also had to be dismissed for lack of a showing of cause and prejudice.see id.at.
with regard to the sixth amendment claim,claim i,the magistrate judge found that counsel letter application did not apprise the new york court of appeals of a federal constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.id.at.the magistrate judge explained that issue i in the leave application presented only a question of new york state law.see id.at.in his view,the discussion of issue ii also failed to present a federal issue because w ithout mentioning or citing the sixth amendment,the supporting argument blends a hint or whiff of ineffective assistance of counsel with a full challenge to the correctness of the state trial court ruling concerning the molineux issue of state law.id.at.
however,ramirez letter motion for reconsideration of the denial of the application for leave to appeal,the reason for the recommital to the magistrate judge,did explicitly claim a denial of the sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.the magistrate judge apparently treated this motion as a timely presentation of the federal issue to the court of appeals but found that it was a mixed claim because the pro se motion listed failings of counsel,see supra note,that had not been raised in the appellate division.the magistrate judge use of mixed is puzzling,because that term usually refers to a petition assertion of exhausted and unexhausted claims requiring further state court proceedings before federal habeas review.see zarvela artuz,cir.however,the magistrate judge also immediately thereafter concluded that ramirez claims were subject to a cause and prejudice standard thereby implying that they were deemed exhausted because procedurally barred in new york recommended dismissal.ramirez,civ,slip op.at,report and recommendation.
ramirez,acting pro se,sought and was granted a certificate of appealability in this court and was assigned counsel.the certificate was granted for the limited purpose of briefing 
whether ramirez has fairly presented a federal constitutional ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the highest state court for exhaustion purposes,when the letter application to the court of appeals is silent as to the constitutional basis for the claim,but the constitutional basis was raised in his attached brief to the appellate division which was specifically referenced in the letter application and the letter application made general reference to the lack of harmless error in counsel performance,and 
whether ramirez has fairly presented his confrontation clause and fair trial claims except for the claim regarding the molineux and sandoval rulings,in the highest state court for exhaustion purposes,when the letter application to the court of appeals is silent as to all other factual allegations,but those factual allegations were contained in the appellate division brief which was incorporated by reference in the letter application.
however,the order also affirmed the dismissal of ramirez prosecutorial misconduct and eighth amendment claims.see ramirez,at.
discussion 
under b,applicants for habeas relief serving state sentences must first exhaust all state remedies.see grey,at.state remedies are deemed exhausted when a petitioner has i presented the federal constitutional claim asserted in the petition to the highest state court after preserving it as required by state law in lower courts and ii informed that court and lower courts about both the factual and legal bases for the federal claim.see picard connor,d daye,at.even if a federal claim has not been presented to the highest state court or preserved in lower state courts under state law,it will be deemed exhausted if it is,as a result,then procedurally barred under state law.see grey,at.review of a procedurally barred claim in a federal court will,however,be subject to the cause and prejudice standard before reaching the merits.see wainwright,at.
whether a federal petitioner has presented a claim to the highest state court is a frequently litigated question,particularly where,as in the case of the new york court of appeals,the highest state court exercises discretionary jurisdiction.an application for discretionary review may be brief,ambiguously incorporate other papers by reference,and be otherwise enigmatic.
generally speaking,an application for review will preserve an issue if the nature or presentation of the claim was likely to alert the court to the claim federal nature.daye,at.of course,c iting a specific constitutional provision alerts state courts of the nature of the claim.jones vacco,cir.such specificity,however,while sufficient,is not necessary.in daye,we identified other ways in which a petitioner may alert the state court to the constitutional nature of a claim without referring chapter and verse to the constitution 
a reliance on pertinent federal cases employing constitutional analysis,b reliance on state cases employing constitutional analysis in like fact situations,c assertion of the claim in terms so particular as to call to mind a specific right protected by the constitution,and d allegation of a pattern of facts that is well within the mainstream of constitutional litigation.
a the federal ineffective assistance claim 
we believe that our certificate of appealability did not address the precise issue raised on this appeal.we asked the parties to brief the ineffective assistance issue as one involving a letter application by counsel that was silent in that regard an
