eric brown,now in state prison serving two life terms for first degree murder,was denied habeas corpus relief in the federal district court,brown,d,and now appeals.the factual background,recounted in detail in the state court decision upholding his convictions,commonwealth brown,is readily summarized.
in the early morning of june,two men were shot at close range with a shotgun in boston south end and both were killed.the day before the murders,brown had accompanied his friend dwight bobbitt,a security guard who had the credentials to obtain firearms,to a boston sporting goods store.after brown supplied bobbitt with money,bobbitt purchased a shotgun selected by brown,together with shells,and turned both the weapon and the ammunition over to brown.brown,at.bobbitt thereafter reported the shotgun as stolen,but later admitted he had purchased it for brown.id.at.
then,sometime after midnight on june,brown in the company of several friends including bobbitt fired the shotgun into the air several times outside of his house in roxbury.brown was back inside the house when police arrived to investigate,and after they left he returned outside wearing a green jacket and black boots.brown again fired into the air several times and then left on foot toward boston south end carrying the shotgun with him.brown,at.
witnesses in the south end testified that in the early morning hours on appleton street,a number of people were outside socializing and walking about.at about in the morning,a man approached one of these people,athos oliveira,and shot him twice with a shotgun,the second shot hitting oliveira in the face and killing him.the assailant continued down the street,encountered one thomas meyer,killed him with a shot to the back of the head,and left the scene.brown,at.
five witnesses who either heard or saw one or the other of the two crimes and who eventually testified at brown trial could not identify brown as the man who killed oliveira and meyer.but most of the witnesses identified the assailant as a black male and one identified the assailant as having short african american hair another said he was wearing a green,length jacket two said that he was about or so brown was in fact and one said he was pounds brown was pounds.although one said the jacket was,three agreed it was.
ten days after the crimes,on june,a policeman stopped brown for erratic driving in a community not very far from boston and eventually discovered a shotgun and a spent shell on the floor of the van he was driving.brown,at.shell casings recovered at the scenes where oliveira and meyer died were matched to the shotgun recovered from brown van bobbitt confirmed that this was the weapon he had bought and also that a green jacket that police found in brown apartment matched the color of the one brown had worn on the night of the shootings.
brown was indicted in august but was not put on trial until march.in the interim,brown was committed to massachusetts bridgewater state hospital bridgewater for an extended period to determine his competence to stand trial.successive conflicting determinations as to competency followed along with for more observation finally,after hearings in january and march,he was twice determined to be competent to stand trial by the state judge,although defense experts and a court clinician disagreed.a trial commenced in late march and lasted for four weeks.
at trial,the principal defense witness rosmarin,a forensic psychiatrist from massachusetts general hospital,testified that brown was a paranoid schizophrenic who exhibited prominent symptoms of the disease and suffered from delusions of persecution,a horror of homosexuality,and voices telling him to kill those he believed to be sexual immoralizers.he also gave his opinion that at the time of the deaths,brown was not sane and lacked criminal responsibility under the standard used in massachusetts 
two treating psychiatrists and a treating psychologist from bridgewater agreed that brown was a paranoid schizophrenic suffering from delusions,and described the symptoms they had observed during his time at bridgewater.supporting evidence from friends and family members confirmed brown mental and emotional deterioration in and.but several witnesses for the prosecution testified on rebuttal that brown seemed normal to them both before and after the killings and the prosecution expert testified,albeit rather summarily and after limited exposure to him,that brown was not psychotic on the day of the shootings.
the jury convicted brown in of two separate counts of first degree murder,as well as other less serious offenses,and on each murder count he received a life sentence.the supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc affirmed the conviction.brown.brown then filed a habeas petition in the federal district court.the magistrate judge recommended that the habeas petition be dismissed on the merits,and the district judge agreed,but also granted a certificate of appealability as to four different issues,which are now before us.brown,d at.
a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus when a state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.d there are additional provisions relating to factual issues,id.e,but any ambiguity resulting from the interaction of the factual provisions,see wood allen,d noting circuit split,does not impact the outcome here.
sufficiency of the evidence.brown first argument is that under jackson virginia,d,no reasonable jury could find that he is the person who committed the murders.the sjc rejected this claim on the merits,brown,at,so our review is deferential.but,in this instance,deference to the state court is beside the point if an identical insufficiency of evidence claim were made on direct appeal after a federal trial,the evidence would be entirely sufficient to support a jury verdict finding that brown shot the two victims.
brown says the prosecution established,at most,circumstantial evidence connecting brown and the gun used in the shootings.the prosecution case was circumstantial in the limited sense that no one at the scene testified in court to recognizing brown as the shooter but there was direct eyewitness evidence that the man was similar to brown in race,height,weight,hair style and green jacket that brown left for the south end with his shotgun an hour or two before the murders that he possessed that shotgun less than two weeks later and that the shell casings at the scene matched his weapon.
true,the credibility of bobbitt who testified to the purchase of the gun and the incident in front of brown house before the murders was open to attack,although his version of the gun purchase was not effectively challenged.the eyewitness testimony as to identity of the shooter was in some respects vague and certainly the jury could have doubted brown sanity.but this last issue is not before us and brown plainly disturbed personality,if the disturbance fell short of insanity,provided an explanation for what otherwise might be viewed as a senseless,and therefore improbable,crime.
brown counsel at trial conceded to the jury in closing that brown had done the shootings,and sensibly concentrated on persuading the jury that brown was insane.in his presentation of the case,defense counsel provided strong expert and lay testimony that brown was insane which would likely have persuaded many juries especially because the prosecution had a bare minimum of expert evidence on its side and appeared to rely heavily on the doubtful inference that brown can not have been insane because he was fairly organized and systematic.
however,under the massachusetts standard see note,above,showing a severe mental illness is not conclusive the jury must also decide whether the illness prevented the defendant from appreciating the wrongfulness of his actions or conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law.commonwealth dipadova.the main defense expert said brown met this standard the prosecution expert said that brown was not even psychotic on the day of the murders and the sjc upheld the jury verdict.brown,at.the insanity issue was not pressed in the habeas proceeding.
instead,in this court,brown presses his attack on the sufficiency of the identification evidence along two lines.first,counsel points out that under massachusetts law,the evidence can be found insufficient based solely on what is presented in the prosecutor opening case if the defendant files a motion at the close of the prosecution case and,on this premise,brown counsel urges that jackson should be applied so as to disregard any evidence that came in only later through the defense case or prosecution rebuttal where a limited amount of evidence adverse to brown was admitted.
but this massachusetts practice is not imposed by federal constitutional law.see lamere slaughter,cir hernandez cowan,cir.and jackson does not say or even suggest that its test is to be applied to the prosecution case but asks instead whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.at.accord mcdaniel brown,d.
second,brown relies on,cir,cert.denied,d,where this court on habeas review upheld a jackson challenge.in that case,the defendant was directly connected with a vicious assault only by some small blood stains in the defendant apartment linked by dna testing to him not the victim and his baseball bat presumptively the murder weapon found in the woods,also with blood stains which yielded no conclusive results after dna testing.id.at.
in practice,jackson challenges are rarely upheld on habeas and is a rare exception.the evidence showing that brown committed the crime,described above,was far stronger than in.the only truly close issue as to guilt was brown sanity,and,as noted earlier,that issue was resolved against brown based on what can charitably be regarded as conflicting expert evidence,and anyway that issue is not before us.
intoxication.brown does raise a related state of mind issue on this appeal.specifically,brown claims that the trial court should have granted his request for a jury instruction on intoxication.at trial,psychiatrists for both the defense and the prosecution made mention of brown drinking on the night of the crimes.but,although brown submitted a written request for an intoxication instruction,the trial judge instructions to the jury did not include one on intoxication.brown,at.
massachusetts defines first degree murder as requiring premeditated malice.laws ch,and it endorses a jury instruction allowing the jury to consider intoxication to negate the required scienter but such an instruction is required only when there is evidence presented of intoxication so debilitating it prevents the defendant from forming the requisite intent.commonwealth morgan.on direct appeal,the sjc found there was no such evidence in this case.brown,at.
brown principal claim here is that the no such evidence ruling was an unreasonable determination of the facts.d.ordinarily,errors of state law are not the basis for federal habeas relief,estelle mcguire,d pulley harris,d,but brown also argues that the failure to give the instruction where the facts and law made it appropriate violated his due process rights in all events,no evidence of disabling intoxication was presented in this case or at least the state court could permissibly so find.
true,brown points to testimony of the prosecution and defense psychiatric experts rogers and rosmarin both of whom adverted to statements brown himself made during their examinations that he had drunk vodka and beer on the night of the murders rosmarin also mentioned some intake of marijuana and rogers,negating insanity,referred to brown drinking excessively and homophobia to explain the killings.
but brown statements to the doctors were admitted only to disclose the basis for their expert opinions on sanity and not for the truth of brown statements.brown,at.the distinction was conveyed to brown jury and is not directly challenged in this case.commonwealth sama,cited to us by brown,did require an instruction but there the expert gave his own opinion that the defendant might have been hallucinating at the time of the crimes as a result of substance abuse.
thus,strictly speaking,practically no evidence of brown drinking was properly before the jury even if the statements were considered as substantive evidence,the sjc pointed out that 
none of this evidence or any other evidence admitted at trial demonstrated how much or for how long brown had been drinking on the night of the shootings or what effect any alcohol that he may have ingested had on him or whether his ability to form the requisite criminal intent was impaired.
brown,at internal citation omitted.assuming a federal issue exists,the state court assessment rejecting such an instruction was not unreasonable,given the lack of any specific testimony about a debilitating impact.wood.at.
competence.brown third argument on habeas is that he was not competent to stand trial,or at least that the procedures used to determine his competency were defective.competence to stand trial is a narrowly focused concept a defendant may have all kinds of mental afflictions,but he can avoid trial only if he lacks sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings.dusky united states,d.
as already explained,after his arrest brown was for several years confined to bridgewater.the competency determination now before us was initially made in january and then reaffirmed after a hearing in march shortly before trial.the finding was made despite affidavits from brown counsel stating that brown was unable to consult with his attorneys with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and did not have a rational understanding of the proceedings against him.
the defense expert,price,based on examinations in february and march,agreed.she stated that brown was suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia,was delusional,believed he was the anti christ,and heard voices.she said that brown appeared to have deteriorated significantly since his last evaluation,was inattentive,and would have serious difficulties following the proceedings and preparing a defense.she also said that brown would likely substantially improve if he resumed medication 
the court clinical psychologist evaluated brown on march,and also found him incompetent.he summarized his review of brown past evaluations as follows 
t he prevailing clinical opinion is that brown indeed can be competent,particularly when he is appropriately medicated.under the influence of medication his symptoms are significantly improved although never completely absent h is competency can fluctuate under a number of different conditions.
the psychologist reported that while brown could respond well to short,concrete questions,he could not process questions that were longer or complex.he concluded that brown could understand only simple concepts,did not have more than a superficial understanding of key legal processes for example,he could name the two possible defenses as not guilty by insanity and not there but could not explain how he might choose between the two,and was not currently competent and would only worsen without medication.
after receiving these reports,the judge ordered another evaluation by the commonwealth expert,a forensic psychiatrist.annunziata met with brown for two evaluations both when brown was still,and testified that brown was competent to stand trial.annunziata said that while brown did hear voices,they were not overly distracting,and that during the evaluation,brown was able to concentrate and focus,had a good memory,and showed no gross impairment in judgment.
despite further defense testimony by price after another brief interview with brown,the trial judge ruled on march,that brown was competent,expressly relying solely on annunziata testimony,to which he gave great weight and credit,and his own obser
