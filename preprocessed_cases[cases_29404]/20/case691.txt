opinion of the court 
appellant jamar campbell was convicted by a jury in of possession of crack cocaine with intent to deliver and possession of cocaine within three hundred feet of a park.he appealed his conviction to the supreme court of delaware,which affirmed.after unsuccessfully seeking relief in the superior and supreme courts of delaware,campbell,acting pro se,filed this habeas proceeding under in the district court.his petition and accompanying memorandum of law alleged ineffective assistance of counsel on a number of grounds and an assortment of six other violations of his federal constitutional rights the district court concluded that all of campbell claims other than his ineffective assistance of counsel claims were unreviewable because the delaware supreme court had rejected them pursuant to delaware supreme court rule,which provided an independent and adequate state law ground supporting that court judgment.therefore,the court reviewed those claims only for cause and prejudice or a miscarriage of justice.see coleman thompson,d.with respect to campbell ineffective assistance of counsel claims,the district court held that campbell had failed to exhaust three of them in the state courts and had not shown cause and prejudice or a miscarriage of justice,and that the delaware supreme court rejection of the remainder was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law within the meaning of d.
this court granted campbell application for a certificate of appealability under c with respect to the following issues is delaware supreme court rule an independent and adequate state ground that precludes federal habeas review did the district court properly discern all of the ineffective assistance of counsel claims that campbell presented to the state court,and was the delaware supreme court application of strickland washington,d unreasonable.app.at.we also granted his application for appointment of counsel.we conclude that delaware supreme court rule provides an independent and adequate state law ground for the delaware supreme court judgment,that any error of the district court in rejecting three of campbell claims of ineffective assistance of counsel as unexhausted was harmless,and that the delaware supreme court application of strickland was not unreasonable.
delaware supreme court rule 
delaware supreme court rule provides 
only questions fairly presented to the trial court may be presented for review provided,however,that when the interests of justice so require,the court may consider and determine any question not so presented.
on campbell direct appeal,the supreme court of delaware expressly invoked rule in the disposition of all of campbell claims other than his ineffective assistance of counsel claims.after ruling that campbell ineffective assistance claims would have to be pursued in a relief proceeding,the court turned to the first of the remaining six claims and ruled as follows 
we review this claim,as well as the rest of campbell claims,for plain error,since he raises them for the first time in this appeal.supr.wainwright state.plain error is error that is so clearly prejudicial to substantial rights as to jeopardize the fairness and integrity of the trial process.id.
campbell state.the court held that all six of these claims failed to pass the plain error test.
as this ruling and the citation to wainwright indicate,the interest of justice exception to rule has been interpreted in the context of criminal litigation to call for what the delaware supreme court terms a plain error analysis.wainwright explains this concept as follows 
under the plain error standard of review,the error complained of must be so clearly prejudicial to substantial rights as to jeopardize the fairness and integrity of the trial process.dutton state.furthermore,the doctrine of plain error is limited to material defects which are apparent on the face of the record which are basic,serious and fundamental in their character,and which clearly deprive an accused of a substantial right or which clearly show manifest injustice.
wainwright,at.
as the delaware supreme court opinions in wainwright and this case indicate,this plain error rule is a state law rule and is applied without reference to federal case law.see dutton state.
a federal habeas court may not address the merits of a claim if the state court opinion includes a plain statement indicating that the judgment rests on a state law ground that is both independent of the merits of the federal claim and an adequate support for the court decision.coleman thompson,d.as we have explained 
a state rule provides an independent and adequate basis for precluding federal review of a claim if the rule speaks in unmistakable terms,all state appellate courts refused to review the petitioner claim on the merits,and the state courts refusal was consistent with other decisions,that is,the procedural rule was consistently and regularly applied.doctor walters,cir.
albrecht horn,cir.the question before us is whether the delaware supreme court application of its rule in campbell case was independent of the merits of his federal claims and adequate support for its judgment 
independence 
when,as here,a state court expressly relies on a state procedural rule of preclusion as a basis for its decision,the independence issue turns on whether the state law alone provides everything necessary to support the court judgment.even when the state court decision rests on alternative holdings,one based on federal law and the other based on a state procedural rule of preclusion,for example,the court reliance on federal law does not deprive the state rule of its independence if the state rule is sufficient alone to support the judgment.caruso zelinsky,cir 
while the delaware supreme court when applying rule in this context of criminal litigation must,of course,be cognizant of the nature of the alleged federal constitutional violation,federal law is not essential to support its judgment.the court is applying state,not federal,law and it can apply that state law without resolving the merits of the federal constitutional issue.delaware case law establishes that the issue of whether the alleged error in the context of this particular case was apparent on the face of the record and so clearly prejudicial to substantial rights as to jeopardize the fairness and integrity of the trial process are issues governed by delaware law.and those issues may be resolved by assuming arguendo the merit of the federal claim.in these respects,the situation before us is much like that before the court of appeals for the seventh circuit in willis aiken,cir.the court there posed the issue before it in the following manner 
the indiana postconviction appellate court addressed federal constitutional concerns in analyzing the appropriateness of the jury instruction.as we have just noted,however,it did so in the context of determining whether waiver of the issue through failure to object ought to be forgiven because the instruction constituted fundamental error.we must now determine whether,in this procedural context,the indiana appellate court judgment can be said to rest on an independent and adequate state law ground or whether the determination of no fundamental error is so interwoven,coleman,at.at,with the federal claim as to justify federal review without a demonstration of cause and prejudice.
the willis court ensuing description of the case law dealing with the indiana fundamental error doctrine is an accurate description of the delaware plain error jurisprudence under rule 
these cases demonstrate that the principle of fundamental error in indiana law involves an assessment not only of the substantive rights at stake but also of their impact on the particular trial.while there have been occasions in which indiana courts have looked to a federal court assessment of federal rights to corroborate its own assessment,see winston state,there is no discernible pattern of dependency on federal court assessment of a particular error as fundamental.rather,the term,as employed in the indiana cases,appears to be a term of art employed on a basis for the purpose of determining whether to excuse noncompliance with the requirement that a timely objection be made on the record.
indiana mandates review on the merits of fundamental rights claims only when the denial of the right gives rise to a question of fundamental error as defined by state law.gutierrez,at emphasis supplied.
delaware plain error exception to rule is not unique.many states have procedural default rules with similar safety valves for situations in which enforcing the procedural default would work a serious injustice.neal gramley,cir.as a result,while the united states supreme court has not definitively resolved the matter,there is ample court of appeals case law on whether invocation of similar plain error review of alleged violations of the federal constitution in order to mitigate the effect of a state procedural default rule will suffice to deprive a state court ruling of its independent character.we agree with our sister courts of appeals for the first,fourth,sixth,seventh,tenth and eleventh circuits that it does not.gunter maloney,cir mere fact that a state appellate court engages in a discretionary,and necessarily cursory,review under a miscarriage of justice analysis does not in itself indicate that the court has determined to waive an independent state procedural ground for affirming the conviction daniels lee,cir federal court procedurally barred from considering claim where state court merely reviewed whether the error so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process scott mitchell,cir that ohio supreme court reserved discretion,in exceptional cases,to review for plain error an alleged violation of the federal constitution that would otherwise be barred by its contemporaneous objection rule does not preclude that rule from serving as an independent state law ground neal,at illinois like many states provides a safety valve for situations in which enforcing a procedural default would mask a plain error.to decide whether an error is plain requires consideration of the only so far as may be required to determine that issue.it does not open up the merits any wider for consideration by the federal court.internal citations omitted cargle mullin,cir a state court can deny relief for what it recognizes or assumes to be federal error,because of the petitioner failure to satisfy some independent state law predicate.in such a case,that predicate would constitute an independent state ground for decision which would warrant application of principles on federal habeas.julius johnson,cir the mere existence of a plain error rule does not preclude a finding of procedural default.osborne ohio,d where state court reviewed claim for plain error citing exclusively state law,we have no difficulty agreeing with the state that osborne counsel failure to contemporaneously object constitutes an independent and adequate ground preventing us from reaching the claim roy coxon,cir distinguishing osborne and concluding that,where state court cited to and relied on federal law in its plain error review,claim not procedurally defaulted.but see walker endell,cir.
thus,our case,like willis,is one in which the applicable state law is not dependent on a federal law.it is unlike ake oklahoma,d,where the escape valve for the procedural default rule was phrased in terms of fundamental trial error and,under oklahoma law,all federal constitutional errors were fundamental.as the supreme court explained in ake,that was a situation in which the state made application of the procedural bar depend on an antecedent ruling on federal law,that is,on the determination of whether federal constitutional error had been committed.before applying the waiver doctrine to a constitutional question,the state court was required to rule,either explicitly or implicitly,on the merits of the constitutional question.id.at.
rule,as applied by the delaware supreme court in this case,was independent of federal law.
a state procedural rule is adequate to bar federal habeas review only if it is firmly established and regularly followed by the state courts at the time of the petitioner trial.ford georgia,d.this rule is intended both to ensure that state courts do not insulate disfavored claims from federal review,and to ensure that federal habeas review is not barred unless petitioners have fair notice of the steps they must take to avoid default.bronshtein horn,cir dugger adams,d hathorn lovorn,d state courts may not avoid deciding federal issues by invoking procedural rules that they do not apply evenhandedly to all similar claims.in applying these principles,this court seeks to determine whether the state rule itself provides guidance regarding how the rule should be applied or whether such standards have developed in practice.see,doctor walters,cir because the rule on its face provided little or no guidance regarding the application of the rule to the present facts,examining the case law to determine whether the rule,at the time of its application to petitioner,was firmly established and regularly applied.however,neither an occasional act of grace by a state court nor a willingness in a few cases to overlook the rule and address the claim on the merits renders a rule inadequate.banks horn,cir.a rule can be adequate if the state supreme court faithfully applies it in the vast majority of cases.dugger,at.
rule and the case law interpreting it served clear notice on campbell and his trial counsel in unmistakable terms that an issue not presented to the trial court would not be considered on appeal unless the alleged error was so prejudicial to substantial rights as to jeopardize the fairness and integrity of the trial process.wainwright sykes,d.moreover,campbell does not,and can not,claim that the supreme court of delaware as of regularly ignored this state rule when presented with an issue not fairly presented to the trial court.based on our review of its application of this rule as of the time of campbell trial in,it appears that,when confronted with an issue raised for the first time on appeal,the court virtually always relied upon rule in some manner in the vast majority of such cases,it held that review was precluded by the rule.the court occasionally,but infrequently,merely cited rule and found the claim waived or defaulted,without further discussion.see,wade insulation,visnovsky,manley state,marine state,it also frequently engaged in plain error review and with a few sentences of explanation,found none.see,weedon state,gattis state.as one would expect given the requirements of the plain error test,the court occasionally,but rarely,concluded that the test was satisfied and proceeded to resolve the merits of the claim.see,lewis state,invoking the interests of justice exception because,on appeal,defendant raised important questions relating to the sixth amendment and fundamental fairness in the administration of justice finding violations reynolds ellingsworth,cir collecting cases.importantly,we have been referred to,and have found,no cases in which the delaware supreme court plain error analysis has led to inconsistent results.
in the final analysis,campbell argument on adequacy boils down to his insistence that a discretionary procedural rule such as rule can not be adequate for purposes of procedural default.appellant br.at.if accepted,this proposition that a state procedural rule is rendered per se inadequate merely because it allows for some exercise of discretion by state courts would all but vitiate the doctrine of procedural default in the federal habeas context.as we have earlier noted,numerous courts of appeals cases have sustained the validity of state procedural bar rules having safety valves which involve exercise of the same kind of discretion required by the interest of justice exception to rule.see also,wedra lefevre,cir w e are not convinced that simply because new york law allows some discretion to be exercised in the granting of extensions that a dismissal on the basis of untimeliness does not constitute an adequate procedural bar hutchison bell,cir due process exception does not render state rule inadequate for federal procedural default as long as discretion is not unfettered prihoda mccaughtry,cir state rule allowing court to disregard procedural bar for sufficient reason is not necessarily inadequate wood hall,cir that the application of a rule requires the exercise of judicial discretion does not render the rule inadequate to support a state decision.the issue is not whether the state procedural default rule leaves room for the exercise of some judicial all do.rather,the issue is whether,at the relevant point in time,the judicial discretion contemplated by the state rule is being exercised in a manner that lets people know when they are at risk of default and treats people in the same manner.our review of delaware supreme court rule law convinces us that it performs both of these functions.
campbell cites very little in support of his condemnation of discretion.he complains that the delaware supreme court frequently exercises its discretion under rule to review federal claims raised for the first time on appeal but the cases he cites,by his own acknowledgment,present ed fundamental constitutional problems which the delaware supreme court found to satisfy the plain error standard.appellant br.at.we do not agree that this happens frequently,but,in any event,the frequency of such findings is not material so long as the plain error rule is being regularly and consistently applied.
the only category of cases where campbell purports to identify instances in which rule has been applied in an inconsistent manner to similar situations is ineffective assistance of counsel cases.he cites a number of cases for the proposition that the delaware supreme court often invokes rule to review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel for the first time on direct appeal and then cites a number of cases for the proposition that it also frequently exercises its discretion to not consider ineffective assistance of counsel cases for the first time on appeal.appellant br.at emphasis in original.given the variety of forms ineffective assistance of counsel claims may take and the infinite variety of circumstances in which they may have occurred,this alone hardly demonstrates that rule is inconsistently applied by the supreme court of delaware in ineffective assistance of counsel cases.moreover,frequently,when it decides not to consider ineffective assistance of counsel claims for the first time on appeal,the delaware supreme court,as here,does not reach the rule issue,relying instead on a different and independent claims are generally best heard in the first instance in a relief proceeding because the trial record will not be adequate for resolving the relevant issues,and because trial counsel,if continuing to pursue his representation on direct appeal,should not be required to argue his own ineffectiveness.campbell state,wl,citing desmond state.see also duross state,collins state.in one of the cases relied upon by campbell,johnson state,for example,the court concluded that the plain error rule gave it the power to hear the ineffective assistance of counsel issue,but that,as here,these kinds of prudential considerations dictated that it stay its hand until the trial court addresses that issue in the first instance.in short,we perceive no inconsistency in the cases campbell cites.
we hold that delaware supreme court rule as applied by the delaware supreme court in campbell case provides an independent and adequate state ground which forecloses federal habeas review as the district court held.
ii.ineffective assistance 
the state case against campbell was straightforward.two police officers observed campbell at on december,standing with a woman on the sidewalk.he and the woman had their hands out towards one another and were looking down as they appeared to exchange something.the officers stopped their patrol car near campbell and got out.as they did,campbell began to walk away and threw an object into the street under a car.one of the officers retrieved the object almost immediately.it was a bag containing smaller bags which held,in total,grams of crack cocaine.campbell was arrested.
the police officers testified at campbell trial along with a senior forensic chemist and those having responsibility for the chain of custody of the drugs.campbell was the sole witness for the defense.he denied selling drugs.he indicated that he was on his way to visit his aunt and uncle but had some difficulty remembering his uncle name.
the supreme court of delaware when reviewing the judgment of the superior court in the relief proceeding described the ineffective assistance of counsel claims before it as follows 
h is trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to conduct an adequate investigation,subpoena trial witnesses,make appropriate objections at trial,conduct a proper of the state witnesses,move to suppress evidence,challenge the arrest warrant,object to improper jury instructions,and move for a mistrial.
campbell state,wl.the delaware supreme court denied all of these claims for the same reason 
in order to prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel,campbell must show that his counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that,but for counsel professional errors,there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different 
campbell claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are unavailing.campbell has presented no evidence that any claimed error on the part of his counsel resulted in prejudice to him.
campbell insists that this ruling was an unreasonable application of strickland because the delaware supreme court essentially required campbell,a pro se litigant,to produce evidence of prejudice at the pleading stage without giving him an opportunity to present evidence of prejudice.appellant br.at.we disagree.
while it is true that the court employed the phrase presented no evidence,we decline to attribute to the delaware supreme court an intent to fault campbell for not having presented evidence to the court when no hearing had been held.in is,in the context of a motion by the state to summarily affirm the superior court judgment on the ground that it was manifest on the face of campbell opening brief that the appeal was without merit,app.at court clearly was ruling that campbell had provided no reason to believe he could present a prima facie case of prejudice if the matter proceeded to a hearing.this was not an unreasonable application of strickland.we approved a similar application of strickland in wells petsock,cir,where the petitioner,in his petition and brief,had pointed to no evidence of such prejudice.we affirmed the district court dismissal of the habeas petition without a hearing.while we there dealt with a district court dismissal of a habeas petition,our holding makes clear that the delaware supreme court application of strickland was not unreasonable.
when a district court has denied a petition for a writ of habeas corpus without an evidentiary hearing,we must remand for a hearing only if the petitioner has alleged facts that,if proved,would entitle him to relief.zettlemoyer fulcomer.cir,petition for cert.filed june.thus,to merit a hearing,a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel,accepting the veracity of its allegations,must satisfy both prongs of the strickland test,deficient counsel and prejudice to the defense.dawson,cir.here,wells allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel is impaled on the second prong of the court analysis in strickland.
in order to establish the prejudice required by strickland,the party claiming ineffective assistance must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.it is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding not every error that conceivably could have influenced the outcome undermines the reliability of the result of the proceeding.id.at.while it is true,as campbell stresses,that his factual allegations had to be accepted for t
