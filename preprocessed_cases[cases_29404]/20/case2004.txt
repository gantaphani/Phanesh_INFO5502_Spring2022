in april of,an indiana state court jury convicted alan matheney of murder and burglary.agreeing with the jury recommendation,the trial judge sentenced matheney to death.matheney exhausted his direct appeals and proceedings.moving to the federal courts on july,he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,which included a claim that he had been incompetent to stand trial.on july,the district court,without a hearing but in a detailed examination of the extensive record,found,among other things,that matheney was competent to stand trial and denied his habeas petition.on appeal,this court remanded the case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on issues related to matheney incompetency claim.
on november,the district court,in compliance with our directions,held an evidentiary hearing addressing the same matters decided in its memorandum and order of,to wit whether matheney was competent to stand trial in whether matheney attorneys at his trial were ineffective because they did not demand a competency hearing prior to the trial and whether the state trial court was obligated to hold a competency hearing sua sponte.
as before,the district court considered the totality of the evidence that pertained to these issues from the trial record,the proceedings record,and the federal habeas record,along with some additional evidence submitted by the parties.
it again concluded that matheney had been competent to stand trial in.hence,the district court reasoned,his attorneys did not provide ineffective assistance at his trial,and the trial court did not err in failing to sua sponte consider matheney competency.
matheney appeals only the district court determinations as to his competency and his attorneys effectiveness.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm the district court decision to deny the writ.
the factual and procedural background of this case has been thoroughly laid out in prior opinions.see matheney anderson,cir matheney iv matheney anderson,d matheney iii matheney indiana,matheney ii matheney indiana,matheney i.it will suffice for present purposes to supply only a brief factual introduction to the relevant issues and refer to prior treatments of the case as necessary.
on march,matheney took advantage of an pass from an indiana state prison to break into the home of his,chase her outside,and brutally bludgeon her to death with a shotgun.faced with overwhelming evidence linking matheney to the crimes,matheney trial counsel admitted in the first line of his opening statement that matheney indeed performed this horrific act and subsequently presented the legal defense of insanity.this defense strategy ultimately proved to be unsuccessful.
shortly after his indictment,his original counsel requested the evaluation of matheney by psychiatrists for the purpose of determining matheney competency to stand trial and his mental state at the time of the offense.the incompetency claim and the insanity defense were both premised on matheney unique understanding of the events of his life.matheney was in prison at the time of the murder because he had kidnapped his children and battered his.rather than attributing his imprisonment to his own actions,matheney blamed a conspiracy between his and a prosecutor,whom he believed were having an affair.in preparing for trial and at his proceedings,matheney insisted that the focus of his defense should be to expose this conspiracy and matheney his crimes.
the defense early request for a competency examination notwithstanding,the trial court did not order the doctors to address matheney competency to stand trial.so,the doctors,batacan and berkson,made no explicit competency findings in their written reports on matheney sanity.instead,the doctors limited their inquiries into whether matheney was sane under indiana law at the time of his crimes.the issue of competency was not raised by defense counsel after the initial motion.
competency to stand trial,however,was addressed five years later by the indiana trial court in the review of matheney conviction.a lengthy evidentiary hearing was conducted.the hearing included an ex parte examination of matheney counsel by the magistrate,testimony by matheney himself,and expert testimony.
along with many other issues,the question of matheney competency to stand trial in was fully reviewed in the trial court proceeding.it was argued that matheney received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorneys failed to secure a competency determination prior to his trial.however,in a page findings of fact and conclusions of law,entered on april,the magistrate and judge found to the contrary.we quote extensively from that document 
petitioner allegation the petitioner was denied the effective assistance of trial and appellate counsel because counsel failed to notify the court that the petitioner was incompetent to stand trial and was incompetent to proceed on direct appeal.c.
conclusion the petitioner was competent.
the petitioner asserts that he was incompetent at the time of trial and appeal.we note that counsel at the hearing on the petition for relief attempted to halt the proceedings because of their stated belief that the petitioner remains incompetent.for the reasons discussed below,it is the conclusion of this court that the petitioner is,and always has been,competent.
the petitioner raised the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect at trial.he was examined by a number of mental health professionals who testified at trial.the petitioner mental condition was no secret from either the trial court or the jury.the decision to raise the affirmative defense was made by the trial attorney who also acted as appellate counsel.counsel sincerely believed and continues to believe that the petitioner had a mental illness.the affirmative defense was pursued at trial for this reason and because part of the petitioner trial strategy regarding the defense took into account the evidentiary advantage of presenting testimony from the petitioner through third parties without putting him personally on the witness stand.the petitioner was consulted on this strategy and agreed to it.
one thing about the petitioner seems very clear.he is one of the most difficult clients that any lawyer could be obliged to represent.from virtually the day the case was filed,the petitioner has routinely papered the courts with pro se pleadings that have perhaps doubled the volume of the record.they have kept his lawyers scurrying to deal with the collateral problems those pleadings create.the previously cited filing of the pro se motion for change of venue from the county is but one example.as trial counsel has implied,working with the petitioner requires a great deal of patience.
what is the petitioner problem first and foremost,he is intensely and narrowly focused on the belief that his and the prosecuting attorney in joseph county were having an affair.he believes that he was imprisoned prior to the murder as part of a conspiracy between the putative lovers to keep him out of the way.and finally,he also believes that his capital prosecution for murder was an extension of that conspiracy because the prosecuting attorney wanted to forever silence the petitioner about the affair.the petitioner is so narrowly focused on this alleged conspiracy that he sees the actions of others,including those of the trial court and his own attorneys,as extensions of the conspiracy to keep the affair from being litigated in the courts.he believes that the affair is the only matter worth litigating even now and he has little patience for those who suggest that the affair is irrelevant to the question of whether or not he murdered his.
the attorneys for the petitioner at trial,on appeal,and in these proceedings have all had trouble communicating with the petitioner because of his reaction to those he feels are not giving sufficient attention to the conspiracy issue.as appellate counsel tells it,one needs to let the petitioner talk on and on about the things he feels are important before other issues can be discussed.communication is possible,however,if not efficient.most significantly,counsel has stated that the petitioner was substantively involved in the trial process even if he was as helpful as another client might have been.
the petitioner alleges that he was and remains incompetent.competency as used here means the ability to understand the nature of the proceedings and assist in the preparation of a defense.it is the conclusion of this court that the petitioner has always been competent because he understood the nature of the proceedings at trial,on appeal,and in the petition for relief and,he was able to assist in the preparation of his defense.
the petitioner understood the nature of the proceedings at,on appeal,and in the petition for trial relief.it is very clear from his own pleadings that he understood that the purpose of the trial was to adjudge him innocent or guilty of the murder of his.he also understood that one issue in the trial court was whether he should be put to death himself for that murder.he understood the respective roles of the prosecuting attorneys,defense attorneys and trial court judges at trial.likewise,he recognized the purpose of the appeal and the mechanisms that were a part of it.the repeated pro se criticisms of the attorneys,the courts,and the rulings on the admissibility of evidence,all are in themselves sufficient to support the conclusion that the petitioner has always had a very clear understanding of the nature of the proceedings even if he did not agree with others opinions of what should be presented in those proceedings.
the petitioner was able to assist in the preparation of his defense.the one trial attorney who had the best rapport with the petitioner was the same one who represented the petitioner on appeal.he found the petitioner frustrating,stubborn and decidedly.it required extraordinary patience to deal with the petitioner.but,the petitioner was able to provide counsel with the details of everything that preceded and followed the murder,even if he did not describe the beating death itself.there is no evidence to suggest that the petitioner was unable to assist trial counsel.
does the petitioner have a mental illness the experts disagree.in short,it is sufficient to say that the petitioner has an obsession or delusional way of thinking that some doctors believe is so significant that it rises to the level of a paranoid personality disorder.this,of course,was known at the time of trial to both the judge and the jury through the doctors testimony.
after trial and appeal,a psychologist examined the petitioner in preparation for the hearing on the petition for postconviction relief.he reported an opinion that the petitioner was unable to assist counsel in the prosecution of the petition because he could not rationally discuss his case,nor manage sufficient distance from his delusional system to appreciate the possibility that he might stand to benefit from perspectives other than his own.the doctor who testified at trial on behalf of the petitioner agreed.we do not.the petitioner obsession,whether factual or delusional,has always made it difficult to work with him,but it has not made it impossible.this court conclusion that the petitioner was and remains competent in the legal sense makes it unnecessary to explain our further conclusion that competency of the petitioner was not required before the appeal or petition for postconviction relief could be resolved.
exh.c at endnotes omitted.
the indiana supreme court affirmed the lower court determination of matheney competency to stand trial given the psychiatrists determinations before trial,trial counsels own opinions of matheney competency,and berkson earlier determination of matheney competency,trial counsel were not ineffective for failing to follow up their request for a determination of competency with a formal motion for a hearing on matheney competency.matheney ii,at thus,the indiana courts,in adjudicating the effectiveness of matheney state trial and appellate counsel,directly addressed and determined matheney competency to proceed at trial.
matheney then brought a federal habeas claim under in the northern district of indiana.that court denied matheney request for an evidentiary hearing on his competency,but then conducted a lengthy de novo review of the massive record.the district court ultimately made its findings 
on the basis of all of the facts stated above,this court finds that matheney was competent to stand trial under the dusky standard.he understood the facts of the situation and he understood the consequences of trial and sentencing.additionally,he provided some assistance to his counsel,perhaps not as much as they would choose,but not completely unhelpful.importantly,none of his counsel,including the very experienced lead counsel,felt that he was incompetent.this court does not doubt that these very able lawyers would have raised the incompetence issue had it been appropriate.although this court is well aware of matheney beliefs as to the alleged relationship between his former wife and the prosecutor of joseph county,this court does not find that those beliefs so impeded matheney appreciation of his situation as to render him incompetent to stand trial.thus,his due process right to be tried as a competent individual was not violated as matheney was competent,his attorneys failure to raise the issue did not prejudice him and thus was not violative of his sixth amendment rights to effective assistance of counsel.
matheney iii,d at.
in matheney iv,we unfortunately did not take note of the trial court lengthy evidentiary hearing and extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law when we observed that the indiana state courts had not properly considered matheney due process competency claim.matheney iv,at.we mistakenly understood that the indiana courts had refused to allow the majority of matheney attempts to file pleadings on the issue of competency.id.finally,we were wrong when we stated in matheney iv that the federal district court concluded that matheney had not received a full and fair evidentiary hearing on his competency to stand trial from the indiana state courts.id.agreeing with this faulty premise,we remanded this case to the district court for a full evidentiary hearing on matheney competency at the time of the original trial.
on remand,the district court again considered all of the relevant evidence from the trial record,the review record,and the federal habeas record.this of it discussed in matheney iv,matheney iii,and matheney medical evidence and opinions from all of the mental health experts,attorneys,and family members familiar with matheney.
also,the district court considered additional evidence submitted by the defense and prosecution.matheney counsel submitted a november,videotaped deposition of helen morrison,who had served as defense expert in the original trial,and who had also been deposed for the proceedings in.morrison concluded in her deposition that matheney was not competent to stand trial because he was not able to rationally understand what he needed to do to provide a defense and he did not trust his attorney because matheney believed the attorney was part of the court system and therefore part of the conspiracy against him.morrison based her conclusion on her assessment that matheney suffered from paranoid delusions.
the state of indiana submitted only a memorandum which noted that matheney refused a psychological test on march,on the advice of counsel.after the evidentiary hearing on november,but before the district court opinion denying habeas relief,matheney himself filed two handwritten notes that discussed his current conspiracy theories.the district court considered these submissions as well.
after examining all of the evidence,the district judge concluded,as he had in matheney iii,that matheney had been competent to stand trial in.in part because he was competent,the district court also concluded that it was not ineffective assistance on the part of matheney trial attorneys not to pursue an incompetency claim at trial,nor was it error on the part of the trial judge to not consider matheney competency sua sponte.matheney appeals the first two and ineffective assistance of not the trial judge failure to sua sponte broach the competency question.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
respondent anderson asserts that d and should guide our inquiry into matheney competency to stand trial.section d is part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,a statutory scheme that is extremely deferential to adjudications.it is clear that aedpa is applicable to matheney habeas petition,as the petition was filed after april,the effective date of the statute.see lindh murphy,d.matheney,however,insists that d deference is inappropriate under the particular circumstances of his case.
matheney argues that the state courts did not reach the merits of the competency issue even if the state reached the merits,their findings should be ignored because this court,in matheney iv,ordered the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing and the indiana court assessment of matheney competency was retrospective and therefore invalid.we will address each argument in turn.
first,succinctly put,as our summary of the indiana review process establishes,both the trial court and the indiana supreme court squarely addressed matheney competency claims and found him to be competent and determined that his trial counsel were not ineffective.section d deference applies.
second,our case law is clear in holding that d is applicable even though the district judge held an evidentiary hearing.pecoraro walls,cir see also valdez cockrell,cir reh g en banc denied.but see miller champion,cir.the evidence obtained in such a hearing is quite likely to bear on the reasonableness of the state courts adjudication but we do not see why it should alter the standard of federal review.pecoraro,at.
finally,we note that an inquiry into competency to stand trial is subject to d deference,young walls,cir,and the indiana courts,in retrospectively analyzing the effectiveness of matheney trial and appellate counsel,concluded that matheney had been competent to stand trial.thus,each of matheney arguments fails,and we will apply d deference to the state court determinations.
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in the state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d emphasis added.
under d,we follow the methodology established by the supreme court in part ii of justice concurrence in williams taylor,d,to determine whether the state court either came to a decision contrary to clearly established supreme court law or made an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court law.see ward sternes,cir.under d,relief may be had where the petitioner can show by clear and convincing evidence that the state court factual determinations were unreasonable.harding walls,cir citing e and explaining that courts refer to e for the petitioner burden of proof when that petitioner tries to make a d showing of unreasonable state court factual determinations.
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law or mixed questions of fact and law de novo.harding,at.
competency to stand trial 
it is that a defendant may not be tried unless he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.benefiel davis,cir quoting dusky united states,d see also drope missouri,d.
matheney knew he had killed his,knew the nature of the proceedings against him,and knew the death penalty was a possible consequence of his actions.furthermore,matheney provided assistance to his trial counsel with facets of the defense.matheney understood the judicial process,testified coherently about trial strategy under examination by a magistrate at the hearing,took direction from counsel not to participate in mental health examinations unless authorized by them,restrained himself from any detrimental outbursts in court,and consulted with his attorneys concerning the factual considerations of his case.these findings of fact have overwhelming support in the record.
matheney stubbornly insisted that his crimes should be excused because his deserved it and that anyone who failed to see things this way must be in on the conspiracy against him.matheney unreasonable conspiracy rejected by his counsel as poor trial not inexorably lead to a legal conclusion of incompetency.p ersons of unquestioned competence have espoused ludicrous legal positions.united states james,cir holding that the articulation of unusual legal beliefs does not imply incompetency.matheney trial attorneys were certainly frustrated by matheney recalcitrance,but this frustration is not enough to satisfy the legal definition of incompetency.
we note that matheney expert,morrison,the only medical expert to directly express a legal conclusion on matheney competency to stand trial,concluded that matheney was incompetent that testimony is certainly not the only factor to be considered,however.see benefiel,at deferring to trial judge assessment that petitioner was competent despite lone expert testimony in petitioner favor.morrison expert opinion has been given due consideration.but other evidence has also been considered,including the testimony of the other experts,the testimony of matheney trial attorneys,the testimony of matheney himself,and the rest of the evidence in the record.see united states collins,cir noting that the statements of defendant attorneys and the defendant himself are appropriate evidence for the trial judge to consider when evaluating competency.
we agree with the trial court,the indiana supreme court,and the district court that matheney was indeed competent to stand trial.matheney was able to rationally consult with his attorneys about his crimes and the trial.he also had the ability to rationally understand the proceedings in which he was involved.he was able to assist in the preparation of his defense.matheney attorneys testified that matheney was able to follow their directions,suggest witnesses,and discuss the case.matheney himself testified at his proceeding that he understood the legal issues presented by his counsel and that he agreed with some of the issues and disagreed with others.even morrison deposition makes clear that matheney was able to understand the role of his attorneys,that he understood the nature of the proceedings against him,and that he could factually describe the events of the day he killed his.
fundamentally,matheney disagreed with his attorneys about the proper scope of his trial.he wanted to expose his perceived mistreatment at the hands of his and a local prosecutor he thought this would win jury sympathy and improve his chances of winning a favorable result or,at least,a less unfavorable result,life in prison.his lawyers dismissed this strategy as irrelevant and pursued a defense of insanity matheney disagreed with this assessment of his mental.his lawyers also wished to investigate and present significant evidence about matheney childhood and background.matheney considered this information to be irrelevant to the case.this sort of disagreement between lawyers and a client does not amount to legal incompetency.the indiana courts,in retrospectively deeming matheney to have been competent at his trial,did not unreasonably apply established supreme court precedent.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
as noted above,because the state court in matheney ii found trial counsel to be effective in representing matheney,we give this determination the deference due to it under d.see united states pierson,cir noting that the aedpa provides for clear error review of state court strickland adjudications because of the inherent element of deference to counsel choices in conducting the litigation in combination with the layer of respect added by d.
in order to show ineffective assistance,matheney must show both deficient performance by his trial attorneys and prejudice.strickland washington,d.to show prejudice,matheney must demonstrate a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had his trial counsel raised the competency issue.strickland,at.
because we agree with the state courts finding that matheney was competent to stand trial,it follows that the state courts did not err in concluding that matheney trial attorneys provided effective assistance.the trial court and the indiana supreme court did not unreasonably apply strickland,or unreasonably determine the facts surrounding matheney representation before his original trial.thus,even if we were to assume that the trial attorneys performance was deficient in not demanding a contemporaneous competency examination and hearing,matheney ineffective assistance claim would fail on the prejudice prong.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the district court denial of matheney petition for habeas corpus relief under is affirmed.
when matheney was initially brought to trial for this crime,his lawyers sought a determination of his sanity and his competency.the court,however,ordered only a determination of his sanity,and none of the trial attorneys in the case appeared to even notice.in fact,examination of the record in this case reveals repeated instances in which attorneys and judges involved in that trial and his subsequent appeals blur the two,as if the determination that he was not legally insane at the time of the offense somehow also established that he was competent to stand trial.
as the majority points out,the competency issue eventually was addressed by the court in its page findings of facts and conclusions of law.the length resulted from the sheer quantity of issues raised by matheney and his counsel in that proceeding.there were in all.the portion addressing the competency issue spans only a few pages and in fact has been reproduced in its entirety in the majority opinion.in it,the court considered matheney competence at trial and.the court properly identified the test as whether matheney understood the nature of the proceedings and was able to assist in the preparation of his defense.i will discuss only the second factor,as the record sufficiently supports the finding that matheney understood the nature of the proceedings.however,in determining that matheney was able to assist in his defense,the court rejected the only psychiatric testimony on that issue.
morrison conducted a psychiatric examination of matheney at the time of the trial and in fact testified at trial that matheney was not legally insane at the time of the offense because he could distinguish between right and wrong even though he could not conform his conduct.record pcr at.she diagnosed matheney as suffering from paranoid disorder with psychosis delusion.she testified at length regarding details of that diagnosis as well as its impact on his thought processes and its progression over time.she further stated that in her professional opinion,matheney would not be able to rationally consult with his lawyers.id.at.in so stating,she emphasized that the delusion he maintained interfered with any ability to look at the realistic facts of his case and what was necessary for the trial because everything to him remained a conspiracy.she further declared that over time she would expect the delusions to become even more fixed and to include more individuals,and that his attorneys would become part of the paranoid conspiracy.id.at.
similarly,at the time of the proceeding,smalldon examined matheney over a period,and submitted a report to the court with his assessment.he concluded that matheney thinking was delusional,and his paranoid and persecutory ideas were fixed and rigid,completely refractory to logical or persuasive appeals.smalldon further stated that one effect of that delusional worldview was his inability to rationally discuss his legal situation except in terms of his own rigid,delusional version of reality.smalldon concluded that it was his professional opinion that matheney was not competent to assist his attorneys.in fact,smalldon testified that matheney willingness to work with me at all,not only to collaborate with formal testing,but even to engage with me in a discussion of this case was entirely contingent on my willingness to remain within his extremely cramped,claustrophobic view of his case and to refrain from challenging in any way his beliefs about the reality of his situation.id.at.
the court provided very little reasoning in rejecting the only psychiatric testimony on the issue.the court stated that the one trial attorney who had the best rapport with matheney and represented him on appeal found him frustrating and,but that matheney was able to provide counsel with details of everything that preceded and followed the murder even if not the murder itself.that was the extent of the court analysis of the second factor.the only other clue as to the court reasoning appears in an earlier statement that m ost significantly,counsel has stated that petitioner was substantively involved in the trial process even if he was as helpful as another client might have been.
under the aedpa,the competency determination can not stand if it is an unreasonable application of the law to the facts,or if it is based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented to the state court.d harding walls,cir ward sternes,cir.a state court decision that rests upon a determination of fact that lies against the clear weight of the evidence is,by definition,a decision so inadequately supported by the record as to be arbitrary and therefore objectively unreasonable.ward,at,quoting hall washington,cir.that standard is met here.a number of attorneys testified in this case.all of them provided testimony consistent with the diagnoses by morrison and smalldon.
scott king was the lead counsel in the trial and appears to be the attorney referenced by the court when determining that matheney was able to assist in his defense.it is curious that king testimony is the only evidence relied upon by the court in making the assessment of matheney competence at the time of the trial,particularly given the procedural history of this case.king was not appointed as counsel for matheney until february,and the trial took place a mere two months later.nevertheless,the court mentions only description rather than by finding competency,with no mention of the testimony provided by other counsel and the investigator who worked with matheney for nearly a year more than king,from march through the trial.
setting that aside for the moment,king testimony provides no basis for rejecting the psychiatric testimony and concluding that matheney was competent at the trial.king testified as to matheney persistent belief that his and barnes had been engaged in a conspiracy against him,and that if people outside the conspiracy learned of that conspiracy,they would find that his death was justified.king referred often to matheney as being unhelpful in discussing the murder or the merits of the case,further stating that communication with matheney was helpful in one that his written and verbal statements and inability to focus on matters outside that delusion provided support for the insanity defense.for instance,when asked whether matheney was involved in devising the defense,king responded that his time spent with matheney and reading what matheney wrote was a primary factor in the defense ultimately relied on insanity in terms of him being at all helpful,in terms of the merits of the allegations that he killed his wife,no.pcr at.similarly,when asked if matheney was able to help in preparing for,king noted that in addition to lacking the typical objectivity,he also had a particular dent sic completely away from the case focused on the conspiracy with michael barnes and his.id.at.as a result,king testified that he was not helpful in preparing for of state witnesses,but i n the sense of between his writings and between his conduct,okay,supporting the use of the insanity defense,yeah,that was helpful to dictate that.that can not support the court decision that matheney could assist in his defense.it would be ironic indeed if a defendant irrational behavior was interpreted as assisting in his defense,thus rendering him competent to stand trial,because it gave counsel further evidence that he was insane.king recounts repeatedly matheney fixation on his delusion,and his inability to engage in discussions outside of that delusion.there is in fact little in king testimony to support the court conclusion that matheney provided substantial assistance.because the court provided no details as to what testimony supported its finding of competency,it is difficult to address precisely the issue,but the testimony by king contains nothing that would support the court dismissal of the psychiatric opinions.in fact,king testified on a number of occasions that he concurred with morrison assessment of matheney.king ultimate assessment of matheney was that he was singularly focused on the case as he defined it.which was an ongoing saga of injustice promulgating from his then incarceration.and that his definition of the case.that portrayal meshes with the analyses of morrison and smalldon,and does not provide a basis for a finding of competency.
moreover,the testimony of others involved in the trial and process further contradict the competency determination.although the court appeared to rely solely on king testimony,other counsel including charles lahey also testified.he was counsel for matheney from march,nearly a year before king joined the defense team.significantly,lahey was the person whom king identified as the one he relied upon for insight into matheney.
lahey testified extensively about the inability to communicate with matheney outside his delusion.for instance,lahey testified that matheney was actively planning his defense,but that defense was that his deserved it because of the conspiracy between herself and barnes,and that if the information would just be made public,then he would be vindicated.id.at.lahey was unable to reason with him regarding the effectiveness of that defense.id.lahey stated that the decision to pursue the insanity defense was partly based on matheney inability to assist him in any defense other than the one upon which matheney was focused.id.at.
one illustration of matheney singular focus on that defense was his insistence on a change of venue.lahey argued against the motion with matheney,based in part on his view that no jury in joseph county had ever returned a capital punishment verdict,and that the judge in the case was as compassionate and reasonable a person as he could hope to have deciding the issue.id.at.lahey felt that obtaining a change in venue to lake county,which was one of only two counties that had returned capital punishment verdicts,was signing his own death warrant.id.lahey was unable to reason with matheney,however,who believed that the court system in joseph county was controlled by barnes,the prosecutor in that county,and that if he could be tried in an outlying county,the jury would hear what he had to say and decide that his actions were justified.id.at.matheney ultimately succeeded in obtaining that change of venue.lahey thus provides a concrete example of a defense decision by matheney made based on his conspiracy delusion,impervious to the rational advice of his attorneys.lahey further recounted that after his opposition to that motion,matheney no longer trusted him,which is also consistent with morrison prediction that his attorneys would eventually be added to the conspiracy,perpetuating the delusion.lahey concluded that matheney was obsessed with his conspiracy defense,unable to work with him on any evidence other than along those lines,and was of no assistance whatsoever on the legitimate issues that existed in the case.id.at.lahey appeared to be unfamiliar with the second prong of the competency test,stating that he did not label it as a problem of competence,because maybe a psychiatrist would say that was because of his obsessive behavior but it was because he was bouncing off the walls and did know what day it was or who i was,which of course relates to the first part of the test.id.lahey testimony establishes that matheney met the first factor of competency,that he understood the nature of the proceedings,but not the second one,that he was able to assist in his defense.
in addition,the record contained an affidavit from steven radde,a private investigator who worked for months for the defense in the matheney case,and who spent a considerable amount of time with matheney.id.at.one of radde assignments was to locate and interview numerous witnesses brought to the defense team attention by matheney.radde stated that in their conversations,matheney 
talked almost exclusively about proving there was a conspiracy between lisa bianco and michael barnes.virtually all of the witnesses he requested we find were witnesses he said would help prove the conspiracy.he insisted that no other issues existed or mattered.i do not believe that matheney ever understood that his theory of defense was irrational and unsympathetic.he insisted to the end that his conduct was justified,and that if the existence of the conspiracy against him was shown,the world would agree and he would be exonerated.matheney was unable to assist me in my role as part of the defense team in any meaningful way.his assistance was limited to providing lengthy lists of names of people he believed would provide support for his own theory of how the case should be tried.
finally,the two attorneys for matheney in relief also testified that matheney was unable to assist in his own defense.yet the same court held that he was competent in that proceeding as well.steven with jeffrey merryman,testified as to matheney intractable fixation with the conspiracy,and the difficulties in trying to establish trust with matheney.schutte declared that his representation of matheney was a constant balance between conducting the investigation that the case required and gaining enough trust with matheney to proceed properly.id.at.each step in one direction cost him in the other.id.at.schutte testified that to try and establish trust with matheney,he investigated some of matheney conspiracy claims.id.at.he further noted that matheney had tens of thousands of pages of documents in his possession,but would not let his lawyers see all of them.matheney decided when schutte would view them and in what order,because matheney feared that if schutte viewed them out of order or out of context,schutte might not understand the significance to his conspiracy case.id.at.trust issues impacted schutte in other ways as well.for instance,matheney signed some authorization and release forms early in the representation,but later refused to sign any more.id.at.furthermore,matheney acted on his own,filing,for example,a witness list that contained names,and trying to control who schutte contacted.schutte attempts to investigate the case properly by contacting relevant persons would have the problematic effect of adversely impacting his efforts at gaining matheney trust.he testified that matheney was not competent.
his,merryman,represented matheney for three years and also concluded that matheney was unable to speak with him rationally about his case.matheney refused to discuss with merryman anything that he did not consider relevant to the his case,which he defined as the conspiracy between his and the prosecutor.that included information about what matheney did the day of the crime and his background,both of which related to his mental health.id.at.along similar lines,matheney would not tell them who his friends were and instructed his family not to cooperate with his lawyers.id.at.merryman concluded by trying to provide some perspective on the problem.he stated that he had practiced law for nine years and had been a trial level public defender.as a result,he was familiar with difficult clients and clients who elected not to cooperate for
