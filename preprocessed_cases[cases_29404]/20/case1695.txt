charlie lee mitchell mitchell was convicted in a michigan state court of murder and sentenced to a term of ten to fifteen years imprisonment.throughout his confinement in custody awaiting trial,mitchell sought to have new counsel appointed to his case because he claimed that his lawyer refused to meet with him.mitchell motion to replace his counsel was addressed by the state trial court on the second day of jury selection and was subsequently denied.mitchell claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was rejected in his direct appeals in the michigan courts,but the federal district court in the eastern district of michigan granted mitchell habeas petition on the ineffective assistance claim.we affirmed,mitchell mason,cir,but the supreme court vacated our decision and remanded the case for our further consideration in light of bell cone,d.although bell changes our analysis,it does not change our conclusion that mitchell was denied the effective assistance of counsel,and we affirm the district court.
background 
charlie lee mitchell was arrested and charged with murder for the death of raymond harlin,who was killed after a fight broke out in mitchell kitchen on october.on october,gerald evelyn was appointed counsel for mitchell.evelyn represented mitchell at a preliminary examination on october,during which he called one witness and argued against the denial of bail.evelyn next represented mitchell,close to four months later,at the final conference on february.on april,evelyn was suspended from practicing law in the state of michigan he was reinstated on may,the day jury selection began for mitchell trial.
at mitchell trial,evelyn did not present an opening argument.mitchell did not testify,nor did evelyn present any witnesses on mitchell behalf.at the close of the prosecution case,evelyn moved for a directed verdict.the court partially granted the motion by reducing the charge to murder.during closing arguments,evelyn argued that thompson testimony was equivocal and that the prosecution had not carried its burden of proof.the jury convicted mitchell of murder on may.mitchell was sentenced by the trial judge to ten to twelve years imprisonment and then resentenced to ten to fifteen years imprisonment due to a miscalculation in his original sentence.
prior to the trial,mitchell wrote six separate letters to the trial judge,the chief judge,and others requesting new counsel.mitchell alleged that evelyn had not visited him once in prison nor had mitchell had the opportunity to speak with his lawyer in court.on april,eleven days before jury selection was to begin,the trial court held a hearing on mitchell motion for withdrawal of counsel at which mitchell appeared on his own behalf.evelyn did not appear for the hearing,although he had notice of it.at the hearing,mitchell informed the court that he had received a letter from his counsel informing him that he was suspended for a month.he also asked for a new lawyer and a postponement of the trial to afford a new lawyer the chance to review his case.because evelyn was not present,the trial court held the motion on advisement.
on the second day of jury selection,may,mitchell again renewed his motion for new counsel.at that point,evelyn,who had been reinstated the day before,informed the court that mitchell wanted him removed because he had failed to visit him the night before in prison as promised.the district court denied mitchell motion without prejudice.
on may,the sixth day of trial,evelyn informed the court that he had received a grievance letter filed by mitchell with the attorney grievance commission on may.he then offered to have himself removed from the case.in response to questions from the court,mitchell then stated,i would like to,you know,cancel that grievance,you know,because all the motions and everything that i requested have been answered i satisfied,your honor.at.
on direct appeal,mitchell was granted an evidentiary hearing,known as a ginther hearing,on the effective assistance of his trial counsel.see people ginther.at the hearing,which occurred before the same judge who presided over the trial,mitchell presented the testimony of four witnesses,including mitchell mother.mitchell himself also testified.mitchell appellate counsel did not call his trial counsel,evelyn,to the stand.appellate counsel introduced two witnesses who had been present at mitchell apartment on the night of harlin murder to establish that they were material witnesses and that evelyn neither contacted them nor called them to testify at trial.mitchell testimony was offered to establish her numerous efforts to contact evelyn and to inform him that there were other witnesses whom he should interview.mitchell also testified to his efforts to contact evelyn and discuss his case with his lawyer.after the hearing,the trial judge found that mitchell had not demonstrated objective unreasonableness or prejudice as required by state law and that he had received effective assistance of counsel.
the michigan court of appeals,see people mitchell,and the michigan supreme court,see people mitchell,affirmed mitchell conviction.on mitchell ineffective assistance of counsel claims,the michigan supreme court first found that evelyn suspension did not constitute a per se denial of counsel during a critical stage of the proceedings under united states cronic,d.that court rejected mitchell contention that his case warranted a presumptive finding of ineffectiveness under the sixth amendment,concluding that mitchell claim presented neither a circumstance in which it was unlikely that any lawyer could provide effective assistance of counsel,a constructive denial of counsel,nor an unconstitutional failure to grant a continuance.see mitchell,at.the michigan supreme court thus analyzed mitchell claims under the strickland washington,d,standard for ineffective assistance of counsel which requires deficient performance and a showing of prejudice,and it found that because mitchell had not adequately developed a record at the ginther hearing regarding what evelyn did or did not do,or whether evelyn knew of the alleged eyewitnesses,there was no factual basis for a conclusion that counsel performance was constitutionally deficient.mitchell,at.the court concluded that a n inference of constitutional ineffectiveness can not be established on the basis of the circumstance of counsel suspension during seven months of representation,without any inquiry into the conduct of the trial or any record being developed regarding counsel actual preparedness and its effect on the result.id.at.
two justices dissented,finding that evelyn performance was per se ineffective under united states cronic,d,and geders united states,d,because of a confluence of factors including evelyn suspension,which rendered him completely unavailable for thirty days during the critical stage of investigation the fact that evelyn failed to hold a private meeting with the defendant during the period of his representation and the gravity of the murder charge against mitchell.see mitchell,at.the dissent concluded that the surrounding circumstances made it so unlikely that any lawyer could provide effective assistance of counsel that mitchell was constructively denied counsel 
on march,mitchell filed a petition for habeas corpus relief with the district court under,asserting that he was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel.the district court granted mitchell petition,and on july,we affirmed,reasoning that because mitchell was constructively denied the assistance of counsel during the critical period,the state courts refusal to grant him relief was an unreasonable application of united states cronic,d.after the supreme court decided bell cone,d,which further explicated the line between claims based on united states cronic and claims based on strickland washington,d,the court vacated our decision in this case and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of bell.mason mitchell,d.upon careful consideration,we affirm the district court.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
whether the district court properly granted the writ of habeas corpus is a question of law that we review de novo.doan brigano,cir.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,pub,stat,which amended,applies to all habeas petitions filed after april,the effective date of the act.because mitchell petition for habeas was filed after the effective date,aedpa governs our review of this case.
pursuant to aedpa,a writ of habeas corpus may not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the federal court must presume that all determinations of factual issues made by the state court are correct unless the defendant can rebut that presumption by clear and convincing evidence.see e.
the question whether mitchell was deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact.olden united states,cir.in a habeas case,we apply the unreasonable application prong of d to a mixed question of law and fact.harpster ohio,cir.in terry williams taylor,d,the supreme court elaborated upon the independent meaning conveyed by the contrary to and unreasonable application of clauses of the statute,as well as the distinct analysis to be performed under each clause.williams,at.according to the court,a federal habeas court may find that the state court decision resulted in an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.the supreme court cautioned that a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.the williams decision also clarified that in our review of the state court judgment,we may only look to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision to determine whether the state court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.see id.at.
with these guidelines in mind,we turn to the question whether the district court properly granted mitchell petition for habeas corpus relief.
procedural default 
as we did in our first opinion,we must address the warden initial argument that the district court erred by evaluating mitchell ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim instead of rejecting it as procedurally defaulted in state court.warden mason asserts that under michigan law,when the effectiveness of a lawyer representation is challenged,the lawyer must be called as a witness to testify at the ginther hearing in order to create the proper evidentiary record.according to the warden,mitchell failure to call his trial counsel at the ginther hearing violated this state procedural rule.therefore,mitchell was unable to establish the necessary factual record from which that court could evaluate his claim.the warden asserts that the michigan supreme court relied on this state procedural rule to deny mitchell relief.
when the state argues that a petitioner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule,federal habeas review is barred unless the petitioner can show cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law.coleman thompson,d.for the doctrine of procedural default to bar federal review,however,a firmly established and regularly followed state procedural rule applicable to the petitioner claim must exist,and the petitioner must have failed to comply with that rule.see ford georgia,d explaining that an adequate and independent state procedural bar to the consideration of constitutional claims must have been firmly established and regularly followed by the time as of which it is to be applied citing james kentucky,d.we have jurisdiction to review the petitioner federal claim unless the last state court from which the petitioner sought review clearly and expressly invoked a firmly established state procedural rule as a basis for its decision to reject review of the petitioner federal claim.coleman,at.
based on our review of michigan case law,we conclude that there was no state procedural rule as of the time that mitchell claim was reviewed that barred appellate review in the absence of trial counsel testimony at a ginther hearing.at oral argument before this court,counsel for the warden first pointed us to this very case,people mitchell,as evidence that michigan has a firmly established procedural rule requiring the defendant to call defense counsel at a ginther hearing or risk procedurally defaulting the claim.of course,citing to the very case under review is useless because it is the warden burden to demonstrate that the rule was already firmly established and regularly followed as of the time the state court invoked the rule.see ford,at.counsel for the warden then cited to a order in another case granting a ginther hearing,people williams,to support his contention.this single,order is utterly insufficient to demonstrate the existence of a state procedural rule so firmly established and regularly followed that it may bar a petitioner federal constitutional claim on collateral review.ford,at.quoting james,at.
when there has been no motion for a new trial or a ginther hearing,the case law reveals that a michigan reviewing court will consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel but will be forced to limit itself to examining the trial record for errors,as no other record has been developed thus,while ginther and its progeny indicate that it is crucial to develop an adequate record of trial counsel failures if petitioner claim is to succeed,we believe that those michigan courts that have rejected ineffective assistance of counsel claims have done so on the merits of the claim and not due to a procedural default because we conclude that there was no firmly established and regularly followed state procedural rule to bar mitchell ineffective assistance claim when the michigan supreme court reviewed this case,the district court did not err in considering the claim and we need not engage in a analysis before reaching the substance of mitchell claim.
application of aedpa 
the threshold question under aedpa is whether mitchell seeks to apply a rule of law that was clearly established at the time his state court conviction became final.williams,at.there is no doubt that the rule of law that mitchell seeks to per se ineffective assistance of counsel clearly established by the supreme court in united states cronic,d.in cronic,the supreme court held that an appeals court must reverse a criminal defendant conviction without any specific showing of prejudice to defendant when counsel was either totally absent,or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding.cronic,at.in other words,when counsel is totally absent during a critical stage of the proceedings,prejudice must be presumed.in williams,the supreme court confirmed the vitality of this per se approach,noting that while the strickland washington,d,test for ineffective assistance of counsel,requiring proof of deficient performance and prejudice,provides guidance for resolving virtually all ineffective assistance of counsel claims,there are a few situations in which prejudice may be presumed.williams,at.citing strickland,at.we have recently applied the test to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.olden,at prejudice is presumed when counsel is absent during prosecution presentation of evidence that implicates defendant because such absence occurred during critical stage of trial.thus,we easily reach the conclusion that it was clearly established by the supreme court,as of the time that mitchell case was decided in state court,that the complete denial of counsel during a critical stage of a judicial proceeding mandates a presumption of prejudice.roe,d citing cronic,at.
because there is clearly established law applicable to mitchell claim,the next question we must address is whether the michigan supreme court decision rejecting mitchell ineffective assistance claim was an unreasonable application of that established law or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.the warden correctly argues that the district court failed to review the michigan supreme court findings under the deferential standard of review mandated by aedpa.the district court order did not determine whether the michigan supreme court analysis was objectively unreasonable instead,it essentially reviewed mitchell claims de novo.we must now,therefore,conduct the appropriate review of the michigan supreme court decision.
mitchell ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
although the michigan supreme court properly acknowledged supreme court precedent by noting that t he right to counsel extends to representation during any critical stage of the proceedings,it then concluded that the right to counsel does not require the state to provide the defendant with unlimited access to the attorney during the trial and that a fortiori,it does not guarantee a defendant a private interview during pretrial in the place of the defendant choosing.mitchell,at internal citations omitted.
framing this case as one about allegations of inadequate preparation,the michigan supreme court declined to apply a per se prejudice analysis to mitchell claim after rejecting the suggestion that mitchell case presented circumstances that made it unlikely that any lawyer could provide effective representation,that mitchell was constructively denied counsel,or that he was denied counsel combined with a failure to grant a continuance.see id.at.the michigan supreme court rejected these theories in inverse order.relying on morris slappy,d,for the proposition that n ot every restriction on counsel opportunity to investigate or otherwise to prepare for trial violates a defendant sixth amendment right to counsel,the michigan supreme court determined that it was not error for the state trial court to deny mitchell request for a continuance so that he could consult with his lawyer prior to trial.mitchell,at quoting morris,at.pointing to united states cronic,d,the michigan supreme court then held that evelyn suspension did not constitute a constructive denial of counsel.moreover,the michigan supreme court declared,a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel stemming from a suspension coupled with time for preparation does not,pursuant to cronic,create a circumstance making it so unlikely that any lawyer could provide the defendant with constitutionally effective assistance.see mitchell,at.
the michigan supreme court then evaluated evelyn performance to determine whether it was deficient under the familiar strickland standard and concluded it was not.id.the court first stated that there was no factual basis for concluding that evelyn performance was constitutionally inadequate.see id.at.the court then performed the first part of the strickland analysis based on the record before it and determined that evelyn performance met constitutional muster.see id.at.
after a thorough review of the record,we are convinced that the undisputed amount of time that evelyn spent with mitchell prior to jury selection and the start of six minutes spanning three separate meetings in the bullpen,when viewed in light of evelyn suspension from practice immediately prior to a complete denial of counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings.the michigan supreme court evaluation of mitchell ineffective assistance claim under the cronic standard for per se prejudice reflects a misunderstanding and misapplication of that supreme court precedent.we conclude that,in insisting on evaluating mitchell claim under the strickland standard for ineffective assistance of counsel,the michigan supreme court erroneously and unreasonably applied clearly established supreme court law set forth in cronic.
constructive denial of counsel 
in bell cone,d,the supreme court defined the differences between claims governed by strickland and claims governed by cronic.if a claim is governed by strickland,a defendant must typically demonstrate that specific errors made by trial counsel affected the ability of the defendant to receive a fair trial.if a claim is governed by cronic,however,the defendant need not demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the lack of effective counsel in some cases,the sixth amendment violations are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.cronic,at.three types of cases warrant cronic analysis.the first is the complete denial of counsel,in which the accused is denied the presence of counsel at a critical stage.bell.at quoting cronic,at.the second is when counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing.id.quoting cronic,at.the third is when counsel is placed in circumstances in which competent counsel very likely could not render assistance.id.
because mitchell was denied the presence of counsel during the critical stage,mitchell claim should be reviewed under cronic.on its way to analyzing mitchell claim under strickland,the michigan supreme court erred by focusing solely on the period immediately preceding trial in which mitchell counsel was suspended from practicing law.framing the issue as entirely an issue of preparation time,the state court interpreted mitchell challenge as a challenge to one particular aspect of the defense and analyzed the claim under strickland.if this period were the only issue,it might have been proper to apply the strickland analysis,for as bell notes,counsel failure in particular instances is evaluated under strickland.see bell.at.however,the absence of counsel extended throughout the period not only was mitchell counsel suspended from the practice of law for the month immediately preceding trial,but mitchell counsel also met with mitchell for no more than six minutes over the period before trial,and the trial court repeatedly ignored mitchell entreaties for counsel who would properly prepare a defense.
in analyzing this case under,we note that this is one of those cases in which,as the williams court described,it is difficult to distinguish a decision involving an unreasonable extension of a legal principle,which would warrant relief under unreasonable application provision,from a decision that arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law,which would warrant relief under contrary to provision.see williams,at.quotation omitted.that is,despite the supreme court instruction that questions of law are governed by the contrary to provision and questions involving the application of law to facts are governed by the unreasonable application provision,it is unclear whether a case such as this one is better categorized as involving an unreasonable extension of strickland to the facts at hand or an incorrect choice of law in refusing to apply cronic.see henry monaghan,constitutional fact review,colum,describing questions of law,questions of fact,and mixed questions of the application of law to fact as not admitting of clear distinctions.regardless,as the court did in williams,we decline to resolve this question,for,as in williams,the state court decision is both contrary to and involves an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.williams,at.
in bell,the supreme court identified critical stage s by looking to previous cases in which it had so characterized various stages of criminal proceedings.by this reasoning,the period is indeed a critical stage,the denial of counsel during which supports a cronic analysis.several of the supreme court cases demonstrate that the period between appointment of counsel and the start of trial is indeed a critical stage for sixth amendment purposes.the supreme court in powell alabama,described the period as perhaps the most critical period of the proceedings that is to say,from the time of their arraignment until the beginning of their trial,when consultation,investigation and preparation were vitally important.the court ruled that a defendant must be provided counsel at every step in the proceedings against him,which the powell ruling suggests includes the period at issue here.id.at.
bell confirms that the critical stage s at which counsel must be present are not limited to formal appearances before a judge.that is,although a defendant may not have a right to consult with counsel while the defendant is testifying,h e has an absolute right to such consultation before he begins to testify.perry leeke,d.the bell court cites geders united states,d,in which a defendant was not allowed to access counsel during a overnight recess,as an example of the denial of counsel at a critical stage for cronic purposes.see bell.at.the recess was important,according to geders,because s uch recesses are often times of intensive work,with tactical decisions to be made and strategies to be reviewed.the lawyer may need to obtain from his client information made relevant by the day testimony,or he may need to pursue inquiry along lines not fully explored earlier.geders,at.bell reliance on both powell,see bell.at,and geders,see id.at,confirms that a critical stage includes preparation.
the period constitutes a critical period because it encompasses counsel constitutionally imposed duty to investigate the case.in strickland,the supreme court explicitly found that trial counsel has a duty to investigate and that to discharge that duty,counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.strickland,at.the supreme court also recognized that without consultation with the defendant,trial counsel can not fulfill his or her duty to investigate.the court stated that t he reasonableness of counsel actions may be determined or substantially influenced by the defendant own statements or actions.counsel actions are usually based,quite properly,on informed strategic choices made by the defendant and on information supplied by the defendant.id.the court went on to emphasize further the significance of the defendant input into trial counsel investigation 
in particular,what investigation decisions are reasonable depends critically on such information provided by defendant.for example,when the facts that support a certain potential line of defense are generally known to counsel because of what the defendant has said,the need for further investigation may be considerably diminished or eliminated altogether.and when a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful,counsel failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable.in short,inquiry into counsel conversations with the defendant may be critical to a proper assessment of counsel investigation decisions,just as it may be critical to a proper assessment of counsel other litigation decisions.
id.because the supreme court has repeatedly made clear that there is a duty incumbent on trial counsel to conduct investigation,it necessarily follows that trial counsel can not discharge this duty if he or she fails to consult with his or her client 
unlike the defense counsel in morris slappy,d,and dick scroggy,cir,defense counsel here utterly failed his client during the critical period.in slappy,the supreme court rejected an ineffective assistance claim based on a public defender who became ill and was replaced prior to trial.the court in slappy pointed out that the replacement counsel had read all of the relevant transcripts,obtained and reviewed all of the relevant materials,and had met with the defendant several times for extended interviews.see slappy,at.indeed,counsel in slappy repeatedly assured the trial court that he was prepared to try the case based on his conferences with the defendant and the study he had made of the investigation.id.at.similarly,in scroggy,the defendant ineffective assistance claim was rejected because counsel had,in fact,interviewed the defendant in a thirty to meeting.see scroggy,at.neither of these cases gives guidance here,however,because although it is true that n ot every restriction on counsel time or opportunity to investigate or to consult with his client or otherwise to prepare for trial violates a defendant sixth amendment right to counsel,slappy,at,in this case,no effort to consult with the client was made.
the sixth amendment guarantees more than a pro forma encounter between the accused and his counsel,and six minutes of consultations spread over three meetings do not satisfy its requirements.assistance begins with the appointment of counsel,it does not end there.cronic,at.when counsel is appointed but never consults with his client and is suspended from practicing law for the month preceding trial,and the court acquiesces in this constructive denial of counsel by ignoring the defendant repeated requests for assistance,cronic governs.the michigan supreme court decision was both contrary to and an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.see williams,at.
mitchell contact with his attorney 
finally,the warden argues that the district court based its decisions on factual findings specifically rejected by the state courts in violation of e,which requires a habeas court to presume that all factual findings made by a state court are correct absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.see e.however,the presumption of correctness that protects state court findings of fact does not extend to the michigan supreme court legal conclusion that mitchell was not without counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings.thus,the michigan supreme court pronouncement that t here is no factual basis for a conclusion that counsel performance was constitutionally deficient,mitchell,at,is not due the deference accorded to a pure finding of fact,as this statement encompasses a mixed question of law and fact,which we review de novo.indeed,our conclusion is dictated by our application of law to facts in the state court record,which is properly governed by d.
although the michigan supreme court stated that n o record was made regarding what evelyn did or did not do,mitchell,at,that court noted that mitchell wrote six letters to the trial judge,the chief judge and others requesting removal of counsel,id.at.these letters,which were part of the record before the michigan supreme court,document mitchell unsuccessful efforts to contact his attorney.for example,on february,mitchell wrote to the court 
i have been locked up for months and not once have my lawyer took time out to talk to me times after i went to court my lawyer has told me that he would be over to talk to me,but never did.every since my second month of being incarcerated i have had my mother go over to his office concerning an evidentiary hearing,she have been at his office many times,she has wrote many letters but he has never replied to her i know i charged for something i have done,but i know that if i ca express to gerald evelyn what happen on the night this incentdent occurd he will not know the best stradagy of what and how to fight this case for months i have waited patiently,i have tryed every way i can to get him to talk to me,i am tired of being in the dark and knowing he in the dark so your honor please take him off my case because he not representing me at all.
at handwritten letter from mitchell.no one responded to his letters until eleven days before the start of the trial.
on april,the trial judge convened a hearing to discuss mitchell motion for appointment of new counsel.at the hearing,mitchell informed the trial court that he had received a letter stating that evelyn had been suspended from the practice of law it does not appear that the trial court was even aware that evelyn had been suspended.evelyn did not attend this hearing,pres
