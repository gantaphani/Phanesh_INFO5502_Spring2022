petitioner treon mcelrath,a state prisoner in kentucky,appeals from the denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus filed under.petitioner was convicted,along with codefendants terrance boykin and andra everett,of one count of complicity to murder and six counts of complicity to wanton endangerment arising out of a shooting that occurred on june.mcelrath,who was represented at trial and on appeal by the same attorney as boykin,maintains that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment.the district court,having denied relief with respect to all of petitioner claims,granted a certificate of appealability coa with respect to petitioner claim that his counsel labored under an impermissible conflict of interest that manifested itself in counsel decision to pursue a joint defense and counsel failures in the pursuit of and advice regarding a possible guilty plea.this court expanded the certificate of appealability to include the claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to properly advise him concerning the commonwealth plea offer.
after review of the record and consideration of the arguments presented on appeal,we conclude that counsel joint or dual representation of petitioner and boykin resulted in an actual conflict that affected petitioner representation in violation of his sixth amendment rights.accordingly,we reverse the district court denial of the writ on that basis and remand with instructions to conditionally grant the writ.
on the evening of june,natasha wilson and her boyfriend corey fitts were sitting on the front porch of her grandparents house at bowden,in clinton,kentucky.fitts saw mcelrath driving his yellow mustang past the house.fitts was alarmed and feared that terrance boykin,mcelrath cousin,had come for revenge because wilson and fitts had both filed criminal charges against boykin wilson went inside the house and made a call to police at,then returned to the porch and told fitts that the police were going to pick up mcelrath.wilson two grandparents and her three children were inside the house.
fitts testified that some twenty minutes later,he saw two armed men turn the corner of the house and approach the porch where they were sitting.fitts and wilson ran for the door and entered at about the same time.fitts escaped into the house and jumped into the bathtub,but wilson fell wounded inside the doorway.wilson grandmother called at to report that wilson had been shot.
a few minutes before the first call,clinton police officer brian morrison had seen mcelrath in his mustang not far from wilson grandparents house.three other individuals were with mcelrath but could not be identified because they ducked down in the car.morrison went to the station to take wilson call,and then checked whether there were any outstanding warrants for mcelrath before receiving the second call a few minutes later.wilson was still alive when morrison arrived at the scene,but she died without identifying her assailants.
at trial,fitts positively identified boykin and everett,whom he knew,as the shooters.fitts was impeached with evidence that he told police at the scene that treon done it.two disinterested witnesses,eric and sammy hunter,testified that mcelrath was with them when the shooting occurred.they were visiting their parents,who lived feet from the scene,on the night of the shooting and received an unexpected visit from mcelrath.mcelrath was with them for approximately ten minutes before the shooting,but left immediately when the shots were heard.mcelrath later admitted that he had been in the area with everett.
in nearby union city,tennessee,officer christopher cummings was alerted about the shooting.cummings went to vine street,where mcelrath was known to reside with his grandmother.there cummings found mcelrath,boykin,and everett together out front.mcelrath mustang was searched,but nothing incriminating was found at that time.four days later,on june,search warrants were obtained for the primary residences of mcelrath,boykin,and everett,respectively.
at mcelrath residence at vine,mcelrath was arrested on other charges after he ran,and his mustang was searched again.this time,an ammunition clip for a caliber weapon was found in the console.one of the six bullets in that clip bore the same bunter stamp as the caliber casings found at the scene of the shooting,although the testimony was that the same bunter stamp would appear on between and bullets manufactured together.there was also evidence that this clip fit the caliber handgun that had been used in the shooting,although such clips were conceded to be interchangeable.
the search of north holmes street in union city,where boykin primarily resided with his grandmother,resulted in the seizure of one of the weapons used in the shooting.specifically,officers found a caliber llama handgun located above the door frame inside a bedroom closet.in that same bedroom,police found letters,identification,and pay stubs bearing boykin name.a box containing ammunition for a caliber handgun was also found in the house.ballistics evidence offered at trial established that two caliber casings and a bullet recovered at the scene of the shooting had been fired from this llama caliber handgun 
mcelrath and boykin were jointly represented by attorney benjamin lookofsky from arraignment through direct appeal.the kentucky court of appeals found that,although mcelrath had executed a waiver,the record contained no indication that the trial judge had advised either mcelrath or boykin concerning the possible conflict of interest as required by kentucky rule of criminal procedure rcr.mcelrath commonwealth,wl,boykin commonwealth,wl.correspondence exchanged between mcelrath and attorney lookofsky shortly before trial reflected counsel advice concerning a plea offer,which mcelrath rejected,he contends,as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel.there was no written offer,however,and the commonwealth would later dispute that such an offer was made.
joint trial of mcelrath,boykin,and everett commenced in february.none of the defendants testified,and each was convicted of all counts.the jury recommended sentences of years for complicity to murder and years for each count of complicity to wanton endangerment.the trial judge accepted the recommendations and sentenced each to consecutive sentences totaling years imprisonment.mcelrath convictions were affirmed on direct appeal by the kentucky supreme court case,as were boykin case.mcelrath then moved for relief pursuant to kentucky rule of criminal procedure.the trial court denied petitioner motion in july,the kentucky court of appeals affirmed in august,and the kentucky supreme court denied discretionary review in march 
mcelrath habeas petition was filed on march.respondent answered and moved for dismissal or summary judgment.the magistrate judge recommended dismissal of the petition in its entirety,which the district court adopted as modified with respect to some claims but remanded two claims for an evidentiary hearing.one of those two petitioner counsel was ineffective when advising him with respect to the commonwealth alleged plea before us on appeal.in that regard,the magistrate judge found after an evidentiary hearing that,despite the prosecutor repudiation of the offer,the weight of the evidence indicated that a plea offer had been made and rejected.nonetheless,the magistrate judge concluded that petitioner had not been denied effective assistance of counsel in connection with the plea offer and recommended that the remaining claims be dismissed 
in a summary order,the district court accepted the recommendations,dismissed the habeas petition,and denied petitioner a certificate of appealability.revisiting the last of these when presented with a separate motion for certificate of appealability,the district court was persuaded to grant a certificate of appealability with respect to the sixth amendment claim that 
counsel labored under an impermissible conflict of interest that manifested itself in counsel decision to pursue a joint defense that was not in the petitioner best interest
