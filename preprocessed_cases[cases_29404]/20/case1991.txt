discussion 
martin filed his petition for habeas corpus after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,so its standard of review governs his claims.lindh murphy,d.under the aedpa,habeas relief is available only if the petitioner demonstrates that the state court adjudication of his federal constitutional claims resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.d mcfowler jaimet,cir.
we begin with martin ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim.martin argues that he was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel when his counsel on direct appeal failed to raise several claims of merit and failed to present all of the relevant facts in the issues that were raised.ineffective assistance of counsel claims require the petitioner to establish that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and this deficiency actually caused prejudice.strickland washington,d.
an appellate counsel performance is deficient if he or she fails to argue an issue that is both obvious and clearly stronger than the issues raised.lee davis,cir.however,counsel is not required to raise every issue on appeal.mason hanks,cir.there is a strong presumption that counsel performance is reasonable and this presumption has particular force when the ineffective assistance claim is based solely on the trial court record.yarborough gentry,d.martin argues that his appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance in not alleging various instances of trial counsel ineffectiveness.
at the trial,jacqueline daughter,shannon carr,testified that on august,martin climbed up into her bedroom window and asked to be let into the house she refused.she then heard martin say,if i ca have her,can nobody have her.then she heard her mother screaming and saw that her face had been cut and she called the police.officer stan mullins testified that on august,he responded to a battery in progress at erie.upon his arrival to the scene,he saw jacqueline bleeding from her left arm and face.he arrested martin and placed him in the squad car where he heard martin say he,should killed the bitch.
martin faults trial counsel for failing to prevent,impeach,or dilute the testimony of the victim daughter,shannon carr,with regard to the august of prior bad act.br.of petitioner at.martin contends that his trial counsel was inadequately prepared to defend against the state motion to use the other crime evidence.br.of petitioner at.the government argues that martin waived this claim when he failed to raise the issue to the district court.martin did attack appellate counsel for refusing to present issues of merit on direct appeal,but he failed to specify any particular issues and the district court interpreted issues of merit as those that the court found to be waived,which included martin ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim.the petition,however,reveals that the petitioner did not challenge trial counsel representation on the specific bases now asserted.
moreover,martin concluded in error that his trial counsel complete lack of preparation resulted in the grant of the state motion.rather,the court granted the motion because illinois law expressly provides for the admissibility of other crimes evidence to prove intent.people illgen.the record establishes that counsel vigorously represented martin interests and set forth the best possible argument in light of the clear state of the law.his appellate counsel decision to refrain from attacking trial counsel representation on this basis was not objectively unreasonable.lee,at.moreover,because the underlying trial counsel claim is meritless,there is not reasonable probability that the outcome of the appeal would have been different had counsel raised the issue.id.at.
martin argues next that his trial counsel failed to develop a strategy to rebut shannon carr testimony.martin finds significance in the fact that carr testified that she heard martin tell the victim if he ca have her,can nobody have her while the police report from the august of bad act stated that the victim informed the arresting officer,officer mullins,that martin said,i f i ca have you,nobody gon na want you.according to martin,o ne statement suggests an intent to kill,the other suggests an intent to make jacqueline unattractive by cutting her face.br.of petitioner at.martin contends that his counsel should have officer mullins or called his partner to testify about the victim statement in an effort to impeach the credibility of carr.this argument offers a distinction without a difference.the requisite intent for murder is the intent to kill or cause great bodily harm,or the knowledge that such acts will cause death,or the knowledge that such acts will cause great bodily harm.ilcs.even if the police report supported martin argument that he intended only to slash the victim face,the act certainly demonstrates an intent to cause great bodily harm which is sufficient to sustain a conviction for murder.
moreover,the same police report contains martin statement to the police that he should killed the bitch.the jury heard this evidence when officer mullins testified that martin made a statement to me and my partner that he should have killed the bitch.br.of respondent at.the trial counsel made an informed and strategic decision to not officer mullins with the police report as it would have allowed the state to reiterate on redirect examination martin statement that he should killed the bitch.his counsel decision here was not objectively unreasonable,nor would the presentment of this issue on direct appeal have changed the outcome.the illinois appellate court stated 
our careful review of the record reveals sufficient evidence from which the jury could
