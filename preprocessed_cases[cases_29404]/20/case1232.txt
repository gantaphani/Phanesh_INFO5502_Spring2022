petitioner daroyce lamont mosley mosley argues that he is entitled to habeas relief because prejudice should have been presumed on his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim his right to due process was violated by the trial court decision to begin the penalty phase of his trial on saturday instead of monday and his right to equal protection was violated by the discriminatory manner in which grand jury forepersons were selected.because we find no constitutional violations,we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
mosley was convicted of capital murder for the death of patricia colter on october,and sentenced to death on november.
patricia colter,along with her husband duane colter,her alvin waller waller,and luva congleton congleton,were keeping waitress sandra cash cash company as she closed up katie lounge in kilgore,texas on july.cash was placing the receipts for the evening in a tackle box katie used to store money.at approximately,two armed men wearing ski masks burst through the door.the first man through the door said,give me the money,you white bitch.while sliding the tackle box towards the gunman,cash was shot in the hand as she attempted to shield her face.she was then shot in the stomach,but nonetheless managed to call.this is all that cash,the sole survivor,was able to recall.
cash and the bodies of the colters,waller,and congleton were found by police and ems upon their arrival.autopsies revealed that the colters each died from a single gunshot wound to the back of the head.bullets were recovered.congleton was also shot in the back of the head,but no bullet was recovered.waller was shot twice in the head,and once in the thigh any one of the three wounds would have been fatal.forensics determined that the gun that shot cash was not the same gun that shot waller and the colters.
mosley,marcus smith marcus,and ray don mosley ray don,mosley uncle,were arrested separately on july after the police received several tips.one such tip was from ricky wheat,who lived across the street from katie lounge.he informed police that ray don,along with marcus and mosley,had spoken with him on july outside his residence.ray don,who was in possession of a pistol,told the informer that there was some money in the area and that he had to have it.this party of three left the wheat property,and returned minutes later with a tackle box,requesting a ride.ricky wheat stated that ray don told him he had shot someone over at katie lounge.another tip was from christopher kaboo smith kaboo,mosley best friend and marcus cousin.kaboo told police that on the evening of the murders he saw mosley with a gun,which mosley claimed to have gotten from stanley rossum,a neighbor.mosley left,but returned with marcus and ray don.ray don stated that they had killed people in katie lounge.after kaboo expressed his disbelief,mosley responded,we did it.then mosley divided the contents of the tackle box evenly between kaboo,ray don,and marcus,each party receiving.
on july,after pulling over mosley to arrest marcus,the police asked mosley if he would voluntarily go to the police station to answer some questions.mosley agreed.
at first,mosley averred that he had nothing to do with the robbery and murders at katie lounge.after the police received information from marcus,however,they arrested mosley.at this point,mosley made a second oral statement and admitted to shooting two of the people at katie lounge.mosley requested and received the presence of his grandparents before continuing further.in the third statement,which was transcribed,mosley insisted that the offense had been planned in advance,but that once it was time to go through with the plan,he did not want to participate.although he admitted to being present at katie lounge when the shootings occurred,he denied shooting anyone.he also informed the police that he had been wearing a ski mask or toboggan during the offense and had thrown it in the woods near the wheat residence.
based upon information in the third statement,law enforcement officers requested mosley accompany them in search of the discarded hat.a glove was found near the toboggan,and mosley then admitted to wearing a glove during the robbery.law enforcement agents explained to mosley that they could tell by the residue on the glove whether the person wearing it had fired a gun.they asked if mosley had anything to add to his previous statements.
at this time mosley made another oral statement,indicating that he had shot four people at katie lounge and ray don had shot the woman behind the bar.after a period of rest,mosley made his final statement to police.
ray don went in first and told everybody to get down.they were still sitting up in the chairs and i heard a shot.the people looked at me and it scared me and i shot a lady at the table.i was about five feet from her and i shot her in the back of the head.another lady got up and ran.ray don told me to kill them.ray don told me to shoot them or get shot.when i looked at ray don,he was pointing the gun at me.he said this after i had already shot the first lady.then i shot a man who was sitting by the first lady i shot.i do know where i shot the man at.i was about the same distance i was when i shot the lady.by this time the lady that ran had gotten under the pool table.i told the lady to get out from under the pool table.ray don said,fuck that,shoot her.then i shot the lady under the pool table twice in the head.i bent down next to the pool table and shot her twice.then ray don was behind the bar and had shot behind there.i came from around the pool table and another man was by the bar.the man got up and was coming towards me with a pool stick.ray don said,shoot him boy,shoot him.i just turned my head away and shot three times.the man fell after i had shot three times.ray don had gotten the money in a big box from behind the bar.the box was dark colored.then we ran out and ran across the street.ray don started hollering and asking me where marcus was at.i kept telling him i did know.then we saw marcus come up behind us after we crossed highway.ray don asked marcus where he had been and marcus told him he had been trying to break in a car.marcus went into katie when ray don and i went in.after i shot the first lady,i looked around and marcus had left katie.
mosley was indicted for the capital murder of patricia colter on august.
during his trial,mosley was represented by gary bledsoe bledsoe,cynthia orr orr,and gerald goldstein goldstein.the jury returned a guilty verdict saturday,october.the penalty phase of the trial began the same day the jury returned a death sentence on november.
bledsoe and orr represented mosley on direct appeal to the texas court of criminal appeals.that court affirmed his conviction and sentence.mosley state.the supreme court of the united states denied mosley petition for a writ of certiorari on april.mosley texas,d.
before the affirmation of his conviction and sentence on direct appeal,mosley commenced his state action on december.although the trial court recommended that he be granted relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel iac claim,the texas court of criminal appeals denied mosley application for state habeas relief.mosley petition for writ of certiorari as to his state habeas claims was denied by the supreme court on january.mosley texas,d.
mosley present writ of habeas corpus was filed on june,in the district court for the eastern district of texas.although the district court denied habeas relief,it granted a certificate of appealability on the three claims now before this court.
ii.standard of review 
because mosley filed his habeas petition after the enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,this statutory scheme governs our review.penry johnson,d.
aedpa dictates that this court will not overturn a state court adjudication of a prisoner claims unless the state court decision was either contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.a state court decision is deemed contrary to clearly established federal law if it reaches a legal conclusion in direct conflict with a prior decision of the supreme court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the supreme court based on materially indistinguishable facts.pondexter dretke,cir.we use the same standard as the district court in reviewing the state habeas court decision.young dretke,cir.we review legal determinations de novo,and the district court findings of fact for clear error.busby dretke,cir.
iii.discussion 
ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal 
the first issue before us is whether the state court determination that prejudice could not be presumed from the filing of mosley appellate brief is contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.mosley contends that because his brief on direct appeal was filed late,and because the brief itself was woefully inadequate,prejudice should have been presumed.the government counters that mosley failed to show prejudice,much less that prejudice should be presumed.
relief based upon an iac claim,under the standard enunciated in strickland washington,d,may only be granted if the petitioner demonstrates both that counsel was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced the petitioner defense.at.in extremely rare circumstances,however,prejudice may be presumed from the delinquent performance of counsel.this presumption of prejudice may occur if there is a complete denial of counsel,or if counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing.united states cronic,d.mosley does not contend that counsel was not present or available during direct appeal we therefore assume that he contends that the prosecution case was not tested because of the briefing on appeal.
uncontested evidence reveals that the brief submitted on direct appeal was a page tome,raising points of error.this brief was filed after several extensions of time,and was nonetheless ultimately filed late.the brief was never proofread in its entirety.on direct appeal,the court addressed roughly of the points of error.several sets of objections were repeated later in the brief,while others were not addressed because they were inadequately briefed.there was testimony suggesting that the brief was prepared after the expiry of the last filing deadline.
despite these inadequacies,it is clear from the thoughtful opinion from the court of criminal appeals that mosley appellate counsel did subject the prosecution case to meaningful testing.this is unlike the brief in passmore estelle,cir,which was a one page anomaly.in the case at bar counsel provided adequate grounds for appeal for the court to review,and,ultimately,to deny.that the brief contained assignments of error above or below and beyond those addressed by the court does not make the brief presumptively prejudicial.we therefore decline to grant habeas relief on this claim.
due process 
mosley next contends that the state court ruling that the trial court refusal to allow counsel additional time to prepare for the punishment phase was not a violation of his due process rights is contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.mosley maintains that his due process rights were violated when the trial court forced his attorney to begin the penalty phase on saturday after the jury returned a verdict in the guilt phase.as was his stance with respect to his iac claim,mosley again claims that prejudice can be presumed under cronic.
the jury returned a guilty verdict on saturday,october.the government indicated that it had its witnesses on minute call to proceed with the penalty phase.orr objected,indicating to the court that she understood that even if the guilty verdict were returned on saturday,the penalty phase would not begin until monday,october.because this was her understanding,orr had failed to prepare any strategy overall,had failed to prepare a strategy for witnesses,and had failed to have defense witnesses on call.it was later revealed that goldstein was scheduled to do the penalty phase,and that orr had never intended to perform these duties.
based upon the preferences of the jury,the court refused orr request for a continuance until monday.instead,orr was given two hours to prepare for the penalty phase of the trial.
in his brief to this court,mosley offers no cases to support a due process claim based upon a trial court ruling that the penalty phase would commence immediately after the guilt phase of a trial.because the due process claim has not been briefed to this court,we decline to examine it.see yohey collins,cir finding that a defendant abandons arguments by failing to argue them in the body of his brief.
although mosley claims this portion of his brief amounts to a due process challenge,the cases he cites in support of his contention are for sixth amendment deprivation of effective assistance of counsel.out of an abundance of caution,we will address his claims with respect to the sentencing phase of the trial as iac claims.in so doing,we can not find this lack of preparation for one portion of his trial deficient.as the supreme court noted in morris slappy,d n ot every restriction on counsel time or opportunity to investigate or consult with his client or otherwise to prepare for trial violates a defendant sixth amendment right to counsel o nly an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay violates the right to the assistance of counsel.emphasis added citations and quotations omitted.in slappy,the supreme court found no violation of the defendant right to counsel despite the fact that replacement counsel had been appointed six days prior to the beginning of trial.the circumstances here are even less problematic,primarily because orr was chief counsel throughout the guilt phase of the trial.she was intimately acquainted with mosley and the facts of the case.she had heard all of the testimony and had an opportunity to observe the jury.that orr had been warned that the penalty phase would begin after the resolution of the guilt phase,and chose to ignore that warning,does not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel.
equal protection 
the final,and most contentious,issue before us is whether the state court determination that there was no equal protection violation in the selection of the grand jury foreperson is contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.mosley asserts that the court of criminal appeals application of the due process,instead of equal protection test,violates supreme court precedent.the government insists that the use of the due process test was not in violation of clearly established supreme court precedent,even though the state court methodology was contrary to fifth circuit precedent.
at the heart of the matter are two supreme court cases rose mitchell,d,and hobby united states,d.rose addressed a possible equal protection violation in the selection of grand jury forepersons.hobby,on the other hand,addressed a possible due process violation in the selection of grand jury forepersons.
rose mitchell and the equal protection clause 
in rose,four black men indicted for capital murder filed pleas in abatement,seeking dismissal of their indictments on the grounds that the grand jury array,and the foreman,had been selected in a racially discriminatory fashion.at.emphasis added.in tennessee,a grand jury consisted of members,with the foreperson making up the thirteenth.the grand jury members were selected by a key man system,in which three commissioners compiled a list of qualified potential jurors from which the grand jurors were selected at random.the foreperson,on the other hand,was appointed by the judge of the court for a two year term.id.at.the pleas in abatement were denied,and the four were found guilty of murder.id.at.on direct appeal,the convictions were affirmed.id.after proceedings,the supreme court granted certiorari to consider the equal protection claim with respect to the selection of
