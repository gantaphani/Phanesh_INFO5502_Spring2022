roger bostick bostick,appeals the district court awarding summary judgment to the warden in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.we issued a certificate of appealability to address bostick ineffective assistance of counsel claim pursuant to c,and now agree with bostick that the state procedural ground under which the district court found his claim to have been procedurally defaulted was not consistently applied at the time of his state proceedings furthermore,we find that the performance of bostick trial counsel was constitutionally deficient because counsel did not consult with bostick about an appeal following his conviction.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand to the district court with instructions that it issue the writ of habeas corpus.
in september,bostick was convicted of murder and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment in south carolina.prior to sentencing,bostick told his daughter in open court,do worry,i get a appeal sic,do worry.bostick never explicitly told trial counsel to file an appeal after trial,however,and counsel never did so.
in march,bostick filed a pro se,pcr application alleging,among other things,that the performance of his trial counsel was constitutionally deficient because counsel did not consult with him about an appeal.at the pcr hearing in june,bostick reiterated that trial counsel never discussed with him whether or not to file an appeal and that he never requested that counsel file one.his also testified that she asked counsel about an appeal and he told her,i ca do an appeal because it was a jury trial.counsel denied saying that he could not appeal,but acknowledged that he told bostick wife,there been a jury trial.the jury has spoken.what possible grounds are there for an appeal.counsel did not testify as to any consultation with bostick regarding an appeal,but did say that before trial bostick told him,that he was going to be satisfied with what the jury come up with,win,lose,or draw,and that would be the end of it.counsel then said that he agreed with bostick assessment.
the pcr court denied bostick relief in august.though it addressed several claims,it did not address whether counsel was ineffective for not discussing an appeal with bostick.bostick,this time through counsel,petitioned the south carolina supreme court for certiorari in october,but the court summarily denied his petition in january.
bostick then,once again pro se,filed a habeas petition in the united states district court in south carolina,alleging,among other things,that counsel was ineffective for not consulting with him about a direct appeal and arguing that he was entitled to a belated appeal as a result.the warden moved for summary judgment.the warden conceded that bostick exhausted his claim in state court,but insisted that the claim was procedurally defaulted,because bostick had not asked the pcr court to amend its opinion to address his claim before petitioning for certiorari.the warden alternatively argued that even if it could be considered,bostick claim was unsupported by the record.a magistrate judge recommended that summary judgment be granted on this claim on the grounds that bostick claim was procedurally defaulted,and the district court agreed.bostick timely appealed.
we review a district court grant of a motion for summary judgment in habeas proceedings de novo.frye lee,cir.where a petitioner claim has been adjudicated on the merits by a state court,section of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa of,stat.codified at d,precludes our granting relief unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.in a case like bostick,however,where the state courts did not reach the claim merits and instead ruled on procedural grounds,we review the claim de novo.hudson hunt,cir.
bostick appeal raises two related issues a whether or not his claim is procedurally defaulted due to his to comply with south carolina rule of civil procedure e and b whether or not his trial counsel was in fact ineffective for not consulting with him about an appeal following his conviction.we address each issue in turn.
bostick first alleges that the district court erroneously deemed his claim procedurally defaulted.he admits that he did not comply with rule e requirement that he ask the pcr court to amend its opinion before petitioning the state supreme court for certiorari,but he nonetheless argues that his failure to do so should not procedurally bar his claim.we agree with bostick that at the time of his state proceedings,south carolina rule e was not consistently applied by the state courts,and that as a result,his failure to comply with the rule does not prevent him from pursuing his claim here.
federal courts may not hear a section claim if a state court disposed of the claim on adequate and independent grounds,unless the petitioner can show cause and prejudice for,or a fundamental miscarriage of justice resulting from,failure to comply with the applicable rule.coleman thompson,d wilson moore,cir.this rule protects the state interest in the finality of its judgments and promotes respect for the system.coleman,at.for a ground to be adequate,though,it must be applied regularly or consistently.johnson mississippi,d brown lee,cir.where a procedural rule is inconsistently applied,we will not allow a state invocation of that rule to thwart federal habeas review of constitutional issues that the adequacy requirement was designed to prevent.brown,at.
it is quite clear to us that rule e was not consistently applied by the south carolina courts at the time of bostick pcr proceedings.indeed,in we explicitly noted that rule e was inconsistently applied and that it was inadequate to preclude federal review.pearson harrison,cir and though the warden urges us to find that the south carolina supreme court has clarified its jurisprudence and begun applying the rule more consistently,the state court did not do so until bostick filed his petition for certiorari.see marlar south carolina,rev g.
in marlar,which the warden repeatedly cites for the proposition that rule e is consistently applied,the south carolina court of appeals detailed the south carolina supreme court past willingness to overlook rule e violations in order to attend to the pervasive problem of inadequate pcr orders.at citing to prior decisions in which the state supreme court remanded to the pcr court for further findings,despite a petitioner with rule e,rev.it also discussed a single case in which the court was unwilling to overlook a petitioner failure to comply with rule e,but stated that it is not clear whether the court would begin to consistently apply the rule in light of errors that continue to permeate south carolina judicial system.id.at.
the south carolina supreme court then reversed the court of appeals decision.marlar,at.in doing so,it stated that the general rule is that where a party fails to file a rule e motion,the argument is forfeited.id.at.the state supreme court acknowledged,however,that it had previously excused failures to file rule motions in order to force pcr courts to make specific findings id.even in overruling the intermediate court and insisting that it would consistently apply rule e from that day forward,the state supreme court acknowledged that the lower court view of the law as it existed at the time was essentially correct.
the state court of appeals issued its decision in marlar in march two months after the state supreme court denied bostick petition for certiorari and years after the pcr court dismissed his appeal.the state supreme court did not reverse that decision until november.south carolina,therefore,can not be said to have regularly or consistently applied the law if both of its appellate courts acknowledged that they did not strictly enforce rule e even months after bostick final appeal was denied.see brown,at.we decline to hold bostick responsible for failing to comply with a rule when,at the time his case was decided,the state courts did not distinguish,in any prin
