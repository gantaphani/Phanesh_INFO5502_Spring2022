opinion of the court 
we decide whether a district court has jurisdiction to consider a habeas corpus petition that alleges violations of article of the united nations convention against torture cat congress has implemented cat by enacting the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of farra because generally we do not infer congressional intent to repeal habeas jurisdiction,and because farra jurisdictional provisions do not specifically foreclose habeas corpus jurisdiction under,the general habeas statute,we hold that cat claims are cognizable under.we therefore reverse the district court dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of christopher ogbudimkpa habeas corpus petition and remand so that it may consider the merits of his petition.
facts and procedural history 
ogbudimkpa is a citizen of nigeria who entered the united states in on a student visa.in an immigration judge ij ordered ogbudimkpa to be deported for remaining longer than his visa permitted and for working without government authorization,under immigration and nationality act ina a,a current version at a.the immigration and naturalization service ins did not immediately remove him.in ogbudimkpa was convicted and sentenced on state drug charges and,upon his release from prison in,paroled to ins custody.
in the board of immigration appeals bia granted ogbudimkpa motion to reopen his removal proceedings so that he might seek protection under article of cat,which provides that n o state party shall expel,return refouler or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.ogbudimkpa testified that,if he were returned to nigeria,he would be imprisoned,tortured,or possibly executed by his extended family members,one of whom is a senator,past president of the nigerian government,and another who holds the rank of major either in the police or the military.the ij concluded that ogbudimkpa had testified credibly,but had not demonstrated that it was more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to nigeria.the bia affirmed the ij decision.
ogbudimkpa filed a pro se motion for emergency stay of removal in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania,arguing that the united states attorney general had erred in not granting him relief from removal under article of cat.the district court treated this motion as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.in the first set of what became a game of forum ping pong,the government moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,arguing that the circuit court was the proper forum for ogbudimkpa cat claims ogbudimkpa continuing to act pro se petitioned the district court to transfer his case to our court,and the government consented.but upon transfer of the case to our court,the government again moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,claiming the jurisdictional bar of c g of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira applied to ogbudimkpa because of his status as a criminal alien,even though the criminal conviction did not form the basis of the charges of deportation.this was exactly the opposite tack to the one taken by the government in the district court unaware of the whipsawing procedural posture of this case,we granted the government motion to dismiss in an unpublished and of course judgment order in doing so we noted the possibility that ogbudimkpa might petition for a writ of habeas corpus 
back yet again in district court,ogbudimkpa still acting pro se filed a petition for habeas relief that essentially replicated the petition he had filed in november.the government moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the district court granted that motion,concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider his petition this appeal followed an appeal in which ogbudimkpa has been superbly represented by appointed counsel 
ii.discussion 
the convention against torture 
the united nations drafted cat in order to make more effective the struggle against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment throughout the world.united nations draft convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,doc,preamble.on december,the united nations general assembly adopted cat by unanimous agreement.committee on foreign relations,convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,exec,at.
president reagan signed cat on april,with the following reservation the government of the united states of america reserves the right to communicate,upon ratification,such reservations,interpretive understandings,or declarations as are deemed necessary.united nations treaty collection declarations and reservations,http.one month later,the president transmitted cat to the senate for approval,with nineteen proposed reservations,understandings,and declarations,including the declaration that cat is not,and the assurance that t he recommended legislation necessary to implement cat will be submitted to the congress separately.treaty doc,iii,vi 
the senate adopted a resolution of advice and consent to ratification of cat,subject to the declaration that it be deemed,on october.cong.rec.the instrument of ratification included the declaration that the provisions of articles through of cat are not.united nations treaty collection declarations and reservations.on october,president clinton deposited the instrument of ratification with the united nations.regulations concerning the convention against torture.
to implement article of cat,congress passed farra in.farra a provides that i t shall be the policy of the united states not to expel,extradite,or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.section b of farra requires the heads of the appropriate agencies to prescribe regulations to implement the obligations of the united states under cat article.accordingly,the department of justice of which the ins at that time was a division promulgated regulations delineating the procedures for deciding cat claims.pursuant to c,if an alien can demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to a particular country,the ins must grant him or her protection.depending on the status of the alien,that protection may take the form either of permanent withholding of removal or of temporary deferral of removal.c.the latter protection exists only until changed conditions in the proposed country of removal make it no longer more likely than not that the alien will be tortured if returned.b.
at issue in this case are the jurisdictional provisions of farra and whether they preclude district courts from exercising habeas jurisdiction over claims alleging violations of cat.section d of farra contains a provision and a provision.the provision denies federal courts the power to review the regulations promulgated under farra.id.the provision prescribes that cat claims may be considered only as part of final orders of deportation reviewed pursuant to of the ina.id.n othing in this section shall be construed as providing any court jurisdiction to consider or review claims raised under cat or this section,or any other determination made with respect to the application of the policy set forth in subsection a,except as part of the review of a final order of removal pursuant to section of the immigration and nationality act.
while on its face farra zipper clause acts only to consolidate jurisdiction in one action in the court of appeals,its effect is also to limit the extent to which courts of appeal may exercise that jurisdiction.section d of farra provides that only cat claims that arise in the context of final orders of removal may be reviewed by the courts of appeal.but farra is not the first federal enactment to affect courts jurisdiction in immigration proceedings.iirira expressly precludes the courts of appeals from exercising jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against any alien who is removable by reason of a conviction for certain criminal offenses,including any aggravated felony.see ins,d citing a c by confining judicial review to final orders of removal,which are unreviewable if the petitioner has committed certain crimes,farra prevents the courts of appeals from reviewing cat claims raised in deportation proceedings by aliens with certain criminal convictions.
we follow the breadcrumb trail to the supreme court opinion in ins cyr,d,which may provide an answer to the question whether habeas relief remains available.cyr decided this issue with respect to,inter alia,iirira which contains a jurisdictional provision similar to farra.the supreme court held that the provisions of iirira which deprive appellate courts of the right to review the final orders of removal of certain classes of criminal aliens did not contain a sufficiently explicit statement of congress intent to deprive district courts of their habeas jurisdiction to effect that foreclosure at.as a result,the court concluded that habeas relief remained available under to raise challenges to petitioners final orders of deportation.id.
two canons of statutory construction guided the supreme court analysis in cyr.one canon provided a reason to conclude that the statute did not foreclose habeas review the other made that construction possible.
the court invoked the canon of constitutional avoidance if an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems,and where an alternative interpretation of the statute is fairly possible,we are obligated to construe the statute to avoid such problems.id.at internal citations omitted.here,the serious constitutional problem that concerned the court was the potential violation of the constitution suspension clause implicated by foreclosure of habeas review construing the statute to allow for habeas review would avoid a potential suspension clause issue,thus not requiring the court to answer the difficult question of what the suspension clause protects.id.at.
the second canon of construction invoked by the court was the plain statement rule.this rule is designed to ensure that,absent unambiguous evidence of congress intent,extraordinary constitutional powers are not invoked,or important constitutional protections eliminated,or seemingly inequitable doctrines applied.cipollone liggett group,d scalia,concurring.here,both the extraordinary power of congress to eliminate all article iii review of the deportation orders of certain aliens and the elimination of the important constitutional protections embodied by the suspension clause were at issue.w hen a particular interpretation of a statute invokes the outer limits of congress power here,the power to deprive the courts of all jurisdiction to review certain types of cases we expect a clear indication that congress intended that result.cyr,at.citing edward debartolo.gulf coast constr.trades council,d and there exists a longstanding rule requiring a clear statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas jurisdiction.cyr,at.citing ex parte yerger,wall.implications from statutory text or legislative history are not sufficient instead congress must articulate specific and unambiguous statutory directives to effect a repeal of habeas jurisdiction.id.at.see also felker turpin,d declining to conclude that title i of aedpa repealed habeas jurisdiction because it did not explicitly mention habeas corpus demore kim,d concluding that district court had jurisdiction to consider habeas corpus claim challenging statute permitting aliens to be held indefinitely without bail despite language stating that n o court may set aside any action or decision by the attorney general because where a provision precluding review is claimed to bar habeas review,the court has required a particularly clear statement that such is congress intent.
in the context of these principles,the court concluded that the language of iirira was not sufficiently precise to repeal the habeas jurisdiction theretofore available via.none of the provisions that the government alleged divested the district court of habeas jurisdiction contained a clear,unambiguous,and express statement of congressional intent to preclude judicial consideration on habeas.cyr,at.in particular,they did not explicitly mention habeas,or.id.at.as a result,the court concluded,no provision of iirira speaks with sufficient clarity to bar jurisdiction pursuant to the general habeas statute.id.at.
cognizability of habeas corpus claims under farra 
notwithstanding the above,the district court in this case concluded that it lacked habeas jurisdiction under to consider claims arising under cat and its implementing legislation and regulations.after consideration of the parties arguments,we conclude that farra jurisdictional provisions do not preclude habeas jurisdiction.
as noted above,two provisions of farra affect the jurisdiction of the federal courts.only one is relevant to this case.farra provision provides that n o court shall have jurisdiction to review the regulations adopted to implement this section.farra d.here,however,ogbudimkpa does not challenge the regulations themselves,but the ij application of the regulations to his case,and thus this provision is not implicated.at issue here is whether the clause in d,which limits courts jurisdiction to consider cat claims to the review of final orders of removal,precludes habeas review.
applying cyr s principles 
guided by cyr s analysis of a similar provision in iirira,we join the first,second and ninth circuits in concluding that,because d of farra fails to state explicitly that a district court may not exercise jurisdiction over habeas corpus claims or mention,the district court retains that jurisdiction cyr,at.holding that a statute must explicitly mention habeas,or,to speak with sufficient clarity to bar jurisdiction pursuant to the general habeas statute see also demore.at.at describing cyr as establish ing a superclear statement,magic words requirement for the congressional expression of an intent to preclude habeas review quoting cyr,at.scalia,dissenting wang,at a statute must,at a minimum,explicitly mention either habeas corpus or in order to limit or restrict jurisdiction.
we note first that the same constitutional concern that guided the supreme court to its conclusion in cyr is present in this case.as in cyr,the government asks us to interpret a statute in a way that would foreclose an individual ability to invoke the writ of habeas corpus.to determine whether this foreclosure violates the suspension clause of the constitution would require us to construe that clause scope,a task the supreme court concluded should be a last resort in light of the considerable differences of opinion on the breadth of the clause.at.the danger of a suspension clause violation here is as acute as in cyr because this case involves the historical core of the writ of habeas corpus providing a means for reviewing the legality of executive detention,including the detention of aliens.id.at.we decline to consider the government argument that a cknowledging no habeas corpus remedy for a narrow category of claims does not effect an outright suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.resp t br.at.accepting or denying the truth of this statement is,spot on,what the cyr court sought to avoid.at.the fact that this court would be required to answer the difficult question of what the suspension clause protects is in and of itself a reason to avoid answering the constitutional questions that would be raised by concluding that review was barred entirely.we follow the supreme court lead and thus forgo construing the suspension clause.cyr,at.see also wang,at noting desire to avoid serious constitutional concerns.
we note also that the reasons to require a clear statement of congressional intent are also present here.as discussed above,while ogbudimkpa initially sought review of the final order of removal issued in his case,that petition was dismissed by our court for lack of jurisdiction.if we were to conclude here that there is no habeas jurisdiction,no article iii court will review ogbudimkpa cat claims.we are reluctant to construe the statute to bar any type of judicial review without a clear statement from congress indicating its intent to do so.accord cyr,at.in addition,the construction that the government proposes would eliminate habeas jurisdiction,something that also requires a clear statement of intent on the part of congress.id.at.
with these considerations in mind,we turn to the language of farra.a comparison with emphasis added of the provision of iirira at issue in cyr that most closely mirrors the language of farra at issue here convinces us that farra does not foreclose habeas review.
with strong indication from the supreme court that nothing will suffice but the most explicit statement that habeas jurisdiction under is repealed,and because d of farra does not mention habeas corpus or,we conclude,by analogy to cyr,that farra does not foreclose a district court from exercising habeas jurisdiction over claims alleging violations of cat.
arguments to distinguish cyr 
differences between farra and iirira 
the government reasons that a different result from cyr should occur in this case,carefully parsing the differences between the statutory language of farra and iirira in search of support.it notes that farra does not just forbid review but also expressly prohibits any interpretation of its terms that would confer jurisdiction either to consider or to review a cat claim.
cyr rejects this line of argument.that the wording of farra is minimally different from iirira is immaterial in the absence of a clear statement by congress of its intent explicitly to foreclose habeas jurisdiction.even assuming that farra language is broader than iirira language at best does nothing more than create a slight ambiguity as to congress intent.but statutory ambiguity does not help the ins and o nly the clearest statement of congressional intent will support the ins position.cyr,at.indeed,in cyr the court concluded that habeas relief under remained available notwithstanding the fact that one provision under review,entitled elimination of custody review by habeas corpus,repealed the ina provision authorizing habeas relief,ina a the court reasoned that this provision could not eliminate what it did not originally grant namely,habeas jurisdiction pursuant to.cyr,at.in other words,excising a specific ina provision theretofore authorizing habeas review did not affect the general habeas authority granted by.if excising a provision authorizing habeas review is not sufficiently explicit an expression of congressional intent to foreclose habeas jurisdiction,then the use of the word consider in addition to the word review can not be deemed sufficiently explicit.
the government argues that because cyr did not involve a treaty,the supreme court reasoning does not apply to farra.further,because farra involves such a treaty,there is no habeas jurisdiction unless congress grants it.with a treaty,no domestic legislation is required to give it the force of law in the united states.trans world airlines,franklin mint,d.conversely,a treaty is one that must be implemented by legislation before it gives rise to a private cause of action.mannington mills,congoleum,cir citing head money cases.as noted above,in ratifying cat the senate gave its advice and consent subject to the declaration by the united states that the provisions of articles through of cat are not.cong.rec.
premised on its conclusion that cat is not,the government states that an alien has only those cat claims that congress has expressly provided.in essence,the government contends,the question that the supreme court asked in cyr is there evidence that congress intended to foreclose the availability of habeas review is turned around in the context of a treaty and becomes,instead,whether there is evidence that congress intended to provide for the availability of habeas review.were this analysis correct,habeas review would not be available for claims based on violations of cat because,the government points out,there is no explicit evidence that congress intended to provide for that review.
we agree with the first and second circuits that the proper starting point is the question whether farra deprives the district court of habeas jurisdiction,not whether it grants it.habeas relief is available for an individual who claims his or her continued detention violates a statute or a treaty.c.cat has been implemented by farra and its accompanying regulations.farra makes it federal law that no one shall be removed to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.farra,a.it follows that those individuals whose detention violates farra may challenge their detention under,just as with any other detentions that violate federal law.see wang,at once congress created rights under cat by enacting farra,necessarily became a proper avenue of relief for individuals in custody in violation of farra and its implementing regulations.saint fort,at saint fort claims do not rest solely on a treaty that is not,they rest on the cat through the farra and the regulations,and on a claim of violation of constitutional rights.thus,whether cat is or is not is irrelevant.
historical practice 
in support of its argument that congress must affirmatively grant habeas jurisdiction,the government notes that there is no history of district courts reviewing cat claims in the form of habeas corpus petitions.we are unpersuaded that this is relevant.in the words of the second circuit which also dismissed this argument,it makes no difference whether the type of claim allegedly being excluded from is or newly created.wang,at.once congress created rights under cat by enacting farra,became a proper avenue of relief for individuals in custody in violation of farra and its implementing regulations.id.
in a similar vein,the government contends that the lack of history of habeas review of cat claims distinguishes this case from cyr because there was a longstanding history of habeas review of deportation and exclusion orders prior to iirira,whereas there is no such history of cat claims prior to farra.but the cyr court analysis of the historical availability of the writ of habeas corpus did not focus narrowly,as the government would have us do,on whether there was a history of habeas review of the exact claims at issue in that case.
using the broad lens of the cyr court,we conclude that the question is whether the general nature of the claims at issue were historically reviewable on a writ of habeas corpus.habeas corpus writs were traditionally issued to command the discharge of seamen who had a statutory exemption from impressment into the british navy,to emancipate slaves,and to obtain the freedom of apprentices and asylum inmates.cyr,at.here,as in cyr,the general nature of the claim is that of a challenge to the validity of executive detentions,and we are persuaded by cyr s analysis demonstrating that these challenges invoke the writ protections in their purest form.id.at at its historical core,the writ of habeas corpus has served as a means of reviewing the legality of executive detention id.at noting the historical use of habeas corpus to remedy unlawful executive action and to redress the improper exercise of official discretion id.at arguing that to conclude that the writ is no longer available in this context would represent a departure from historical practice in immigration law.the writ of habeas corpus has always been available to review the legality of executive detention.
even if we were to narrow the lens,disallowing habeas relief would still be a departure from historical practice.not only did the writ traditionally issue as a means to review the legality of executive detention of citizens,it also issued as a means of reviewing the legality of executive detention of aliens.cyr,at.and it traditionally issued as a means of reviewing the legality of the detention of aliens in the face of alleged treaty violations.brief amici curiae of legal historians listed herein in support of respondents ins cyr,geo.immigr,describing cases in which deserting alien sailors brought habeas corpus petitions based on violations of treaties or federal laws see also mali,at.considering habeas corpus petition brought on behalf of alien sailor alleging violations of consular agreement between the united states and belgium.hence the conclusion that habeas review was not available for cat claims would,as in cyr,represent a departure from historical practice,a departure we decline to follow.cyr,at.
we therefore hold that district courts may exercise habeas jurisdiction over petitions alleging violations of cat or farra and that farra does not speak with sufficient clarity to deprive the district courts of that jurisdiction 
scope of review 
the government further asserts that,even if we were to conclude as we have done that district courts have jurisdiction under to review cat or farra claims,the district court has no jurisdiction over ogbudimkpa habeas corpus claims because he has not sought review on a legal or constitutional claim,but rather of a factual issue.we disagree.ogbudimkpa does not dispute the factual findings of the ij.rather,he argues that the ij wrongly applied the standard for relief set forth in farra and its implementing regulations to the facts of his case.habeas relief is traditionally available to correct errors of law,including the erroneous application or interpretation of statutes.cyr,at.emphasis added.a district court habeas jurisdiction encompasses review of the bia application of legal principles to undisputed facts.wang,at wang argument on appeal challenging the bia application of the particular facts in this case to the relevant law falls within the permissible scope of review.see also saint fort,at noting the second circuit conclusion in wang while declining to reach issue because the petitioner claim was constitutional in nature.because ogbudimkpa alleges misapplication of a legal principle to undisputed facts of record,this case falls within the scope of habeas jurisdiction granted to the district court by.
iii.conclusion 
district courts have jurisdiction to consider claims alleging violations of cat raised in habeas corpus petitions.congress implemented cat by passing farra.farra jurisdictional provisions do not refer to habeas corpus or,and thus do not speak with sufficient precision to divest district courts of that habeas jurisdiction.because the scope of habeas jurisdiction extends to claims concerning the correct interpretation or application of a statute,the district court has jurisdiction to consider ogbudimkpa claim that the bia misinterpreted farra and the regulations implementing farra in concluding that the facts in this case do not satisfy the standard for relief under cat.accordingly,we reverse the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and remand for it to consider the merits of ogbudimkpa habeas corpus petition.

div.g,title xxii,stat,codified as note to.
to the district court,the government argued that,under of farra,only our court had jurisdiction to review his claim because farra provides that review may only be had for final orders of deportation,and the courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction to conduct that review.the government noted that,if the basis of the order of removal of ogbudimkpa had been his criminal conviction,then c g of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of would preclude our court from exercising jurisdiction,and in that situation his only recourse would be to file a habeas petition in the district court.however,the basis of the charges of deportation against ogbudimkpa was not because he was a criminal alien,but because he had violated the conditions of his visa.hence,we would have jurisdiction.
we caution that the tactics of the government are inappropriately confusing and misleading,especially when used against a pro se litigant.
the issue raised by the government positions whether the jurisdictional bar applies only where the ins actually charges the criminal conduct as the basis for removal as the government conceded in the district court or whether it is a bar and applies to any alien with an applicable criminal conviction as the government argued before us has resulted in a circuit split.compare reno,cir basis of charge for removal immaterial for purposes of jurisdictional bar attorney general,cir same with choeum ins,cir jurisdictional bar applies only when criminal conduct is basis of charge for removal yousefi ins,cir same briseno ins,cir same.we have not addressed this issue in a published opinion,and do not do so in this case.
ogbudimkpa argues that the district court erred in ignoring the law of the case as set forth by this unpublished judgment order.under the doctrine,once an issue has been decided,parties may not relitigate that issue in the same case.waldorf shuta,cir.because,in dismissing ogbudimkpa petition,we stated that ogbudimkpa may seek review of his claims before the district court in a habeas corpus proceeding,ogbudimkpa argues that we have decided that the district court has jurisdiction to hear his habeas corpus shall not impute the resolution of a complicated issue from dictum in a judgment order.dicta statements are not binding law of the case.see united artists theatre circuit,township of warrington,cir.similarly,courts may refuse to infer decisions on issues that were barely presented,or from summary decisions.charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed see also.hosps.of cleveland emerson,cir refusing to presume that footnote tersely stating the conclusion without discussion constituted law of the case.ogbudimkpa argues that we were obliged to decide the issue at the time of the government motion and cites to liang ins,cir.in liang,we concluded that iirira divests courts of appeals of jurisdiction over certain petitions for review,but that district courts retain their general habeas jurisdiction under to consider the lawfulness of the removal orders.at.we noted that the determination of our jurisdiction over aliens petitions for review is inextricably intertwined with the question whether the district courts have continued habeas jurisdiction.id.at.but we are not persuaded by this argument that the two decisions are necessarily intertwined.in liang,we affirmatively noted our intent to resolve the issue whether district courts had habeas corpus jurisdiction.id.we find no intent to resolve the issue presented in this case in our prior unpublished judgment order.
the district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review ogbudimkpa claims in part because there is no judicial review under farra except as part of the review of a final order of removal pursuant to section of the ina and because ogbudimkpa final order of removal was issued pursuant to a,not of the ina.as ogbudimkpa notes,and as the government conceded at oral argument,what occurs pursuant to of the ina is judicial review,not the issuance of final orders of removal.all final orders of removal are issued pursuant to another section,such as a.compare ina setting forth procedure for judicial review of orders of removal with a listing deportable aliens.if the district court interpretation of farra were correct,then no court would ever have jurisdiction because no final orders are issued pursuant to of the ina.because the district court based its conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction on another ground,we note this error only in passing.
