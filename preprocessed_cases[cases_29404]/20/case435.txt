gary thibodeau appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york mcavoy,denying and dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,which challenged new york kidnapping statute,penal law section,as unconstitutionally vague under the fourteenth amendment due process clause.thibodeau argues that the law,for which a conviction requires a jury to find that an abducted person died during the abduction or before he or she could return or be returned to safety,is void for vagueness because it fails to specify a time period after which a victim absence may give rise to a presumption of death.for the reasons to be discussed,we reject thibodeau argument that section is unconstitutionally vague and affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
heidi allen,an cashier at a convenience store in new haven,new york,disappeared from her job on the morning of april.four months later,her whereabouts still unknown,a grand jury in oswego county,new york,charged thibodeau and his brother richard with,inter alia,kidnapping in violation of section in connection with allen disappearance and presumptive death.section declares that a person is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree when he abducts another person and when t he person abducted dies during the abduction or before he is able to return or to be returned to safety.the law further provides for an evidentiary presumption of death arising 
from evidence that a person whom the person abducted would have been extremely likely to visit or communicate with during the specified period between the termination of the abduction and trial were he alive and free to do so did not see or hear from him during such period and received no reliable information during such period persuasively indicating that he was alive.
thibodeau was brought to trial in.at trial,the people introduced evidence linking thibodeau to allen abduction,including,inter alia,eyewitness testimony that at the time of the kidnapping his brother van was parked in front of the convenience store from which allen was abducted,that two men then held and subdued a young woman in that store parking lot,and that shortly thereafter the same van was swerving erratically on a nearby road because of an apparent struggle inside the vehicle.other witnesses testified that they heard yelling and screaming emanating from thibodeau house on the morning of allen disappearance.two jailhouse informants further recounted that while awaiting trial,thibodeau had admitted that he occasionally used drugs with allen,that the two had had an altercation,that allen had been bludgeoned to death with thibodeau own shovel,and that her body was hidden in a location which authorities would never find.after her disappearance,allen parents and her boyfriend,all of whom had,prior to her abduction,enjoyed daily contact with her,testified that they had not seen or heard from her after april.allen,in fact,has never been seen or heard from again.the jury found thibodeau guilty of kidnapping under section and he was sentenced principally to years to life imprisonment 
thibodeau filed a timely direct appeal in state court,alleging as he had before the trial court,inter alia,that section is unconstitutionally vague because it lacks any definite time period by which an abducted,missing person may be presumed dead,thus creating an arbitrary and unreasonable presumption of death.the appellate division,fourth department rejected thibodeau appeal in a published decision,people thibodeau,dep t.the new york court of appeals denied leave to appeal,people thibodeau,table,after which thibodeau filed this habeas action pursuant to in the united states district court for the northern district of new york.in his petition,thibodeau reiterated his contention that section is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to specify a time period after which the presumption of death may apply.the petition was referred to magistrate judge david peebles,who issued a report and recommendation on october,recommending that the petition be denied as to the vagueness claim.the district court,after considering thibodeau objections,adopted the report and recommendation in full.thibodeau subsequently moved the district court to issue a certificate of appealability coa,which the district court granted only as to the question of vagueness.this timely appeal followed 
discussion 
standard of review under 
we review a district court denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo,but review its determination of facts for clear error.anderson miller,cir.
under d,a court may grant a habeas petition with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings only where the state court judgment 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
the supreme court has held that the phrases contrary to and unreasonable application of establish independent bases for fulfilling the requirements of d.williams taylor,d.first,a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it contradicts supreme court precedent on the application of a legal rule,or addresses a set of facts materially indistinguishable from a supreme court decision but nevertheless comes to a different conclusion than the court did.id.at.loliscio goord,cir.second,a state court decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the case before it.williams,at.we have acknowledged that the meaning of unreasonable in this context is at times difficult to define,christie hollins,cir internal quotation marks omitted,but,as the supreme court has elucidated,the standard requires at least that the state court be more than incorrect or erroneous,lockyer andrade,d.it must,in fact,be objectively unreasonable.id.
ii.vagueness 
standards for the doctrine 
it is that the fourteenth amendment,which guarantees that no state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law,const.amend.xiv,ensures that the individual need not speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes and is entitled to be informed as to what the state commands or forbids,lanzetta new jersey.as one of the most fundamental protections of the due process clause,farrell burke,cir,the doctrine requires that laws be crafted with sufficient clarity to give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited and to provide explicit standards for those who apply them,betancourt bloomberg,cir quoting grayned city of rockford,d.
supreme court jurisprudence recognizes two independent grounds upon which a statute language may be so vague as to deny due process of law.first,a law violates due process if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits.hill colorado,d.animating this first vagueness ground is the constitutional principle that individuals should receive fair notice or warning when the state has prohibited specific behavior or acts.see smith goguen,d the doctrine incorporates notions of fair notice or warning.second,a law is unconstitutionally vague if it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.hill,at.this second ground,which the supreme court recognizes as the more important aspect of the vagueness doctrine,mandates that laws contain minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.kolender lawson,d.indeed,statutes must provide explicit standards for those who apply them to avoid resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis,with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.grayned,at.
the supreme court has cautioned that this doctrine does not require meticulous specificity from every statute,id.at,as language is necessarily marked by a degree of imprecision,farrell,at.instead,t he degree of vagueness that the constitution well as the relative importance of fair notice and fair in part on the nature of the enactment.village of hoffman estates flipside,hoffman estates,d.while economic regulations are subject to a less strict vagueness test,we apply a more stringent analysis when examining laws that impose criminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively more severe.id.at.
this case does not present the typical vagueness challenge because the language thibodeau alleges is unconstitutional concerns not the specific elements of the kidnapping statute but rather the evidentiary presumption of death that the statute permits in certain situations while thibodeau has cited no cases where courts have applied the doctrine to an evidentiary we are unaware of analysis is appropriate here because the presumption,as applied by the police and the jury,satisfied a required element of the kidnapping statute,leading to thibodeau arrest and conviction,a clear deprivation of his liberty.thus,we must determine whether the state properly deprived thibodeau of his liberty,particularly where it has accorded to the police and jury the discretion to determine whether the length of time a kidnapping victim has been missing is sufficient to presume his or her death in a criminal case.
vagueness analysis 
a statute may be challenged on vagueness grounds either as applied or on its face.both types of vagueness challenge require the inquiry described above,see farrell,at,but the two differ in terms of what parties may assert and how these challenges may be brought.because thibodeau does not address in his brief which type of challenge he is bringing here,we analyze each type in turn.
we begin with the analysis of the as applied challenge because the permissibility of a facial challenge sometimes depends upon whether the challenged regulation was constitutional as applied to the plaintiff.id.indeed,the supreme court instructs courts to examine the complainant conduct before analyzing other hypothetical applications of the law.hoffman estates,at.
we thus turn to whether the law presents an ordinary person with sufficient notice of or the opportunity to understand what conduct is prohibited or proscribed.we find no ambiguity in the state legislature wording of the statute,it being pellucidly clear to the ordinary person that the state had made it a criminal offense to restrain a person with intent to prevent his liberation through holding him in a place where he is not likely to be found,or threatening to use deadly physical force,penal law,where such abduction resulted in the death of the abducted,id.in any case,by not addressing this argument at all in his brief,thibodeau has waived any argument that the statute is vague on this ground.losacco city of middletown,cir.
thibodeau challenge,properly distilled,focuses on the second vagueness the law accords unfettered discretion to law enforcement and juries.indeed,thibodeau claims that section gives law enforcement personnel unfettered discretion to deem a missing person allegedly kidnapped to be dead simply because neither friends nor family have heard from such person.additionally,he notes that the presumption of death is typically subject to a set of objective guidelines to guide those enforcing the law,citing court decisions and state laws that presume death in the civil context only after a fixed period of years has passed with no contact from,or the reappearance of,the missing person in essence,by failing to specify a fixed time period after which an abducted person will be presumed dead,the law,in thibodeau eyes,gives excessive discretion to police and juries by permitting their own arbitrary whims and predilections to decide when a kidnapping victim has been missing long enough that the presumption should attach.
in examining challenges on the second ground,we have recently concluded that courts undertaking an challenge may determine either that a statute as a general matter provides sufficiently clear standards to minimize the risk of arbitrary enforcement or that,even without such standards,the conduct at issue falls within the core of the statute prohibition,so that the enforcement was not the result of the unfettered discretion that law enforcement officers and factfinders might have in other,hypothetical applications of the statute.farrell,at.
we agree with new york appellate division,fourth department,which ruled on thibodeau direct appeal,that section standards are sufficiently clear because the presumption of death operates only in those circumstances in which the people establish that the victim has been abducted and subsequently not seen or heard from even though it is extremely likely that the victim otherwise would have visited or communicated with family or friends.thibodeau,at quoting penal law.moreover,the statute further requires proof that the victim family,friends,or other contacts have received no reliable information persuasively indicating that the victim remains alive.id.quoting penal law.far from granting the police and prosecutors the unfettered discretion to use any amount of time that a person is missing to create a presumption of death,these two factors severely limit the application of the presumption.they provide instead objective criteria,ensuring that the statute presumption does not apply only at the whim of any police officer.kolender,at.internal quotation marks omitted.and it is precisely the objectivity and clarity of section criteria that convince us that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague.indeed,section does not resemble the standardless laws the supreme court has found unconstitutionally that,for example,required an individual to provide credible and reliable identification at the request of the police officer without explaining how the police officer was to determine the credibility of an identification,id.at,or that required t hose generally implicated by the imprecise terms of the ordinance to comport themselves according to the life style deemed appropriate by the jacksonville police and the courts,papachristou city of jacksonville,d.see also smith,at.the language at issue is void for vagueness as applied to goguen because it subjected him to criminal liability under a standard so indefinite that police,court,and jury were free to react to nothing more than their own preferences for treatment of the flag.
section instead parallels those statutes that incorporate express restrictions or provide some meaningful guidelines as to their proper enforcement,and courts have generally not hesitated to uphold such laws.see,united states nadi,cir concluding that,which prohibits certain kinds of fraud by government contractors,sets forth clear requirements to guide prosecutors by specifying the type of contract at issue and the contract value required.indeed,in united states schneiderman,cir,abrogated on other grounds by posters n things,united states,d,this court,confronted with a vagueness challenge to proscription of the interstate or foreign sale of drug paraphernalia,found no constitutional infirmity because the law defined drug paraphernalia by enumerating fifteen examples of the items congress sought to target and by listing additional objective criteria to guide law enforcement in applying the statute.id.at.as with,we find that section establishes reasonable limiting criteria and standards that preclude the arbitrary whims of police or juries from controlling when the presumption of death should apply in any given context.
our holding is further corroborated by the legal principle we articulated in schneiderman that the constitution does not ban all discretion on the part of police officers or prosecutors as e ffective law enforcement often requires the exercise of some degree of police judgment.id.quoting grayned,at.due process,after all,does not impose impossible standards,and lest we convert the constitution into an insuperable obstacle to legislation,we must acknowledge that it requires only reasonable precision in criminal statutes.united states petrillo.given the above,it is clear that section permits the police and juries a reasonable and circums
