guy billy lee scott,an inmate at the ross correctional institution in chillicothe,ohio,appeals the district court sua sponte order dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court dismissed scott habeas petition as barred under the statute of limitations imposed by d.for the reasons stated below,we reverse the district court decision and remand for further consideration of scott petition.
on february,a jury in the butler county,ohio court of common pleas convicted scott for the murder,anal rape,and misdemeanor assault of lesa buckley.scott received consecutive sentences of fifteen years to life for murder and fifteen to years for rape as well as two concurrent sentences for the assault charges.scott appealed his convictions and identified seventeen assignments of error.on august,the ohio twelfth district court of appeals ruled against scott on all counts.citing four errors in the court of appeals decision,scott appealed to the ohio supreme court,which declined to review scott case on december.
without having any success through direct appeal,scott collaterally challenged his criminal convictions by filing a motion for relief with the butler county common pleas court on september.scott offered six reasons why the common pleas court should vacate the judgment and sentence,but the court rejected each reason on november.citing seven assignments of error in that court decision,scott appealed to the ohio twelfth district court of appeals,which ruled against him on october.scott appealed that decision to the ohio supreme court,which declined review on january.
after these repeated rejections by ohio courts,scott took his case into the federal court system.on january,scott petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.three days after receiving the habeas petition,a federal magistrate judge issued an order the january order,which instructed respondent,terry collins,to file a return of writ that should include an allegation of whether petitioner claims are barred by the statute of limitations established in section of title i of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,d west supp.respondent timely filed a page return of writ that did not include an allegation that scott petition was barred by the d statute of limitations.after respondent failed to address the statute of limitations issue,the magistrate judge issued an order explaining why scott petition was barred by d.in the same order,the magistrate judge commanded scott to show cause,in writing,within twenty days of the date of filing of this order why this court should not dismiss this action as.after receiving an extension of time to respond,scott responded with five reasons why the statute of limitations should not bar his habeas corpus petition.unpersuaded by the reasons scott offered,the district court dismissed scott petition with prejudice on statute of limitations grounds.
the district court thoroughly explained its basis for rejecting scott habeas petition on statute of limitations grounds in its order.for cases not petitioning the united states supreme court for a writ of certiorari,the district court reasoned that the statute of limitations begins to run ninety days the time allotted for filing a writ of certiorari after the conclusion of all direct criminal appeals in the state system.because the ohio supreme court declined scott appeal on december,the district court noted that,were it enacted at that point,the statute of limitations would have begun running ninety days.however,recognizing that d did not become law until april,the district court concluded that the statute of limitations began to run on that date instead.next,the district court acknowledged that under d,the statute of limitations is tolled during the pendency of properly filed applications for state relief.thus,after approximately five months had run on the statute of limitations,scott tolled the statute of limitations by filing for state relief on september.the statute of limitations resumed on january,when the ohio supreme court declined review of scott motion for relief.because the remaining seven months of the statute of limitations expired in approximately august,the district court barred scott january,petition for habeas relief.
although it dismissed scott petition,the district court granted scott a certificate of appealability coa on the limited issue of whether the statute of limitations barred scott habeas petition with the coa,scott timely appealed his case to the sixth circuit.in his appellate brief,scott realleged his actual innocence of the anal rape conviction and argued against the application the statute of limitations to his petition for four reasons i respondent waived the statute of limitations defense ii the court violated its duty to be fair and impartial by asserting a waived defense on behalf of the respondent iii scott petition is entitled to the benefit of equitable tolling of the statute of limitations and iv applying the statute of limitations to scott as a first time habeas petitioner unconstitutionally suspends the writ of habeas corpus in reply to these arguments,respondent contends that scott petition is barred by d because i the district court had authority to consider sua sponte the timeliness of the petition and the district court did not err in holding that scott petition was untimely ii the district court properly held that scott was not entitled to the benefits of equitable tolling and iii the application of the statute of limitations to scott case is not an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.later,the ohio association of criminal defense lawyers and the ohio public defender filed amici briefs urging reversal of the district court dismissal of scott petition.the question of whether the district court properly applied the statute of limitations to scott habeas petition is now before this court.
two initial observations are necessary before analyzing the merits of scott appeal.first,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,which became law on april,governs scott habeas petition because scott filed his habeas petition on january,the effective date of aedpa.see bronaugh ohio,cir applying aedpa statute of limitations to a habeas petition that was filed on april,harris stovall,cir.second,a court of appeals reviews a district court disposition of a habeas corpus petition de novo.bronaugh,at harris,at.thus,scott four assignments of error will be analyzed under aedpa and the district court decision will be reviewed de novo.
the first issue presented for review is whether respondent waived the ability to assert the statute of limitations defense.without addressing the effect of the district court sua sponte actions at this point,we conclude that respondent waived the statute of limitations defense 
to avoid waiver under the rules of pleading and to comply with the court order,respondent had to plead the d statute of limitations defense.the d statute of limitations defense is an affirmative defense as opposed to a jurisdictional defect.see hill braxton,cir acosta artuz,cir the aedpa statute of limitations is not jurisdictional,and nothing in the aedpa or in the habeas rules indicates that the burden of pleading the statute of limitations has been shifted from the respondent to the petitioner.the aedpa statute of limitations is therefore an affirmative defense and compliance therewith need not be pleaded in the petition.citations omitted kiser johnson,cir recognizing that the statute of limitations provision of the aedpa is an affirmative defenses rather than jurisdictional united states ex rel.galvan gilmore,s ince d does not affect this court subject matter jurisdiction over habeas petitions,the state can waive the d timeliness issue by failing to raise it.citations omitted.because the d statute of limitations is an affirmative defense,rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure requires that a party raise it in the first responsive pleading to avoid waiving it.c in pleading to a preceding pleading,a party shall set forth affirmatively statute of limitations and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.haskell washington township,cir pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure,a defense based upon a statute of limitations is waived if not raised in the first responsive pleading.see also phelps mcclellan,cir generally,a failure to plead an affirmative defense,like statute of limitations,results in the waiver of that defense and its exclusion from the case.carrington robinson,wl,at,explaining that t he statute of limitations provision of the aedpa is an affirmative defense charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,at ed.generally,a failure to plead an affirmative defense results in the waiver of that defense and its exclusion from the case.the sixth circuit is not alone in recognizing that a respondent who does not raise the d statute of limitations defense,waives it.see,galvan.at s ince the state did not raise the d limitations argument in this case,we find that it has been waived.samuel duncan,wl,at cir.july,explaining that the government waived the d statute of limitations defense by not raising the defense when the habeas petition was filed after the statute had run.
despite these cases underscoring the need to raise the statute of limitations defense,respondent return of writ did not assert that defense.respondent failure to raise the statute of limitations defense takes on even greater significance in light of paragraph four of the district court january,order,which commanded respondent to file a return of writ that included an allegation of whether petitioner claims were barred by the d statute of limitations.putting the pieces together,respondent failure to raise the statute of limitations defenses as required by both the rules of pleading and the district court january order amounted to a waiver of that defense.
respondent counters the waiver argument by contending that waiver is not complete because rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure allows for the amendment of the return of writ.respondent fails.although rule a allows for the possibility of amending a pleading to include a previously omitted affirmative defense,the mere possibility of amendment through rule a does not cure respondent actual failure to raise the defense.
in sum,the statute of limitations in d is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded to avoid waiver.here,respondent did not plead the statute of limitations defense.consequently,respondent waived it.
b.the district court authority to dismiss sua sponte a habeas petition 
although respondent failed to raise the statute of limitations defense,the district court sua sponte dismissed scott habeas petition.scott argues that by asserting the statute of limitations defense sua sponte,the district court violated its duty to be fair and impartial.respondent counters by referencing several instances where district courts have sua sponte dismissed habeas petitions on statute of limitations grounds although the myriad of cases cited by respondent is generally helpful,none of those cases addresses the precise issue presented here for instance,many of the cases consider only the question of a district court ability to dismiss sua sponte a habeas petition as an initial matter,not after a finding that respondent waived the defense other cases pertain exclusively to the statute of limitations in for habeas motions for relief from federal sentences as opposed to the statute of limitations for habeas petitions for relief from state sentences 
in deciding the question of whether a district court may sua sponte cure a respondent waiver of the d statute of limitations defense,we first examine the scope of a district court power to dismiss a habeas petition sua sponte.rule governing section cases permits a district court to dismiss habeas petition sua sponte as an initial matter 
the original petition shall be presented promptly to a judge of the district court in accordance with the procedure of the court for the assignment of its business.the petition shall be examined promptly by the judge to whom it is assigned.if it plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court,the judge shall make an order for its summary dismissal and cause the petitioner to be notified.otherwise the judge shall order the respondent to file an answer or other pleading within the period of time fixed by the court or to take such other action as the judge deems appropriate 
fed.governing section cases.under this rule,after prompt examination,a judge may,as a matter of preliminary review,summarily dismiss the petition if it plainly appears from the face of the petition that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.see acosta artuz,cir kiser johnson,cir small endicott,cir see also boyd thompson,cir every circuit to consider the issue holds that a habeas court has discretion to raise procedural default sua sponte to further the interests of comity,federalism,and judicial efficiency.rule use of the word otherwise indicates that,if,after prompt examination,a judge does not summarily dismiss the case,the judge must order respondent to either file an answer or take other appropriate action.significantly,rule does not give a court continuing power to dismiss sua sponte the case after the court orders respondent to file an answer.in short,rule gives a district court the ability to dismiss habeas petitions sua sponte,but that ability expires when the judge orders a respondent to file an answer or take other appropriate action 
a district court ability to dismiss a habeas petition sua sponte as an initial matter after giving the petitioner notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard does not amount to a power to cure sua sponte a party waiver of an affirmative defense see haskell,at since statute of limitations is a waivable defense,it ordinarily is error for a district court to raise the issue sua sponte.otherwise,the waiver aspect of rule c would have little meaning.citations omitted edwards armstrong,wl,at cir.june,a court thus commits error when it cures one party waiver by ruling sua sponte.see also esslinger davis,cir reversing district court sua sponte dismissal of a habeas petition after the state had waived an affirmative defenses because t he court sua sponte invocation of the procedural default to bar relief,despite the state waiver,served no important federal interest.as discussed above,rule permits sua sponte court action only as an initial matter.thus,the district court sua sponte dismissal after it ordered respondent to answer and after respondent answered was not a dismissal as an initial matter.instead,it was an impermissible curing of the respondent waiver 
in addition to rule,the second circuit has held that a district court may sua sponte dismiss a habeas petition on statute of limitations grounds where the dismissal implicates values beyond the concerns of the parties.acosta,at.in reaching that result,the second circuit explained that t he aedpa statute of limitation promotes judicial efficiency and conservation of judicial resources,safeguards the accuracy of state court judgments by requiring resolution of constitutional questions while the record is fresh,and lends finality to state court judgments within a reasonable time.id.to date,this circuit has not adopted that rationale as a basis for sua sponte dismissal of habeas petitions on statute of limitations grounds.nevertheless,even if this circuit were to adopt the acosta holding in addition to rule as a basis for a district court sua sponte dismissal of a habeas petition,the result here remains unchanged.in acosta,the second circuit articulation of the values beyond the concerns of the parties,are set forth only to justify a district court sua sponte dismissal of a habeas petition as an initial matter.for that reason,our holding is not inconsistent with acosta because here,unlike acosta,the respondent waived the statute of limitations affirmative defense.furthermore,acosta does not suggest that the values beyond the concerns of the parties justify granting a district court the ability to dismiss a habeas petition sua sponte on statute of limitations grounds after respondent waived that defense.
in sum,the district court sua sponte dismissal was not a preliminary matter.therefore,the district court sua sponte action improperly cured respondent waiver.thus,the district court erred in dismissing scott petition on statute of limitations grounds.for that reason,we remand this case to the district court for consideration of the merits of scott habeas petition.we note that this result in no way undermines a court power to dismiss a habeas petition sua sponte as a preliminary matter.nor does it prohibit a court from dismissing a habeas petition on statute of limitations grounds at a later time if the respondent raises the statute of limitations affirmative defense.
this case presents a rare and unusual situation where the district court sua sponte dismissed a habeas petition on statute of limitations grounds after the respondent had waived the statute of limitations defense.under those facts,the district court erred by sua sponte correcting respondent waiver by dismissing the petition.for that reason,the district court decision is reversed and the case is remanded to the district court for consideration of the merits of scott habeas petition.in light of this remand order,the remaining two issues,equitable tolling and unconstitutional suspension,are moot and we refrain from addressing them here.
because i can not agree that the district judge erred in dismissing the petitioner petition for writ of habeas corpus on limitations grounds,i must respectfully dissent.the district court believe aedpa provides district courts with the authority to sua sponte consider the timeliness of a habeas petition even when a state fails to preserve the issue.here,the district court determined that the respondent failure to raise the defense was inadvertent and not the result of a purposeful or deliberate decision to forego the defense gave the petitioner an opportunity to present his arguments against dismissal on limitations grounds found that the petition was untimely under the provisions of aedpa and concluded that dismissing the petition as untimely was appropriate given the goals of aedpa.i would affirm the district court.
initially,i question whether the waiver sua sponte dismissal issue addressed by this court is within the scope of the certificate of appealability coa.in its order dismissing the petition,the district court considered four issues whether the petition is barred as untimely under d whether the petitioner is entitled to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations whether the district court has the discretion to raise the statute of limitations issue sua sponte and whether applying the statute of limitations to the petitioner case amounts to an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.the district court certified only the first issue for review on appeal.specifically,the district judge wrote 
in light of the evolving interpreting and applying the statute of limitations governing habeas corpus cases set forth in d,a certificate of appealability will issue solely with respect to the issue addressed in this order as to whether the instant habeas corpus petition is barred from review under d.
when we remanded the case to the district court for it to reconsider its coa in light of the supreme court opinion in slack mcdaniel,d,the district court said that it stands by its original order for issuance of certificate of appealability on the statute of limitations question addressed in the order being appealed.
the petitioner did not ask this court to broaden the scope of the district court coa.the petitioner nonetheless specified four issues on appeal,none of which was expressly certified by the district court.specifically,the petitioner raised the following issues whether the respondent waived the statute of limitations defense whether the district court violated its due process obligation to be fair and impartial when it sua sponte asserted a waivable defense on behalf of the respondent whether the district court erred in determining that the petitioner was not entitled to equitable tolling and whether enforcement of the statute of limitations in the petitioner case constituted an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.
aedpa limits the scope of review in a habeas appeal to issues specified in the coa.c.issues not certified for appeal,either by the district court or by this court on motion under sixth circuit rule a,can not be heard on appeal.savage united states,wl cir,murray united states,cir.because the operative coa in this case mentions only the issue of timeliness under d,i believe that we exceed the scope of the coa when we address the issues articulated by the petitioner.
should we nevertheless generously construe the coa as permitting the petitioner to argue on appeal his waiver and sua sponte dismissal issues,we should then reject the petitioner arguments on the merits.in my judgment,the district court acted in conformity not only with aedpa but also with the caselaw construing aedpa.
congress intended aedpa to further the principles of comity,finality,and federalism.williams taylor,d stating that there is no doubt congress intended aedpa to advance these doctrines comity,finality,and federalism.consistent with such purpose,congress created a limitations period that was meant to streamline the habeas review process and to lend finality to state court convictions.duncan walker,d recognizing that the year limitation period of d quite plainly serves the interest in the finality of state court judgments see also cong,at,reprinted in conf,at,reprinted in,explaining that,in enacting aedpa,congress wanted to curb the abuse of the statutory writ of habeas corpus by adding,among other things,a period of limitation to the time a state prisoner has to seek habeas relief from a state conviction.indeed,as recognized by the second circuit in acosta artuz,cir,aedpa limitations period implicates values beyond the interests of the parties and,in particular,promotes judicial efficiency and conservation of judicial resources,safeguards the accuracy of state court judgments by requiring resolution of constitutional questions while the record is fresh,and lends finality to state court judgments within a reasonable time.
since enactment of aedpa,many courts have concluded that the limitation period contained in section d is an affirmative defense that may be waived by the respondent.see,kiser johnson,cir.nonetheless,courts have unanimously held that a district court may sua sponte raise and decide a limitations defense,waivable though it may be,before the respondent is even ordered to file an answer to the petition.see,acosta,at kiser,at.these courts have found such a result to be consistent not only with the purposes of aedpa but also with rule of the rules governing section cases,which rule gives district courts the power to review and summarily dismiss habeas petitions,before the respondent files an answer,i f it plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibits annexed to it that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.rules governing cases,rule.rooted in the duty of the court to screen out frivolous applications and eliminate the burden that would be placed on the respondent by ordering an unnecessary answer,advisory committee note to rule,the district court authority to summarily dismiss habeas petitions under rule reflects aedpa policy considerations of comity,finality,and federalism and clearly differentiates habeas cases from other civil cases with respect to sua sponte consideration of affirmative defenses.kiser,at.
to be sure,this case is distinguishable from the many cases upholding summary dismissal on limitations grounds where respondents have never been ordered to file a response to the petition.here,the district court ordered the respondent to file a return of writ responding to the allegations of the petition.in its order,the court stated that the return of writ should include a number of allegations,including an allegation as to whether aedpa statute of lim
