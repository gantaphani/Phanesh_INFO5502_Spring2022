angel sellan appeals from a september,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york david trager,district judge,denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.he argues primarily that he was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel when his appellate counsel failed to raise a potentially meritorious issue of new york state law on direct appeal before the new york appellate division.sellan contends that his counsel should have argued on direct appeal that he was entitled to a new trial under people gallagher,because the trial court failed to charge the jury that it could not simultaneously convict him of two counts with assertedly inconsistent mental states.we affirm the district court dismissal of sellan habeas petition because we are unable to conclude that the new york appellate division unreasonably applied clearly established federal law in rejecting his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.
background 
this case arises out of a shooting incident that occurred on may,in which john mullaney,mario arce and george molina were shot on the boardwalk at rockaway beach,queens.three or four shots were fired.mullaney and arce were injured and molina was killed.following a jury trial in queens county supreme court,sellan was convicted of murder in the second degree depraved mind murder,manslaughter in the first degree a lesser included offense of second degree intentional murder,which requires intent to cause serious physical injury resulting in death,two counts of assault in the first degree,reckless endangerment in the first degree,and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree,pursuant to penal law,and,respectively.rafael morato,a friend of sellan,testified at trial that he heard several shots,and then,within minutes of the shooting,saw sellan on the boardwalk holding a pistol.the police subsequently went to sellan home,obtained permission from his aunt to search his bedroom,and found a caliber pistol and particles of sand in a bag.a ballistics expert testified at trial that the fatal shot had been fired from that caliber pistol.sellan was sentenced principally to an indeterminate incarceration term of years to life for his second degree murder conviction,a concurrent term of eight and years to years for the first degree manslaughter conviction,and concurrent shorter terms for the other convictions.
on direct appeal,sellan appellate counsel raised two arguments the prosecutor improperly him with regard to evidence of sellan gang membership,and the prosecutor improperly attempted to refresh the defendant recollection of a prior bad act.sellan appellate counsel,however,did not raise an issue on direct appeal that had been properly preserved at trial whether the trial court erred when it failed to charge murder in the second degree and first degree manslaughter in the alternative because the mental state elements were mutually exclusive the appellate division affirmed sellan conviction,see people sellan,and leave to appeal to the court of appeals was denied.see people sellan.
on the theory that appellate counsel should have raised this argument,sellan sought a writ of coram nobis in state court on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.he argued that the manslaughter charge required the jury to find that he intended to cause serious physical injury to his victim,while the murder charge required a finding that he acted with an extreme state of recklessness in causing that same victim death.sellan cited a new york court of appeals decision,people gallagher,for this proposition.in gallagher,the court of appeals vacated a defendant conviction and ordered a new trial,holding that he could not be convicted of both intentional murder and reckless manslaughter for the same act because guilt of one necessarily negates guilt of the other.gallagher,at.the second department of the appellate division summarily denied sellan application in a decision and order stating 
motion by defendant for a writ of coram nobis to vacate an order of this court dated october,which affirmed a judgment of the supreme court,queens county,rendered march,on ground of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.people bachert.
upon the papers filed in support of the motion and the papers filed in opposition thereto,it is 
ordered that the motion is denied.
people sellan.div d dep t.leave to appeal to the court of appeals was denied.see people sellan,and a second application for leave to appeal was denied on the basis that the second department order denying his writ of coram nobis was not appealable.see people sellan.on march,the queens county supreme court denied,as both procedurally barred and meritless,sellan pro se motion to vacate the judgment under,and upon reargument adhered to its decision.
subsequently,sellan raised his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a habeas corpus petition in federal district court.his petition was filed after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat,which mandates deference to state court decisions.see d.on september,the district court denied sellan petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court held that appellate counsel failure to raise a potentially meritorious state law claim on direct appeal did not give rise to a violation of clearly established federal law within the meaning of d.having denied sellan petition on this ground,the district court concluded that it was not required to decide whether the appellate division decision constituted an adjudication on the merits warranting application of aedpa higher level of deference to state court decisions,or whether the de novo standard of review applied.
petitioner now appeals.we review de novo a district court judgment denying habeas corpus.see chalmers mitchell,cir.
discussion 
this appeal requires us to construe and apply d,enacted in as part of aedpa,which establishes standards for federal habeas review of state court decisions.the statute provides,in pertinent part 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
several threshold questions regarding the proper interpretation and application of d must be addressed at the outset.first,we must decide whether sellan claim for ineffective assistance of counsel meets d requirement that the claim be based upon clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.if not,we need go no further.if,however,petitioner claim is based on clearly established law,then we must proceed to answer the question we left open in washington schriver,cir what level of deference does this court owe to a state court summary decision denying a petitioner federal claim in the absence of any reference to,or discussion of,federal law.
clearly established federal law 
as noted,we must determine as an initial matter whether sellan ineffective assistance of counsel claim was based on federal law clearly established by the supreme court.the district court held that such was not the case because the particular theory of ineffective assistance of counsel pressed by,that his attorney failed to raise an arguably meritorious state law argument on direct not been adopted by the supreme court as a basis for making out a successful sixth amendment ineffective assistance claim.see sellan kuhlman,d,a t the time the alleged errors were made by state courts,there was no clearly established federal rule that counsel could be found ineffective under the united states constitution for failing to raise an issue of state law on direct appeal.we disagree.
in some circumstances,the question of precisely what law must be clearly established for aedpa purposes may prove to be a complex one.johnson newburgh enlarged sch,cir describing the recurring difficulty of determining whether a federal right is clearly established for qualified immunity purposes.no such complexity exists here.in williams taylor,d,a ineffective assistance of counsel case decided after the district court filed its opinion,the supreme court concluded it is past question that the rule set forth in strickland washington qualifies as clearly established law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.id.at.stevens,for the court,part iii internal quotation marks omitted.the williams court thus clarified that for aedpa purposes,it matters only that the strickland performance and prejudice test has been clearly established not that a particular theory of ineffective assistance derived from strickland has been clearly established.any concerns obviate neither the clarity of the rule nor the extent to which the rule must be seen as established by this court.id.
following the lead of the williams court,we hold that a sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claim necessarily invokes federal law that has been clearly established by the supreme court within the meaning of aedpa.to determine whether sellan is entitled to habeas relief on the basis of his sixth amendment claim,we consider the standard of deference that is applicable here.
ii.standard of deference 
because the strickland standard satisfies the clearly established federal law requirement of d,we must decide whether the new york appellate division denial of sellan coram nobis petition constituted an adjudicat ion on the merits under d,absent any discussion of or explicit reference to sellan federal claim.if so,we are required to apply the deference mandated under aedpa to sellan claim.
in washington schriver we discussed,but did not decide,whether a state court decision that fails to discuss or refer to the merits of a petitioner federal claim or its basis in federal law constitutes an adjudication on the merits triggering the unreasonable application test set forth in d in that case,washington argued that his federal constitutional claim was not adjudicated on the merits because the state courts neither cited nor applied federal law,no r relied upon precedents which in turn cited or applied federal law.washington,at.after acknowledging conflicting interpretations of adjudicated on the merits among the circuits,we found it unnecessary to decide the question because washington petition lacked merit under either the aedpa unreasonable application test or de novo review.see id.at.see also leka portuondo,cir finding it unnecessary to decide which level of deference to apply,because even under aedpa deference,the state court decision rejecting leka constitutional claim was unreasonable.
but this is not a case like washington or leka.sellan sixth amendment claim is a forceful state law argument that sellan counsel failed to raise on direct appeal is quite strong,see post,part iii,and we have held that failure by a state prisoner attorney to raise a particularly strong state law claim on direct appeal may constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.see mayo henderson,cir holding on habeas that petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel when appellate counsel failed to raise a rosario claim that would require per se reversal under prevailing new york case law.accordingly,were we to review sellan sixth amendment claim de novo,we might well be inclined to grant the writ.
by contrast,were we to review the relevant state court decision under the deferential standards now prescribed by aedpa,it is plain that sellan would not be entitled to the writ.indeed,as discussed below,see post part iii,the sixth amendment does not require that all colorable state law arguments be raised on direct appeal.see jameson coughlin,cir holding that counsel made a reasonable,strategic decision not to raise an argument based upon state law before the new york appellate division but see mayo,at finding ineffective assistance of counsel when appellate counsel failed to raise a rosario claim that would require per se reversal under prevailing new york case law.under the circumstances of sellan case,the state court did not unreasonably apply relevant federal law when it held that appellate counsel failure to raise the gallagher issue did not amount to a sixth amendment violation.
in short,whether aedpa deference applies here is all but.to decide whether we must apply aedpa deference,we must reach and resolve the question left open in washington and,whether a state court decision as to a particular federal claim can constitute an adjudication on the merits within the meaning of aedpa even when the state court does not explicitly refer to the federal claim or to relevant federal case law.
the district court agreed with our conclusion that the level of deference would determine the outcome,albeit with a slightly different emphasis 
u nder the old standard of habeas review,it may fairly be concluded that petitioner appellate counsel performance was inadequate.whether the second department denial of petitioner application for a writ of error coram nobis,based on appellate counsel failure to raise the issue of inconsistent verdicts,was unreasonable under aedpa new standard of review presents a much closer question.
because we conclude that the law was clearly established and because we,like the district court,can not conclude that the outcome would be the same with or without aedpa deference,we must consider whether aedpa unreasonable application test applies 
section d unreasonable application test is triggered when a federal claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state court.thus,the application of d turns on the meaning of adjudicated on the merits more specifically,on whether a federal claim is adjudicated on the merits when the state court decision that disposes of it neither discusses the claim nor references federal law.
we begin with the statutory text.when congress uses a term of art such as adjudicated on the merits,we presume that it speaks consistently with the commonly understood meaning of this term.see walters metropolitan ed,d.adjudicated on the merits has a well settled meaning a decision finally resolving the parties claims,with res judicata effect,that is based on the substance of the claim advanced,rather than on a procedural,or other,ground.see,semtek int l,lockheed martin,d noting one definition of an on the merits adjudication as one that actually passes directly on the substance of a particular claim before the court internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.see also,black law dictionary ed adjudication.the legal process of resolving a dispute the process of judicially deciding a case.judgment.adjudicate.to rule upon judicially.adjudge.webster third new int l dictionary adjudicate to settle finally the rights and duties of the parties to a court case on the merits of issues raised enter on the records of a court a final judgment,order,or decree of sentence.
nothing in the phrase adjudicated on the merits requires the state court to have explained its reasoning process.nowhere does the statute make reference to the state court process of reasoning.see aycox lytle,cir.as the fourth circuit has explained,when a state court fails to articulate the rationale underlying its rejection of a petitioner claim,and when that rejection is on the merits,the federal court will focus its review on whether the state court ultimate decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent.see bell jarvis,cir,petition for cert.filed.
in sum,the plain meaning of d dictates our holding for the purposes of aedpa deference,a state court adjudicate s a state prisoner federal claim on the merits when it disposes of the claim on the merits,and reduces its disposition to judgment.when a state court does so,a federal habeas court must defer in the manner prescribed by d to the state court decision on the federal if the state court does not explicitly refer to either the federal claim or to relevant federal case law.
we recognize that a state court explanation of the reasoning underlying its decision would ease our burden in applying the unreasonable application or contrary to tests.see aycox,at noting that the state court explanation of its reasoning would avoid the risk that we might misconstrue the basis for the determination,and consequently diminish the risk that we might conclude the action unreasonable at law or under the facts at hand bell,at.however,the absence of an explanation does not absolve us from performing the same task.in the absence of an explicit statement in the text that congress intended the presence or absence of reasoning to determine which standard of deference to apply,we have no warrant to ignore a clear congressional mandate.cruz miller,cir w e are determining the reasonableness of the state courts decision,d,not grading their papers.
our conclusion is fully consistent with the teaching that federal habeas courts should be wary of impos ing on state courts the responsibility for using particular language in every case in which a state prisoner presents a federal claim.coleman thompson,d we encourage state courts to express plainly,in every decision potentially subject to federal review,the grounds upon which their judgments rest,but we will not impose on state courts the responsibility for using particular language in every case in which a state prisoner presents a federal claim.if we were to infer that an unconscionable breakdown occurred herein because the appellate division issued a summary affirmance rather than a written opinion,not only would this reflect doubt regarding the capabilities of the new york courts as fair and competent forums for the adjudication of federal constitutional rights,but this would also place us in the position of dictating to state courts that they must issue opinions explicitly addressing the issues presented or else face second guessing by the federal courts.the supreme court has pointedly instructed us that we have no power to tell state courts how they must write their opinions.capellan riley,cir citing coleman,at.
our conclusion is consistent not only with the plain meaning of aedpa,but also with the position taken by a number of our sister circuits.see bell,at cir.en banc neal puckett,cir defining adjudication on the merits to be a substantive,rather than a procedural,decision hennon cooper,cir posner,recognizing that to condition reasonableness or unreasonableness on the quality of a state court reasoning,rather than its result would place the federal court in just the kind of tutelary relation to the state courts that the recent amendments are designed to end,cert.denied,d aycox,at cir.holding that an adjudication on the merits is a substantive,rather than a procedural,resolution of a federal claim and that a federal court must apply aedpa deference to the result of a state court decision,even if the reasoning is not expressly stated.mercadel cain,cir holding that a denial of a federal claim in state court was procedural,and not on the merits,and therefore declining to apply aedpa deference 
in his concurring opinion in washington schriver,judge calabresi urged this circuit to adopt the rule that the standard of review should indeed be applied in cases like this,that is,in which state courts have rejected a petitioner federal constitutional claim without specifically addressing it even if only by citing to federal case law or to state court decisions that apply federal law.washington,at calabresi,concurring.rather than justifying this proposed rule on the basis that well articulated reasoning avoids the risk that federal courts will misconstrue the basis for a decision,or that it would ease our burden,he argues that denying aedpa deference to summary decisions on federal claims is actually advantageous to extremely busy state court judges.by deciding not to address federal questions presented to them,state courts could simply assign this difficult burden to the federal courts,secure in the knowledge that federal courts,with their greater expertise,would address the federal questions de novo.see id.at.we are not persuaded.
judge calabresi interpretation of d adjudicated on the merits requirement,which does not purport to rest on any textual basis,could lead to deleterious substantive consequences.a rule that would apply aedpa deference only when a state court articulates its reasoning or cites federal law could encourage state prisoners to press their federal claims in state court in an essentially cursory enough to exhaust state remedies and to avoid default or waiver,but not too the hope that the state court will not refer to or engage in any lengthy discussion of their federal claims,thus entitling the prisoner to de novo consideration of these claims on federal habeas review.such a rule would have the practical effect of shunting serious arguments as to state claims to state court,and serious arguments as to federal claims to federal court,and would thus be at odds with the animating spirit of aedpa which respects the state court adjudication of all claims.see,cong.rec,statement of hatch aedpa deference simply ends the improper review of state court decisions.after all,state courts are required to uphold the constitution and to faithfully apply federal laws.the notion that state courts may absolve themselves of their duty to decide federal questions has no basis in the law.under the supremacy clause,state courts are obligated to apply and adjudicate federal claims fairly presented to them.see const.art.vi cl.testa katt.finally,judge calabresi position is at odds with much of the supreme court habeas jurisprudence,see,picard connor,d describing the exhaustion of state remedies doctrine as,inter alia,designed to give the state an initial opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of its prisoners federal rights internal quotation marks omitted.
we adopt the fifth circuit succinct articulation of the analytic steps that a federal habeas court should follow in determining whether a federal claim has been adjudicated on the merits by a state court.as the fifth circuit has explained,w e determine whether a state court disposition of a petitioner claim is on the merits by considering what the state courts have done in similar cases whether the history of the case suggests that the state court was aware of any ground for not adjudicating the case on the merits and whether the state court opinion suggests reliance upon procedural grounds rather than a determination on the merits.mercadel cain,cir.
applying this test,there can be no doubt that sellan claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was adjudicated on the merits by the second department.although it denied sellan motion for a writ of coram nobis without referring explicitly to the sixth amendment or relevant federal case law,the appellate division indicated that sellan ineffective assistance of counsel claim was denied.there is no basis for believing that the appellate division rejected the claim on grounds.accordingly,we conclude that the appellate division adjudication was on the merits,and that we must therefore review that court decision to deny sellan sixth amendment claim under the deferential standards prescribed in d.we now turn to that inquiry.
iii.applying the unreasonable application test 
we now address whether the appellate division unreasonably applied strickland to the facts of sellan case at the outset,we observe that the constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel extends to appellate counsel.see evitts lucey,d.
to show that his appellate counsel representation was ineffective under strickland,sellan must establish that the attorney representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and the deficient representation prejudiced the defense.see strickland,at.under d,we must determine not whether the state court was incorrect or erroneous in rejecting sellan ineffective assistance claim,but whether it was objectively unreasonable in doing so.see williams,at,for the court,part ii.for an application to be objectively unreasonable,we have held that s ome increment of incorrectness beyond error is required the increment need not be great otherwise habeas relief would be limited to state
