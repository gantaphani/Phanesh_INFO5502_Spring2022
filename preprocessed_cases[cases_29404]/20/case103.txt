petitioner yoderny pena was convicted of murder in massachusetts state court.after the state court upheld his conviction on appeal,pena filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,based on alleged violations of his fifth and sixth amendment rights.the district court denied the petition.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court decision.
facts background 
on march,pena killed his girlfriend by stabbing her times.five months later,he turned himself in to the police.at trial,pena acknowledged that he had killed the victim.the defense contended,however,that pena was mentally impaired at the time of the murder and therefore incapable of forming the mental state required to commit murder.
the defense only witness was rebecca brendel,a psychiatrist,who testified to pena mental illness based on her review of pena medical records and interviews she had with pena and his sister.relying on her record review and observations,she concluded that pena suffered from a chronic and severe mental illness on the day of the killing and expressed serious doubt whether pena could form the intent required for murder on the day he killed his girlfriend.pena dickhaut,rwz,wl,at.
brendel testimony did not convince the jury,which returned a verdict of murder based on deliberate premeditation and on extreme atrocity or cruelty.the court denied pena motion for a new trial,and the supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc upheld the conviction on appeal.thereafter,pena filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court 
his original habeas petition raised seven issues,but pena abandoned all but two of them in the brief he submitted to the district court,in which he argued that the prosecutor improperly commented on his failure to testify in violation of the fifth amendment.he also raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the basis that his attorney inadvertently failed to produce certain medical records to the prosecution during discovery,which prevented her from questioning brendel about them at trial.pena raised,and the sjc rejected,both of these arguments on direct review.the district court held that the sjc determination of these issues was not unreasonable and denied the petition for habeas relief.
ii.analysis 
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,a habeas petitioner must show that the challenged state court adjudication was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or that the decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.d see also morgan dickhaut,cir.in this context,unreasonable means some increment of incorrectness beyond error.morgan,at internal quotation marks omitted.this standard is highly deferential to the state court.burt titlow,wl,at,per curiam.it requires the petitioner to show that the state court ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.id.alteration in original internal quotation mark omitted.
a district court decision to deny or grant a habeas petition under is subject to de novo review.morgan,at.accordingly,like the district court,we must determine whether the state court decision was unreasonable under the standard set forth in aedpa.stephens hall,cir.
fifth amendment violation 
pena argues that the state court proceedings violated the fifth amendment because the prosecutor improperly commented on pena failure to testify.it is that the fifth amendment forbids comment by the prosecution on the accused silence.gomes brady,cir alteration in original quoting griffin california.to determine whether a petitioner is entitled to collateral relief,f irst,we determine whether the comment offended the fifth amendment by insinuating improperly that the defendant failure to testify was evidence of guilt.id.citing griffin,at.second,we ascertain whether the comment had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict such that reversal is warranted.id.quoting brecht abrahamson.
in its closing argument,the prosecution addressed the defense argument that there was no evidence of motive 
two people are close to each other,they have an argument and one of them ends up dead.well,one of them will never be able to tell us why it happened,will she celines carabello,obviously,can never tell us.the defendant is the only one who knows why he did it.he the only one who knows why he got so enraged that he had to kill 
at this point,defense counsel objected and the court sustained the objection.the prosecutor continued with his closing argument,and immediately after he concluded the court issued the following curative instruction to the jury 
members of the jury,counsel stated that the defendant is the only one who knows,made reference in that regard.the defendant,as i will instruct you later,has an absolute right not to testify in this case,and it is improper to comment on that right to remain silent.you are to disregard that portion of the prosecutor closing argument.
during jury instructions,the court again emphasized that pena had an absolute right not to testify,and instructed the jury not to draw any adverse inference against the defendant because he did not testify.
on direct appeal,the sjc found that the impropriety of the prosecutor remark was a close question,but concluded that the prosecutor did not intend his comment to be understood as a comment on pena failure to testify commonwealth pena.the sjc also found that the judge prompt and thorough instructions here were sufficiently clear and complete to negate any possible prejudice to the defendant.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
on habeas review,the district court remarked that the question of the comment impropriety was indeed close,and i f it were deciding the issue in the first instance,it might reach a different conclusion.pena,wl,at.but under the deferential standard of d,the district court concluded that the sjc holding was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,federal law.id.moreover,the district court agreed with the sjc that any error was harmless.id.it observed that t he reference to pena silence was brief and immediately interrupted by objection it did not form a major theme of the prosecutor argument and the court instructions to the jury were prompt and thorough.id.accordingly,the district court found that pena has failed to show that the error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the verdict against him.id.quoting brecht,at.
the district court was correct on both points.the fact that the district court disagreed with the sjc on the propriety of the remark does not mean the sjc determination was unreasonable for the purposes of review.in fact,this court has explained that if it is a close question whether the state decision is in error,then the state decision can not be an unreasonable application of federal law.morgan,at internal quotation marks omitted.under the deferential standard of d,the district court correctly allowed the sjc decision to stand.
furthermore,we agree with both the sjc and the district court that the error,if any,was harmless.this court has repeatedly held that a strong,explicit and thorough curative instruction to disregard improper comments by the prosecutor is sufficient to cure any prejudice from prosecutorial misconduct.united states rodriguez,cir citing united states riccio,cir.the court instructions here were more than sufficient.indeed,we have found that even without a contemporaneous curative instruction,standard jury instructions alone can be sufficient to mitigate the prejudice of an improper comment if the comment was an isolated instance of misconduct and the evidence against the defendant was compelling.gomes,at.here,as the district court pointed out,the challenged comment was brief and quickly interrupted,and the prosecution case rested on the substantial evidence it presented at trial,not on an impermissible inference drawn from pena silence.given the strength of the c
