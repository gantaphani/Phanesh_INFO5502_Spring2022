our review on remand is limited to whether the pennsylvania supreme court unreasonably applied united states supreme court precedent in finding no constitutional defect in the jury instructions and verdict form employed in the sentencing phase of abu jamal trial.see d williams taylor.pursuant to the supreme court order,we consider this question in light of spisak and will examine whether the verdict form and jury instructions in the present case are distinguishable from those at issue in spisak such that,taken together,they clearly brought about a substantial probability the jury believed it was precluded from considering any mitigating circumstance not found unanimously.mills,at.
under the standard for habeas relief established by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,a state prisoner application for a writ of habeas corpus will be denied unless the adjudication of a claim in state court proceedings resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
under the first clause of d,a decision is contrary to supreme court precedent if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by th e court on a question of law,or if the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at a result opposite to the court.williams,at.here,the pennsylvania supreme court correctly identified mills as the applicable supreme court precedent,and the facts at issue are not materially indistinguishable from those in mills.the pennsylvania supreme court decision was consequently not contrary to mills.see williams,at.
accordingly,we consider only the second clause of d,and must determine whether the pennsylvania supreme court decision to deny abu jamal mitigation instruction claim involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d,in mills.under d s unreasonable application clause a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.williams,at see schriro landrigan,the question under aedpa is not whether a federal court believes the state court determination was incorrect but whether that determination was unreasonable a substantially higher threshold.the supreme court has instructed that,in making this inquiry,we should ask whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.williams,at.
in spisak,the supreme court found no violation of mills and consequently concluded the state court decision at issue,reaching the same conclusion,was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states in mills.at quoting d alteration in original.accordingly,consistent with the supreme court order to reconsider in light of spisak,we first evaluate whether a mills violation has occurred,and then proceed to examine whether the pennsylvania supreme court application of mills was objectively unreasonable under the second clause of d.
in mills,the supreme court vacated a death sentence after finding there was a substantial probability that reasonable jurors,upon receiving the judge instructions in this case,and in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed,well may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all jurors agreed on the existence of a particular such circumstance.at.the court held the constitution proscribes imposition of the death penalty if members of the jury could reasonably believe they are precluded from considering mitigating evidence unless the jury unanimously agrees the mitigating circumstance has been proven to exist.id.at,see also mckoy north carolina,mills requires that each juror be permitted to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence when deciding the ultimate question whether to vote for a sentence of death.
the verdict form at issue in mills included a list of potentially mitigating circumstances,and spaces for the jury to check yes or no after each circumstance.preceding the list,the form read b ased upon the evidence we unanimously find that each of the following mitigating circumstances which is marked yes has been proven to exist and each mitigating circumstance marked no has not been proven mills,at appendix to the opinion of the court.next,the form read b ased on the evidence we unanimously find that it has been proven that the mitigating circumstances marked yes outweigh the aggravating circumstances,and provided spaces where the jury could mark either yes or no.id.at.thus,the instructions,together with the forms,told the jury to mark yes on the list of mitigating factors only if the jury unanimously concluded that the particular mitigating factor had been proved,and to consider in its weighing analysis only those mitigating factors marked yes.spisak.at.accordingly,the court found the jury was not free to consider all relevant evidence in mitigation as they balanced aggravating and mitigating circumstances,but only mitigating evidence found unanimously to exist mills,at.the mills court conceded that a constitutional construction of the jury instructions and verdict form is plausible,id.at,but remanded for resentencing because there was at least a substantial risk that the jury was misinformed,id.at,and had reasonably interpreted the jury instructions and verdict form to preclude consideration of mitigating circumstances not found unanimously,see id.at under our cases,the sentencer must be permitted to consider all mitigating evidence.the possibility that a single juror could block such consideration,and consequently require the jury to impose the death penalty,is one we dare not risk.
we conclude the verdict form and jury instructions in this case likewise created a substantial probability the jury believed it was precluded from finding a mitigating circumstance that had not been unanimously agreed upon.in relevant part,the first page of the verdict form used in abu jamal trial stated 
we,the jury,unanimously sentence the defendant to 
life imprisonment.
to be used only if the aforesaid sentence is death 
we,the jury,have found unanimously at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance.the aggravating circumstance s.
x one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances.the aggravating circumstance s 
the mitigating circumstance s 
the second page listed ten potentially aggravating circumstances a j.a third page listed eight potentially mitigating circumstances each of the potential aggravating or mitigating circumstance listed had a space next to it for the jury to place a checkmark if it found the aggravating or mitigating circumstance to exist.on the third and final page,there were twelve spaces for each juror to sign his or her name,and each did.the instructions given to the jury provided,in part 
members of the jury,you must now decide whether the defendant is to be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.the sentence will depend upon your findings concerning aggravating and mitigating circumstances.the crimes code provides that a verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance,or if the jury unanimously finds one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances.
the verdict must be a sentence of life imprisonment in all other cases.
the c ommonwealth has the burden of proving aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.the defendant has the burden of proving mitigating circumstances,but only by a preponderance of the evidence.this is a lesser burden of proof than beyond a reasonable doubt.a preponderance of the evidence exists where one side is more believable than the other side 
now,the verdict is for you,members of the jury.remember and consider all of the evidence giving it the weight to which it is entitled.remember that you are not merely recommending a punishment.the verdict you return will actually fix the punishment at death or life imprisonment.remember again that your verdict must be unanimous.it can not be reached by a majority vote or by any percentage.it must be the verdict of each and everyone sic of you.
remember that your verdict must be a sentence of death if you unanimously find at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances.or,if you unanimously find one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances.in all other cases,your verdict must be a sentence of life imprisonment.
it is substantially probable the verdict form first page,especially w e,the jury,have found unanimously one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances,was read by the jury to mean that both aggravating and mitigating circumstances must be found unanimously.the jury instructions read similarly,stating the crimes code provides that a verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance,or if the jury unanimously finds one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances.and the portion of the form where the jury was instructed to identify any mitigating circumstances found the mitigating circumstance s.was introduced by the words w e,the jury,have found unanimously.moreover,the instructions throughout and repeatedly emphasized unanimity.in light of the language and parallel structure of the form and instructions in relation to aggravating and mitigating circumstances,it is notable that neither the verdict form nor the judge charge said or in any way suggested that the jury should apply the unanimity requirement to its findings of aggravating but not mitigating circumstances.this absence is also notable because the trial court distinguished between the two with respect to the proper burden of proof the jury should apply.
we conclude the verdict form together with the jury instructions read that unanimity was required in the consideration of mitigating circumstances and that there is a substantial probability the jurors believed they were precluded from independent consideration of mitigating circumstances in violation of mills.we now compare the instructions at issue in spisak with the verdict form and jury charge here to determine whether our conclusion is consistent with spisak.
in spisak the supreme court evaluated a sixth circuit decision holding a habeas petitioner sentencing instructions unconstitutional.the supreme court found the forms and instructions used in the sentencing phase of spisak trial differ ed significantly,spisak.at,from those at issue in mills such that mills was not violated and consequently the state court decision upholding the forms and instructions was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states in mills,id.at alteration in original quoting.d.in spisak trial,the jury found aggravating circumstances prior to,and separately from,the sentencing phase of the trial when the jury was directed to consider mitigating circumstances.at spisak sentencing hearing,the trial judge instructed the jury that the aggravating factors they would consider were the specifications that the jury had found proved beyond a reasonable doubt at the guilt phase of the trial essentially,that each murder was committed in a course of conduct including other crimes,and,for two of the murders,that the murder was committed with the intent to evade apprehension or punishment for another offense.id.at.the judge then explained what a mitigating factor was,listed examples,and informed the jury they should consider any other mitigating circumstances relevant to the issue of whether the defendant should be sentenced to death.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the judge then instructed the jury on how it should reach its verdict 
y ou,the trial jury,must consider all of the relevant evidence raised at trial,the evidence and testimony received in this hearing and the arguments of counsel.from this you must determine whether,beyond a reasonable doubt,the aggravating circumstances,which spisak has been found guilty of committing in the separate counts are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors present in this case.
if all twelve members of the jury find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance in each separate count outweighs the mitigating factors,then you must return that finding to the court.
on the other hand,if after considering all of the relevant evidence raised at trial,the evidence and the testimony received at this hearing and the arguments of counsel,you find that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances which spisak has been found guilty of committing in the separate counts outweigh the mitigating factors,you will then proceed to determine which of two possible life imprisonment sentences to recommend to the court.
id.at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.two sets of verdict forms were made available to the jury.one read 
we the jury in this case do find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance which the defendant was found guilty of committing was sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors present in this case.
we the jury recommend that the sentence of death be imposed

we the jury do find that the aggravating circumstances which the defendant was found guilty of committing are not sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors present in this case.
we the jury recommend that the defendant be sentenced to life imprisonment 
after reviewing the jury instructions and the language of the verdict forms,the supreme court found that 
the instructions and forms made clear that,to recommend a death sentence,the jury had to find,unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt,that each of the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating circumstances.but the instructions did not say that the jury must determine the existence of each individual mitigating factor unanimously.neither the instructions nor the forms said anything about how or even whether the jury should make individual determinations that each particular mitigating circumstance existed.they focused only on the overall balancing question.and the instructions repeatedly told the jury to conside r all of the relevant evidence.
spisak.at alteration in original citation omitted.based on these findings,the court concluded 
in our view the instructions and verdict forms did not clearly bring about,either through what they said or what they implied,the circumstance that mills found critical,namely,a substantial possibility sic that reasonable jurors,upon receiving the judge instructions in this case,and in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed,well may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all jurors agreed on the existence of a particular such circumstance.
id.at quoting mills,at.
the commonwealth claims the instructions examined in spisak are virtually identical to the language at issue here,which must therefore also be read to address only the final balancing question.the commonwealth sees equivalence in i f all twelve members of the jury find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance in each separate count outweighs the mitigating factors,spisak.at,and w e,the jury,have found unanimously one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances,from abu jamal verdict form.thus,the commonwealth contends the verdict form first page does not read that both aggravating and mitigating circumstances must be found unanimously in violation of mills.
we disagree.the identified language of unanimity at issue in spisak addressed only how the jury should weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances,not how to find either individual aggravating or mitigating circumstances.spisak.at.the forms and instructions in spisak contained no language whatsoever about how or even whether the jury should make individual determinations that each particular mitigating circumstance existed.id.at.
the verdict form and judge instructions used in the sentencing phase of abu jamal trial are materially different and easily distinguished from those at issue in spisak.by contrast with spisak,the identified language of unanimity here indisputably addresses more than the final balancing of aggravating and mitigating factors.we,the jury,have found unanimously,directly refers to one or more aggravating circumstances,and in the absence of any instruction or even suggestion to the contrary,it is substantially probable the jury applied the unanimity requirement to mitigating circumstances as well.when read naturally,spisak.at,in the context of the form and instructions,there is a substantial probability the word unanimously was understood by the jury to modify and refer to the finding of both aggravating and mitigating circumstances 
moreover,by further contrast with spisak,the form and instructions required the jury to make individual determinations that certain identified mitigating circumstances existed and said or implied,at,that these determinations must be made unanimously.the verdict form at issue in this case required the jury to select any mitigating circumstances found from a list of potentially mitigating circumstances as discussed,the list is accompanied by spaces for a checkmark after each potential circumstance.the trial judge instructed the jury to identify each mitigating circumstance it found and considered in its weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances 
the mitigating circumstances appear on the third page here.they run from a little a to a little letter h.and whichever ones you find there,you will put an x mark or check mark and then,put it on the front here at the bottom of the first page,which says mitigating circumstances.
in spisak the jury had already determined the existence of aggravating circumstances at the guilt phase,separately from and before the sentencing phase of the trial.here,the form and instructions required the jury to make individual determinations regarding both mitigating and aggravating circumstances contemporaneously during the penalty phase.the verdict form introduced the list of potential mitigating circumstances with the list of aggravating circumstances under one heading reading aggravating and mitigating circumstances.the jury was instructed identically as to each list the parallel structure of the form in relation to aggravating and mitigating circumstances reads that findings as to each should be made similarly.see mills,at w e presume that,unless instructed to the contrary,the jury would read similar language throughout the form consistently.additionally,the trial judge distinguished between mitigating and aggravating circumstances with respect to the proper standard of proof applicable to each this reinforced the apparent similitude with respect to the finding of mitigating and aggravating circumstances,increasing the risk that the jury was misinformed,id.at,and impermissibly limited in its consideration of mitigating evidence.accordingly,unlike the jury in spisak,the jury here was required to specify not only the aggravating circumstances it found but also mitigating circumstance
