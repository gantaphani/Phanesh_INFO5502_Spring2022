jacques robidoux was convicted in massachusetts state court for the murder of his son for which he is serving a life sentence.he now seeks review of the district court denial of his federal petition for habeas corpus.the central question is whether his trial counsel,francis,provided competent representation.a brief summary of background events and earlier proceedings is a preface to several difficult legal issues 
robidoux father led a religious sect that included robidoux and his wife,karen.one of his father beliefs was that a number of ordinary institutions,including the legal system,the medical system,and mainstream religion,were invalid indeed,among satan seven counterfeit systems and members of the sect were instructed to eschew doctors and medicines.
on april,robidoux son,samuel,was born without complication to his wife karen.samuel was healthy he was described by family members as active and robust in january,when he was eight months old,he was reported to eat willingly anything that was put in front of him and he was able to sit and had begun walking by grabbing onto furniture.
in early march,one of robidoux sisters claimed to receive a leading what the sect deemed a revelation from god to live life in a certain manner that karen was to nurse samuel for ten minutes on each breast every hour and eliminate all other sources of food from samuel diet.this regime,endorsed by robidoux father,was adopted by robidoux and his wife.
in consequence,samuel began to fail from lack of proper nourishment.samuel deterioration was manifest and its dreadful character and his suffering were portrayed at the later trial but robidoux and karen did not take samuel to a doctor or relax his dietary restrictions.rather,robidoux called a special meeting of the sect in late april to pray in the hope of improving samuel condition.
the next day,robidoux informed the sect of samuel death.he concealed the body in the bulkhead of a sister home and months later buried it in baxter state park in maine.the police learned of events from an of the sect and recovered samuel remains about a year after the secret burial.a state grand jury in massachusetts indicted robidoux for murder his wife was indicted for murder.robidoux was tried,separately from karen,in a trial in june,who had practiced law in massachusetts for nearly forty years,served as trial counsel for robidoux.
at trial,main defense was to argue that starvation was not the proven cause of death.robidoux expert witness,a pediatric forensic pathologist,testified that samuel may have died from any number of causes other than starvation.for the state,maine chief medical examiner testified that samuel cause of death was severe malnutrition due to starvation a forensic anthropologist pointed to abnormalities in samuel bones consistent with malnutrition and a pediatrician described samuel deterioration as consistent with malnutrition.
robidoux himself chose to testify,admitting some facts helpful to the prosecution but also offering statements that might induce some sympathy.he admitted seeing adverse changes in samuel after the dietary restrictions began and conceded that samuel deteriorating health was based on his not getting enough nourishment.however,robidoux denied any intent to harm the child,saying that the death was a product of mistakes and misunderstandings,and he took responsibility for samuel death,saying that t he buck stops here.
during his closing argument,attempted to turn robidoux candor to the defense advantage,arguing that robidoux was courageously attempting to take the bullet for the rest of the family.implored the jury not to let robidoux become the scapegoat for the prosecution,but rather to judge the man.he concluded his closing statement suggesting that robidoux did not cause samuel death,that the cause of death remained debatable,and that,given his candor,robidoux was no hardened criminal.
on june,one day after the case went to the jury,the jury found robidoux guilty of first degree murder by reason of extreme atrocity or cruelty,and on that same day,the trial court sentenced robidoux to life imprisonment.robidoux ultimately filed two motions for relief both were denied by the trial judge.
the first,prepared shortly after the verdict by,was a motion for a required finding of not guilty or for a new trial it alleged,inter alia,that the judge failed properly to charge the jury on massachusetts third prong malice element,discussed below.the second motion,prepared in by new counsel for robidoux,was also for a new trial,and charged,inter alia,that had provided inadequate representation.the second motion included three affidavits pertinent here.
one was by a psychologist who gave his opinion that robidoux was unable to appreciate or understand that it was wrong to deprive his son of solid food,although he admitted that he had never interviewed robidoux a second affidavit was by robidoux himself,who stated that discussed with him the various ways to try his case,including the insanity defense,but that there was simply no way that robidoux would talk to a doctor or a psychotherapist prior to the trial because of his religious beliefs.
the third affidavit was by the director of the new england institute for religious research,who had been the guardian ad litem in the care and protection case brought by massachusetts against the sect.based on interviews with robidoux and other materials,the affiant gave his opinion that undue influence was being exercised over robidoux by his father and other sect members that made it impossible for counsel to present an adequate defense.
in rejecting the motion,the state trial judge found that trial counsel had properly defended the case.the judge said that,based on her own observation of robidoux in court and the cogency of his answers and trial testimony,he was entirely competent to stand trial.the trial judge also had earlier said that robidoux rambling motion to represent himself described in more detail below was a tactic to secure a delay.on direct appeal,the sjc upheld robidoux conviction.
robidoux then sought federal habeas relief,which the federal district court in turn denied.robidoux,civ.rgs,wl.however,the court granted a certificate of appealability,c,as to whether had provided ineffective assistance in failing to request a mental evaluation and a competency hearing on robidoux motion,we expanded the certificate to include trial counsel failure to press a defense based on insanity or diminished capacity.
all three of these issues were addressed by the sjc on the merits and the claims were rejected indeed,the sjc affirmed that robidoux had been competent to stand trial.customarily,where the state court has addressed the constitutional issues and applied standards at least as generous to the defendant as those imposed by the federal constitution,federal review is limited in two respects by the current habeas statute.
first,as to law or the application of legal standards to settled facts,habeas relief can not be granted unless the defendant shows that the state court decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.d.second,if the issue is one of fact,the defendant must show that it was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the record before it.id.d see also e clear and convincing evidence standard 
robidoux competency.each of the three certified questions on appeal concerns representation rather than robidoux competence to stand trial.and,while the second motion in state court focused primarily on failure to pursue an insanity defense,robidoux brief in this appeal has shifted the emphasis to failure to seek a competency hearing.robidoux competency itself is not the issue before us,save as evidence as to how it may bear on responsibilities or might furnish a basis for finding a lack of prejudice.
the governing federal standard for all three of robidoux claims is that set forth in strickland,which requires proof both that counsel fell below minimum standards of representation and that there is a reasonable probability that the deficiency altered the outcome of the case.see strickland washington.the choice whether to pursue an insanity or diminished capacity defense turns in part on defense counsel choice of strategy,and for obvious reasons counsel strategy judgments are ordinarily given special deference.see id.at genius pepe,cir,cert.denied.
by contrast,where there are substantial indications that the defendant is not competent to stand trial,counsel is not faced with a strategy choice but has a settled obligation under massachusetts law,commonwealth simpson,commonwealth,and under federal law as well,see,jermyn horn,cir united states boigegrain,cir,cert.denied,to raise the issue with the trial judge and ordinarily to seek a competency examination.
this is perhaps surprising,if stated as an invariable rule,because that course could sometimes be adverse to the client interest the obvious instance is the case of an incompetent defendant with an excellent merits defense.nevertheless,this obligation has been deemed necessary to the dignitary interests of defendants and the integrity of the trial process,see aba criminal justice mental health standards c,at,and if there are exceptions,none has been invoked here.
yet competency in this context is a comparatively narrow concept and must not be confused with broader or different uses of the term.it is not the same as whether the defendant has an insanity or diminished capacity defense on the merits or whether his ideas about how to live or what to believe are common in the community or seem sensible to others.rather the competency insisted on by the courts is a functional concept focusing on the defendant part in the trial.
the two settled requisites of competency are that the defendant understand the nature of the proceedings against him and that he be able to cooperate with counsel in his defense.cooper oklahoma,drope missouri.the understanding required is of the essentials for example,the charges,basic procedure,possible defenses but not of legal sophistication.one of the jobs of counsel and,in limited respects,the judge is to explain matters to the defendant,and it is that understanding that is required.
there is only a single piece of direct evidence to suggest that robidoux might not have understood what he was told.robidoux tendered on the first day of trial and withdrew the next day a long,rambling and judged by conformity to legal principles almost incoherent request to proceed pro se and to change his plea based on some sort of lack of jurisdiction argument.however,the core argument in the motion is one familiar to federal judges,namely,that somehow the government and courts have no legitimate authority over the defendants 
this is a misunderstanding of the law,but it seems to be a common illusion among certain groups alienated from society and is often reflected in doctrinal writings parroted in pleadings.it does not prevent a defendant from knowing that the government has put him on trial,recognizing the procedures to be used,or appreciating advice that lack of authority claims will not constitute an effective defense.thus,
m any litigants articulate beliefs that have no legal support think of tax protesters who insist that wages are not income,that taxes are voluntary,or that only foreigners must pay taxes sometimes these beliefs are sincerely held,sometimes they are advanced only to annoy the other side,but in neither event do they imply mental instability or concrete intellect so deficient that trial is impossible.

robidoux proved in court to be intelligent and articulate in colloquies with the judge and as a witness.nothing in his affidavit shows that he did not understand the proceedings his psychologist affidavit bears only on the insanity defense and the third affidavit simply expresses the view that robidoux may have been unduly influenced in deciding on his defense strategy by others in the sect who contacted him in prison.
as for cooperating with counsel,this does not require that the defendant go along with his lawyer advice,nor do we know that anything robidoux did was against that advice.his brief now suggests that his testimony undercut causation defense but his testimony was not critical to prove what had happened,and his admission to mistakes and acceptance of responsibility for the death appear a shrewd way of indirectly seeking to negate the intent element of the crime,in addition to expressing remorse.
what is more,the question is not whether we think that counsel should have raised the competency issue but whether the sjc was unreasonable in concluding that in the circumstances he did not have to do so.d.we can hardly find the sjc decision unreasonable when there is little evidence anywhere that robidoux failed to understand the proceedings and virtually none that he was unable to cooperate with counsel.
affirmance could also rest on an alternative ground.even if should have raised the competency issue,the sjc found that robidoux was competent,so it is difficult to see how counsel supposed error could have satisfied the prejudice requirement of strickland.robidoux says that a finding of competence is not subject to deference because it was not based on an evidentiary hearing but rather on the trial judge statement and the sjc inferences,but this is a dubious position.
case law is divided on whether,when,and to what extent lack of an evidentiary hearing in the state court might undercut the deference to state that is due under the habeas statute section d current language contains no requirement of a hearing we found no direct first circuit precedent,but the answer must be that evidentiary hearings can not always be required they are not always required in federal courts either,united states marquardo,cir contempt proceeding and it is far from clear that the state finding here is made unreasonable by the lack of one.
we need not resolve this point because robidoux counsel has not gone beyond the flat assertion,which we reject,that a state court finding gets no deference absent an evidentiary hearing.it is enough to note that the trial judge was familiar with robidoux conduct,conducted colloquies with him in the courtroom,watched him as a witness at trial,and was aware that he had no known diagnosed history of mental illness.nor had there been any complaints from.
insanity defense.next challenged is failure to raise the insanity defense.unless incompetent,robidoux was entitled to decline to assert the defense and to refuse any psychiatric examination to support it.commonwealth murphy,commonwealth federici.robidoux made clear that he did not wish to be examined by doctors.whether he ever told his lawyer expressly not to assert an insanity defense is less clear.
robidoux refusal to be examined would in any event allow,and likely lead,the trial judge to bar robidoux counsel from offering an expert witness of his own.b,c commonwealth guadalupe.if not forbidden,counsel might still have asserted the insanity defense without an expert,commonwealth gaboriault,commonwealth mattson,and urged that robidoux did not appreciate that his withholding of solid food was wrongful.under massachusetts law 
a person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.

but insanity is normally rooted in some recognized mental illness.nothing indicated that robidoux had ever been so diagnosed or even cleanly fit into a standard,recognized category of mental illness.the american psychiatric association diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ed,has ambiguous language on delusional disorder that might or might not be useful to robidoux,id.at,but it is unclear that the volume would even be admissible without an expert.
in this court,robidoux counsel now argues that insanity was patent based on two of robidoux religious illusions that god and prayer,not ordinary nourishment,would protect samuel and in a similar but less disastrous
