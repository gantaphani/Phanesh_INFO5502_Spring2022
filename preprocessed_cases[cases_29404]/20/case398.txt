george wilson appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york david trager,judge,denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,filed pursuant to d.see wilson mazzuca,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,wilson vii.wilson contends that he is entitled to habeas relief because he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel at trial in violation of the sixth amendment to the constitution.see strickland washington,d.because the district court conducted additional in order to adjudicate that claim,this appeal presents a question of first impression for our court is the standard of review prescribed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,for a claim resolved on the merits by a state court displaced when a district court conducts additional in habeas proceedings we hold that aedpa deferential standard of review is not displaced under these circumstances it applies to wilson petition even though the district court conducted additional.applying that standard of review to the state court decision,we conclude that,but for the substantial errors committed by trial counsel,there is a reasonable probability that wilson would not have been convicted.the state court decision to the contrary was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court denying habeas relief and remand the cause.on remand,the district court shall issue a writ of habeas corpus to wilson by the sixtieth calendar day after the issuance of our mandate unless the district attorney of queens county has,by that point,taken concrete and substantial steps expeditiously to retry wilson 
background 
at approximately on december,roger erra was robbed at gunpoint by two men who entered erra scrap metal business in queens,new york.one of the robbers,whom erra later identified as wilson,assaulted him and demanded cash.see trial tr.after the robbery,erra called the police and described the first robber as a tall lighter male black,weighing approximately two hundred thirty pounds.wilson vii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.at the police precinct on the day of the robbery,erra reviewed several photo albums or mug books containing mug shots of people arrested for a variety of felonies,and identified wilson photograph in one of these albums.police were unable to locate or speak with wilson.on october,wilson was arrested for an unrelated extortion at a construction site.the following day,erra picked wilson out of a,and wilson was charged with first and robbery.see id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
state trial proceedings 
wilson was brought to trial before justice charles latorella in new york state supreme court,queens county,in september.during his opening statement,frank ganun,who represented wilson at trial,urged acquittal on the grounds of mistaken identity and insufficient police investigation.in light of the second line of defense,the prosecution argued that,during his opening statement,ganun had open ed the door to erra prior photo identification.trial tr,the trial court was ambivalent,but warned ganun that i f you ask those questions on,i think you will have opened up the door.id.at.
the prosecution first scheduled witness was erra,but erra did not appear,prompting the prosecutor to request a material witness order.at a hearing regarding that application,the trial judge asked the prosecution erra is not only your complaining witness,but he virtually your principal witness and except for peripheral facts,he essentially your only witness is that correct trial tr.the prosecution agreed that it was,and the trial court issued the order.
pursuant to that order,erra testified on september.under direct examination,erra testified that he had chosen wilson out of a and made an identification.on,ganun inquired about the reliability of erra identification,the contours of the police whether the police questioned other witnesses and had made diagrams of the crime erra absence from court.see wilson vii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.ganun also asked erra whether he feared wilson,and erra testified that he did,and was specifically afraid of r eprisals.trial tr.this was the first time the jury heard testimony from erra that he feared that wilson would retaliate against him for testifying.
following ganun of erra,the trial court concluded that,by attacking the reliability of the police investigation in his opening statement and,ganun had opened the door to erra initial identification of wilson photograph at the police precinct.on redirect examination,erra confirmed his initial identification of wilson,responding to the prosecutor questions about mug shot s.see wilson vii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.although both terms conveyed to the jury that wilson had been arrested previously,ganun did not object.when the court inquired about the matter,ganun stated,unfortunately,i probably did hear the word,mug shot.trial tr.the trial court then dealt with the question of how the mug shot itself would be shown to a jury.after initially observing that there is no way that this jury is going to see the booking plate in front of the defendant body,id.at,the trial court asked ganun whether he wanted the plaque to be redacted from the photograph.ganun responded,i want the do want any of the photograph going in.if it goes in,it going to be in over the objection of the defense.id.at.the trial court overruled ganun objection and again asked whether ganun wanted the plaque to be redacted.ganun responded,i do want it redacted.id.at.the trial court then twice confirmed that ganun waived redaction of the photograph.
following erra testimony,the prosecution called a police officer and a detective who participated in the investigation.on of the police officer,ganun introduced an unredacted arrest report from wilson october arrest,which indicated that wilson was arrested for attempt ed grand larceny extortion,menacing with pipes and unlawfully enter ing a construction site.pet r app x see also wilson vii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the prosecution objected to its introduction as a business record,but the trial court overruled the objection,adding the following during a conference 
the court i going to ask the defense,do you really want this in evidence 
ganun absolutely.
the court all right.it your choice.you not asking for redaction or anything else 
ganun no,your honor.
the court that not a problem as long as we all fully understand what we doing here,i sure you do,i not going to ask you what your theory of defense is.all i going to say to you is,i would not let the jury see this in ten million years unless you specifically wanted it.it as simple as that.you realize,of course,that it contains a complaint of certain conduct.it hearsay basically,but if you want it in,i put it in.last chance now,do you want it 
ganun may i look at that one second 
the court okay,what do you want to do 
ganun i want to have it put in evidence.
trial tr.see also wilson vii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
prior to the close of the prosecution case,while ganun was the police detective,the trial court called for a recess and raised sua sponte and on the record the possibility that wilson had received ineffective assistance of counsel.the court stated 
i am becoming increasingly disturbed and i going to put it right on the record,at some of the decisions apparently made by defense in this case and i not going to probe defense theories,i do know what defense has in mind,but i going to tell you right here and now,certain questions are being raised in my mind.
i understand that we have retained counsel.but so far,we have had an opening of the door on the investigation.we have had,although that i could see perhaps it was not anticipated but it happened,and it certainly should have been considered before the opening was made.that number one.
number two,we had a questioning of the complaining witness as to why he did come in which he elicited the answers,as much as i tried to delay it or prevent it,that he was afraid to come in,which was disastrous for the defendant.
then we had the defense putting into evidence,the warrant and order and the supporting affirmation by the,which again did not help the defendant.
then we had several questions today that are going right into areas that i personally,as a defense lawyer,would touch with a fifty foot pole.
i even found it necessary on my own motion,just a few minutes ago,to warn the jury not to draw too many conclusions from the mug book.
i have very serious problems with this case right now.the alarm bells are ringing in my head and i going right on the record.and the question concerns the representation of the defendant.
i sorry,there is no other way i can put it.
trial tr.after delivering these remarks,the trial court stated,under no circumstances would i ever interfere with representation,but there are certain amendment concerns that have arisen in my mind.id.at.the court then asked ganun whether he had a strategy in this trial which encompasses the things that have been done so far id.at.ganun responded that he did,and the trial continued.
after the prosecution closed its case,ganun called four witnesses for the defense,including an alibi witness and a character witness.carolyn younger,the defense character witness,testified about her knowledge of wilson from his involvement in a community organization.ganun asked younger what kind of role wilson played in the organization,and she responded,george wilson is a role model for young adults.trial tr.upon hearing this testimony,the trial court sua sponte gave ganun an opportunity to strike his own question,but he declined.id.at.on,the government inquired whether younger was aware that this defendant was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in,id.at,or of a case involving criminal possession of a weapon,see id.at,or of a conviction for snatch ing a gold chain and beat ing a woman about the face,id.at.younger had not been aware of these incidents.ganun objected to the prosecutor questions about wilson criminal record,but the trial court overruled that objection,explaining that i warned you that if you offered character evidence,it would permit the door to be opened you did this with your eyes open,you had put on a character witness,the door is open.id.at.
both sides delivered their summations on october.relying on evidence that would not have been admissible but for ganun decisions at trial,the prosecution argued that erra testimony was reliable because,in addition to seeing wilson at the crime scene and identifying him in a and in court,erra picked out wilson photograph from the police mug book soon after the robbery occurred,see trial tr,erra feared retaliation from wilson if he testified at trial,see id.at and younger assessment of wilson character should be discounted in light of wilson prior convictions,see id.at.
on october,wilson was convicted of robbery in the second degree.he was subsequently sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of seven and to fifteen years.
ii.proceedings in state court 
in october,wilson moved the trial court to set aside the judgment pursuant to new york criminal procedural law,on the ground that his trial counsel had been ineffective.the trial court denied the motion.on direct appeal to the appellate division of the new york supreme court,second department,wilson pursued claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and insufficiency of the evidence.on may,the appellate division summarily rejected wilson claims and affirmed his conviction.see people wilson,dep t wilson i.with respect to wilson ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the appellate division concluded,without explanation,that the claim was without merit.id.at.on november,the new york court of appeals denied wilson application for leave to appeal the appellate division decision.people wilson,wilson ii.
iii.habeas corpus proceedings in federal court 
on april,wilson filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court.he contended,inter alia,that his trial counsel was ineffective for eliciting testimony from erra that he feared wilson would retaliate against him for testifying opening the attacking the police investigation of the the admission of erra identification of wilson mug shot from a mug book on the day of the robbery not requesting the redaction of wilson mug shot,which showed him with a booking plate hung around his neck,before the photograph was admitted into evidence moving into evidence an unrelated police report documenting wilson october arrest and opening the door to the admission of wilson prior convictions by eliciting testimony from younger regarding wilson good character.
the district court referred the petition to magistrate judge robert levy for a report and recommendation r r.on january,magistrate judge levy submitted his r r,which recommended denying habeas relief.wilson mazzuca,dist.lexis,at,wilson iii.with respect to wilson ineffective assistance of counsel claim,magistrate judge levy concluded that ganun tactical decisions that,in hindsight,might be considered did not run afoul of the sixth amendment,and wilson failed to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice as a result of counsel actions.id.at.in an order filed may,judge trager,after an independent review of the record,adopted the r r in its entirety and denied wilson habeas corpus petition.wilson mazzuca,dist.lexis,at may,wilson iv.
wilson appealed the district court judgment,and on january,another panel of this court vacated the denial of the petition.see wilson mazzuca,cir wilson v.that panel concluded that it was unable to assess with confidence whether strategic considerations accounted for certain acts or omissions by defense counsel that had the effect of substantially strengthening the state otherwise weak case.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,that panel vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded with instructions to give wilson trial counsel an opportunity to explain his performance.id.at see also sparman edwards,cir we believe that a district court facing the question of constitutional ineffectiveness of counsel should,except in highly unusual circumstances,offer the asserted ineffective attorney an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence,in the form of live testimony,affidavits,or briefs.
on remand,the district court referred the petition to magistrate judge levy,who appointed pro bono counsel to represent wilson.judge levy held a hearing on july,at which ganun,wilson trial counsel,testified about his conduct at trial on june,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation the second r r,this time recommending that habeas relief be granted.wilson mazzuca,wl,at,dist.lexis,at june,wilson vi.magistrate judge levy determined that ganun made serious errors that allowed the jury to learn of the otherwise inadmissible photo array id and wilson criminal history and that counsel acts were not the result of a deliberate and reasonably informed trial strategy.id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.these errors,according to the second r r,prejudiced wilson by allowing the jury to learn that an eyewitness had picked wilson out of a photo array the day of the robbery,that wilson had a criminal record,and that the chief prosecution witness was afraid of him.id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.when compared to the serious weaknesses of the prosecution case,magistrate judge levy concluded that defense counsel errors undermine d confidence in the outcome of the trial,id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at quoting strickland,at,and he therefore recommended that the petition be granted.
judge trager declined to adopt the second r see wilson vii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.despite largely agreeing with magistrate judge levy that ganun performance was objectively unreasonable judge trager ruled that wilson suffered no prejudice.specifically,the district court concluded 
a lthough there was no physical evidence connecting defendant to the scene,defendant made no inculpatory statement and erra identification was,these factors,even taken together,would not have created a reasonable doubt given the evidence against petitioner.in light of erra strong identification that was based on a opportunity to see the robbers and that was not undermined on,there is not a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different absent ganun errors.ultimately,one can not defeat something with nothing,especially when the nothing is a weak alibi with no supporting evidence.
id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
pursuant to our disposition in wilson v,jurisdiction was automatically restored by letter from wilson appellate counsel,debevoise plimpton llp,on april,and the clerk of court assigned this case to the present panel in the ordinary course.see wilson v.at.
discussion 
this appeal presents,at the threshold,a question of first impression for our court is aedpa standard of review for a claim resolved on the merits by a state court displaced when a district court conducts additional for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that aedpa standard of review remains in force.with respect to the habeas corpus petition itself,we conclude that it should be granted.it was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law for the state court to conclude that wilson received his sixth amendment right to counsel,or that the outcome reached by the jury in this case is reliable.
aedpa standard of review governs wilson ineffective assistance of counsel claim even though the district court found additional facts in habeas proceedings.
we review a district court decision to grant or deny habeas relief de novo.dolphy mantello,cir.when a state court has adjudicated the merits of petitioner claim,we apply the deferential standard of review established by aedpa,under which we may grant a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court adjudication was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.id.quoting d where,as here,a state court fails to articulate the rationale underlying its rejection of a petitioner claim,and when that rejection is on the merits,the federal court will focus its review on whether the state court ultimate decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent.eze senkowski,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court was uncertain about whether aedpa deferential standard governed its review of wilson ineffective assistance of counsel claim,noting i t is unclear whether deference is still appropriate under aedpa once a federal court has conducted an evidentiary hearing and elicited new evidence that was not before the state court.the second circuit has not answered this question.wilson vii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.the district court decided that the standard of review depended on which prong of strickland was at issue.under strickland,a defendant must demonstrate both that his attorney performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,at,and there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,id.at.with respect to the first performance of district court determined that the evidence elicited at the july,hearing is relevant solely in deciding whether ganun had strategic reasons for his decisions at trial and,therefore,in analyzing strickland first prong,a de novo standard of review is appropriate.wilson vii,wl,at,dist.lexis at.with respect to the second prejudice,the court concluded that the evidence from the july,hearing was irrelevant in deciding whether ganun actions prejudiced defendant.id.accordingly,the district court applied aedpa deference only to strickland prejudice prong.see id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
on appeal,wilson argues that the district court should have reviewed the entirety of his ineffective assistance claim de novo.specifically,wilson contends that i t is impossible to ascertain how the new york state court would have decided his claim for relief if it had the benefit of the testimony elicited years later at the hearing before magistrate judge levy.pet r br.respondent counters that the plain meaning of aedpa statutory language makes clear that aedpa deference governs the claim in its entirety.we agree with respondent.
the standard of review set forth in aedpa is not conditional.it is stated in mandatory relief shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings,d emphases added and these terms do not lose their force because an intervening evidentiary hearing is held in federal court.indeed,the provision of aedpa setting forth the circumstances under which a federal evidentiary hearing can be held,e,does not suggest that holding such a hearing has any impact whatsoever on the standard of review governing habeas claims accordingly,a habeas claim,even if subject to a federal evidentiary hearing,is still a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings,d,and is subject to the highly deferential standard of review established therein,id.
where,as here,the habeas claim is brought under d,a habeas court asks whether there was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,in light of all the facts and whatever facts are discovered during a hearing in federal court subject to the requirements of e a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.the applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.any new evidence uncovered in the federal proceeding is relevant only insofar as it assists the habeas court in determining whether the state court reached an unreasonable application of law 
in reaching this conclusion,we join two of our sister circuits that have considered this question in pecoraro walls,the seventh circuit held 
aedpa authorizes us to upset a state court conviction only if the state courts adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d t his standard is applicable even though the district judge held an evidentiary hearing.the evidence obtained in such a hearing is quite likely to bear on the reasonableness of the state courts adjudication that is true but we do not see why it should alter the standard of federal review.
cir.the fifth circuit reached a similar conclusion in valdez cockrell,explaining 
where a district court elects,in instances not barred by e,to hold an evidentiary hearing,the hearing may assist the district court in ascertaining whether the state court reached an unreasonable determination under either d or d.an evidentiary hearing is not an exercise in futility just because d and e require deference.
with respect to wilson argument that i t is impossible to ascertain how the new york state court would have decided his claim if it had had the benefit of the testimony elicited years later at the hearing before magistrate judge levy,pet r br,we acknowledge that this may be so,but that is not the relevant inquiry under aedpa.in the instant case,our review is limited by statute to whether the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.where,as here,a district court has performed additional,the court must then ask whether the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,in light of any facts.it is clear that federal courts are not being directed to construct and answer an impossible would the state court have decided had additional information been available instead,we are directed to apply the same aedpa standard that would otherwise be in force,now in light of the new information that has been obtained through a e hearing.
accordingly,aedpa deferential standard of review governs wilson claim in its entirety.
ii.the state court denial of wilson claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was an unreasonable application of federal law.
to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment,as noted above,a defendant must demonstrate that his attorney performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,strickland,at.and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,id.at.to satisfy the first performance record must demonstrate that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.id.at.such errors include omissions that can not be explained convincingly as resulting from a sound trial strategy,but instead arose from oversight,carelessness,ineptitude,or laziness.eze,at.under the second prejudice reasonable probability of a different result is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.the prejudice prong can be satisfied even if the errors of counsel can not be shown by a preponderance of the evidence to have determined the outcome.id.
trial counsel performance was objectively unreasonable,and it was an unreasonable application of federal law for the state court to conclude otherwise.
wilson petition notes five alleged errors that he maintains are objectively unreasonable.magistrate judge levy agreed entirely with wilson position,whereas judge trager concluded that only four out of the five purported errors were objectively unreasonable.however,both the magistrate judge and the district judge determined that the performance of ganun,wilson counsel at trial,was objectively unreasonable.our reading of the record supports this conclusion.
as noted above,wilson argues that ganun committed five devastating errors that allowed prejudicial information to cloud the jury.pet r br.listed chronologically,they are eliciting testimony from erra,the complainant and eyewitness,that he feared wilson would retaliate against him for testifying opening the attacking the police investigation of the the admission of the erra identification of wilson mug shot from a mug book on the day of the robbery not objecting to the prosecutor characterization of wilson photograph as a mug shot and not requesting the redaction of wilson mug shot,which showed him with a booking plate hung around his neck moving into evidence an unredacted police report describing wilson october arrest for an armed at a construction site and opening the door to the admission of wilson prior convictions for drug possession and physical harassment by eliciting testimony from younger regarding wilson good character.
first,ganun elicited testimony from only eyewitness to testify at he feared reprisals from wilson.remarkably,after confirming that erra had not been threatened in any manner or in any way,and after stating that his examination was complete,ganun asked erra,w ere you in fear of this defendant,george wilson erra responded,yes.ganun then asked and why were you in fear of this defendant,george wilson erra answered reprisals.trial tr.
at the july,hearing before magistrate judge levy,ganun justified his on the ground that he had wanted to show that erra was a puppet of the police and had thought it was possible that erra would testify that he did not fear reprisals from wilson.wilson vii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.judge trager observed that this possibility seemed unlikely given the eyewitness earlier testimony on,in which he had expressed fear for my family,and fear for myself,id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.nevertheless,judge trager concluded that ganun questioning was not so,given the vagueness of erra earlier testimony,to be completely unreasonable.id.wl,at,dist.lexis,at.we disagree.it was objectively unreasonable for ganun to ask erra whether he feared wilson and even more unreasonable,after erra replied in the affirmative,to ask the question why before ganun elicited this testimony,the jury had not heard any suggestion that fear of wilson accounted for erra failure to appear.to ask these questions on the theory that erra might say that he was not afraid of wilson was reckless and objectively unreasonable 
second,by attacking the police investigation,ganun opened the door to the admission of the eyewitness identification from a photograph array on the day of the robbery.under new york law,evidence that an eyewitness identified wilson from a photograph album on the day of the robbery was inadmissible in the prosecution,but could be used as rebuttal evidence if defense counsel challenged the adequacy of the investigation.wilson vii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at see also people lindsay,it is settled under the law of new york that a witness may not testify regarding a photographic identification of the defendant people hamilton,dep t while a witness is generally not permitted to testify to an extrajudicial identification of a photograph of the defendant,such testimony is appropriate when the defendant opens the door to this type of inquiry during of the witness.internal citations omitted people hines,dep t explaining that the purpose of the rule is to avoid improper bolstering.
ganun was warned by the state trial judge,after he made an opening statement attacking the investigation,of the consequences should he press this argument on.see trial tr.nevertheless,on his of erra,ganun inquired into the adequacy of the investigation,asking,for example,whether diagrams were made,and photographs were taken,of the crime scene.see wilson vii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at trial tr.ganun also asked erra if he knew whether the police had spoken to other possible witnesses.trial tr.at a sidebar held to determine whether the prosecution would be permitted to introduce evidence of the photographic identification to rebut ganun attacks on the adequacy of the investigation,ganun appeared to misunderstand the legal issue.in opposing the prosecution motion to admit the identification,ganun argued 
t he door was open,number one because the statement poor investigation does relate to anything about photographic identification.secondly,your honor,in regard to the of erra,at no time did i go near the issue of photographic identification.
id.at.the trial court responded this door has been opened so wide,i never seen a wider open door.id.at.not surprisingly,the court ruled in favor of admitting the identification.
at the hearing before magistrate judge levy,ganun testified that he thought only questions specifically about the identification would open the door to the admission of that identification.hr g tr,july.this mistaken belief was entirely unreasonable.before erra ever took the stand,the trial court warned ganun that questioning the adequacy of the investigation would trigger the admission of the identification evidence.this warning was more than sufficient to dispel any misunderstanding on ganun part regarding the consequences of challenging the adequacy of the investigation.
third,after the state trial court determined that the identification was admissible,the prosecutor referred multiple times to the photographs of wilson as mug shots,without objection from ganun,before moving the photographs into evidence.wilson vii,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.at that time,the court remarked,there is no way that this jury is going to see the booking plate in front of the defendant body showing a number nycpd that out,that going to be redacted.trial tr.ganun objected to the photographs on the ground that the jury would infer that the photographs were mug shots.the trial court reminded ganun that the prosecution had already referred to the photographs as mug shots without objection.ganun responded that he must not have heard those words.the court then offered defense counsel a chance to redact the photographs,but ganun declined the offer,and the photographs were admitted in unredacted form.
at the hearing before magistrate judge levy,ganun offered no strategic explanation for his failure to object to the characterization of the photograph of wilson as a mug shot,suggesting wilson criminality,or his decision not to redact the portion of the photographs showing wilson booking plate.ganun stated only that he wanted to get on with the case in chief.hr g tr,july.ganun refusal of the trial court offer to redact the photographs,so as to mitigate,even if only slightly,their prejudicial effect,is incomprehensible.as judge trager stated,the fact that the trial court offered to redact the photo
