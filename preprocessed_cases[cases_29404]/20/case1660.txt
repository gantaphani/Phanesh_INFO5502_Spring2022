procedural history 
state proceedings 
the present action began with the petition for discharge williams filed on september.in addition to seeking discharge under section of the sexual psychopath act,williams contended that the application of section violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection.on july,the state circuit court rejected williams constitutional challenges.ja people williams,fy allegan county.cir.july.on june,at the conclusion of a series of evidentiary hearings,it orally denied williams petition.a subsequent written order stated that it was established by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has not recovered from his criminal sexual psychopathy to a degree that he will not be a menace to others.ja.
the michigan court of appeals affirmed.it ruled that the constitutional challenges were without merit and that the circuit court had not clearly erred in denying discharge.see ja people williams.on november,the michigan supreme court denied williams application for leave to appeal.see people williams.
federal collateral proceedings 
after the state circuit court rejected his constitutional claims in,williams filed a petition in federal district court seeking habeas relief under.on january,the district court dismissed the petition,pending final resolution of the state court proceedings.the case was reopened on january,after the michigan supreme court denied williams application for leave to appeal.the district court appointed counsel to review,and amend as necessary,williams petition.williams filed an amended petition on october,claiming that requiring him to seek discharge under section deprived him of his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection.his due process claim had two components.first,he claimed that section failed to satisfy the requirements of constitutional due process because it only required the state to prove a predisposition toward,not a likelihood of,future dangerousness,in conflict with the due process principles established by the supreme court in kansas hendricks,d,a decision upholding the standard for commitment in kansas sexually violent predator act.next,he claimed that even if section did not on its face violate due process,his continued detention did because even under section there was insufficient evidence to support the state circuit court conclusion that he was not entitled to release.his equal protection claim rested on a comparison between the standard for discharge under section and the standard for discharge under the mental health code.the latter,he claimed,was easier to satisfy,resulting in his being treated differently than other similarly situated persons held under the mental health code.the district court referred the case to a magistrate judge on january.
on march,the magistrate judge issued his report and recommendation,concluding that the habeas petition should be denied.ja.williams had ten days to file objections to that report.see b.on march,williams filed a consent motion for an enlargement of time,asking the district court for an additional thirty days to file objections because the issues are novel and complex,the record voluminous,and other matters already scheduled for counsel when the report and recommendation was received will occupy a significant amount of counsel time in the next couple of weeks.ja.the district court granted the motion,giving williams until april,to file objections.ja.
on april,williams filed a second motion for enlargement of time,asking for an additional days,until may,to file objections.ja.the motion stated that counsel needed the extra time o n account of recent illnesses and his trial schedule and to review the implications of the supreme court april,grant of certiorari in kansas crane,d,a case counsel thought had the potential to alter the guiding constitutional principles of involuntary hospitalization ja.williams counsel was unable to speak with williams prior to making this request,but he informed the district court that he was confident williams would not object.ja.on april,the district court denied the motion,stating petitioner counsel has already had one extension of time,and the supreme court grant of certiorari in kansas crane is unlikely to affect the merits of this case.ja.that same day,the district court accepted the magistrate report and recommendation and denied williams petition for habeas relief.ja.
on may,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,williams filed a motion for relief from judgment,for reconsideration of the order denying his second motion for an enlargement of time,and for leave to file objections,which he attached.ja.as grounds for relief,williams argued that his failure to timely file objections was excusable neglect under rule b.williams motion described in greater detail the reasons why counsel had failed to file objections within the time allotted 
undersigned counsel informs the court that he fell ill on two separate occasions in the time between his first and second motions for enlargement.as a result,he lost several days of work.moreover,also during this time a close friend came into the final stage of a terminal illness,which required the undersigned attention in both a personal and representative capacity,resulting in a additional time being diverted from the office.those unexpected events,combined with an already heavy hearings schedule including a trial during this time,and combined further with the unexpected crane development,made it impossible for the undersigned to file william objections within the enlargement of time initially given.
ja.with respect to the potential relevance of crane,williams argued that if the supreme court were to decide in crane that the constitution requires a showing of volitional impairment to prove future dangerousness,that would support williams claim that the quantum of proof of dangerousness required under the sexual psychopath act did not satisfy constitutional due process.ja.finally,williams pointed out that if the district court denied the motion for relief from judgment,he would be barred from any appeal on the merits.ja.
on june,the district court denied williams motion for relief from judgment,for reconsideration of the order denying the second motion for enlargement of time,and for leave to file his objections instanter.ja.the court ruled that williams counsel recent illnesses,his trial schedule and the potential need to review a case before the supreme court did not amount to excusable neglect to justify granting relief under rule b.ja.
williams filed a timely notice of appeal on july.on january,the sixth circuit issued a certificate of appealability,limited to the sole issue of whether the district court properly denied williams motion for relief from judgment and for leave to file objections to the magistrate report and recommendation.
ii.discussion 
legal principles 
in relevant part,federal rule of civil procedure b provides that on motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party from a final judgment for mistake,inadvertence,surprise or excusable neglect.b.where a party seeks relief from a default judgment rule b should be applied equitably and liberally to achieve substantial justice.united coin meter seaboard coastline,cir internal quotations omitted.in deciding whether relief is warranted,three factors are relevant whether the party seeking relief is culpable whether the party opposing relief will be prejudiced and whether the party seeking relief has a meritorious claim or defense.id.at.culpability is framed by the specific language of the rule,a party demonstrates a lack of culpability by demonstrating mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.waifersong,classic music vending,cir.and because rule b mandates such a demonstration,i t is only when the party seeking relief can carry this burden that he will be permitted to demonstrate that he also can satisfy the other two factors the existence of a meritorious defense and the absence of substantial prejudice to the other party.see also weiss paul fire marine ins,cir a party seeking relief must demonstrate first and foremost that the default did not result from his culpable conduct.a district court denial of a rule b motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united coin,at.
application 
culpability of party seeking relief 
we start,as we must,by considering williams culpability.williams contends that the failure to timely file objections was not the result of culpable conduct but of excusable neglect.a party conduct is culpable if it display s either an intent to thwart judicial proceedings or a reckless disregard for the effect of its conduct on those proceedings.amernational indus,cir quoting invst financial group,systems,cir.moreover,although clients are held liable for the acts and omissions of their counsel,see,united states reyes,cir,this court,like many others,has been extremely reluctant to uphold the dismissal of a case or the entering of a default judgment merely to discipline an errant attorney because such a sanction deprives the client of his day in court,see buck united states dep t of agriculture,cir.
the record establishes that in failing to timely file neither williams nor his counsel engaged in any culpable conduct.first,williams failure to timely file objections does not appear to have been willful or the result of carelessness or negligence.see weiss,at.he timely asked for enlargements of time,and the time requested was not extraordinary.his first motion for an enlargement of time,which was granted,was timely filed and sought merely an additional thirty days.the second motion was also timely filed and asked for only an additional days.moreover,the length of time that lapsed between the appointment of williams counsel and the filing of the amended petition,while not irrelevant,does not obviate the need for sufficient time after receiving the magistrate report and recommendation to review the actual report and prepare responsive objections.
nor did williams fail to give reasons for needing additional time.see,wilson cassidy in re cassidy.in both the second motion for an enlargement of time and the motion for relief from judgment,williams cited a number of reasons for needing additional time,including illness,preexisting professional obligations,the supreme court grant of certiorari in kansas crane,the complexity of the issues,the magnitude of the record,and the magistrate reliance on caselaw from other jurisdictions.all of these events were mostly or entirely beyond counsel control,and there is no evidence that any of the claimed reasons were false or frivolous.the respondent asks us to penalize williams for failing to provide the district court with the specific details of his counsel illness or trial schedule,but we do not believe that fact supports a finding of culpability where,as here,he was never asked for such information and the veracity of the information has not been challenged.the respondent also contends,as the district court ruled,that crane had no relevance to williams case.we disagree.the grant of certiorari in crane,presenting and ultimately resolving the issue of what the federal constitution requires a state to demonstrate with respect to a sexual offender lack of control,clearly had the potential to be relevant to williams claims.
finally,williams did not delay seeking relief or filing his objections.he filed his motion for relief,with objections attached,almost immediately after the district court denied the second motion for enlargement of time and entered judgment.and the objections williams seeks to file are not mere repetitions of his original petition.given these circumstances,williams failure to timely file objections was the result of excusable neglect,not culpable conduct.
prejudice to prevailing party 
the respondent concedes that granting the requested relief will cause it no prejudice.
meritoriousness of claim or defense 
the final factor to consider is the meritoriousness of the claim of the party seeking this case,the meritoriousness of williams objections to the magistrate report and recommendation.a claim or defense is meritorious,if there is some possibility that the outcome of the suit after a full trial will be contrary to the result achieved by the default.invst financial systems,cir internal quotations omitted emphasis added see a
