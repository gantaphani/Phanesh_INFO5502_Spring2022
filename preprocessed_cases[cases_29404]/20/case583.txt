qabail hizbullahankhamon appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york shira sheindlin,judge dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to d on the ground that the petition was pursuant to d.hizbullahankhamon walker,d.petitioner argues that his petition was timely filed because the limitations period for filing habeas petitions should be tolled i during the pendency of his applications to the new york court of appeals for leave to appeal the appellate division orders denying his two motions for a writ of error coram nobis,ii during the periods in which petitioner could have moved in the appellate division for reargument of the denial of his two coram nobis motions,and iii during two periods he spent in solitary confinement allegedly without access to legal materials.we hold that,because petitioner coram nobis motions ceased to be pending on the dates they were denied by the appellate division,the limitations period was not tolled during the pendency of his applications for leave to appeal these denials to the new york court of appeals.we also hold that the limitations period should not be equitably tolled during the initial period petitioner spent in solitary confinement because petitioner failed to exercise reasonable diligence upon his return to standard confinement where he had access to legal materials.absent the tolling to which petitioner would be entitled were these two arguments successful,the petition was filed beyond the limitations period.therefore,we do not reach petitioner remaining contentions and affirm the district court judgment dismissing the petition as untimely.
background 
on august,petitioner qabail hizbullahankhamon,then known as kirk johnson,was convicted in bronx county supreme court,following a jury trial,of murder in the second degree three counts and attempted murder in the second degree two counts.petitioner was sentenced to consecutive indeterminate terms of imprisonment of years to life on each murder count and eight and to years on each attempted murder count.
on direct appeal,the appellate division,first department,unanimously affirmed the conviction,people johnson,dep t.the court of appeals denied petitioner application for leave to appeal,people johnson,and,on december,denied his application for reconsideration,people johnson.petitioner conviction thus became final on march,the date on which the time to petition for certiorari to the supreme court of the united states expired.see ross artuz,cir.
on january,petitioner filed the first of two motions for a writ of error coram nobis in the appellate division,alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.the appellate division denied this first motion on august,people johnson,dep t.the court of appeals dismissed petitioner application for leave to appeal this denial on october,people hizbullahankhamon,and denied his application for reconsideration on november,people hizbullahankhamon.petitioner filed his second coram nobis motion on june.the appellate division denied this second motion on february,people johnson,dep t,and the court of appeals dismissed his application for leave to appeal this denial on april,people hizbullahankhamon.
prior to filing his first coram nobis motion,petitioner was placed in solitary confinement from november,to may.on november,approximately three months after the appellate division denied petitioner first coram nobis motion,petitioner was again placed in solitary confinement,where he remained until june.petitioner alleges that,during these periods in solitary confinement,he was denied access to his legal files and to the law library.
petitioner filed his federal habeas corpus petition on april.in an opinion and order filed august,the district court granted respondent motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that it was under d,as interpreted by ross,and granted a certificate of appealability.hizbullahankhamon walker,d.petitioner timely appealed.
discussion 
we review a district court ruling on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo.english artuz,cir.
under title i of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,pub,stat,codified at,a prisoner in state custody has one year after the date his conviction became final in which to file a habeas petition.d.a prisoner whose conviction became final prior to the aedpa effective date of april,has a grace period after that date in which to file a first habeas petition.ross,at.however,t he time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward this period.d see also bennett artuz,cir holding that section d is applicable to the grace period,aff,d.
because petitioner conviction became final prior to april,he had until april,to file a first habeas petition,plus any time tolled under section d or the doctrine of equitable tolling.see smith mcginnis,cir.per curiam,cert.denied,d ross,at.as noted,petitioner filed his petition on april,a total of days after april.the parties agree that,pursuant to section d,the limitations period was tolled between the filing of the first coram nobis motion on january,and the appellate division denial of the motion on august,that is,days and between the filing of the second coram nobis motion on june,and the appellate division denial of the motion on february,that is,days.subtracting this time from the day total reduces the elapsed time to days 
petitioner advances three additional grounds for tolling the limitations period.first,petitioner contends,as he did below,that,pursuant to section d,the limitations period was tolled during the pendency of each of his two applications to the court of appeals for leave to appeal the appellate division orders denying his two coram nobis motions.second,petitioner contends,for the first time on appeal,that the limitations period was tolled during the day periods in which he could have moved in the appellate division for reargument of the denials of his coram nobis motions.third,petitioner argues,as he did below,that,under the doctrine of equitable tolling,the limitations period should be tolled one day for each day he spent in solitary confinement without access to legal materials.we discuss these tolling arguments seriatim.
tolling during applications for leave to appeal denial of the coram nobis motions 
petitioner contends that,under section d,the limitations period was tolled during the day interval between the appellate division order denying his first coram nobis motion on august,and the new york court of appeals denial of his motion for reconsideration of its dismissal of his application for leave to appeal that order on november,and during the interval between the appellate division order denying his second coram nobis motion on february,and the court of appeals dismissal of his application for leave to appeal that order on april.subtracting these from the undisputed elapsed time of days would reduce the elapsed time to days.
the district court held that this tolling argument is foreclosed by our holdings in bennett artuz,cir and geraci senkowski,cir,cert.denied,d.hizbullahankhamon,d at.we agree.
in bennett,we addressed the issue of when an application for review is properly filed under d.we construe d properly filed to mean simply that an application for state relief recognized as such under governing state procedures has been filed.at.we also considered the issue of when an application for review is pending under section d.noting that section d complements the c exhaustion requirement by tolling the limitations period on federal habeas petitions while an appellant pursues remedies,we declined to hold that a petition is not pending before state courts during the intervals between disposition and appeal on the ground that this holding would force appellants into federal court prematurely,before giv ing state courts a full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues.id.at quoting boerckel,d.we therefore held instead that a petition for or other collateral review is pending from the time it is first filed until finally disposed of and further appellate review is unavailable under the particular state procedures.id.at.this holding clearly presupposes that the appeal from an initial determination on review does not constitute a distinct application for review in addition to the initial application.once a court determines that the initial application was properly filed,the properly filed inquiry comes to an end the only remaining question is when further appellate review of the initial application becomes unavailable.
in geraci,we addressed this latter question with respect to a motion in the appellate division for a writ of error coram nobis.we held that petitioner motion ceased to be pending on the date on which the appellate division denied it,because,as of that date,the door of the new york court of appeals was closed and further appellate review was unavailable.geraci,at.in support of this statement about new york procedural law governing coram nobis applications,we cited people adams.in adams,the court of appeals dismissed the appellant motion for an extension of time within which to apply for permission to appeal the appellate division denial of his coram nobis motion on the ground that no application for leave to appeal will lie from the order of the appellate division denying an application for a writ of error coram nobis.id.at.the court of appeals established this rule as early as,and it was law at the time hizbullahankhamon filed his first coram nobis application on january.see people howard,people abdullah,people de leon,people ames,people medina,people burgess,people hughes,people rivera,people soto,people marsicoveteri,people giraldi,people white,people williams,people tramell,see also levine comm r of corr,cir observing that the denial of a petition for a writ of error coram nobis is not appealable to the court of appeals 
petitioner urges this court to hold that an application to the court of appeals for leave to appeal the appellate division denial of a motion for a writ of error coram nobis qualifies as a properly filed application for state or other collateral relief that tolls the limitations period so long as it is pending.d.we are foreclosed by bennett from adopting this position because this position erroneously presupposes that an application for leave to appeal an order denying a coram nobis motion is a distinct application for state or other collateral review in addition to the initial coram nobis motion itself.under bennett,however,the only question with respect to the properly filed requirement is whether petitioner initial coram nobis motions were properly filed there is no additional question of whether petitioner applications for leave to appeal the orders denying these motions were properly filed.the only additional question is when these motions ceased to be pending.geraci compels us to answer that the first coram nobis motion ceased to be pending on august,the date on which it was denied by the appellate division and that the second coram nobis motion ceased to be pending on february,the date on which it was denied by the appellate division.therefore,the limitations period was not tolled during the intervals between these denials and the dates on which the court of appeals dismissed petitioner applications for leave to appeal these denials 
we note that this holding is consistent with the consideration upon which we based our holding in bennett that an application for review is pending from the time it is filed,during the intervals between disposition and appeal,and until further appellate review is unavailable,namely,the complementary relationship between aedpa tolling provision and aedpa exhaustion requirement.bennett,at stating that tolling the federal statute of limitations while the state prisoner is properly adhering to exhaustion requirements reinforces the orderly presentation of claims to the appropriate state tribunals and obviates the need for federal action internal alterations and quotation marks omitted see also,at.the exhaustion doctrine turns on an inquiry into what review procedures are available under state law.because review of an appellate division order denying a motion for a writ of error coram nobis is unavailable in the new york court of appeals,the court of appeals has no opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues,at,raised in such a doomed appeal.therefore,it would be an exercise in utter futility to require habeas purposes of file such appeals.see id.at.t here is nothing in the exhaustion doctrine requiring federal courts to ignore a state law or rule providing that a given procedure is not available.correspondingly,tolling the limitations period during the pendency of such appeals would unjustifiably frustrate the purposes underlying congress enactment of aedpa statute of limitations.d see also james liebman randy hertz,federal habeas corpus practice procedure b,at ed stating that an apparent purpose of the properly filed language is to keep prisoners from making bad faith use of state postconviction proceedings to delay the onset of federal habeas corpus proceedings and the final adjudication of the legality of their convictions and sentences 
ii.tolling during time for reargument of the coram nobis motions 
petitioner argues,for the first time on appeal,that the limitations period was tolled during the periods in which he could have sought reargument in the appellate division of its orders denying his coram nobis motions.petitioner contends that,although the relevant reargument rule states that m otions for reargument shall be made within days after the appeal has been decided,tit,a,the court of appeals and the first department have interpreted this language to mean that the period runs from the date of service of the order with notice of entry of the denial.the state appears to concede that petitioner was never served with notice of entry of the denials of his coram nobis motions.hence,if petitioner interpretation of rule a were correct,and we were to hold that a coram nobis motion is pending during the reargument period,it would follow that petitioner coram nobis motions were still pending.
even assuming that the first department permits motions to reargue coram nobis motions,petitioner has not cited,nor does our research disclose,any authority suggesting that it petitioner interpretation of rule a is not correct.none of the cases petitioner cites in support of his interpretations concerns section.see people washington,interpreting.proc.matter of park east whalen,interpreting civ.proc.luming cafe,birman,dep t interpreting civ.proc.am.banana venezolana int l de aviacion,dep t interpreting civ.proc.moreover,of the first department cases that have addressed section a,none have stated that it means anything other than what it says,namely,that the day period runs from the date the first department issues its decision.see people robles,dep t,rev on other grounds,people jones,dep t,aff,mcmahon city of new york,dep t people washington,dep t coppola.excavation melnick,dep t.this literal reading of section a is likewise to be found in leading commentaries on new york appellate procedure.see sanford young,appeals from intermediate courts require careful adherence to applicable statutes and rules,at noting that the time period begins to run on the date of the court order,which means that the practitioner can not afford to wait for service of the order with notice of entry thomas newman,new york appellate practice mark davies,et,new york civil appellate practice,at noting that the time period runs from the appellate division decision,not from service of notice of entry of the decision.hence,even assuming that section a permitted motions to reargue coram nobis motions,such a motion would have to be filed within days of the order denying the coram nobis motion 
in any event,we need not decide whether a motion for reargument of a coram nobis motion may be made in the first department or,if so,whether a coram nobis motion remains pending during the period for moving for reargument thereof for the reasons explained below,even assuming that the limitations period was tolled during the
