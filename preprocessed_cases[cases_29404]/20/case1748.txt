richard fox fox appeals from the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus in this ohio death penalty case.this court granted a certificate of appealability as to two issues i whether the ohio courts erred by using a separate crime for which fox was neither charged nor convicted as an aggravating circumstance in imposing the death penalty and ii whether the ohio courts erroneously considered the violence and planning of the crime as aggravating factors in imposing the death penalty.we now affirm the district court denial of fox petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
the facts underlying fox conviction and sentence were set out by the ohio supreme court 
on september,leslie keckler applied for a waitress job at a bowling green restaurant.defendant,richard dick fox,worked there as a grill cook.as keckler filled out her job application,fox pointed out keckler to a coworker and said,i like to have some of that.at fox request,the restaurant manager showed fox the job application,which included keckler telephone number.
sometime after september,keckler told her boyfriend,girlfriend,and mother about an exciting restaurant supply job opportunity.keckler described the job to her girlfriend and said that she had an interview.according to keckler mother,her daughter was very excited about this sales route job,which involved selling supplies such as towels and aprons to local area restaurants.
on the evening of september,keckler went to the holiday inn where a job interview for the sales route job was to take place.keckler boyfriend saw her just before she left.keckler told him she might be gone for two or three hours while she went over the sales route.when keckler did not come home that night,her boyfriend and mother filed a missing persons report with police.police found the car keckler had been driving abandoned at the woodland mall.
on september,two boys riding bicycles found keckler body in a rural drainage ditch.keckler was still wearing her new black dress and leather jacket.however,a clasp on her brassiere was broken,her belt was unbuckled,two dress buttons were missing,and her pantyhose were torn in the crotch.aside from a nearby shoe,police found no other evidence at the scene.
keckler had died as a result of asphyxia from ligature strangulation and multiple stab wounds.she had been stabbed six times in the back three stab wounds penetrated her lungs.her right wrist had a deep gash,and her face had bruises on her left eye,upper lip,and nose consistent with blunt force injury.the coroner found no signs of sexual molestation.
the evidence at trial later showed that at the hotel,keckler had met fox,who later stabbed her six times,strangled her with a rope,dumped her body into a ditch,and then drove home.the facts surrounding keckler abduction reminded police of an incident several months earlier involving marla ritchey and an unknown man who called himself jeff bennett.in may,marla ritchey had applied for a waitress job at a bowling green restaurant.fox then worked at that restaurant.some days later,arrangements were made for ritchey to go to the bowling green holiday inn for an job interview.at the holiday inn,fox,calling himself jeff bennett,told ritchey that he worked for great american foods,and they needed a local sales representative.ritchey agreed to accompany bennett in his car that evening to discuss the job.
after driving a distance and parking,bennett fox told ritchey he thought her dress was too long.eventually,ritchey decided this was a fake interview and told fox she was not interested in the job.fox then asked what ritchey would do if someone pulled a knife on her and asked her for money,or asked her to do other things.when ritchey jumped out of the car,fox tried to grab her and said come back,that he was finished with her yet.ritchey immediately reported the may incident to the police and helped them prepare a composite police sketch of bennett.
because of the similarity between keckler abduction and the earlier ritchey incident,police circulated an updated composite sketch of bennett,the man ritchey had met.police thought he might be a suspect in keckler abduction.on october,an acquaintance of fox told police that this composite sketch resembled richard fox of tontogany.police confirmed that fox matched ritchey description of bennett,and fox car also matched the description of bennett car.
on october,police secured a warrant to search fox car and the home where fox lived with his parents o fficers conducted the search and found some suspicious items,fox agreed to go voluntarily to the police station,where he waived his miranda rights and agreed to talk further with police.before fox was placed under arrest,he admitted that in early may he had worked at a restaurant where marla ritchey had applied for a job,that he met ritchey at the holiday inn,and that he took her for a drive and discussed her skirt length.
fox also admitted he knew keckler and claimed they had met and talked at the restaurant where he worked and met again a couple of days later.he described his encounter with keckler at the holiday inn on september as a date.later,at the mall,he saw leslie and they talked and ended up taking a drive in his car.
fox said that,after driving for a while,he and keckler parked,and things were getting warmed up.however,then leslie did not want to participate.she called him an asshole and started to get out of the car.fox told detectives,no one calls me an asshole.then he grabbed leslie by the coat as she was standing up to get out of the car and pulled her back in,and he pulled the coat up over her head.fox got a knife out of the glove compartment and stabbed her in the back or times.then,he got the rope out of the trunk just to make sure she was dead and strangled her.police terminated the interview when fox asked for a lawyer.
during the interview,fox also described another remote rural location.at that location,police subsequently recovered keckler purse,her notebook,a letter she had written,her other shoe,a button from her dress,and a piece of nylon cord.forensic examination of fox car revealed blood on the front passenger seat,door,and window.samples tested were keckler blood type.in fox garage,police found a fillet knife and a thin nylon rope both had blood on them.
a grand jury indicted fox for kidnapping and aggravated murder with a death penalty specification alleging kidnapping.after fox motion for a change in venue was overruled by the trial court,fox waived a jury and tried the case to a panel.
at the guilt phase,fox retained counsel conceded that fox had killed keckler but disputed that the evidence established kidnapping.the parties stipulated that fox had no criminal record.on,some witnesses testified to fox good character and hard work.despite his arguments,the panel convicted fox as charged.
state fox,ohio.following his conviction,the mitigation phase of fox trial began before the same panel of judges after consideration the panel sentenced fox to death as well as an additional sentence of to years imprisonment for the kidnapping offense.state fox,verdict and sentence at wood cty.june.
fox conviction and sentence were affirmed by the ohio court of appeals,state fox,wl ohio,and the ohio supreme court.state fox,ohio.fox sought certiorari from the united states supreme court but his petition was denied.fox ohio,d.
fox then unsuccessfully sought collateral relief from the state courts before filing the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus on may.the district court denied fox petition on november,after concluding that the ohio courts had not considered any aggravating circumstances and that the ohio supreme court independent reweighing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances was therefore not contrary to clearly established federal law.see fox coyle,cv,at.the district court also denied fox request for a certificate of appealability as to all issues.see id.at.this court,however,granted a certificate of appealability as to two issues i whether the ohio courts erred in using a separate alleged crime for which fox was not tried as an aggravating factor and ii whether the ohio courts erred in using the violence and planning of the crime as aggravating factors.the present appeal followed.
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court legal conclusions in a habeas proceeding de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see lucas,cir.defendant filed his habeas petition on may,meaning that this court review of the state court decision is governed by the standards set forth in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa.see lindh murphy,d harpster ohio,cir.as amended,d provides as follows 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the supreme court has explained the effect of d in the following terms 
in sum,d places a new constraint on the power of a federal habeas court to grant a state prisoner application for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to claims adjudicated on the merits in state court.under d,the writ may issue only if one of the following two conditions is adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.under the contrary to clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.
williams taylor,d.with these standards in mind,we now turn to fox claims.
ohio statutory death penalty provisions 
in common with other states that employ the death penalty,ohio uses a weighing method to determine whether an individual charged with a capital offense receives the death penalty.an individual becomes eligible for the death penalty only if one or more of a series of statutory aggravating circumstances is specified in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.ohio a.in the present case,fox was convicted of murder with the capital specification of kidnapping.see ohio a.once an individual has been found guilty of a capital offense,a jury or panel must determine whether the presence of one or more of the nine statutory aggravating circumstances listed at ohio revised code a outweighs the mitigating circumstances presented by the defendant.the panel was thus required to weigh against the aggravating circumstance proved beyond a reasonable doubt,the nature and circumstances of the offense,the history,character,and background of the offender,and all of the following factors listing factors such as age,mental disease,and provocation.ohio b.
in weighing the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors,the 
court,and the trial jury if the offender was tried by a jury,shall consider any evidence raised at trial that is relevant to the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing or to any factors in mitigation of the imposition of the sentence of death,shall hear testimony and other evidence that is relevant to the nature and circumstances of the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing,the mitigating factors set forth in division b of section of the revised code,and any other factors in mitigation of the imposition of the sentence of death,and shall hear the statement,if any,of the offender,and the arguments,if any,of counsel for the defense and prosecution,that are relevant to the penalty that should be imposed on the offender.
ohio d.finally,if the court or panel imposes the sentence of death,it must specify in a separate opinion the aggravating and mitigating circumstances found to be present as well as the reasons why the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing were sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors.ohio f 
fox constitutional claims 
fox claims that in the process of weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances present in his case the panel improperly considered the planning and violence of the crime.rather than correcting these errors,fox further alleges that the state appellate courts compounded them not only by continuing to rely upon the planning and violence of the crime but also by introducing the ritchey incident into the weighing process.the result,fox claims,was a constitutionally invalid death sentence.
an examination of the supreme court death penalty jurisprudence indicates that for fox claim to succeed he must show that the state courts did consider aggravators that any errors were not corrected by the state appeals process and that the consideration of aggravating factors so infected the balancing process as to render the ultimate sentence constitutionally infirm.
i constitutionality of the consideration of aggravating factors 
a state wishing to authorize capital punishment has a constitutional responsibility to tailor and apply its law in a manner that avoids the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death penalty.part of a state responsibility in this regard is to define the crimes for which death may be the sentence in a way that obviates standardless sentencing discretion.godfrey georgia,d quoting gregg georgia,d.states may fail to meet their responsibility by relying upon constitutionally invalid aggravating circumstances to define those who are to be sentenced to death.see,id.at.rejecting the georgia supreme court affirmance of a sentence of death in a case in which the sole aggravating circumstance was the finding that the offense was wantonly vile,horrible and inhuman such words were insufficient to serve as a restraint on the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death sentence.a defendant due process rights may also be infringed upon by a state failure to adhere to its own sentencing statute.see hicks oklahoma,d where,however,a state has provided for the imposition of criminal punishment in the discretion of the trial jury,it is not correct to say that the defendant interest in the exercise of that discretion is merely a matter of state procedural law.the defendant in such a case has a substantial and legitimate expectation that he will be deprived of his liberty only to the extent determined by the jury in the exercise of its statutory discretion.
the present case involves a state alleged reliance on sentencing factors that,while constitutionally permissible,could not be considered under the state statutory sentencing scheme since they were not alleged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt in barclay florida,d,the supreme court considered an eighth amendment claim regarding a trial court use of an aggravating factor in a weighing state.the petitioner in barclay was sentenced to death for the random,racially motivated killing of a young hitchhiker.id.at.at sentencing the trial court rejected the jury recommendation of a sentence of life imprisonment and imposed the death penalty.amongst the aggravating factors cited by the trial court was the petitioner criminal record a factor not listed in the florida statute governing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances to be considered in the imposition of the death sentence.id.at.a plurality of the supreme court began its analysis by noting that the the question whether barclay sentence must be vacated depends on the function of the finding of aggrav
