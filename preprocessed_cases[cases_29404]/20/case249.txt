a jury convicted petitioner julio of aiding and abetting two carjackings in violation of and,and of using a weapon during the commission of a violent crime in violation of c.although count one of the superseding indictment charged ramirez with violating,the trial court did not instruct the jury to determine whether the victim of the carjacking suffered serious bodily injury as a result of the carjacking.ramirez appeals the district court denial of his petition,in which he claimed that his sentence must be vacated because the supreme court ruling in jones united states,d,requires that the jury determine the element of serious bodily injury.we affirm.
we review this case for the fourth time in a federal grand jury indicted ramirez and daniel on two counts of aiding and abetting each other in two carjackings,and,and on one count of using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime,c.the defendants were charged under the version of which provided,in relevant part 
whoever,possessing a firearm as defined in section of this title,takes a motor vehicle from another by force and violence or by intimidation,or attempts to do so,shall 
be fined or imprisoned not more than years or both 
if serious bodily injury as defined in section of this title results,be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both 
as is apparent from the text of the statute,the default maximum sentence for a carjacking is fifteen years,id,but if the carjacking results in serious bodily injury,the maximum statutory penalty is increased to years,id.
count one charged ramirez and monta√±ez with aiding and abetting each other in taking,while armed,a motor vehicle from nancy 
by force,violence or intimidation,to wit by forcing her to remain in the car,at gunpoint,and forcibly assaulting her sexually,resulting in serious bodily injury,as defined in section,namely bodily injury which involves a substantial risk of death and extreme physical pain.all in violation of united states code,sections and.
the trial court read the entire indictment to the jury,including the language.despite that reading,the court did not instruct the jury under.rather,its instruction referred solely to the elements set forth in the first paragraph of.the court,however,did provide the jury for its deliberation a copy of the superseding indictment,which included count one,quoted above.trial counsel did not object to the jury instructions as given 
the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all three counts.the trial evidence showed that,before relinquishing control over rosado and her vehicle,one of the carjackers forced her to undress and then raped her.in both written exceptions filed in response to the investigative report and at the sentencing hearing,ramirez objected to a recommended enhancement for serious bodily injury,under b,being applied to his conviction for the carjacking of rosado.he claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of serious bodily injury to support the enhancement.however,he did not argue that the maximum available sentence for the carjacking of rosado was fifteen years because of the failure to instruct the jury to determine,beyond a reasonable doubt,that rosado suffered serious bodily injury.
the district court flatly rejected ramirez objection,noting that the jury had found ramirez guilty under.he then determined that there was sufficient evidence of serious bodily injury to enhance ramirez sentence by four points under b.in the end,the court sentenced ramirez to a term of months as to counts one and two,to be served concurrently,and months as to count three,to be served consecutively to counts one and two.
ramirez,pro se,appealed his convictions and sentence.but he assigned no error to the court jury instructions,nor did he claim that he was deprived of due process or of his right to jury trial because no serious bodily injury instruction was provided to the jury.in fact,relying on our decision in united states,cir,ramirez challenged the denial of his motion in limine on the ground,inter alia,that serious bodily injury was a sentencing factor.we affirmed his convictions,but vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing because the sentence imposed by the district court exceeded the maximum sentence available under the statute.united states,wl cir.may,see also providing for a term of months for carjacking that results in serious bodily injury.on remand,the district court resentenced ramirez to months as to count one,but erroneously entered an identical concurrent term for count two,which lacked serious bodily injury and thus had a statutory maximum of fifteen years under.ramirez again appealed,this time with appointed counsel,who raised a number of objections to the convictions and sentence moreover,appointed counsel did not raise the claim now raised in the petition.
on march,one day after the filing of ramirez reply brief,the supreme court decided jones united states,d.in jones,the supreme court held that subsections of are three separate offenses with distinct elements,each of which must be charged by indictment,proven beyond a reasonable doubt,and submitted to a jury for its verdict.id.at.ramirez did not raise the jones issue at trial,nor during the pendency of the second appeal,in a supplemental brief or a letter.
two months after the jones decision and without reference to it,we vacated ramirez sentence as to count two,on the ground that it exceeded the statutory maximum of fifteen years under.united states,wl cir.may.
on may,seeking to take advantage of the jones decision,ramirez brought a motion to vacate,set aside or correct his sentence,pursuant to.he argued that the district court should vacate his sentence because the jury did not determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether rosado suffered serious bodily injury.in the alternative,he alleged that his appellate counsel failure to advise this court of the jones decision on his second appeal amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court denied his petition.
we granted a certificate of appealability,c,as to whether appellate counsel failure to advise this court of the jones decision constituted ineffective assistance of counsel,whether ramirez prior default of the jones issue barred him from raising it for the first time on collateral review,and whether jones entitles him to relief.
for ramirez to prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,he must establish that,by failing to advise this court of the jones decision,his appellate counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,he would have prevailed on his jones claim on his second appeal.strickland washington,d see also murray carrier,d holding that the strickland standard applies to trial and appellate counsel.we find it unnecessary to determine whether ramirez appellate counsel was unreasonable in failing to raise a jones claim,for even if we assume that he was,his claim would have failed under strickland second prong.
because ramirez failed to object to the jury instructions or otherwise raise a claim at trial,we would not have granted relief on his second appeal unless ramirez established that the jones error was plain under.b.see united states,cir holding that,on direct appeal,plain error review applies where the jones argument was not preserved at trial united states cotton,d holding that a defendant failure to object to apprendi error at trial engenders plain error review on direct appeal neder united states,d holding that the omission of an element in a jury instruction is an error that is subject to analysis.under that test,before an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial,there must be error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.johnson united states,d quoting united states olano,d.if these conditions are met,we may then exercise our discretion to correct the error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted quoting olano,at.
we quickly dispose of the first two prongs of the test.jones applies to ramirez case retroactively as his case was still on direct review at the time it was decided,at citing griffith kentucky,d.accordingly,the trial court failure to instruct the jury to determine the element of whether the carjacking resulted in serious bodily injury was error.see jones,at,at.and because jones was decided at the time of appellate consideration,the error was plain.see johnson,at.w here the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of is enough that an error be plain at the time of appellate consideration.
our third inquiry is whether the error affect ed ramirez substantial rights.an error affects substantial rights if it was prejudicial,meaning that the error must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.olano,at.see also,at.in making this inquiry,we do not become in effect a second jury to determine whether the defendant is guilty.neder,at.quoting traynor,the riddle of harmless error.rather,we must determine whether the record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the omitted element.united states benjamin,cir quoting neder,at.united states baldyga,cir same.this inquiry is substantially similar to the standard applied in harmless error analysis,except that the petitioner,not the government,bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.olano,at.see also,at.
in providing for an enhanced penalty in,congress intended that defendants involved in carjackings that include serious bodily injury should receive more severe punishment than those defendants involved in carjackings that do not include serious bodily injury.the issue for the jury,therefore,is whether the carjacking resulted in serious bodily injury.it is undisputed that rosado was raped during the commission of the carjacking indeed,ramirez conceded this fact at oral argument and not surprisingly,ramirez agreed at oral argument that rosado suffered serious bodily injury as a result of being raped by one of the carjackers.thus,the question immediately before us is whether rosado serious bodily from the carjacking.
we are not in uncharted territory.in united states,cir,we analyzed what type of injuries result from a carjacking for purposes of.we explained that 
the choice of the word results in the statutory phrase if serious bodily injury results suggests that congress intended to cover a fairly broad range of consequences flowing from a carjacking.moreover,the legislative history characterized the provision as imposing the enhancement when the carjacking involves bodily injury,which supports the view that the injuries covered are not limited to those resulting from the taking of a vehicle,but also include those caused by the carjacker at any point during his or her retention of the vehicle.
id.citation omitted.accordingly,we held that serious bodily injury arising from the rape in that case resulted from the carjacking id.we have since reaffirmed our reading of the term results as including injuries that were caused by the actions of the carjacker at any time during the commission of the carjacking.see united states lowe,cir 
the jury heard overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence that rosado was raped during the commission of the carjacking.see i,wl,at.indeed,in ramirez direct appeal,we found that the rape,like the earlier brandishing of the gun,provided the intimidation by which the carjackers extended their control of the victim and her automobile.id.at.at no time has ramirez disputed that rosado serious bodily injury occurred during the commission of the carjacking.nor does he do so now.in sum,ramirez has failed to point to any our independent review of the entire record has found suggest that the jury rationally could have reached a different conclusion.
faced with the unavoidable conclusion that the rape resulted from the carjacking,at oral argument,ramirez maintained that he suffered prejudice because the jury did not determine the identity of the rapist.according to his that was not raised at trial,sentencing,direct appeal,in his petition,or in his briefs for this the rapist,not the other carjacker,can be held criminally responsible for the serious bodily injury because the rape was not included in the purpose of the joint carjacking of,in any case,the rape occurred after the joint venture ended.
ramirez arguments raise the interesting question of the scope of aider and abettor liability under the carjacking statute.after all,not only was ramirez charged and convicted as a principal,but he was also charged and convicted as an aider and abettor under a whoever commits an offense against the united states or aids,abets,counsels,commands,induces or procures its commission,is punishable as a principal.the case law is remarkably silent on the question of the scope of aider and abettor liability in this situation.
although intriguing,the issue need not detain us for two reasons.first,the question of the scope of aider and abettor liability is beyond the scope of this appeal.the only issue before us is whether the failure to instruct the jury to determine the element of serious bodily injury affected the trial court proceedings.had the error not occurred,the trial court would have instructed the jury to determine,in addition to the other elements of the offense,only whether rosado suffered serious bodily injury as a result of the carjacking.there is nothing in jones or that requires the trial court to instruct the jury to determine the identity of the person who actually caused the serious bodily injury.the identity of the rapist is simply immaterial to answering this question.
second,even if the identity of the rapist is material,we reach the same result because the jury verdict necessarily included a finding that ramirez was the rapist.the trial evidence showed that there were only two number of carjackers has never been in dispute.given that there were only two carjackers,ramirez and monta√±ez,if one is excluded as the rapist,the other necessarily is the rapist.after taking over rosado car,the two carjackers drove around searching for a second victim.one carjacker drove rosado car while the other sat in the backseat.spotting kassandra,the driver rammed rosado car into rivera car.the driver then exited rosado car,got into rivera car,and drove away,leaving the only other carjacker with rosado.the other carjacker,who remained in the backseat of rosado car,moved to the driver seat,and drove rosado to a secluded location.once there,he ordered her to undress,and then raped her.after raping rosado,the second carjacker left rosado and climbed into the backseat of rivera car.the two men,with rivera in the passenger seat,drove off,stopped to consume drugs,and ultimately crashed into a mango tree.ramirez was found in the backseat of rivera car,trying to escape 
the trial evidence was overwhelming and uncontroverted that monta√±ez was the first carjacker,the carjacker who exited rosado car,and the only driver of rivera vehicle,leaving the second carjacker as the one who ultimately raped rosado that only leaves ramirez,the second carjacker,as the rapist.by convicting ramirez for both carjackings,the jury necessarily found that ramirez was the second carjacker,who remained in rosado car after monta√±ez exited,and who ultimately raped rosado.no other reading of the facts and verdict is possible.in any event,the record does not contain evidence that would allow a rational jury to reach a contrary finding.the jury determination that ramirez was the rapist is not surprising given the overwhelming evidence presented at trial,including the positive identification by rosado that ramirez was the rapist and corroborating testimony provided by rivera.see i,wl,at.in short,we conclude that the jury verdict necessarily would have been the same had the trial court asked the jury to determine whether the carjacking resulted in serious bodily injury.
finally,even were we to pass over the question of whether the error affected ramirez substantial rights,we would still affirm because ramirez claim fails under the fourth prong of p
