a lake county,indiana court convicted cleveland bynum of murdering five people and sentenced him to years imprisonment.bynum filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under,contending that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to put him on the stand at the hearing on his motion to suppress his confessions to the murders.bynum contends that his confession was coerced and that,had he testified about the coercion,the trial court would have granted his motion to suppress.the district court denied bynum petition and,because he has not shown that he was prejudiced by his counsel ineffectiveness,we affirm.
on february,bynum began arguing with his friend anthony jeffers.bynum was upset because jeffers had told people that bynum was a drug dealer.a third person,elizabeth,witnessed the confrontation.later,in the early hours of february,bynum resumed the argument,this time at jeffers home.jeffers girlfriend,angie wallace,was present during this second argument along with wallace daughter,her sister susan,and susan son,that night,sleeping in a different room,was awakened by five gunshots.testified at trial that,immediately following the first few shots and while he was still in the bedroom,he heard two men talking.he testified that one voice was bynum,even though he had met bynum only once before.according to,bynum said something about putting another shell in.stated that the other man,whose voice he did not recognize,said d o rush me,and bynum responded s hoot her in the head.after bynum and the second man departed,left the bedroom and discovered that jeffers,angie wallace,and susan wallace were all dead.the child was spattered with blood,but she was still alive.
on that same evening in a different house,elizabeth,sheila bartee,and michelle fliris were preparing for bed.according to fliris,paged someone and received a phone call a few moments later.she then decided to go to the liquor store along with bartee.fliris went to sleep,but awoke several hours later to find that and bartee had never returned from the store.fliris noticed a piece of paper had left by the phone on it was written the name chris as well as a phone number.bynum,whose middle name is christopher,often goes by the nickname chris.the next day,police found and bartee bodies lying on the ground in a baseball park,riddled with gunshot wounds.
on february,officers arrested bynum and held him for two days on a probation violation.during that time,bynum made two statements to police.in his first statement,made on the day of his arrest,he admitted killing jeffers and the wallace sisters.he also admitted that he knew and had given her his pager number,but insisted that he had not shot her or bartee.instead,he reported that and bartee were present at jeffers home when he shot the other three victims,but that they left accompanied by two men,deandre macintosh and terrell jackson.bynum acknowledged that he knew macintosh and jackson intended to kill and bartee,but claimed that he had nothing to do with those murders.according to the arresting officers,they read bynum his miranda rights before he gave his statement.bynum also signed a waiver form in which he acknowledged that he was advised of his constitutional rights,including his right to counsel,and that nonetheless he waived those rights.he also acknowledged in writing that his statement was voluntary and that no one had threatened him.
two days later bynum signed a second,identical written waiver and made a second statement.he confirmed that he had killed jeffers and the wallaces.this time,however,he exonerated macintosh and jackson,instead claiming that jeffers shot and bartee before bynum killed him.he knew this,he said,because he witnessed the murders and because jeffers used bynum gun.then,bynum continued,jeffers forced him at gunpoint to drag the bodies to the baseball park where they were found.bynum explained that he had walked back to jeffers house with jeffers.jeffers gave the gun back to bynum,but when they got into an argument and began pushing each other,the gun accidentally went off,hitting jeffers.angie and susan wallace began to yell and approached bynum,who interpreted their conduct as a threat and shot them both.then,bynum claimed,he went home and,the next morning,threw his gun in a lake.
before trial,bynum met with his appointed counsel,charles graddick.according to bynum testimony at his hearing,he told graddick that during his interrogation,police threatened him with violence when he asked for a lawyer.bynum also reported that the officers had handcuffed him to a chair for nine hours,deprived him of food and water,and refused to let him use the bathroom.bynum further claimed that officer louis donald told him that the police had bynum fiancée in custody and would charge her with obstruction of justice and harboring a fugitive,events that would require that their son enter child protective services.it was only after seeing his fiancée at the police station,bynum continued,that he agreed to sign the waiver form and make his first statement.finally,bynum claimed that donald fabricated the second confession.
graddick did not respond to these concerns immediately,but at trial,he moved to suppress bynum confessions on the theory that they were coerced.graddick did not ask bynum to testify at the suppression hearing,instead questioning only the three officers who took bynum statements.the officers testified that bynum never asked for counsel,never told them he was tired or hungry,and at no point during the interrogation seemed unwilling to talk to them.the officers also denied physically threatening bynum or coercing him in any way,although they acknowledged that bynum seemed nervous and was worried about his family.moreover,the state of indiana introduced into evidence the two waiver forms.
after the officers testified and counsel presented argument,the trial court judge ruled that bynum confessions were voluntary and denied the motion to suppress.the judge explained that he found the officers testimony credible,noting that the police in no way interfered with the voluntariness of the confession and that the defendant was properly mirandized and apprised him of his rights,and he was given an opportunity to bring in an attorney if he desired to do so.after the remainder of the trial,a jury convicted bynum of five counts of murder,largely based on the confessions.
bynum challenged his conviction on direct appeal to no avail.he then sought postconviction relief in state court with new counsel,arguing that his trial lawyer was ineffective in failing to put him on the stand to testify at the suppression hearing.at an evidentiary hearing,graddick testified that he did not recall bynum ever telling him that he had been prevented from obtaining a lawyer,and maintained that if bynum had told him about that,he would have moved to suppress the statements before trial.moreover,graddick explained that he decided to move to suppress the confessions during trial rather than before because he did not want to give the state advance notice of his trial strategy.and graddick stated that,in his view,the best way to show coercion was to get the officers to tell inconsistent stories about the interrogation.finally,he described his fears that,if put on the stand,bynum version of events would not withstand 
counsel why was it that if you did in fact have a suppression hearing,you would not have had bynum testify in that portion of the trial 
graddick i was afraid for bynum because i had had many discussions with bynum,and each time i have an discussion with bynum,i became more and more sure that once he took the stand,that he could hold up.
counsel all right.and what was it that he told you about what had occurred at the police station that would have led you to believe that he could not hold up with respect to 
graddick well,in part his version of what had taken place,and when i would ask him questions about it,i was always able to pick holes in what he was saying and make it not believable.
therefore,graddick continued,he concluded it would not be in bynum best interest to testify.
a lake county,indiana court denied bynum postconviction relief.the court noted that graddick made tactical choices to raise the issues that he believed had merit and to raise them in the way he thought was in the best interest of his client.because graddick was skeptical that bynum version of events was true,the court continued,he reasonably attempted to suppress the confessions using police testimony alone.finally,the court concluded that graddick strategic decisions did not fall below prevailing professional norms and did not prejudice bynum.
bynum sought review in the indiana court of appeals,arguing that the lake county court erred in concluding that graddick performance was constitutionally adequate.the court of appeals disagreed.first,addressing whether graddick representation was deficient,the court observed that,at the suppression hearing,graddick successfully established through questioning the police officers that bynum told the officers he was afraid for his fiancee safety.even after the trial court denied the motion to suppress,noted the court of appeals,graddick sought to undermine the officers credibility by questioning them about bynum allegations that they threatened him and his family.this aggressive questioning led the court of appeals to conclude that graddick performance was not deficient.the court reasoned mere disagreement with trial counsel handling of his defense does not make an ineffective assistance claim.
moreover,continued the court,even if graddick had called bynum to testify,bynum would not have been able to show that he had been prejudiced because the trial court still could have reasonably denied the motion to suppress.assuming that bynum testimony had been offered at the suppression hearing,the court explained,the trial court would still have weighed that testimony against the officers statements as well as the waiver forms bynum had signed.the court concluded that,because bynum had failed to substantiate his account of events,the trial court could not have been expected to credit his claims in light of other contrary evidence.the court of appeals therefore affirmed the denial of relief and the indiana supreme court declined to hear the case.
bynum next turned to federal court,renewing his argument that graddick was ineffective in failing to put bynum on the stand and also advancing a new theory that graddick had failed to adequately review the state discovery,his own notes,and bynum letter to him before trial,and additionally had failed to spend enough time discussing the case with bynum,his family,and witnesses.the district court rejected the latter claim as procedurally defaulted because bynum had not exhausted his state court remedies.and the court concluded that the former claim fared no better.even though the court concluded that graddick was clearly testimony was the only evidence of coercion there was,and his testimony at the suppression hearing,outside the presence of the jury,would not have damaged his court reasoned that bynum could not show that he was prejudiced by graddick ineffectiveness.the court therefore concluded that the state appellate court ruling on the question of prejudice was not an unreasonable application of clearly established law and denied bynum petition for collateral relief.the court also granted a certificate of appealability limited to whether graddick was ineffective in failing to have bynum testify at the suppression hearing.
bynum appeal challenges the state appellate court conclusions as to both prongs of his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective.he argues that the indiana court of appeals erred in concluding that graddick performance was objectively reasonable.and he contends that both the state appellate court and the district court should have concluded that he was prejudiced by graddick ineffectiveness.our review of the district court decision is de novo.see julian bartley,cir.
we begin with limitations on the scope of our review.we may grant collateral relief from bynum conviction only if the state courts adjudication of his ineffectiveness claim resulted in a decision that was either contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or if the state courts decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts given the evidence before the state courts.d barrow uchtman,cir.a decision is contrary to clearly established law if it applies a legal standard inconsistent with governing supreme court precedent or contradicts the supreme court treatment of a materially identical set of facts.bell cone,d citations omitted goodman bertrand,cir.a state court unreasonably applies supreme court precedent if the state court identifies the correct legal rule but applies it in a way that is objectively unreasonable.yarborough gentry,d gilbert merchant,cir.our mere disagreement with a state court analysis is,however,not enough to meet this standard.jackson frank,cir.rather,the state court analysis is reasonable so long as it stays within the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.id.
bynum believes that he is entitled to collateral relief because his trial counsel did not competently represent him,thereby depriving him of the right to effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by the sixth and fourteenth amendments.see gideon wainwright,d jackson miller,cir.a convicted defendant challenging counsel effectiveness must satisfy both prongs of the strickland test he must show that his attorney representation was objectively deficient,and he must show that he was prejudiced by the substandard performance.strickland washington,d allen chandler,cir.bynum argues that his trial counsel,graddick,was objectively deficient in failing to have him testify at the suppression hearing,and that had he testified,his confessions would have been suppressed,leaving the state with insufficient evidence to support his conviction.
turning to the first prong of the strickland test,we agree with bynum that the indiana court of appeals unreasonably concluded that graddick decision to keep him from testifying fell within the range of competent legal representation.bynum confessions were the crux of the case against him.the suppression motion was therefore critical to the defense without the confessions,the prosecution would have been left to depend on the testimony of a boy who,after meeting bynum only once,merely heard a voice from another room that he thought was bynum.moreover,bynum account of the officers coercive conduct during his interrogation was the only available evidence of coercion.true,graddick testified at the hearing that he intended to elicit evidence of coercion through the officers testimony.but this plan,as the district court aptly observed,is not trial strategy it is television fantasy.bynum buss,wl,at.june,see also goodman,at observing that t here is little tactical wisdom in counsel resting on his hands and assuming the government would help make the defense case for him barrow,at rejecting claim that counsel failure to present any evidence was legitimate strategic move.in any event,the strategy failed,as a competent attorney might expect the officers unanimously and consistently stated that they had not coerced bynum.and without the admission to coercion that graddick had hoped the officers would give,he was left with no evidence that bynum confessions were coerced.a motion to suppress allegedly involuntary confessions can not succeed without at least some evidence that the confessions were coerced.see schneckloth bustamonte,d holding that confession is involuntary only if police coercion or overreaching overbore the accused will and caused the confession conner mcbride,cir same.
moreover,graddick reason for keeping bynum off the he could not withstand and it might prejudice his baseless.of course bynum would have been,perhaps rigorously so.but the suppression hearing was conducted outside the jury presence.under indiana law,the question whether to suppress the confessions was a question for the judge alone.see miller state.and in any case,as the district court observed,testimony on a motion to suppress is not admissible at trial as
