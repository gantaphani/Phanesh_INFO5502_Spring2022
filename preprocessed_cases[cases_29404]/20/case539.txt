background 
a.the indictment and trial 
on december,lanfranco,the owner of a supermarket that burned down as a result of suspected arson,was convicted in new york state court,after a jury trial,of insurance fraud and attempted grand larceny for attempting to collect on an insurance policy for damage caused by the fire.
the grand jury had indicted lanfranco on four counts arson insurance fraud attempted grand larceny and reckless endangerment.the indictment stated that the date of the insurance fraud and attempted grand larceny was october,the date of the alleged arson.lanfranco requested a bill of particulars set ting forth with specificity each and every act attributed to the defendant regarding each offense charged.the bill provided by the district attorney first outlined the theory of arson,and then stated 
upon further investigation,the defendant store was suffering financial difficulties the defendant also had the store insured with a policy and proceeded to file an insurance claim for the insurance company to pay on the policy.
at trial,the prosecution argued that lanfranco committed insurance fraud by falsely stating on his proof of loss claim that he did not know the origin of the fire,a statement that the prosecutor contended was knowingly false because lanfranco himself had committed the arson.the prosecution also argued that lanfranco proof of loss statement contained other materially false representations that he was the sole owner of the property and that he had sole ownership interest in the contents of the supermarket.the prosecutor asserted that these additional misrepresentations constituted separate instances of insurance fraud that were not dependent on lanfranco having committed the arson.evidence introduced at trial showed that lanfranco in fact leased the building from a real estate company and that two creditors had secured interests in the store contents.at no time did lanfranco counsel object to these additional fraud theories.
after the defense rested,the state moved to amend the dates specified in the indictment on counts two insurance fraud and three attempted grand larceny from the date of the fire,october,to the date lanfranco filed the proof of loss statement in support of his insurance claim,december.the state argued that the amendment would not be prejudicial because the date was not a substantive element of the crime,the defendant had received adequate notice,and the amendment did not change the theory of the prosecution.defense counsel requested a adjournment to determine whether he should review the grand jury minutes or the defense case in light of the state motion.defense counsel stated that he had been aware of the erroneous date on counts two and three,but had kept silent because he had planned to move to dismiss the indictment for insufficiency at the close of the state case.he explained that he did not make the motion at that point,because the court brought the issue of the erroneous date to the state attention and inquired whether the state would seek to amend.the court granted the prosecution motion to amend the indictment and denied the defendant request for an adjournment.with respect to reexamining the grand jury minutes,the state court held that they were out of the case because the hearing court with a different judge had already ruled that the evidence presented to the grand jury was sufficient.the court granted leave to defense counsel to the defense case,but defense counsel ultimately declined to do so.
the jury acquitted lanfranco on the arson and reckless endangerment charges,but found him guilty on the fraud and attempted grand larceny charges.
state procedural history 
following his conviction,lanfranco filed a motion in the trial court for relief pursuant to.proc.law,alleging ineffective assistance of counsel based on his lawyer failure to object to the prosecution amendment of the indictment and to its alleged change in theories of guilt.the trial court denied the motion,finding that lanfranco had received meaningful representation,that the motion to amend was properly granted,and that there was no change in the prosecution theory of fraud.the trial court held that viewed in its totality,counsel provided meaningful representation and zealously represented lanfranco,exhibiting complete familiarity with the facts of the case and the relevant principles of evidence,criminal law and procedure.in rejecting lanfranco argument that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the amendment of the indictment,the trial court concluded that the amendment was proper under the statute,reasoning that the date did not constitute a material variance from the theory set forth in the indictment because time was not a material element of the crime.the trial court also found that the amendment changing the date was consistent with the grand jury evidence,which had established that the defendant had not filed an insurance claim until well after the fire.in addition,the trial court concluded that defense counsel had decided not to challenge the amendment for tactical reasons,including moving to dismiss the case for lack of venue,and thus his performance was not deficient.
lanfranco also claimed that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor theories of fraud on the basis that they varied from the theory charged in the indictment and the bill of particulars.the trial court rejected this claim,concluding that the indictment broad allegations covered all of the prosecution theories,that the prosecution case for fraud did not affirmatively disprove the specific facts set forth in the indictment and the bill of particulars and,thus,that there had been no variance.the trial court also concluded that neither the amended indictment nor the alternate theories of guilt prejudiced lanfranco because the indictment adequately notified him of the fraud charges and all of the documents relating to those charges had been furnished to him before trial,including the proof of loss statement containing the misrepresentations.leave to appeal the trial court decision was denied.
on lanfranco direct appeal from his conviction,the appellate division also rejected the ineffectiveness claim,concluding that t here was nothing prejudicial about the amendment,and the theories advanced by the people at trial were completely consistent with the indictment and the bill of particulars.people lanfranco.leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals was denied on january.people lanfranco.
c.the district court decision 
lanfranco filed this timely habeas petition in the district court pursuant to,and the district court granted the writ.the district court found that the amendment to the indictment changing the date of the fraud effected a change in the theory of prosecution,in violation of lanfranco fifth amendment rights,and that his counsel failure to object to the amendment deprived him of his right to effective assistance of counsel.according to the district court,the indictment and the bill of particulars referred only to the arson as a basis for all of the counts.thus,the amendment constructively altered the central elements of the offense to the point tha
