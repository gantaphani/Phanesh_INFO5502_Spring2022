petitioner,earl ralph jacobs,appeals from the district court judgment dismissing petitioner application for a writ of habeas corpus brought pursuant to,as barred by procedural default.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
procedural history 
on january,petitioner filed the instant application for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.petitioner application sought to challenge his ohio conviction for murder in connection with petitioner fatal shooting of a police officer,for which petitioner was sentenced to life imprisonment.as grounds for relief,petitioner asserted that the confession upon which his conviction is allegedly based,is neither handwritten,signed,or notarized in violation of criminal rules of evidence.in a written opinion and order,the district court denied petitioner habeas corpus petition as procedurally defaulted.applying the test of maupin smith,cir,the court noted that petitioner had raised the issue in his petition for relief,and had appealed the trial court unfavorable decision to the ohio court of appeals,which dismissed the appeal as untimely.however,the court found that petitioner failed to appeal the court of appeals dismissal to the ohio supreme court.thus,the district court concluded that petitioner had defaulted his claim.because petitioner had failed to allege any cause for his default,and because petitioner did not argue that he was actually innocent nor did the record support a finding of actual innocence,the district court dismissed petitioner habeas claim.
subsequently,the district court denied petitioner request for a certificate of appealability.this court also denied petitioner request for a certificate of appealability however,in an order dated march,upon consideration of petitioner request for rehearing,this court granted a certificate of appealability with respect to the following issue whether jacob sic due process claim regarding the admission of his confession at trial has been procedurally defaulted by virtue of appellate counsel failure to file an appeal of his behalf.as will be explained infra,consideration of this issue requires us to first examine whether petitioner procedurally defaulted this ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
on august,a grand jury sitting in logan county,ohio,indicted petitioner for murder in connection with the shooting death of a police officer,west liberty marshall sherman ricketts.attorney ewing smith was appointed as counsel for petitioner on august.petitioner entered a plea of not guilty a jury trial was held from october,through november,at which time the jury returned a verdict of guilty.thereafter,on november,petitioner was sentenced to life imprisonment at the ohio state penitentiary in columbus,ohio.
no timely appeal as of right was filed by petitioner following his november conviction however,on june,proceeding pro se,petitioner filed a motion for leave to appeal to the ohio third district court of appeals.in his memorandum in support of his motion,petitioner raised nine allegations of error.the two allegations of error raised by petitioner relevant for purposes of this appeal are as follows 
the prosecution introduced a purported confession of this appellant,purportedly acquired hours after the arrest of appellant and early on in the time of his containment in the rutan hospital.the appellant,in the first instance,was unconscious for many days and under the continuing influence of very heavy sedatives,specifically to include narcotics,administered as the result of the necessity of extremely painful surgery,and any confession thereupon obtained was totally invalid.and in the second instance,the alleged confession was not a knowing,willing and intelligent statement inasmuch as it was obtained without any showing whatsoever that it was highly incriminatory,and as is facially shown by the confession purportedly signed by this appellant.thereby,the appellant rights to fundamental fairness,to due process of law,against and to a fair trial before an impartial jury,guaranteed by amendments v and vi,united states constitution,and applicable in such cases made and provided to the state,amendment xiv,were denied.
the trial court erred in failing to advise that the appellant had an absolute right to undertake a timely appeal to seek review of the judgment of conviction rendered and sentence thereupon imposed and simultaneously,to have the assistance of counsel in perfecting,briefing and arguing the said appeal,it being a first appeal as of right,and guaranteed pursuant to the ohio constitution,article iv,b f,b,orc,and the procedural rules of court then existing and since superseded by rule a rule a,ohio rules of criminal procedure rule b,ohio rules of appellate procedure.
at.petitioner added the following in reference to his ninth allegation of error.
while it is clear that there is no federal constitutional right to appeal per se,it is equally clear that if such rights are established as a matter of state law,constitutional,statutory,decisional or procedural,the denial thereof,be it by chance or by design,triggers the protection afforded a putative defendant in a state court,and further,one who as is conclusively shown herein is indigent,unlearned in the law and confined to custody,by the due process and equal protection clauses,amendments v,xiv,united states constitution.where,as here,those rights existed as a matter of state law,the trial judge was under an obligation to advise of their existence this he did not do.
the state of ohio submitted a brief in opposition to petitioner motion for leave to appeal,wherein the state argued as follows regarding the two relevant allegations of error 
sixth assignment of error 
it was not error for the trial court to admit into evidence a written statement of the confession of the defendant and signed by the defendant when there was no coercion involved whatsoever the defendant was not drugged or drunk,but was fully conscious and aware of what he was then doing and the prosecutor warned the defendant that he need sign nothing but that if he did it could and would be used against the defendant.
ninth assignment of error 
it was not error for the trial court to fail to instruct the convicted defendant of his absolute right to appeal and to have counsel appointed for him to aid his appeal if found indigent when neither the constitution nor the applicable case law required the trial judge to give such instructions.
at.the ohio court of appeals thereafter denied petitioner motion for leave to appeal as not to be well taken for the reasons set forth in the brief of the state of ohio.at.petitioner filed an application for reconsideration of the court decision,as well as a motion to certify because of a conflict with other districts within the court of appeals.the ohio third appellate district denied the application for reconsideration and overruled the motion to certify without opinion.on august,petitioner filed a notice of appeal with the supreme court of ohio challenging the ohio court of appeals decision denying him leave to appeal.the supreme court of ohio sua sponte dismissed petitioner appeal for want of prosecution.
on july,petitioner filed a petition for post conviction relief with the logan county court,wherein petitioner claimed that 
he was not afforded a fair trial,in accordance with his rights as guaranteed by the fifth,sixth and fourteenth amendment s to the constitution of the united states of america and the ohio constitution in that he was not afforded effective assistance of counsel,in violation of ohio rules of criminal procedure,rule a and rule which requires sic assignment of counsel and the defendant further stipulates that he was not advised of his miranda rights required by law,and escobedo rule.
further,defendant was never advised of his right to appeal and to obtain his trial transcript by some means.
at.in his memorandum in support of his petition,petitioner argued at length regarding his allegations of error,arguing at one point 
the defendant will further submit that his attorney appointed for trial,see journal entry,and all available court records fail to show that this attorney protected his right of direct appeal by filing a notice of appeal,as required by law,and in that sense was denied the effective assistance of counsel the records fail to show any notice of appeal was filed,therefore,can not be disputed.the landmark case which must be examined to determine whether or not the petitioner was afforded effective assistance of counsel is,beasley united states,wherein the united states court of appeals for the cir judge sic celebreeze held 
defense counsel must perform at least as well as a lawyer with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law,and must,conscientiously protect his clients,sic interest,undeflected by conflicting considerations,and defense counsel must investigate all apparently substantial defenses available to the defendant,and must assert them in the proper timely manner.
it is submitted that the trial counsel ewing smith has previously determined that he committed no errors,therefore,it was pointless to file any notice of appeal such is not the function of any trial counsel,and violates the sic due process and equal protection,and also,that had petitioners sic attorney exercised the ordinary diligence and skills mandated by the judicial code and the sixth circuit court court sic of appeals,the records would have been transcribed,and a notice of appeal would have been filed.
at,emphasis added.on august,the logan county prosecuting attorney filed a motion to dismiss petitioner petition for relief.logan county judge mark entered a judgment treating the prosecutor motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment,and ordered that each party had until a certain date to submit materials in connection with the motion.petitioner filed a memorandum in opposition to the prosecutor motion,and the prosecutor filed supplements to his motion.
on may,ohio public defender wendie gerus,entered her appearance as counsel for petitioner pursuant to an april,order of the logan county court.gerus filed a supplemental memorandum in opposition to the prosecutor motion to dismiss,wherein gerus argued that petitioner was deprived of due process of law and effective assistance of counsel as the result of the failure of either the trial court or his trial attorney to notify him of his right to appeal.as a result,petitioner has effectively been deprived of an opportunity to appeal his conviction and sentence of life imprisonment.
the logan county court was not persuaded by petitioner petition for relief,and on october,the court entered an order denying the petition.proceeding pro se,petitioner then filed a notice of appeal with the third district court of appeals,challenging the logan county court denial of his petition for release.in doing so,petitioner raised the following allegations of error 
first assignment of error 
the court of common pleas erred in ruling that the issues raised in the petition for post conviction was sic the same issues resolved by this court on appeal.the brief in the appeal was improperly before the court which lacked authority to rule.
second assignment of error 
the court erred in permitting the use of the confession made without benefit of counsel which was used during the preliminary hearing and trial without first making any effort to ascertain the voluntariness of the confession.
third assignment of error 
the court erred in failing to appoint counsel during the critical stage of the prosecution and the preliminary hearing when the right to counsel was noticed by the court.
at.the third district court of appeals reversed the logan county court dismissal as to petitioner second allegation of error,the voluntariness of petitioner confession.in its opinion submitted in connection with its ruling,the court of appeals noted that petitioner claimed that he was denied his right to appeal by the trial court failure to inform him of this right as well as the right to counsel however,the court was not persuaded by petitioner claim inasmuch as the case upon which petitioner relied,state sims,ohio,was limited in application by state leroy,ohio,such that sims was not to be given retroactive application to a cause under review in which the time for filing a direct appeal had expired several years earlier 
pursuant to the court of appeals directive,the logan county court scheduled a hearing to be held on july,regarding the remanded issue petitioner was transported from the correctional facility for the hearing and represented himself pro se.because petitioner wanted to be represented by counsel,but did not desire gerus as his attorney,the court adjourned the matter until such time that counsel could be appointed.gerus was once again assigned to petitioner case,despite his objection,and the matter was eventually heard on may,after continuances were granted,in part so that petitioner could be examined by a forensic psychiatrist at the expense of the state.
following the hearing at which petitioner was represented by counsel,the logan county court entered an order on september,finding that the statements made by petitioner regarding his involvement in the shooting death of the police officer were voluntary and that those statements,and the facts and circumstances surrounding those statements,were properly before the jury for the jury to determine what weight should be given to them.accordingly,the petition is denied.proceeding pro se,petitioner filed a notice of appeal on october,claiming that attorney gerus did not provide him with a copy of the court september,order denying his petition until september.the court of appeals of the third appellate district dismissed the appeal on october,for want of jurisdiction inasmuch as the notice of appeal was filed outside the thirty day period as prescribed by rule a.
it does not appear that petitioner appealed from the october,dismissal of his appeal however,it does appear that at some point petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the supreme court of ohio,which was dismissed sua sponte by that court on november.inasmuch as a copy of this petition was not provided to the district court,nor to this court,it is not clear what claims were raised in that proceeding.
discussion 
we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see harris stovall,cir.because petitioner filed his petition in,his case is reviewed under the standards set forth in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.see lindh murphy,d.
at the outset,we note that when this court issued its order on march,granting petitioner application for a certificate of appealability,the state of the law in this circuit under carpenter mohr,cir,rev sub nom,edwards carpenter,d,was that when a habeas petitioner sought to assert ineffective assistance of counsel as cause to excuse the procedural default of an independent federal claim,it was not necessary that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim itself be subjected to a procedural default analysis.see id.at.applying this principle,the carpenter court ruled that the ineffectiveness of the petitioner counsel served as cause to excuse the procedural default of his separate sufficiency of the evidence claim.see id.however,the supreme court granted certiorari,and in an opinion issued on april,one month after this court granted petitioner application for a certificate of appealability in this supreme court reversed carpenter,holding that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim asserted as cause to excuse the procedural default of another claim can itself be procedurally defaulted.see edwards carpenter,d.
the supreme court decision in carpenter is significant to the matter at hand inasmuch as the issue upon which the certificate of appealability was jacobs due process claim regarding the admission of his confession at trial has been procedurally defaulted by virtue of appellate counsel failure to file an appeal of his the use of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as cause for excusing petitioner procedural default.thus,under carpenter,the record must indicate that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not procedurally defaulted.if the claim was procedurally defaulted,then petitioner can not use this claim as cause to excuse the procedural default of his independent federal claim that his confession was wrongfully used against him.we must therefore undertake an analysis of whether petitioner defaulted the issue of whether his counsel was ineffective in failing to directly appeal his murder conviction.see carpenter,at.
before moving on to that analysis,we note that the issue for appellate review actually involves an inquiry into whether petitioner trial counsel,ewing smith,was ineffective in failing to inform petitioner of his opportunity to appeal his conviction,and to file such an appeal if petitioner so desired,inasmuch as the record does not indicate that petitioner had appellate counsel as the issue framed in the certificate of appealability would suggest.furthermore,because it is well settled that a convicted defendant has no constitutionally protected right to counsel in a state proceeding,interpreting this court issue on appeal to be whether petitioner counsel at wendie gerus was ineffective for failing to file an appeal from that ruling would be contrary to law.see coleman thompson,d citing wainwright torna,d w here there is no constitutional right to counsel there can be no deprivation of effective assistance.
whether petitioner procedurally defaulted the issue of whether his trial counsel,ewing smith,was ineffective in failing to advise or file a direct appeal of petitioner murder conviction 
it is well settled that federal courts do not have jurisdiction to consider a claim in a habeas petition that was not fairly presented to the state courts.mcmeans brigano,cir citing franklin rose,cir.a claim may only be considered fairly presented if the petitioner asserted both the factual and legal basis for his claim to the state courts.id.citing franklin,at.accordingly,we must first determine whether petitioner fairly presented the claim that he was denied his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel by his trial counsel failure to file an appeal on his behalf to the ohio courts.
our review of the record indicates that petitioner first argued that he was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel in this regard when he filed his july,petition for relief with the logan county court,wherein petitioner argued that 
he was not afforded a fair trial,in accordance with his rights as guaranteed by the fifth,sixth and fourteenth amendment s to the constitution of the united states of america and the ohio constitution in that he was not afforded effective assistance of counsel,in violation of ohio rules of criminal procedure,rule a and rule which requires sic assignment of counsel and the defendant further stipulates that he was not advised of his miranda rights required by law,and escobedo rule.
further,defendant was never advised of his right to appeal and to obtain his trial transcript by some means.
at.significantly,in his memorandum in support of his petition,petitioner argued as follows 
the defendant will further submit that his attorney appointed for trial,see journal entry,and all available court records fail to show that this attorney protected his right of direct appeal by filing a notice of appeal,as required by law,and in that sense was denied the effective assistance of counsel the records fail to show any notice of appeal was filed,therefore,can not be disputed.the landmark case which must be examined to determine whether or not the petitioner was afforded effective assistance of counsel is,beasley united states,wherein the united states court of appeals for the cir judge sic celebreeze sic held 
defense counsel must perform at least as well as a lawyer with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law,and must,conscientiously protect his clients,sic interest,undeflected by conflicting considerations,and defense counsel must investigate all apparently substantial defenses available to the defendant,and must assert them in the proper timely manner.
it is submitted that the trial counsel ewing smith has previously determined that he committed no errors,therefore,it was pointless to file any notice of appeal such is not the function of any trial counsel,and violates the sic due process and equal protection,and also,that had petitioners sic attorney exercised the ordinary diligence and skills mandated by the judicial code and the sixth circuit court court sic of appeals,the records would have been transcribed,and a notice of appeal would have been filed.
because petitioner expressly relied upon case law from this circuit regarding a defendant sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel,phrased his claim in terms of the denial of a specific constitutional right,and alleged facts within the mainstream of constitutional law,petitioner fairly presented this claim to the trial court in his petition for relief.see mcmeans,at noting that a petitioner claim may be considered fairly presented when he states his claim along these lines and supports the claim with this type of argumentation,while also noting that general allegations of the denial of rights to a fair trial and due process do not fairly present claims that a specific constitutional right was violated.in addition,petitioner appointed counsel,wendie gerus,added in her brief in opposition to the prosecutor motion to dismiss petitioner petition for relief,that petitioner was deprived of due process of law and effective assistance of counsel as the result of the failure of either the trial court or his trial attorney to notify him of his right to appeal.as a result,petitioner has effectively been deprived of an opportunity to appeal his conviction and sentence of life imprisonment,at,thereby further supporting the finding that petitioner fairly presented this issue to the trial court when seeking relief in.see id.
however,a review of petitioner arguments on appeal to the ohio third district court of appeals,following the trial court dismissal of his petition for relief,does not indicate that he continued to make this argument regarding his counsel performance.accordingly,petitioner failed to raise a sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claim with the court of appeals in relation to his trial counsel failure to file a direct appeal of petitioner behalf.although it is true that the court of appeals remarked on the trial court failure to notify petitioner of his right to appeal and his right to court appointed counsel,this does not suffice to meet the standards that petitioner fairly presented his sixth amendment claim regarding his counsel failure to file an appeal.see mcmeans,at.
in addition,an analysis under the test of maupin smith,cir,indicates that petitioner defaulted his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the four factors a court is to consider to determine whether a claim has been procedurally defaulted under maupin are as follows 
first,the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner claim and that the petitioner failed to comply with the rule second,the court must decide whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction third,the court must decide whether the state procedural forfeiture is an adequate and independent state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim this question generally will involve an examination of the legitimate state interests behind the procedural rule in light of the federal interest in considering federal claims.fourth,the petitioner must demonstrate under wainwright sykes.that there was cause for him not to follow the procedural rule and that he was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.
id.citations omitted.
because petitioner could have raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding his trial counsel failure to file an appeal when petitioner appealed the dismissal of his petition for relief,and because petitioner sought no further action in the ohio supreme court,under ohio law,the first and second maupin factors are met.see state wa
