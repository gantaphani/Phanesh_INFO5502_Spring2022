in this habeas corpus action,the district court granted the petitioner relief.for the reasons that follow,we reverse.
facts and proceedings 
andrew garcia garcia and his brother,alejandro garcia alejandro,entered the car of a young woman while she was stopped at a traffic light in san antonio,texas.the garcia brothers told the woman,at gun point,to drive to a secluded area and forced her to engage in various sex acts with both alejandro and garcia.in addition,the garcia brothers used the victim debit card to withdraw funds from her account and forced her to purchase merchandise,which they kept.eventually,the garcia brothers released the victim.
garcia and alejandro,each represented by separate counsel,were charged with aggravated sexual assault,aggravated robbery,and aggravated kidnapping.both pleaded not guilty,and they were prosecuted in a single trial.the victim testified as the prosecution primary witness.each brother also testified on his own behalf,with each implicating the other 
garcia essentially confirmed the victim version of events,except where her testimony implicated his willingness to commit the acts.garcia theory of defense was that,while he committed the specific criminal acts alleged,he should not be convicted because he acted under duress.in support of this defense,garcia testified that alejandro threatened to kill garcia and that something would happen to garcia and his family if he did not cooperate with alejandro.
the jury was given two jury charges.each charge was complete and on separate documents,and each charge was identified as applicable to each respective defendant over the objection of the prosecution and alejandro counsel,the trial judge included an instruction in both alejandro and garcia jury charges the instruction,given in alejandro charge,described garcia as an accomplice to alejandro.and garcia jury charge,in a similar instruction,described alejandro as an accomplice to garcia.garcia jury charge also included instructions related to his duress defense.garcia challenge is limited to the instruction included in alejandro jury charge.
the jury convicted both garcia and alejandro on all counts.garcia was sentenced to concurrent terms of sixty years for aggravated sexual assault,twenty years for aggravated robbery,and years for aggravated kidnapping.alejandro was sentenced to concurrent terms of years for aggravated sexual assault,years for aggravated robbery,and sixty years for aggravated kidnapping.both garcia and alejandro appealed their convictions 
on direct appeal,garcia raised only two issues,arguing that the trial court erred by omitting garcia requested jury instruction on the issue of the voluntariness of his conduct and in restricting his of the prosecution witnesses.the texas court of appeals affirmed garcia conviction.see garcia state,antonio.garcia did not pursue any further direct review.
garcia filed a habeas petition in state court,alleging four grounds of error that his conviction was obtained pursuant to a constitutionally prohibited jury instruction that the jury instruction was harmful that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.the state trial court recommended granting habeas relief,but the texas court of criminal appeals disagreed and,without opinion,denied garcia petition.
garcia next filed a habeas petition in federal court.garcia petition focused on three issues that the inclusion of the instructions in alejandro jury charge violated the fourteenth amendment that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.the district court initially dismissed garcia petition as under d.on reconsideration,the district court equitably tolled the statute of limitations and addressed the petition merits the district court concluded that garcia conviction had been obtained pursuant to constitutionally prohibited jury instructions and that the state court denial of garcia writ of habeas corpus was contrary to clearly established federal law as established by the supreme court.as a result,the district court granted relief by ordering garcia convictions reversed and remanding to the state trial court for a new trial within days of the district court order.the director of the texas department of criminal justice the director,appeals 
ii.standard of review 
in a habeas corpus appeal,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and review its conclusions of law de novo,applying the same standard of review to the state court decision as the district court.martinez johnson,cir quoting thompson cain,cir.if the issue is a mixed question of law and fact,such as the assessment of harmless error,we review the district court determination de novo.robertson cain,cir citing jones cain,cir.
garcia filed his habeas petition after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.as a result,the petition is subject to the procedures and standards imposed by aedpa.see lindh murphy,d.under aedpa,a federal court collateral review of a decision must be consistent with the respect due state courts in our federal system.cockrell,d.moreover,our circuit precedent provides that a federal habeas court is authorized by section d to review only a state court decision,and not the written opinion explaining that decision.pondexter dretke,cir quoting neal puckett,cir en banc.see also santellan cockrell,cir the statute compels federal courts to review for reasonableness the state court ultimate decision,not every jot of its reasoning.
findings of fact 
a state court factual findings are presumed to be correct.hughes dretke,citing e.before a federal court,a petitioner has the burden of rebutting this presumption with clear and convincing evidence.id.this deference extends not only to express findings of fact,but to the implicit findings of the state court.summers dretke,cir young dretke,cir.
conclusions of law 
our review of a state court conclusions of law is also deferential.the supreme court has determined that d affords a petitioner two avenues,contrary to and unreasonable application,by which to challenge a state court legal conclusions.summers,at discussing williams taylor,d.a state court conclusion of law is contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court under two conditions 
the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases,or the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from supreme court precedent.
foster johnson,cir alteration in original quoting williams,at.
with respect to the second avenue,a state court decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case.summers,at internal quotations omitted.federal habeas courts must heed the supreme court explanation that unreasonable does not mean merely incorrect rather,an application of clearly established supreme court precedent must be incorrect and unreasonable to warrant federal habeas relief.id.quoting foster,at.only if a state court application of federal constitutional law fits within this paradigm may this court grant relief.id.
iii.discussion 
a.the instruction 
garcia contends that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury in violation of sandstrom montana,d the instruction in alejandro jury charge,garcia maintains,directed the jury to apply a mandatory conclusive presumption on an essential element of garcia charged crime the instruction in alejandro jury charge provided 
you are instructed that an accomplice witness,as the term is hereinafter used,means any person connected with the crime charged,as a party thereto,and includes all persons who are connected with the crime,as such parties,by unlawful act or omission on their part transpiring either before or during the time of the commission of the
