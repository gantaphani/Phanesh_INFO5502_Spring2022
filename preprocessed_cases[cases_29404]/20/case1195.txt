background 
martinez was tried and convicted in texas state court of capital murder for the july,murder of herman chavis during the course of a robbery shtr.at the following facts were presented to the jury.
on july,martinez,accompanied by two other men,entered the long branch saloon owned and operated by herman chavis,the victim,and his wife,pauline chavis smith.xx tr.at,smith recognized the three men from the previous monday and tuesday nights,when they came in,purchased beer,took only one sip,and left.id.at.on this date,the men ordered three miller lite beers and stood at the bar.id.at.soon thereafter,one of the men locked the front door,produced a revolver,and told everyone to hit the floor.id.at.martinez also brandished a revolver and threatened a patron.id.at.he then grabbed the barmaid,shoved the revolver into her ribs,and demanded the money from the cash drawer.id.at.martinez was seen reaching into the drawer,although it was later determined that he took no money.id.at.a verbal exchange between chavis and the men ensued,after which martinez pointed his gun at chavis.id.at.several shots were fired.id.at.chavis later died of a gunshot wound to the back of the head and a gunshot wound through the back that lodged in his right arm.ixx tr.at.
at the punishment phase of martinez trial,the state presented evidence of extraneous offenses committed by martinez,including the july,at the don ramon lounge the july,robbery at elaine lounge the july,murder of his own sister,julia,and her boyfriend,guillermo chavez and the july,murder of prostitute tracy pelkey.xxiv tr.at,xxv tr.at,xxvi tr.at,xxvi tr.the state also presented evidence of martinez numerous prior convictions,including burglary for which he received a prison term in armed robbery and assault for which he received a prison term in for which he received a prison term in and theft for which he received a prison term in.shtr.at.the state presented other aspects of martinez violent criminal past through several of his family members.
jerry deanda,martinez older brother,testified that martinez belonged to a gang known as the texas syndicate planned to produce drugs for the gang stabbed a during a former prison term escaped from jail in stole deanda gun with the intent to kill someone committed several violent robberies in the fort worth area and robbed and murdered someone in california while stealing chemicals for a crystal methamphetamine laboratory he intended to create for the gang.his sister,raquel martinez,testified that the government delayed martinez release from a prison term because he stabbed another inmate martinez wanted to produce and sell drugs for the texas syndicate he twice threatened her with a gun he stole her car he attempted to abduct her and he admitted to committing seventeen robberies in the fort worth area.
the state also presented evidence,through a clinical psychologist,that a hypothetical person who committed the crimes allegedly perpetrated by martinez would be likely to commit future criminal acts of violence,and that a person found to have deliberately committed these acts would warrant a finding of future dangerousness.the state also presented evidence that although martinez had been found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to rusk state hospital in,he was found sane on october,and subsequently released.several witnesses described martinez as easily provoked and.
through and the presentation of its own witnesses,defense elicited the following testimony.martinez older brother,deanda,testified that their mother suffered from mental illness,for which she was hospitalized during their childhood.id.at.he also testified that martinez was committed to a state mental institution for a time.id.at.kathryn cox,a former prison minister with the salvation army,testified that martinez acts constituted a cry for help,and that she found him eager to learn,regretful for his past acts,and amenable to rehabilitation.she also testified that he was suicidal.two harris county sheriff deputies,one former and one current,testified that they had interacted with martinez several dozen times without incident.defense counsel also elicited testimony that martinez suffered from malnourishment while at rusk state hospital,was brutalized by prison guards while in care of the texas youth commission,and was committed for a period of time to wichita falls state mental hospital.
cross examination elicited some adverse information from martinez family members,including that they were not aware that martinez had been diagnosed with any mental disorders during his commissions to state mental institutions.rather,they testified that martinez was very intelligent and had no mental health problems.martinez sister,raquel martinez,also testified that martinez,in fact,had committed himself to mental institutions for the purpose of receiving free food and shelter.
at punishment,defense counsel also offered into evidence records from wichita falls state mental hospital demonstrating that martinez mother was treated at san antonio state hospital for mental health issues martinez was a fearful and weak child who suffered from some form of epilepsy that went medically untreated because his father thought his spells were derived from spirits martinez began drinking at thirteen years of age and that martinez was hostile,violent,lost control and committed acts that he later regretted.the wichita falls state mental hospital records confirmed that martinez admissions to the hospital were voluntary,and indicated that he left the facility without permission at least twice.additionally,records from the texas department of corrections indicated that martinez earned a ged while incarcerated.
on the evidence presented,the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that martinez conduct caused the death of chavis,and was deliberately committed with the reasonable expectation that chavis death would result there was a probability that martinez would commit future criminal acts of violence that would constitute a threat to society and martinez conduct in killing chavis was an unreasonable response to any provocation by chavis.the court then sentenced martinez to death.
martinez unsuccessfully appealed to the texas court of criminal appeals,martinez state,reh g denied,october,and then sought certiorari from the supreme court,which denied his petition.martinez texas,d.martinez filed a state application for a writ of habeas corpus on april,asserting ineffective assistance of counsel.during the state habeas proceedings,martinez requested funds and an evidentiary hearing to develop his claim.the state court denied both requests.upon review of martinez habeas writ,the state answer,affidavits of martinez counsel,and the state proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law the state habeas court denied martinez writ,finding that he had not been deprived of effective assistance of counsel.the court of criminal appeals upheld the state court habeas determination on august.
martinez filed a timely petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.in,martinez filed an amended writ incorporating the affidavits of stephen martin,a neuropsychologist paula,a psychologist specializing in psychopharmacology and michael jewell,a fellow inmate.on february,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the following issues whether martinez was mentally ill at the time of his offense whether his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present an insanity defense and whether there was cause for any procedural default of these claims at the hearing,martinez submitted evidence that he has a family history of mental illness,was exposed to neurotoxins in utero and through adolescence when he picked cotton as a migrant farm worker,was physically abused by an older brother,was physically abused by prison guards while in care of the texas youth commission,suffered untreated epileptic seizures,and was previously adjudged not guilty by reason of insanity for an unrelated crime in.with leave of court,the evidentiary hearing was later supplemented with depositions.on november,the district court issued a memorandum and order and entered a final judgment,denying martinez petition for a writ of habeas corpus,and denying,sua sponte,a coa.
on december,martinez filed a request for the issuance of a certificate of appealability with this court,maintaining that he was deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel by his counsel failure to conduct an adequate investigation into his mental health background introduce evidence of neurological impairment and a prior adjudication of not guilty by reason of insanity as a mitigating factor and assert an insanity defense during the phase of his trial and introduce evidence of his neurological impairment as a mitigating factor during the punishment phase of his trial.on december,we invited additional briefing on the latter two issues.
ii.standard for granting a coa 
martinez filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus after the effective date of the antiterrorism effective death penalty act aedpa,april.therefore,the petition is subject to the procedures imposed by aedpa and precedent.lindh murphy,d.
under aedpa,martinez must obtain a coa before an appeal can be taken to this court.c.this court may grant a coa only upon finding that martinez has made a substantial showing of denial of a constitutional right.slack mcdaniel,d.to satisfy this standard,martinez must demonstrate that reasonable jurists could find the district court resolution of his constitutional claims debatable or that reasonable jurists could conclude that the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.cockrell,d.a coa ruling is not the occasion for a ruling on the merit of petitioner claim.id.at.at.instead,this court must engage in a narrow threshold overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.id.at.at.because martinez case involves the death penalty,we must resolve any doubts as to whether a coa should issue in his favor.hernandez johnson,cir.
upon grant of a coa,to obtain habeas relief martinez must demonstrate that the state court proceeding resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a state court decision falls within this rubric if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a state court decision may also qualify under d if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.at.under d,we need only determine whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.neal puckett,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.we have no authority to grant habeas corpus relief simply because we conclude,in our independent judgment,that a state supreme court application of federal law is erroneous or incorrect,at.
iii.analysis 
martinez maintains that he was deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel by his counsel failure to conduct an adequate investigation into his mental health background introduce evidence of neurological impairment and a prior adjudication of not guilty by reason of insanity as a mitigating factor and assert an insanity defense during the phase of his trial and introduce evidence of his neurological impairment as a mitigating factor during the punishment phase of his trial.
to prevail on this claim,martinez must demonstrate,as to each issue for which he requests a coa,that his counsel performance was deficient and his counsel deficient performance prejudiced his defense.strickland washington,d.there is a strong presumption in favor of competency.id.at.at.counsel performance was deficient only if it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness as measured by prevailing professional norms.id.at.at.review of counsel performance must be highly deferential and take into account counsel perspective at the time.id.at.at.we must make every effort to avoid the distorting effect of hindsight.id.where counsel has engaged in an adequate investigation,any strategic decision made as a result of that investigation fall within the wide range of objectively reasonable professional assistance.id.a conscious and informed decision on trial tactics and strategy can not be the basis for constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel unless it is so ill chosen that it permeates the entire trial with obvious unfairness.united states jones,cir.quoting garland maggio,cir,cert.denied,d.
even if we find counsel performance deficient,martinez must demonstrate prejudice.strickland,at.at.martinez must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.at.in capital cases,the standard is whether there is a reasonable probability that,absent the errors,the sentencer would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.id.at.at.under strickland conjunctive test,martinez failure to demonstrate either deficiency or prejudice must result in the failure of his claim.id.at.at.
inadequate investigation 
martinez request for a coa on this issue is denied.martinez contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel by virtue of his counsel failure to adequately investigate his mental health background.martinez argues that his mental health history,his exposure to neurotoxins in utero and as a migrant child farm worker,and his use of medications should have put counsel on notice that a more thorough investigation into his background was required.the district court dismissed martinez claims as overstated given the evidence presented at trial regarding the mental health background of martinez and his mother,and it denied a coa on this issue.we affirm that denial,and also deny martinez instant request for a coa on this claim.
c ounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary id.at.at.a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all circumstances,applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgments.id.a brief overview of the instant claim evinces that counsel conducted a reasonable investigation into martinez mental health history and made reasonable decisions to forgo further investigation into certain lines of inquiry based on their professional judgment.
in brief,martinez trial counsel drew upon information gained during the prosecution to investigate further martinez mental health background,criminal past,and family history in preparation for the trial.in this effort,counsel obtained additional mental health records,hired an investigator,conducted additional investigatory interviews of martinez family members,and sought the assistance of a psychiatrist who declined to help.rr at rr at,hr at as of,martinez family members,bittered by the fact that he had murdered his sister and reeling from threats he had made against some of them,were extremely reluctant to assist in his defense.yet,counsel was able to extract some additional information from them,including that none appeared to have been migrant farm workers.because martinez family members were unwilling or unable to help at the time,the fact that counsel had little family history with which to work was not due to ineffective representation but to the predicament martinez created for himself.
moreover,nothing in counsel personal and professional experience,in their interactions with martinez,or in martinez conditions of confinement,put counsel on notice that further inquiry was warranted.see strickland,at.at the reasonableness of counsel actions may be determined or substantially influenced by the defendant own statements or actions.both defense counsel had been migrant child farm workers and had picked cotton,and both had extensive backgrounds in handling people.both had interacted with martinez,without incident or indication of psychosis,during a period when martinez was not taking drugs.although aware that martinez had been prescribed medications,counsel experience taught that drugs were often prescribed in prison to alleviate the anxieties of incarceration rather than to treat a serious mental illness.counsel also knew that martinez had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.thus,the decision of martinez counsel to forgo further inquiry into his mental health was not unreasonable.
contrary to martinez contentions,the testimony of his family members,the testimony of experts not involved in the trial proceedings,and the production of a whom martinez failed to identify during the state trials in and,see hr at hr at hr at,are irrelevant to counsel perspective in.thus,this evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that counsel failed to conduct an adequate investigation into martinez mental health background in preparation for the trial.
upon an overview of martinez claim and a general assessment of its merit,we conclude that martinez has failed to make a substantial showing that the level of investigation conducted by his counsel deprived him of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.circuit precedent fully supports this conclusion reasonable jurists would not debate the district court conclusion.therefore,a coa will not issue as to this claim.
failure to introduce mitigating evidence during the and punishment phases of trial 
martinez also sought coa on two other claims that his counsel failed to introduce evidence of martinez neurological impairment and prior adjudication of not guilty by reason of insanity during the phase of his trial to support an insanity defense and that his counsel were deficient for failing to introduce evidence of his mental problems and neurological impairment as a mitigating factor during the punishment phase.the district court denied both claims on the merits and declined to issue a coa for either.to this extent,the district court determinations were in error.
the relevancy threshold for mitigation evidence is extremely low,and is satisfied by evidence that tends logically to prove or disprove some fact or circumstance which a could reasonably deem to have mitigating value.tennard dretke,d quoting mckoy north carolina,d.in capital cases,the relevancy standard translates into whether the evidence is of such a character that it might serve as a basis for a sentence less than death.id.at internal citation and quotations omitted.here,reasonable jurists could debate the strickland issues raised by counsel failure to present an insanity defense at trial and to argue at sentencing that martinez suffered from insanity neurological impairments that affected his ability to conform his conduct to the law requirements.therefore,we granted coa as to each of these issues.nevertheless,having reviewed the merits briefs and the record in full,we deny martinez request for habeas relief,finding the state habeas court determinations consistent with federal law as established by the supreme court and distilled by this circuit.
resolving these claims,the state habeas court made the following findings the jury had before it evidence regarding martinez mother mental health as well as his own several psychological evaluations determined that martinez did not suffer from any gross psychiatric disorders or otherwise demonstrate psychotic symptoms martinez claims of neurological impairment were legally meritless and martinez counsel investigated,developed and presented mitigating evidence at trial.shtr.at.finally,the court found that even if martinez counsel was deficient,martinez was not prejudiced given the overwhelming evidence of his guilt for the crime of conviction,his prior convictions,and his extraneous offenses.id.
for reasons explained below,the state court determination that no constitutional error attended counsel decisions were neither contrary to nor did they result from an unreasonable application of federal law.viewing counsel performance through a highly deferential lens and with a view to the facts and resources available to counsel at the time of trial,williams cain,cir quoting motley collins,cir,it is apparent that counsel strategic decisions were based on their professionally informed and competent assessment of the facts of martinez case in.as such,their decisions fell within the wide range of objectively reasonable professional assistance,and,thus,are incapable of forming the basis of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.strickland,at.at.
first,on direct appeal,the state habeas court found that the presumption of insanity issue was not preserved for review because,after counsel submitted a motion on the issue,the state trial court never formally resolved the motion and martinez counsel never renewed it.martinez state.the state habeas court further found that,even if the issue was properly preserved,the subsequent jury determination of sanity in and martinez consequent release were sufficient to overcome the presumption.id.because federal courts are not entitled to review state court dispositions that rest on adequate and independent state grounds,see lambrix singletary,d quoting coleman thompson,d,we must be satisfied with the state habeas court determinations.
notwithstanding,counsel decision not to argue a presumption of insanity during the phase was an exercise of professional judgment consistent with texas law and counsel prior experience in the trial.although martinez argues that his commitment to a state mental institution,from through,raised a presumption of insanity assertable at his trial,under texas law,an adjudication of incompetency is based on one capacity at the time of trial.hall state,holding that a a gap between the defendant breakdown and the trial with no further hospitalization does not constitute evidence tending to show incompetency.here,there was a year gap between martinez release from the state mental institution and his trial.in addition,martinez voluntary guilty plea to robbery wherein a court found him legally sane,eviscerated any presumption that may have arisen from his commitment.even if an assertable presumption did exist in,as the state court found,it would not have been difficult for the state to rebut the presumption given that the verdict was vitiated in by a subsequent jury determination of sane.moreover,the trial transcript indicates that counsel did raise the presumption in the trial,and that it was adequately rebutted.finally,defense attorney montgomery argued the acquittal by reason of insanity at the trial and received an adverse jury verdict within fifteen minutes.hard experience deterred repetition of this course of action in the trial.hr at.
second,counsel had no obligation to assert an insanity defense that they deemed so meritless as to constitute a fraud on the court and otherwise adverse to martinez case.see williams,at rejecting claim of ineffective assistance where counsel declined to introduce mitigating evidence that would have opened the door to more damaging evidence under.moreover,counsel was not required to assert an insanity defense where,after proper investigation,counsel determined that a more viable,and less fraudulent,defense was available.profitt waldron,cir.contrary to martinez contentions,circuit precedent requiring counsel to raise an insanity defense where it is the only viable
