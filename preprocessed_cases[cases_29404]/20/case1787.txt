after the supreme court of wisconsin declined to review his conviction for first degree homicide,thomas socha attempted to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.seeking a lawyer,socha tried first to enlist the help of the wisconsin innocence project.though the project initially informed socha that it would consider taking his case,almost a year later it told socha that it could not offer any assistance.left to his own devices,socha struggled to review the voluminous record in his case and tried his best to master the complexities of federal habeas corpus.this task was made harder by the fact that socha was in the segregation unit as a result,he had access to the law library for only a few hours a month.
having made little progress on his pro se petition and mindful that the deadline for commencing his case was fast approaching,socha filed a motion on july,with the district court for the eastern district of wisconsin,requesting a extension of the limitations period set out in d.this was before the deadline,but only by a single day.a few months later,judge stadtmueller granted the ex parte motion on the ground that socha restricted access to the library had created an impediment to filing that was outside his control.
socha filed his petition for habeas corpus within the period specified in judge stadtmueller order,on november.at that point,however,the case was assigned to judge rudolph randa,who dismissed the petition as untimely.judge randa took the position that judge stadtmueller order extending the limitations period was an impermissible advisory opinion and thus of no effect,because the court issued the order before socha had filed his petition.judge randa also concluded that there was no evidence of extraordinary circumstances that would warrant equitable tolling of the limitations period.
we granted socha request for a certificate of appealability and now vacate the district court judgment,based on our conclusion that judge randa assumed too quickly that socha petition was untimely.we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
on november,three men brutally murdered lance leonard and buried him in a shallow grave near the woods in crandon,wisconsin.police traced the crime back to the three killers and two others,beth mrazik and thomas socha,who were not present that night.mrazik and two of the killers entered into plea agreements and testified against socha at his trial.each of them said that socha played a part in planning leonard murder.socha was anxious to get leonard out of the picture,they asserted,because he feared that leonard might implicate him in a fraudulent check scheme or reveal that he had stolen to of his drug supplier cocaine.
according to mrazik,as the police drew closer to cracking the case,socha threatened that the mafia would go after her if he were connected to the murder plot.when the police eventually did catch socha,he dug himself into an even deeper hole.he asked them if the authorities had picked up mrazik,since she knew all about the murder.while he questioned why he was being charged with homicide,he commented that he did not have any problem being charged with party to a crime.
after a bench trial,socha was convicted of intentional homicide.he appealed and,as permitted by wisconsin law,filed a motion at the same time requesting relief.in these two filings,he pressed a number of different theories,including insufficiency of the evidence,ineffective assistance of counsel,and prosecutorial misconduct.the wisconsin court of appeals was unmoved by any of these points and affirmed,and on april,the supreme court of wisconsin denied further review.
at this point,socha elected not to file a petition for certiorari with the supreme court of the united states,and he also eschewed any further remedies.instead,he turned his attention to federal habeas corpus relief.as a state prisoner,socha was allowed one year from the date when his conviction became final to file his federal habeas corpus petition.d a.once the deadline for applying for certiorari passed,the time for seeking direct review of socha conviction came to a close and that period began to run.id.in concrete terms,this meant that socha had until july,to file his petition.
over the course of that year,socha confronted a number of obstacles that delayed his filing.for much of the year,he thought that the wisconsin innocence project was going to represent him,but shortly before the original deadline,it informed him that it could not take the case.socha efforts to proceed pro se while he waited to hear from the project were hindered by his placement on april,in prison segregation.prisoners in segregation may visit the prison law library.access to the prison law library for inmates in segregation is limited to one period once a week,or an period once every two weeks.
apparently recognizing that the deadline for his habeas petition was imminent,socha initiated a miscellaneous action in the eastern district of wisconsin on july,through a motion requesting a extension of the due date for his petition.in the motion,socha contended that he needed additional time since he was unfamiliar with federal habeas corpus law,had restricted access to the law library,and had only recently been told that he would be unable to get assistance from the wisconsin innocence project.the court took no immediate action on the motion.anxious to learn about the status of his motion,socha filed a letter with the court requesting an update on august.
on september,socha got his answer.judge stadtmueller issued an order granting him an additional days,which pushed back the deadline until december.the judge reasoned that the extension was warranted because socha segregated status limiting access to the prison law library appears to have created an impediment to his ability to file his petition on time.socha limited access to the library also appears to be beyond his control.
as the period was drawing to a close,socha filed another motion requesting more time to collect additional documents relating to his case.judge william griesbach denied that motion on october.this meant that socha had to meet the deadline set by judge stadtmueller he did so,actually filing the petition a month before it was due,on november.his petition asserted,among other things,that the state prosecutors had failed to disclose exculpatory evidence and the representation afforded by his attorneys was ineffective.
the district court,now acting through judge randa,denied socha petition on the ground that it had been filed outside the limitation period established in d.despite the fact that judge stadtmueller had ruled otherwise,judge randa held that none of the hardships socha had encountered in meeting the deadline warranted equitable tolling.moreover,he reasoned that judge stadtmueller order was not entitled to any weight whatsoever because there was no case or controversy pending in the federal court at the time socha filed his request for an extension.this meant,judge randa thought,that judge stadtmueller lacked jurisdiction over the case and the order was a nullity.
on appeal,socha challenges the district court dismissal of his petition.he argues that the district court erred when it chose to disregard judge stadtmueller order.at the very least,the confusion created by this order,socha asserts,justifies equitable tolling of d limitations period.while we typically review the denial of a habeas corpus petition de novo,smith mckee,cir,a decision to deny equitable tolling is reviewed for an abuse of discretion,simms acevedo,cir.
the heart of this matter is whether judge randa correctly concluded that he was compelled to dismiss socha petition as untimely.this conclusion was strongly influenced by his characterization of socha july filing and judge stadtmueller disposition of that motion.if that order represents a mere advisory opinion not addressed to resolving a case or controversy,then it marks an attempted exercise of judicial authority beyond constitutional bounds.const.art.iii.our first order of business is therefore to ascertain whether socha request for an extensio
