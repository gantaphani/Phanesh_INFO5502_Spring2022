background 
on may,the commonwealth of massachusetts issued a criminal complaint charging johnson with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon,assault with a dangerous weapon and various firearms charges.johnson trial was originally scheduled to commence on july,but he moved for a continuance to permit him to retain private counsel.after his motion was denied by the trial judge,johnson filed an emergency petition for a continuance in the supreme judicial court of massachusetts.a single justice of that court denied the petition,and the case was called for trial the next day,july.
on the first day of trial,johnson counsel informed the court that johnson desired to make a statement.johnson then acknowledged,yes,i would like to represent myself.and i not ready for trial today.i got knocked out this morning coming up from middleton.i was assaulted by another inmate and knocked out.i mean,i do really know what going on.the judge informed johnson that the trial would continue,and proceeded to engage in a colloquy with johnson regarding his motion to seek new counsel.the judge informed johnson that he had already denied that motion the previous day,and moved on to johnson request to subpoena a witness and obtain a copy of the police report.following this exchange,the judge entered into a discussion with johnson counsel concerning various matters,including the charge for possessing a handgun.johnson participated in this discussion,asking the trial judge whether the gun had been found and,when the judge revealed that it had not,how he could have been charged with the crime.the judge explained that the charge could be proven by witness statements,and johnson raised no further objection.
the trial then moved to jury selection.after the jury was empaneled and sworn,the judge declared a recess.when the session resumed,the judge told counsel that the court officer had received a report from the nurse indicating that the back of johnson head is blown up and that she recommending sic that he be hospitalized.the nurse entered the courtroom and reported that johnson passed out twice and he vomiting and he a little shaky and he does remember,he said he passed out this morning.she suggested that johnson might have a concussion and should be checked out.
the court suspended proceedings for the day,but continued to discuss with counsel matters relating to scheduling and witnesses.in the course of this discussion,the court was informed that two jurors might have known one of the victims.the judge asked defense counsel whether he would waive his client presence during the discussion of this issue.defense counsel responded that,due to the fact that johnson had taken ill,he would waive his client presence.following an unrecorded sidebar discussion,the judge informed the jury that johnson had become ill and that,as a result,the trial would be postponed until the next morning.
johnson was present in the courtroom the following morning.following a discussion of preliminary matters,defense counsel moved for a mistrial,stating that he had been talking to his client earlier and that there were some serious questions here of his mental capacity to assist himself in the conduct of this trial and that there a question as to his competency and mental capacity.the judge denied the motion,stating that the court officer whom he had directed to call the nurse at the detention facility had already informed him that johnson was medically cleared to appear in the courtroom.the trial proceeded for the remainder of the day.after the defense rested and the jury was dismissed,the judge made the following address to counsel 
in light of the issue that was raised this morning,i now having witnessed the entire day proceedings sic,i just want to make some findings for the record,in light of the statement this morning that johnson was not competent to continue with the trial today because of his injury.i just want to state for the record that johnson has been extremely alert all day.he has been writing notes to his counsel.he has been extremely involved and focused on the trial.raising questions,asking his counsel both verbally and in writing to ask certain questions.raising his hand on numerous occasions which i have no problem with.i commend him for doing it and i think he done an excellent job.but there no question in my mind as a matter of fact that the defendant has been quite able to assist his lawyer in conducting the trial here today and in fact on more than numerous occasions,directed his lawyer to ask certain questions,both in writing and verbally.
on the third day of trial,the jury returned a verdict against johnson.before sentencing,johnson asked to address the court.in his remarks,johnson alleged that he did not have a fair trial because two of the jurors may have known one of the victims.the judge responded that he had inquired into the matter and that both jurors had indicated that they would not be influenced by any prior knowledge.the court sentenced johnson to two and a half years on the assault and battery with a dangerous weapons charge and two and a half years for the firearms charge,to be served consecutively.the court gave a suspended sentence of ten years for the assault by means of a dangerous weapons charge,and the remaining convictions were entered and placed on file.
motion for a new trial 
on march,johnson,represented by new counsel,filed a motion for a new trial,alleging,inter alia,that trial counsel had improperly waived his right to be present at jury selection and that he never agreed to let the trial continue after he was taken back to the detention facility after vomiting and fainting on the day the jury was selected.johnson further alleged that,since much of the jury selection process was conducted at sidebar while he remained at the defense table,he was de facto excluded from participating at all.johnson submitted an affidavit in support of his motion,claiming that he was not content with the jury selected and that his trial counsel did not explain that he could keep certain persons off the jury.johnson trial counsel also submitted an affidavit,stating that johnson had not been competent to assist in the jury selection process,and that johnson understanding of the jury selection process was imperfect.the trial counsel added that d uring that time,he was unable to communicate effectively with johnson and,as a result,johnson was unable to understand or participate,at all,in the jury selection process.
on may,the same judge who presided at trial held a hearing on johnson new trial motion.on the issue of johnson participation during jury selection,the judge stated that he specifically remembered seeing johnson confer with his lawyer during the jury selection.though it was not explicitly stated as a basis for the motion for a new trial,the issue of johnson competency arose from counsel response to the judge statement he indicated that despite the judge observations,trial counsel had been unable to communicate with johnson and that johnson had passed out twice during the break following jury selection.
