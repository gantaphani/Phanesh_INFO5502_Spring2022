olgens dragenice,a native and citizen of haiti who is being detained by the secretary of homeland security for removal to haiti pursuant to a final order of the board of immigration appeals,challenges this court jurisdiction to decide his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.dragenice filed his petition in the district court,and that court transferred it to this court under.alternatively,dragenice urges this court to convert his habeas petition,which asserts that he is a national of the united states and therefore not deportable,into a petition under a for review of the board of immigration appeals final order of removal.
section of title,under which the district court transferred dragenice habeas petition to this court,requires that the district court find,among other things,that it lacks jurisdiction and that this court is one in which the habeas petition could originally have been filed.because neither requirement is satisfied in this case,we reverse the order of transfer and remand dragenice habeas petition to the district court for further proceedings.
dragenice entered the united states on april,as a lawful permanent resident.four years later,he was convicted in maryland state court of robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon,theft involving an amount under,and second degree assault.the maryland court sentenced dragenice to three years imprisonment.
following his convictions,the immigration and naturalization service,now the department of homeland security dhs,served dragenice with a notice to appear,charging that he is subject to removal from the united states under a a i because he is an alien convicted of a qualifying crime involving moral turpitude under a a iii because he is an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and under a c because he is an alien convicted of a firearms offense.in the notice to appear,the dhs alleged that dragenice was not a citizen or national of the united states and that he was a native of haiti and a citizen of haiti.
during the course of three hearings,the immigration judge determined that dragenice was deportable based on the facts admitted by him.dragenice testified,however,that he feared being returned to haiti because he would be tortured and incarcerated on an indefinite basis because,among other things,he had committed crimes in the united states.the immigration judge invited dragenice to file an application for withholding of removal and for relief under the convention against torture,which dragenice filed in december.in his application,dragenice filled in the box for present nationality citizenship,stating that he was haitian,and in the box for nationality at birth,stating that he was haitian.he also stated as part of his employment history that he was in the army reserve,walter reed medical center from march to september.
following a fourth hearing before the immigration judge,during which dragenice agreed that he was a native and citizen of haiti and that he was not a citizen of the united states,the immigration judge found,in a written opinion,that dragenice did not dispute the factual allegations about his nationality and citizenship contained in the dhs notice to appear.based on the admitted facts in this case,the immigration judge denied dragenice application for removal and for relief under the convention against torture,ordering that he be removed and deported to haiti.
dragenice filed a timely appeal to the board of immigration appeals bia,alleging as his reason for appeal that the immigration judge failed cautiously to analyze the evidence which established a likelihood of torture at the hands of government officials upon his return to haiti.in his brief in support of his appeal,filed six months after his notice of appeal,dragenice raised for the first time the additional argument that he was a national of the united states and therefore not subject to deportation even if he had committed an aggravated felony.he argued that because he swore allegiance to the united states to become a member of the army the form specified in he is a national of the united states.
before the bia ruled on dragenice appeal,dragenice filed a petition in the district court for a writ of habeas corpus under.in his petition he alleged that he was being detained in a local jail or detention center by the attorney general of the united states now the secretary of homeland security pending deportation from the united states and that his detention for deportation was unlawful because he was not an alien,as described in.rather,as he alleged,he was a national of the united states,having voluntarily enlisted in the army reserve and taken an oath of allegiance to the united states for that purpose.he stated that he was still a member of the army reserve and has not been discharged from his sworn duty.the secretary filed a motion to dismiss dragenice habeas petition,contending that dragenice had not exhausted his administrative remedies and that the district court did not,in any event,have jurisdiction to determine an issue of nationality in the context of a removal proceeding,citing b,which provides that such nationality claims may be reviewed in the first instance only by the courts of appeals.the district court agreed with the secretary,concluding that review of dragenice nationality claim in the context of his removal order must receive initial review in a court of appeals.rather than dismissing dragenice habeas petition,however,the district court elected to transfer the case to this court under the authority of.
after dragenice habeas petition was transferred to this court,the bia entered an order dated april,affirming without opinion the decision of the immigration judge and declaring it to be the final agency determination.after dragenice filed a motion to reopen and reconsider,the bia entered a second order dated october,denying dragenice motion.in its second order,the bia stated 
the respondent also again argues that he is a national of the united states.the respondent has not presented an error in our previous decision regarding this issue.moreover,even considering the respondent arguments in his motion to reconsider,he has not established that he acquired united states nationality under the means provided by the immigration and nationality act.
dragenice did not appeal either of the bia orders by filing a petition for review in this court as provided by.this court thus has before it only dragenice petition for habeas corpus filed in the district court and transferred to this court.
dragenice contends that the district court improperly applied to transfer his habeas petition to this court because the district court erroneously concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over his petition.he argues,relying on ins cyr,d,that the district court misconstrued b in holding that that provision eliminated the district court general habeas jurisdiction when the habeas claim involves the issue of nationality.alternatively,dragenice urges us to treat his habeas petition,as now lodged in this court,as a petition under a for direct review of the dhs removal order,which was entered after he filed his habeas petition in the district court.
the secretary agrees that we are without jurisdiction,but the secretary argues that a petition for review of the bia determination of dragenice nationality must be obtained by filing a direct petition for review in this court under a within days of the dhs final order of removal.the secretary notes that dragenice never filed a petition for review,electing rather to file his habeas petition before his dhs proceedings had been exhausted.thus,the secretary summarizes 
a t the time that he filed his district court petition,he was not yet subject to a final order of removal which this court could have reviewed.hence,this court should find it lacks jurisdiction over this case because the habeas petition challenging petitioner removal proceedings based on his nationality claim was prematurely filed because petitioner had not then exhausted his administrative remedies.
furthermore,even if petitioner could have somehow cured his untimely filed habeas petition by subsequently moving to amen
