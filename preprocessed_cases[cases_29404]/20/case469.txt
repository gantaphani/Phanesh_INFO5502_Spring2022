this appeal concerns a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on an alleged conflict of interest.the claim,arising out of a bizarre factual context,was the basis for the august,judgment of the district court for the eastern district of new york jack weinstein,district judge,granting a petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought by robert eisemann to challenge his new york state sodomy conviction.see eisemann herbert,d.although the ineffective assistance claim is of arguable concern,we conclude that it is ultimately without merit and that the new york courts did not make an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,the threshold for habeas corpus relief established by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,d.we therefore reverse.
background 
demonstrating that truth is often far stranger than fiction,this case involves a father and a son who sodomized the same victim,a trial lawyer who represented both the father and the son,and the disbarment for fraud convictions of both the trial lawyer and the son state court appellate lawyer.
robert eisemann robert was charged with sodomizing a girl on five occasions between and.robert was in a relationship with the girl mother.he was arrested on august,and interrogated by two police detectives after being read his miranda rights.he then signed a statement admitting to sodomy on at least one occasion and to having committed acts with the victim in his sleep.
on the same day that robert was arrested,police also arrested his father,henry eisemann henry,for sodomizing the same victim and her brother.henry also made an incriminating statement.both father and son were indicted on december.henry was accused of counts of sodomy sexual abuse,one count involving the same victim as in robert case and the rest involving her twin brother.robert was indicted on five sodomy counts,all involving the same victim.
henry and robert engaged harold holtman to represent them,although holtman was paid by henry and his wife.holtman turned out to be a poor choice as he was later convicted of fraud and disbarred.see in re harold holtman,dep t.
in december,henry pled guilty to attempted sodomy and received a sentence of years.
robert was represented by both holtman and his associate,victor regan.at the pretrial hearing in august on the admissibility of robert inculpatory statement,regan conducted the defense.robert was tried in october.regan appears to have conducted almost all of the defense,although holtman attended much,if not all,of the proceedings.
during the trial,the child victim testified against robert,doing so with her face turned away from him.the police detectives and the victim mother also testified.
the jury found robert guilty on three of the five sodomy counts.by the time the verdict was rendered,robert had disappeared.the district court found that holtman had instructed robert to flee.robert was sentenced in absentia to a minimum of eight and years and a maximum of years 
in february,the appellate division affirmed robert conviction,rejecting his challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and the admission of his inculpatory statement,but making no mention of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.people eis e mann,dep t.however,the appellate division subsequently granted a writ of coram nobis,vacating its own decision on the ground of ineffective assistance of robert appellate counsel,marvin basson.see people eisemann,dep t.basson later resigned from the bar following his conviction for fraud.see in re marvin basson,dep t.
on a subsequent appeal after new counsel was appointed,the appellate division vacated robert conviction on one of the sodomy counts,but affirmed the remaining counts.people eisemann,dep t.the appellate division found robert claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel to be without merit.id.at,at.leave to appeal was denied by the court of appeals.people eisemann,table.
robert sought relief through habeas corpus on three grounds first,that holtman representation of henry in general deprived robert of effective assistance of counsel and that holtman many violations of professional responsibility rules,especially his representation of robert father,created a conflict that specifically prevented holtman from providing effective assistance second,that robert counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to properly object to the confession and alleged trial errors and third,that robert was deprived of his rights under the confrontation clause because the child victim testified facing away from him at trial.
the district court determined that the confrontation clause claim was not properly preserved for review and that the lack of proper preservation did not result from ineffective assistance of counsel.see eisemann,d at.the district court also ruled that the claims of ineffective assistance unrelated to holtman conflict of interest provided no basis for relief.see id.at.the district court denied a certificate of appealability with regard to these two claims,see id.at,and robert has not challenged either of these rulings in this court.
with respect to the claim of ineffective assistance due to a conflict of interest arising from holtman representation of robert father,the district court ruled that state remedies regarding this claim were properly exhausted.see id.at.on the merits,the district court determined that holtman representation of robert and his father created a conflict of interest and that this conflict adversely affected holtman performance,cuyler sullivan,d,by causing holtman to forgo three defense strategies that were viable and reasonable,eisemann,d at.these were calling henry as a witness,contending that henry confession was coerced,and encouraging robert to accept a plea in exchange for testifying against henry.see id.at.judge weinstein also concluded that holtman had a conflict of interest arising from his fraudulent conduct with respect to the eisemann family,that a claim of ineffective assistance because of this conflict should be deemed exhausted,id.at,and that holtman interest in concealing his massive wrongdoing eclipsed his interest in zealously safeguarding his client rights,id.at.
judge weinstein granted relief solely because of the adverse affect of holtman representation of both father and son,and required robert to be released unless the state retried him within days or took other appropriate action.see id.at.the judgment was stayed pending this appeal.
discussion 
the state raises four principal arguments on appeal first,that the new york courts did not reach a determination that resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d second,that robert representation was not adversely affected by holtman representation of robert father third,that the alternative defense strategies suggested by judge weinstein were not reasonable or even plausible and fourth,that holtman financial misdeeds did not result in a conflict that adversely affected robert representation.
