edward john johnston,iii,a federal prisoner,moves for a certificate of appealability coa,claiming that the government violated his constitutional rights and c when it utilized witnesses who were either paid informants or were provided immunity from prosecution.after both the government and johnston consented to proceed before a magistrate judge,the magistrate judge dismissed on the merits johnston motion to vacate,set aside or correct sentence filed pursuant to and also denied his motion for a coa.because we conclude that the consensual delegation of motions to magistrate judges violates article iii of the constitution,we vacate the judgment and remand the case to the district court.
background 
johnston was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine,cocaine base,and marijuana.he was sentenced to months of imprisonment,five years of supervised release,a fine,and a special assessment.on direct appeal,we affirmed johnston conviction and sentence.the supreme court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari.see johnston united states,d.
johnston timely filed a motion under,alleging that the district court erred in finding that kimela lomax testimony was a sufficiently reliable basis for calculating johnston sentence the government violated c by paying lomax between and for her testimony and by agreeing not to prosecute roy patterson in exchange for his testimony and the prosecutor engaged in misconduct during the trial.johnston and the government both consented to proceed before a magistrate judge pursuant to c.the magistrate judge issued a memorandum and order denying johnston motion.johnston timely filed a notice of appeal,and he also filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis ifp on appeal.the magistrate judge construed the notice of appeal as a motion for a coa and denied it,but granted johnston ifp motion.thereafter,johnston filed the instant coa motion.
ii.discussion 
before considering the substance of johnston motion for a coa,we must first address whether the motion is properly before us.although neither party has challenged the magistrate judge prerogative to finally adjudicate johnston motion,we have a special obligation to satisfy ourselves not only of our own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review,even though the parties are prepared to concede it.united transp.union foster,cir quoting steel citizens for a better env t,d johnston and the government consented to proceed before a magistrate judge with respect to his motion.whether their consent to proceed before the magistrate judge was sufficient to confer jurisdiction depends on a analysis.united states dees,cir.first,we must ask whether congress,in passing legislation governing magistrate judges,intended for them to perform the duty in question.id.in applying that first step,we should avoid interpreting any legislation governing magistrate judges in such a fashion as to engender constitutional issues if a reasonable alternative posing no such issues is evident.see gomez united states,d commodity futures trading comm schor,d.but if such an alternative is not possible,then we must next consider whether the delegation of the duty to a magistrate judge offends the principles of article iii of the constitution.dees,at.we review each step in turn.
section is a civil matter for purposes of c 
section of title recites the jurisdiction and statutory authority of a magistrate judge.subsection c provides that upon the consent of the parties,a magistrate judge may conduct any or all proceedings in a jury or nonjury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in the case when specially designated to exercise such jurisdiction by the district court or the courts she serves.c.here,the parties consented to proceed before the magistrate judge and the district court had specially designated that a magistrate judge could oversee the present kind of litigation.see general order,at.the question remains whether a proceeding constitutes a civil matter for the purposes of c.
very few courts have directly addressed this precise issue.in united states bryson,cir,the fourth circuit indirectly found that a proceeding is a civil matter for purposes of c when it concluded in dicta that a magistrate judge could adjudicate a proceeding under c.in reaching the latter conclusion and,consequently,the determination that a proceeding is a civil matter for purposes of c,the fourth circuit referenced various decisions from other circuits,including ours,which implicitly held that magistrate judges could adjudicate habeas petitions under and via c.see id.at see also orsini wallace,cir t he plain language of section c indicates that magistrates,upon consent of the parties and reference by the district court,have jurisdiction to order entry of judgment in a habeas case.bullock lucas,cir reviewing appeal from magistrate judge disposition of habeas proceeding conducted under c,modified and remanded sub,cabana bullock,d moore tate,cir same turner henman,cir same sinclair wainwright,cir same.habeas petitions have customarily been viewed as civil in nature.hilton braunskill,d schlanger seamans,d.in referring to those other circuits decisions about magistrate judges oversight of habeas petitions,the fourth circuit essentially adverted to the similarity between and habeas petitions and implied that such a similarity signified that a motion is a civil matter that can properly be delegated to a magistrate judge under c.
in united states hayman,the supreme court discussed the history of the writ of habeas corpus in america and the evolution of.id.at.the court explained that the distinction between and habeas corpus proceedings arose in when the judicial conference persuaded congress that many of the problems surrounding the administration of federal prisoners habeas proceedings,such as the availability of a prisoner records,could be prevented if such proceedings were brought in the sentencing court rather than in the court of the district in which the prisoner was confined.id.at kaufman united states,d.section was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another and more convenient forum.hayman.at.
although we have not addressed the specific issue before us,we have generally construed a proceeding as being civil in nature.see united states young,cir observing that a proceeding is governed by the limit of federal rule of appellate procedure a because such a proceeding is civil united states buitrago,cir claims brought under are civil actions governed by the appeal period of fed.a.united states cooper,cir noting that to the extent a coram nobis motion is like a motion,the former is civil in nature,abrogated on other grounds by smith barry,d.on the other hand,we have at times suggested that motions are conceptually distinguishable from habeas proceedings,such as petitions,for certain discrete purposes.see united states brierton,cir,unpublished concluding that motions are distinct from habeas petitions,precluding application of the suspension clause see also turner johnson,cir.finding in dicta brierton to be persuasive,cert.denied,d.indeed,as enacted recognized some distinction from habeas corpus.see authorizing an application for writ of habeas corpus if a motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of a prisoner detention brendan randall,comment,united states cooper the writ of error coram nobis and the morgan footnote paradox.the brierton panel relied on the advisory committee note to rule of the rules governing section proceedings for the united states district courts to support its determination that the suspension clause did not apply to proceedings because those proceedings were not habeas petitions.the advisory committee note surmised that a motion under is a further step in the movant criminal case and not a separate civil action.rule of the rules governing proceedings advisory committee note.
clearly,if we were to follow narrowly the advisory committee note statement,then the issue would appear resolved.but other courts and commentators have suggested against overly relying on the advisory committee note regarding any distinction between a motion and a habeas proceeding.see united states means,cir united states simmonds,cir united states nahodil,cir see also charles alan wright,federal practice and procedure,at observing that,prior to the adoption of the rules governing,proceedings had widely been presumed to be independent civil actions and noting the limited amount of legislative history in support of the advisory committee note position.instead of discerning an inviolable distinction with definite parameters,many of those courts have concluded that a motion is a hybrid,with characteristics indicative of both civil and criminal proceedings.see means,at simmonds,at.thus,those courts have not placed undue importance on the advisory committee note but have realized that t he precise nature of proceedings remains highly dependent on the proceedings context.id.at.
we,likewise,have found consistency in defining proceedings an elusive task.compare young,with united states cole,cir holding that the prison litigation reform act procedures concerning payment of fees by prisoners seeking to proceed in forma pauperis in civil suits not applicable to proceedings.accordingly,we do not believe that the advisory committee note mandates a finding that a is not a civil matter for purposes of c rather,the determination of whether a proceeding is civil or criminal in nature is dependent on the context of the proceedings,including the legislative and statutory framework in which the proceeding must be examined.
here,the context of the issue centers on the jurisdictional provisions pertaining to magistrate judges.congress amended the federal magistrates act in to include c,the section on a magistrate judge jurisdiction over consensual civil matters.it did so to improve access to the federal courts.conf,at.in particular,congress sought to protect the from the vicissitudes of adjudication delay and expense and to help the federal court system cope and prevent inattention to a mounting queue of civil cases pushed to the back of the docket,at.that intent and legislative history suggest that the terms civil matter in c should be broadly interpreted to allow for increased availability of adjudications by magistrate judges.consequently,at least with respect to proceedings,the scope of c reveals that such proceedings are civil in nature.additional support for this conclusion may be derived from b,which provides authority to magistrate judges to conduct hearings and to submit to the district court proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition,by the district court,of applications for relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses.see b b.although under b a magistrate judge does not have authority to enter a final judgment,the grant of authority to review matters pertaining to all relief,and not just habeas petitions,seems to reflect a general legislative bias towards allowing magistrate judge oversight of proceedings.in light of that statutory framework and legislative intent,we hold that for purposes of c,a proceeding is a civil matter over which congress intended magistrate judges to exercise jurisdiction upon consent of the parties.
article iii strictures preclude delegation of proceedings to magistrate judges 
even though proceedings may be presumed civil in nature for purposes of c,we must still determine whether delegating those proceedings to magistrate judges comports with the strictures of article iii.article iii,section of the constitution provides that the judicial power of the united states,shall be vested in one supreme court,and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish and that t he judges,both of the supreme and inferior courts,shall hold their offices during good behaviour,and shall,at stated times,receive for their services,a compensation,which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.this constitutional provision serves two purposes to safeguard litigants right to have claims decided before judges who are free from potential domination by other branches of government and to protect the role of the independent judiciary within the constitutional scheme of tripartite government.schor.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the former concerns a defendant personal right to have his case heard by an article iii judge.dees,at.that right may be waived id.the second purpose pertains to certain structural guarantees which ensure respect for principles.id.article iii,section seeks to ensure such respect by barring congressional attempts to transfer jurisdiction to iii tribunals for the purpose of emasculating constitutional courts,and thereby preventing the encroachment or aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other.schor.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.when these article iii guarantees are at issue,consent or waiver by the parties to proceed before a iii officer diminishes but does not eliminate the constitutional concerns associated with the delegation of judicial authority to iii tribunals because the guarantees serve institutional interests that the parties can not be expected to protect.see id.at.because johnston consented to the use of a magistrate judge in his case,thereby waiving any personal right he may have had to have his case reviewed by an article iii judge,the only matter before us is whether the delegation of the motion pursuant to c offended the structural guarantees of article iii.
the supreme court has never directly addressed the constitutionality of civil trial authority of magistrate judges,but it has made passing reference to the authority of such judges to preside over civil jury trials with the consent of the parties under c without commenting upon its constitutionality in gomez united states,d,and later again in peretz united states,d.see magistrate judges division of the administrative office of the united states courts,a constitutional analysis of magistrate judge authority.on the other hand,almost all of the circuit courts,including ours,have specifically addressed that issue and concluded that magistrate judges jurisdiction over civil cases with the consent of the parties does not violate the constitution.see puryear ede,cir bell beckwith united states,cir gairola virginia dep t of,cir auld chroma graphics,fields washington metro.area transit,geras lafayette display fixtures,cir lehman.kuhn loeb,clark oil refining,cir collins foreman,cir goldstein kelleher,cir campbell wainwright,cir pacemaker diagnostic clinic,instromedix,cir en banc united states,cir united states dobey,cir quoting favorably from pacemaker and collins.in puryear,we summarily found c to be constitutional,referring to four decisions by our sister courts pacemaker,goldstein,collins,and.see puryear,at.of those four decisions,the seminal one for purposes of article iii analysis is pacemaker,an opinion authored by,now justice kennedy.sitting en banc,the ninth circuit noted two concerns raised by c whether,by providing for reference of court cases to magistrate judges,congress invaded the power of a coordinate branch or permitted an improper abdication of that branch central authority and whether the requirement of entry of judgment by a iii jurist improperly directs the judiciary in the performance of its duties.pacemaker,at.to evaluate those concerns,the ninth circuit set forth the following standard did the statute prevent or substantially impair performance by the judiciary of its essential role under the constitution id.if the essential,constitutional role of the judiciary is to be maintained,there must be both the appearance and the reality of control by article iii judges over the interpretation,declaration,and application of federal law.id.that control must be more than simple appellate review.id.concluding that the statute covering magistrate judges jurisdiction invests the article iii judiciary with extensive administrative control over the management,composition,and operation of the magistrate judge system,the pacemaker court found no constitutional objection.id.
assuming that motions are civil matters for purposes of c,we should be able to rely on puryear and pacemaker,complete the syllogism that has been established,and conclude that the delegation of motions to magistrate judges is constitutional.that is,because motions are civil matters and because consensual delegation of civil matters to magistrate judges has been found to be constitutional,delegation of motions is also constitutional.but as we previously noted about motions,what may seem so logical and straightforward is not always the ineluctable result.at least for the purposes of article iii analysis,a motion does not easily comport with the average civil case or even another proceeding such as a petition and,consequently,presents three major problems besides those problems already in the opinions on consensual delegation of civil cases.
first,unlike the average civil case or a proceeding,a motion directly questions the validity of a prior federal court ruling.the average civil case involves a dispute over the rights and obligations of the litigants to the case and does not generally concern prior legal rulings by another judge.section proceedings do attack prior judgments,but they pertain to state court criminal cases.as such,in proceedings,concerns over comity and federalism are more pronounced than any concerns over the structural guarantees of article iii.that is especially true when one considers that few states,if any,have the lifetime tenure and undiminishable compensation,which form the bulwark of the judiciary quality and independence so integral to article iii.under,a federal prisoner may move to vacate,set aside,or correct a sentence that was imposed by a federal judge,and principles of res judicata do not apply in such a proceeding,see united states reyes,cir.if the parties to a motion consent to proceed before a magistrate judge,that magistrate judge could attack the validity of an article iii judge rulings.such an act clearly raises article iii concerns because judges without lifetime tenure and undiminishable compensation would have controlling authority.see,james woodward michael penick,expanded utilization of federal magistrate judges lessons from the eastern district of missouri,louis,finding awkward and a magistrate judge disposition of a proceeding because such an assignment to a magistrate judge would empower a subordinate judicial officer to review and perhaps vacate or modify a sentence that had been ordered by an article iii judge.
on the other hand,we have previously held that once the parties provide consent and the district court specifically designates a magistrate judge to conduct the civil proceedings,the magistrate judge is not bound by the prior opinions expressed by the district court in the case.see cooper brookshire,cir charles alan wright,arthur miller,richard marcus,federal practice and procedure,at ed.certain rulings by a presiding judge are inherently subject to reconsideration,such as limits on discovery.should parties consent to proceedings before a magistrate judge after the assigned district judge has made such a ruling,the magistrate judge must have authority to modify the order.see generally hill city of pontotoc,cir noting that judges of coordinate jurisdiction will defer to another interlocutory rulings out of deference,not obedience.but see taylor national group of companies,finding that a magistrate judge jurisdiction is not merged with that of the district court to vest the magistrate with authority to reconsider and set aside a prior decision of the district court.we may,however,distinguish cooper from cases involving motions as cooper was a civil action and concerned the overturning of the district court statute of limitations ruling.at.by vacating under a district court criminal sentence,a magistrate judge does not merely overturn another judge civil ruling instead,she directly places herself in the murky confines of federal criminal law and procedure,which in and of itself may violate article iii.see infra.thus,although a magistrate judge may have the authority to reconsider a district court prior decision in a civil case,that does not necessarily mean that a magistrate judge has the authority to do the same in a proceeding upon receiving the parties consent.
even if the ability of a magistrate judge to overturn an article iii jurist prior ruling does not raise article iii issues,the notion that a proceeding is a further step in the movant criminal case,see rule of the rules governing proceedings advisory committee note,means that the consensual delegation of such a proceeding may unwittingly embroil a magistrate judge in the unconstitutional conduct of a felony trial,raising the second major problem.one guiding principle of our previous article iii analysis has been that we doubt that a iii judge can preside over a felony trial without violating the strictures of article iii dees,at.that is because a felony trial is a complex affair requiring close oversight of delicate constitutional questions a district court can not adequately review a magistrate judge actions in an entire felony trial and by giving away critical criminal jurisdiction,federal judges risk devitalizing their coordinate branch of government,thereby upsetting our constitutional balance id.thus,whenever an act delegated to a magistrate judge encroaches upon a district court exclusive felony trial domain,article iii concerns move to the forefront.id.no one seriously questions that the issue of sentencing is an integral part of the felony criminal process.see,gardner florida,d describing sentencing as a critical stage of the criminal proceeding.admittedly,the supreme court has allowed for the consensual delegation of voir dire,another integral component of the felony trial.peretz.at.likewise,we have concluded that the delegation of plea allocutions is proper and does not violate article iii.dees,at.but in the case of voir dire,a district court retains the ultimate decision about whether to empanel the selected jury and,consequently,less article iii concerns exist.id.at.as for plea allocutions,they are more ministerial in nature and do not form an essential component of the actual trial.id.at.sentencings are not ministerial in nature and require the legal judgment and acumen of a learned jurist,who may,at times must,do the unpopular and,therefore,may need the shield of independence afforded article iii jurists.accordingly,in our view,the act of sentencing does not compare with voir dire or plea allocutions for purposes of article iii.therefore,if a magistrate judge were unable to do felony sentencings,then it would be odd for such a judge to have the power under to resentence or to even vacate a prior sentence resulting from a felony conviction.
third and finally,the consensual delegation of proceedings under c presents reviewability problems severe enough to create the impression that magistrate judges are not adjuncts,but are independent of article iii control.the supreme court and our sister courts have consistently asserted that the ability of article iii district courts to control and review a magistrate judge decision provides compelling support for the constitutionality of increased magistrate judge participation in the federal court system.see peretz.at northern pipeline constr.marathon pipe line,d united states raddatz,d blackmun,concurring dees,at geras,at collins,at pacemaker,at,at.for example,the judges of the district courts have the authority to appoint magistrate judges and may remove them for cause.see a i.the district court must specially designate the magistrate judge before consensual delegation of civil matters may occur.id.c.and upon a showing of good cause,the district court has the power to vacate the reference of a civil matter.id.at c see also charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure,at ed.the power of the district judge to vacate a reference is an important feature of the legitimacy of section c referrals under article iii.thus,the argument has run that the activities of the magistrate judge do not endanger the independence of the judiciary because the magisterial scheme allows for a sufficient amount of control and rev
