peter lewis filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus contending that his illinois conviction for residential burglary should be vacated based on several alleged constitutional violations.the district court dismissed his petition,concluding that lewis had procedurally defaulted each of his constitutional claims and that federal review of these claims was therefore barred.we agree and affirm.
according to the state evidence,lewis burglarized the hyde park residence of three university of chicago students in the early morning hours of november.lewis fled after two of the apartment inhabitants saw him and screamed.armed with their description of the burglar,police apprehended lewis approximately minutes later.lewis was taken back to the apartment,where both of the victims identified him as the burglar.that identification apparently was based to some degree on the clothing that lewis was wearing and a perceived match between lewis jeans and a stray button that was found in the burglarized apartment.
a jury subsequently convicted lewis of residential burglary,and the trial judge ordered him to serve a prison term of years.lewis took an appeal to the illinois appellate court,raising a single issue having to do with the trial court handling of jury voir dire after one of the prospective jurors disclosed that she had expressed an opinion about the case to other members of the venire.exs.finding no merit in that issue,the appellate court affirmed lewis conviction.people lewis,order,d,ex.d.the illinois supreme court denied his pro se petition for leave to appeal.
on september,lewis filed a pro se petition for relief,asserting principally that his counsel at trial and on direct appeal had been constitutionally ineffective in a variety of respects.ex.g.in addition,lewis alleged that authorities in advance of trial had improperly destroyed the clothes he was wearing at the time of his arrest,depriving him of evidence that would have helped to establish his innocence.id.at.among the claims of ineffectiveness were four claims that lewis later would assert in his habeas petition a his trial counsel failed to subpoena and examine the clothing that he wore at the time of his arrest,before that clothing was destroyed id.at b counsel did not seek to exclude evidence of the victims identification of him as the burglar id.at,c counsel failed to object to the destruction of his clothing id.at and d counsel neglected to call certain exculpatory witnesses to testify on his behalf id.at.on november,the trial court summarily dismissed the petition as frivolous and patently without merit.ex.h at.in its oral ruling,the court specifically addressed only one of the claims that lewis had made in his petition.this was a claim that lewis trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call a chicago police detective to testify that the victims had been unable to identify lewis at the some minutes after the burglary took place.lewis contended that a police report,which he had attached to his petition,confirmed that the victims had been unable to identify him.the trial court disagreed 
he is just wrong.that is not what it states in this report at all.if i take what lewis states in his petition as true,maybe it would be grounds for a hearing.but h e has included in support of that something that contradicts this.and as i say,i recall the trial in any event.so the petition is meritless and will be dismissed.
on november,four days after the trial court dismissed lewis original petition and almost certainly before lewis received notice of that ruling,lewis again pro se submitted a motion to amend his petition.ex.i.in that motion,lewis sought leave to raise a number of new claims that he had not asserted in the original petition.among these claims was the contention that lewis appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to contend on direct appeal that the jury selection process had deprived lewis of his rights under batson kentucky,d.ex.i at d.because the motion to amend was filed after the trial court had already dismissed lewis original petition,it was treated as a successive petition,and consistent with that treatment we shall refer to it as such.the trial court summarily dismissed the successive petition on december.ex.
lewis separately appealed the dismissals of both his original and successive petitions.the appeals were not consolidated,and they proceeded on separate but parallel tracks through the illinois appellate court.the cook county public defender office was appointed to represent lewis in both appeals.
in the first appeal,from the summary dismissal of lewis original petition,lewis,through his appointed counsel,pursued only one of the claims asserted in that petition.the appeal focused on the same claim that the trial court had remarked upon in dismissing the claim that lewis trial counsel had improperly failed to call a police officer to testify that the victims had been unable to identify him at the.lewis counsel contended that because this claim presented the gist of a potentially meritorious constitutional argument,the trial court should have appointed counsel and conducted further proceedings rather than summarily dismissing this claim along with the others raised in the petition.ex.
on march,the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of this claim.like the trial court,the appellate court reasoned that the police report attached to lewis petition undermined his allegation that the victims of the burglary had been unable to identify him at the.consequently,there was no reason to believe that the police detective who witnessed the would have provided testimony that was helpful to lewis.people lewis,order,d,ex.
in the second appeal,from the summary dismissal of lewis successive petition,the cook county public defender sought the appellate court leave to withdraw as lewis counsel pursuant to pennsylvania finley,d.ex.n.in the defender view,lewis had no meritorious argument to make in support of reversing the dismissal of his successive petition.among other things,the defender noted that the illinois hearing act contemplated the filing of a single petition for relief by the petitioner.id.at.counsel also pointed out that if lewis prevailed in the first appeal,from the dismissal of his original petition,he would be given the opportunity to amend that petition.id.at.
lewis filed a brief in opposition to his counsel finley motion.in that brief,lewis listed a host of claims that,in his view,were meritorious and that he believed the appellate court ought to address.among those claims were several that lewis had set forth in his original petition,including his claim that the prosecution had improperly destroyed exculpatory evidence the clothing he was wearing at the time of his arrest ex.o at,and his claims of attorney ineffectiveness based on his trial counsel failure to examine his clothing before it was destroyed and counsel failure to contact and call to testify certain witnesses who allegedly would have given exculpatory testimony id.at.
in an order issued on february,the illinois appellate court granted the cook county public defender leave to withdraw as lewis counsel and affirmed the dismissal of lewis successive petition.people lewis,order,d,ex.
we have carefully reviewed the record in this case,the aforesaid brief in support of the public defender motion to withdraw,and defendant response in compliance with the mandate of the finley decision and find no issues of arguable merit.therefore,the motion of the public defender for leave to withdraw as counsel is allowed.
the judgment of the circuit court of cook county is affirmed.

lewis subsequently obtained leave from the illinois supreme court to file a late petition for leave to appeal.ex.q.that petition,along with a subsequent motion to amend the petition,contained only the number of his first appeal.exs.r,however,those documents referred to the second appeal and the issues raised therein,and lewis attached to the petition itself the orders issued by the appellate court in the second as well as the first appeal.the order allowing lewis to file the petition also referenced the numbers of both appeals.see ex.q.the illinois supreme court ultimately denied the petition.ex.
having exhausted his state court remedies,lewis filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court.in that petition as fleshed out by the memorandum that he subsequently filed in reply to the state answer,lewis asserted four basic claims that suggestive procedures tainted the identifications of the burglary victims that the state had improperly destroyed exculpatory evidence the clothing lewis wore at the time of his arrest in violation of brady maryland,d that the state exercise of peremptory challenges in jury selection violated batson,and that the trial court had erred in not answering certain factual questions about the case that the jury posed to the court during its deliberations and that he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel in various respects lewis claims of attorney ineffectiveness collectively,claim were based on four asserted omissions by his trial counsel a the failure to examine the clothing evidence before the state improperly destroyed it,which examination,according to lewis,would have shown that the button found in the burglarized apartment did not match the jeans lewis was wearing b the failure to seek suppression of the victims identification of him as the burglar c the failure to object to,and seek appropriate sanctions for,the state destruction of the clothing and d the failure to call certain witnesses who allegedly would have provided exculpatory testimony.
the district court ultimately dismissed lewis petition in its entirety on the ground that he had procedurally defaulted each of his claims.in the first of two opinions,the court found that lewis had failed to properly assert claims,or either on direct appeal from his conviction or in the proceedings and had therefore defaulted those claims moreover,he had not established cause for the default or resulting prejudice that would permit the court to overlook the default.lewis sternes,c,wl,at.as for the four grounds of attorney ineffectiveness alleged in claim,the state in its answer had asserted that two of these four grounds likewise had been procedurally defaulted.the court agreed as to one of these b,based on his trial counsel failure to move to suppress the victim ordered the state to supplement its answer by responding to the merits of the remaining three grounds.id.at.instead,the state,after first allowing the deadline for its supplemental answer to pass and then belatedly securing an extension of time over lewis objection,filed a supplemental memorandum urging the court to dismiss the three remaining claims of ineffectiveness,contending that lewis had procedurally defaulted all of them.the district court ordered this memorandum stricken,finding that the state had failed to comply with its order to supplement its answer and respond to the merits of these claims.the court did permit the state to assert its belated procedural default arguments in addition to addressing the merits of these claims,although the court reserved the right to determine whether the state had waived the procedural default arguments by not raising them in its original answer.id.the state complied by filing a supplemental memorandum that both answered the three remaining claims of ineffectiveness and posited reasons why,in its view,lewis had procedurally defaulted those claims.
after reviewing the state supplemental memorandum,the court agreed that lewis had procedurally defaulted the remaining instances of alleged a,c,and d.lewis sternes,c,wl.it reasoned that although lewis had,for the most part,asserted the claims in his original petition for relief he had not properly raised them in his appeal from the dismissal of that petition.id.at.the court rejected lewis assertion that the state had waived these procedural defaults by not raising them in its original answer to the habeas petition.the court indicated that it was unwilling to find such a waiver in view of the fact that federal review of lewis claims had not proceeded beyond the initial stage and the rules governing habeas corpus proceedings contemplated amendment of pleadings as appropriate.id.
the district court later agreed to certify for appeal the question whether it is proper to permit the state to belatedly assert instances of procedural default not raised in its original answer.it also certified for appeal the question whether lewis habeas claims were,indeed,procedurally defaulted.lewis sternes,c,wl.
the district court determination that lewis procedurally defaulted each of the claims asserted in his habeas petition was a legal determination,abela martin,cir villot varner,cir.our review of the lower court decision is therefore de novo.page frank,cir braun powell,cir.
inherent in the habeas petitioner obligation to exhaust his state court remedies before seeking relief in habeas corpus,see b a,is the duty to fairly present his federal claims to the state courts.baldwin reese,d boerckel,d picard connor,d.only if the state courts have had the first opportunity to hear the claim sought to be vindicated in the federal habeas proceeding does it make sense to speak of the exhaustion of state remedies.id.at.at.fair presentment in turn requires the petitioner to assert his federal claim through one complete round of review,either on direct appeal of his conviction or in proceedings.boerckel,at.at.this means that the petitioner must raise the issue at each and every level in the state court system,including levels at which review is discretionary rather than mandatory.ibid.
a habeas petitioner who has exhausted his state court remedies without properly asserting his federal claim at each level of state court review has procedurally defaulted that claim.see id.at.at see also,howard,cir detella,cir.a procedural default will bar federal habeas relief unless the petitioner can demonstrate both cause for and prejudice stemming from that default,wainwright sykes,d,or he can establish that the denial of relief will result in a miscarriage of justice,murray carrier,d.cause for a default is ordinarily established by showing that some type of external impediment prevented the petitioner from presenting his federal claim to the state courts.id.at.at.prejudice is established by showing that the violation of the petitioner federal rights worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage,infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.united states frady,d emphasis in original.in order to show,alternatively,that a miscarriage of justice would result if habeas relief is foreclosed,the petitioner must show that he is actually innocent of the offense for which he was convicted,that no reasonable juror would have found him guilty of the crime but for the error s he attributes to the state court.schlup delo,d.
lewis procedurally defaulted claims tainted identifications and batson violation.he did not pursue either of these claims,as such,on direct appeal or in the proceeding.it is true that during the proceeding,lewis cited his trial appellate counsel failure to pursue these claims in support of his claims of attorney ineffectiveness.however,an assertion that one counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue particular constitutional issues is a claim separate and independent of those issues.a meritorious claim of attorney ineffectiveness might amount to cause for the failure to present an issue to a state court,but the fact that the ineffectiveness claim was raised at some point in state court does not mean that the state court was given the opportunity to address the underlying issue that the attorney in question neglected to raise.it is undisputed that lewis did not raise claims or in state court.consequently,unless lewis can demonstrate one of the two bases discussed above for excusing his default,cause and prejudice,or a miscarriage of justice,habeas relief on those claims is foreclosed to him.
as lewis suggests and the state concedes,if his trial his appellate attorneys were ineffective for failing to present these claims at trial and on direct appeal of his conviction,then their representation might supply cause for his procedural default of these claims.however,a claim of ineffectiveness must itself have been fairly presented to the state courts before it can establish cause for a procedural default of another claim.edwards carpenter,d.as we conclude below,lewis procedurally defaulted his ineffectiveness claims in the illinois courts.consequently,his attorneys alleged ineffectiveness can not excuse the default of claims and.lewis alternatively has not attempted to demonstrate the possibility that a miscarriage of justice will occur if these claims are not heard.accordingly,the merits of these claims can not be entertained on habeas review.
claim the brady claim stands on a somewhat different footing.lewis original petition did contain an argument that the state improperly destroyed the clothing that he wore at the time of his arrest and that the destroyed clothing might have established his innocence.ex.g at.this argument fell within a section of the petition that lewis entitled ineffective assistance of trial counsel id.at and consistent with that heading,most of the arguments in that section were focused on steps that his trial attorney had failed to take and arguments that he had failed to advance.in contrast to those other arguments,however,this particular contention did not advance a theory as to why lewis attorney was ineffective for failing to raise this issue it simply suggested that the evidence was improperly destroyed.as the state concedes state br.at,given a liberal construction,the petition could be interpreted to be making a brady claim proper,as opposed to a claim that lewis attorney was ineffective for failing to make such a claim.as lewis prepared the petition without the assistance of counsel,we owe it a generous interpretation.haines kerner,d.
however,after raising claim in his petition,lewis failed to pursue that claim through one complete round of review in the illinois courts.he did eventually raise the claim with the appellate court,but in the wrong appellate proceeding.the problem here emanates from the fact that there were two separate appeals in the process,the first arising from the summary dismissal of lewis original petition,and a second appeal arising from the dismissal of his successive petition.lewis did not raise claim in the appeal challenging the dismissal of his original petition,where the claim had been raised.lewis was represented by counsel in that appeal,and his attorney chose to raise only a single issue having nothing whatsoever to do with the brady claim.only in the second appeal,from the denial of his successive petition,did lewis mention the brady claim.recall that in that appeal,lewis appointed counsel moved to withdraw from representing him pursuant to pennsylvania finley,asserting that lewis had no meritorious grounds for appeal.in response to his attorney motion,lewis filed a brief contending that he did have meritorious grounds for appeal,including his claim that the state had improperly destroyed evidence.ex.o at.but this claim was plainly beyond the scope of the second appeal lewis had not raised the brady claim in the successive petition,and the scope of the second appeal was limited to whether or not the trial court had properly disposed of that petition,as opposed to his original petition.lewis was obliged to raise the brady claim in the first appeal,dealing with the dismissal of his original petition.having failed to do so,he procedurally defaulted the claim.
lewis suggests that it is unduly formalistic and unfair to him to compartmentalize the two appeals in this way.among other things,he notes that the two appeals were pending before the appellate court at the same time,the appellate court took note of the fact that there were two appeals see people lewis,supra.order at ex.at,and,finally,when the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of lewis successive petition,the court noted that it did so after reviewing both lewis brief as well as the entire record below lewis,order at ex.at.
we disagree.although the two appeals certainly were related in the sense that they arose from a single proceeding in the trial court,and although they proceeded on parallel tracks through the appellate court,they nonetheless remained distinct they were filed separately based on two different orders of the trial court,they were briefed separately in the first instance,by a public defender on lewis behalf,and in the second instance,by lewis himself when his appointed counsel sought the court permission to withdraw,and they were decided by separate orders.the appeals were never formally or functionally consolidated in such a way that the parties were invited or permitted to effectively merge the two appeals in their briefing.on the contrary,the documents filed by the parties reflect their understanding that the two appeals were distinct.see ex.k at lewis opening brief in first appeal the supplemental petition filed on november,and denied on december,is not part of this appeal.ex.n at finley motion noting that lewis had filed two separate appeals,attachment lewis second pro se notice of appeal noting that the order appealed from was the order of december,described as post conviction petition amended order.
in short,lewis could not properly raise claim in the second appeal from the denial of his successive petition as it was beyond the limited scope of that appeal he defaulted that claim when his attorney failed to raise that brady claim in the first appeal,from the denial of his original petition.lewis has not established any basis for excusing this default.therefore,as with claims and,habeas relief on claim is foreclosed.
we turn now to the attorney ineffectiveness claims.claims a d all were set forth in lewis original petition.the pertinent question,however,is whether lewis properly appealed the summary dismissal of these claims.at this juncture,lewis is not pursuing relief on claim b,leaving us to consider claims a,c,and d.we agree with the district court that lewis procedurally defaulted each of these claims.
before going further,we pause to consider whether,as lewis asserts,the district court improperly allowed the state to raise in an untimely manner several instances of procedural default.as we noted earlier,in its original answer to lewis habeas petition,the state only contended that two of the four ineffectiveness claims,claims a and b,had been procedurally defaulted.the district court agreed as to claim b,but disagreed as to claim a.it then ordered the state to file an answer responding to the merits of claims a,c,and d.instead,the state,after first missing the deadline for that answer and then securing an extension of time from the court,filed a supplemental memorandum asserting a new theory as to why claim a had been procedurally defaulted and contending for the first time that claims c and d also had been defaulted.the district court ordered that memorandum stricken,reasoning that it did not address the merits of these claims,as the court had directed.however,the court allowed the state to file a new supplemental answer in which it both responded to the merits of the claims and asserted the new procedural default arguments.ultimately,the court found these procedural default arguments to be well taken,rejecting lewis contention that the state had waived these arguments by not asserting them in its original answer to the petition.
the district court acted well within its authority to recognize procedural default arguments not raised in the state original answer as lewis rightly points out,a petitioner procedural default does not implicate the jurisdiction of a federal habeas court.rather,it is an affirmative defense,and like other defenses it is one that the state can waive.trest cain,d.but waiver in the true sense occurs when a party intentionally relinquishes a known right,perruquet briley,wl,at cir.one might infer that the state has implicitly waived a procedural default defense when it has asserted that defense as to some of the petitioner claims but not as to the particular claim in question.id.at coll.cases.that is not what occurred here.although the state failed to set forth in its original answ
