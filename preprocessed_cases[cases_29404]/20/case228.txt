this appeal from the district court dismissal of a petition for habeas corpus questions whether d which bars court review of a final order of removal unless the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies as of to such petitions.the district court held that it does and we agree.
background 
the facts are not in dispute.appellant,constantine sayyah,an iranian national,was detained by the immigration and naturalization service ins on march,after having illegally entered the united states from canada,where he had been living in temporary asylum.the canadian government subsequently denied his application for permanent asylum and refused to permit him to return to canada.the ins began removal proceedings.on november,sayyah filed an asylum application with the boston immigration court.on june,sayyah appeared without counsel before immigration judge ragno.after a hearing,judge ragno determined that sayyah was in the united states illegally and ordered him removed as soon as a country could be found that would receive him.until removal,he was to remain in custody.based on statements made by sayyah at the hearing,judge ragno ruled that sayyah had waived his applications for asylum,protection under the convention against torture,and stay of removal,and that he had consented to removal and waived his right to appeal to the board of immigration appeals bia.sayyah subsequently complained that his waivers and consent to deportation were prompted by judge ragno rude and abusive treatment at the hearing.
on february,sayyah filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.in it,he asserted,inter alia,that judge ragno had behaved in a biased and abusive manner,depriving sayyah of his right to due process of law on june,counsel was appointed for sayyah.on june,sayyah was released from detention following the supreme court decision in zadvydas davis,d detention of an alien following final order of removal allowed only for such time as is reasonably necessary to secure the alien removal.
sayyah release did not last long.on november,sayyah was reincarcerated for,among other reasons,getting angry with his deportation officer and stating,in effect,that people become terrorists when very angry and that he was very angry.again,he was to remain in custody pending removal.
in response to sayyah habeas corpus petition,the ins,on july,moved to have sayyah claims reopened with his original immigration judge,judge ragno,for the purpose of allowing him an opportunity to appeal to the bia judge ragno earlier decision.sayyah refused to join in this motion.
on july,sayyah filed in the district court a memorandum and an emergency motion for hearing and order of release,arguing that the reopening of his case should not be allowed to moot the claims set forth in his habeas corpus petition.sayyah further insisted that his detention violated zadvydas and ins rules because it exceeded the presumptive period of reasonable detention allowed for the process of removal.
on july,judge ragno allowed the government motion and,on august,reinstated his prior order directing sayyah removal.judge ragno new order provided sayyah a full right to appeal from any alleged denial of due process by judge ragno.purportedly because he feared being before judge ragno again,however,sayyah did not appeal to the bia.instead,he chose to pursue the habeas petition he had filed in the district court.
meanwhile,on august,the district court held a hearing on sayyah emergency motion for hearing and order of release.on august,the district court denied the motion,but without prejudice.
on october,the ins headquarters post detention unit determined that sayyah might be released on an order of supervision upon the posting of bond.sayyah was not able to raise enough money to post the bond and remained in custody until,after negotiation over the amount of the bond,he was released in january of pending removal.
on november,appellees,steven farquharson of the ins and frederick mcdonald of the franklin county house of correction,filed a motion to dismiss the portion of sayyah habeas corpus petition pertaining to his assertion that he had been denied due process.in the motion,appellees argued that under section d of the immigration and nationality act,d the district court lacked jurisdiction over the portion of sayyah habeas corpus petition containing the due process claim because sayyah had failed to exhaust all administrative remedies available to him as of right.on april,the district court agreed that it lacked jurisdiction over the claim and granted the motion to dismiss.it further concluded that since sayyah remaining habeas corpus claim was mooted by his release,the petition should be dismissed,and it closed the case now,sayyah appeals to this court.
ii.discussion 
as the issues presented are purely legal,we review them de novo.wallace reno,cir.
sayyah argues that the district court erred when it applied d to this habeas corpus case and concluded that section d deprived the district court of jurisdiction to review his due process claim.section d states 
review of final orders.a court may review a final order of removal only if 
the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right,and 
another court has not decided the validity of the order,unless the reviewing court finds that the petition presents grounds that could not have been presented in the prior judicial proceeding or that the remedy provided by the prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.
the exhaustion bar contained in subsection d is jurisdictional.see sousa ins,cir.
whether section d applies to habeas corpus 
sayyah argues that section d exhaustion requirement does not apply to habeas corpus petitions.he notes that section d requires exhaustion as a predicate to court review of a final order of removal but not specifically as a predicate to habeas corpus.he contrasts the statute lack of mention of habeas corpus with c explicit reference to a petition for review or habeas corpus of an order emphasis added 
we find sayyah argument unpersuasive.six other circuits have read section d exhaustion requirement,or that of its predecessor,section c,as being applicable to habeas corpus petitions.sun ashcroft,cir theodoropoulos ins,cir,superseding cir duvall elwood,cir sundar ins,cir,cert.denied,d kurfees ins,cir holding that section c applies to habeas corpus petitions goonsuwan ashcroft,cir same.
sayyah bases much of his contrary argument on language in ins cyr,d a case in which the supreme court held that a different subsection of,namely subsection a c n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense,does not eliminate habeas jurisdiction over petitions by such aliens.see also mahadeo reno,cir in cyr,the court stated that f or the ins to prevail it must overcome both the strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action and the longstanding rule requiring a clear statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas jurisdiction.at.citing ex parte yerger,wall.felker turpin,d footnotes and parentheticals omitted.in the circumstance of a statute purporting to exclude any and all right of judicial review,the court found the absence of any specific reference to habeas corpus to be particularly significant.
cyr is not analogous to this case,however.section d,the statute here at issue,does not purport to eliminate judicial review.rather,it premises judicial review upon the prior exhaustion of administrative remedies.in so doing,section d implements a principle almost universally recognized in our jurisprudence.see,ex parte hawk.per curiam discussing common law exhaustion.
in cyr,on the other hand,an interpretation of section a c eliminating habeas corpus jurisdiction would have invoked the outer limits of congress power,at.see also id.at.if it were clear that the question of law could be answered in another judicial forum,it might be permissible to accept the ins reading of.but the absence of such a for
