in this habeas corpus proceeding,we must determine whether a federal statute governing credit for good conduct unambiguously directs how that credit is to be calculated and applied because we conclude the statute is unambiguous,we do not address whether the rule of lenity applies or whether the federal bureau of prisons interpretation of the statute must be accorded deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,and its progeny.the bureau of prisons correctly determined the credits in this case.therefore,we reverse the district court grant of habeas relief and deny the petition for writ of habeas corpus.
ellen jeanette moreland was convicted in a federal district court in wisconsin of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine,a violation of.she was sentenced to months years imprisonment and five years of supervised release.moreland had served days in pretrial detention before she was transferred to the federal bureau of prisons custody on january,and absent any credit,moreland sentence would have been completed on february.
the bureau determined that during each year of her imprisonment,moreland displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations and thus far had earned the maximum amount of credit permitted under b.at issue is the maximum credit she may receive.section b provides 
a prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than year,other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the prisoner life,may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner sentence,beyond the time served,of up to days at the end of each year of the prisoner term of imprisonment,beginning at the end of the first year of the term,subject to determination by the bureau of prisons that,during that year,the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations.subject to paragraph,if the bureau determines that,during that year,the prisoner has not satisfactorily complied with such institutional regulations,the prisoner shall receive no such credit toward service of the prisoner sentence or shall receive such lesser credit as the bureau determines to be appropriate c redit for the last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited within the last six weeks of the sentence 
the bureau calculated moreland credit by deducting days from her sentence at the end of each year she served.by the time moreland had served fifteen years,less than one year of her sentence remained.the bureau then prorated moreland credit for the remainder of her sentence and projected her release date as november,based on days of credit,assuming continued exemplary behavior.
moreland filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under,contending that the bureau had improperly calculated her credits.moreland asserted that she is entitled to days of credit for each year or partial year of her sentence,a total of days of credit days x years days.she argued that at the end of her first year in prison,days should have been deducted from the days she served,so that her first year of imprisonment would have ended on day.the second year of her sentence would have ended on day,the third year on day,and so on,such that her release date would have been july.
the district court agreed with moreland and directed the bureau to calculate her good conduct time under b so that,for each year of the sentence imposed,she serves days of actual time and earns days of credit that vests immediately.the bureau complied.it subsequently transferred moreland from the federal prison,texas where she had been confined,to the chicago community confinement center for the remainder of her sentence,in order to comply with c,which requires the bureau to assure that a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment spends a reasonable part,not to exceed six months,of the last per centum of the term to be served under conditions that will afford the prisoner a reasonable opportunity to adjust to and prepare for the prisoner into the community.on july,moreland commenced serving her term of supervised release.the bureau asserts that if the grant of habeas relief is reversed,moreland will be returned to community confinement to serve the duration of her term of imprisonment.
as a preliminary matter,moreland contends that the bureau and the director of the bureau were not her immediate custodians when she sought habeas relief,and although she named them as parties,they must be dismissed from the case.that would leave the warden of the bryan facility as the only proper party,moreland asserts,and since that warden no longer has custody over her because she was transferred to illinois,moreland argues that this case must be dismissed.we disagree.
moreland filed her petition for writ of habeas corpus in the district in which she was confined as required by d and named as a respondent the warden of the facility in which she was confined the in custody determination is made at the time the habeas petition is filed.the district court had jurisdiction to act on moreland petition when it rendered judgment,and we have jurisdiction over the appeal from that judgment.the issue before us is whether habeas relief should have been granted.if it was improperly granted,the bureau may moreland,regardless of whether it should have been named as a party in this proceeding.
moreover,whether the bureau and the director of the bureau should have been joined as parties raises questions of personal jurisdiction,not jurisdiction moreland named these governmental entities as respondents in the district court and did not challenge the propriety of her own actions until this appeal.neither the bureau nor the director question the court jurisdiction over them,and the district court final judgment explicitly directs the bureau to calculate moreland credit in a particular manner.the bureau appeals from that judgment,and moreland has waived any contention that she should not have joined,or obtained a judgment against,the bureau.
finally,moreland contends that this case is moot since she has been released from prison.as noted above,the bureau intends to return moreland to community confinement to serve the remainder of her term if it prevails in this appeal.therefore,the case is not moot 
moreland contends and the district court held that a prisoner may earn up to days of credit for each year or partial year of the sentence imposed.as discussed above,the district court multiplied moreland sentence by days and ordered that she be given days of credit,directing that each year of her sentence be reduced to days.
the starting point of our analysis is the statute itself 
a date of prisoner shall be released by the bureau of prisons on the date of the expiration of the prisoner term of imprisonment,less any time credited toward the service of the prisoner sentence as provided in subsection b 
b credit toward service of sentence for satisfactory behavior.
subject to paragraph,a prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than year,other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the prisoner life,may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner sentence,beyond the time served,of up to days at the end of each year of the prisoner term of imprisonment,beginning at the end of the first year of the term,subject to determination by the bureau of prisons that,during that year,the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations.subject to paragraph,if the bureau determines that,during that year,the prisoner has not satisfactorily complied with such institutional regulations,the prisoner shall receive no such credit toward service of the prisoner sentence or shall receive such lesser credit as the bureau determines to be appropriate credit that has not been earned may not later be granted.subject to paragraph,credit for the last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.
notwithstanding any other law,credit awarded under this subsection after the date of enactment of the prison litigation reform act shall vest on the date the prisoner is released from custody.
c bureau of prisons shall,to the extent practicable,assure that a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment spends a reasonable part,not to exceed six months,of the last per centum of the term to be served under conditions that will afford the prisoner a reasonable opportunity to adjust to and prepare for the prisoner into the community 
d allotment of clothing,funds,and the release of a prisoner on the expiration of the prisoner term of imprisonment,the bureau of prisons shall furnish the prisoner with 
suitable clothing 
an amount of money,not more than,and 
transportation 
this court has opined on how credit is to be calculated and applied under this statute on at least two prior occasions,concluding that the bureau interpretation of the statute is correct and rejecting the same arguments moreland puts forth however,neither of those decisions is binding precedent.
in sample morrison the court concluded that section b plainly states that a prisoner can not earn any good time credit until he has served at least one year of his prison term.at that time,and thereafter at the end of each year of the inmate prison term,he may be awarded up to days of good time credit.the court explicitly rejected moreland method of calculating credit the statute,however,contains no language that would permit him to receive additional good time credit based on the original prison term as imposed by the court,and it provides no method for computing such credit.but this conclusion was dicta because the petition in sample was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the court analyzed how credits are calculated only after stating,e ven if we were to assume arguendo that we have jurisdiction,the district court did not err in agreeing with the bureau calculation this was not an alternative holding because it could not support the actual judgment in that case,which was dismissal for lack of jurisdiction rather than an affirmance of the district court judgment.
in an unpublished opinion,tatu rasbeary,this court cited with approval sample discussion of how credits are calculated tatu squarely held that the bureau construction of section b was correct unpublished opinions are not binding precedent but may be persuasive 
we are persuaded that sample and tatu correctly concluded that section b unambiguously directs how credits are to be calculated and applied,which is up to days at the end of each year of the prisoner term of imprisonment,beginning at the end of the first year of the term.given its context,this language has a temporal meaning and can only refer to the end of each year the prisoner serves.the word year has a commonly understood meaning of or days,not days.the statutory language provides no indication that year has an unusual or extraordinary meaning for purposes of section.nor does it indicate that credit should be retroactively applied to reduce each year the prisoner serves from to days.
the temporal meaning of the end of each year of the prisoner term of imprisonment and beginning at the end of the first year is brought into even sharper focus when other parts of section b are considered.credit can not be awarded unless the bureau determines that during that year,the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations.likewise,if the bureau determines that,during that year,the prisoner has not satisfactorily complied with such institutional regulations,the prisoner shall receive no such credit toward service of the prisoner sentence or shall receive such lesser credit as the bureau determines to be appropriate.the statute contemplates a determination of how much,if any,credit is due will be made after that year has expired and the prisoner conduct during that year can be assessed.the statute does not say that conduct will be assessed at the end of periods,or any other periods less than days violent conduct after the day of a given year could mar an otherwise exemplary year of compliance and warrant the award of little or no credit.
moreland interpretation of section b finds no support in the text of the statute.moreland insists that she is entitled to days for each year of the sentence she received.but all agree that because of her good conduct,moreland will not serve at least the last two years of her sentence.section b refers to up to days at the end of each year of the prisoner term of imprisonment,beginning at the end of the first year of the term.when is the end of the last two years of the sentence imposed when those two years will never be served how does during that year apply to the two years of her sentence that she will not serve for purposes of determining whether moreland displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations,or conversely,during that year,the prisoner has not satisfactorily complied with such institutional regulations how can the bureau evaluate moreland conduct for two years she did not serve are we to assume that every prisoner automatically gets the maximum days credit for years that he or she will not serve because of prior credits as this court astutely observed in sample,the statute provides no method for computing such credit.
similarly,section b directs credit that has not been earned may not later be granted.moreland can not earn credit during the two years of the sentence imposed that she will not serve because of her prior credit 
section b also directs how credit is to be calculated for the last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment.it is to be prorated and credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.in this proration provision,term of imprisonment could arguably mean either the time actually served or the sentence imposed upon conviction if it were read in isolation.a prisoner could be sentenced to years,like moreland,and actually serve years,and portion of a year of the term could mean either the final year of the sentence imposed or the final year of the time that will actually be served.but in context,the only reasonable construction of the proration provision is to construe term of imprisonment as the time the prisoner is actually imprisoned since credit may only be earned and awarded for good conduct during time served.
moreland and the district court opinion point out that the phrase term of imprisonment is used many times in section.they recite the familiar canon of construction that a term should be given the same meaning throughout a statute,particularly when a term is repeated within a given sentence but this canon is merely a aid to construction,not an absolute directive to be applied reflexively.the language used in an enactment and its context are paramount.as the united states supreme court has held on more than one occasion,the presumption is not rigid and readily yields whenever there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the act with different intent.the supreme court has colorfully compared the canon of construction on which moreland relies to original sin with regard to its longevity and the need to guard against it 
the tendency to assume that a word which appears in two or more legal rules,and so in connection with more than one purpose,has and should have precisely the same scope in all of them,runs all through legal discussions.it has all the tenacity of original sin and must constantly be guarded against.
moreland concedes that the phrase term of imprisonment has two distinctly different meanings within section.section b provides that a prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than year may receive credit it is beyond debate that in this context,term of imprisonment means the sentence imposed for a conviction.but it is also beyond debate that in section d the same phrase means the time the prisoner has actually served,not the sentenced imposed.section d says upon the release of a prisoner on the expiration of the prisoner term of imprisonment,the bureau of prisons shall furnish the prisoner with suitable clothing an amount of money,not mor
