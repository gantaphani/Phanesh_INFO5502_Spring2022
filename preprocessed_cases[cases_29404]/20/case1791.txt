on april,rogelio promotor got drunk,drove at speeds up to miles per hour,tore through two red lights,and crashed into a passing car.he killed four people and severely injured two others.he pleaded no contest in wisconsin state court to four counts of homicide by intoxicated use of a motor vehicle and two counts of causing injury by intoxicated use of a motor vehicle.
before sentencing,promotor cooperated in the creation of a defense investigation report which stated that promotor consumed up to beers in the hours preceding the crash.the court mentioned the beers figure twice when it sentenced promotor to years of imprisonment and years of supervised release.
promotor filed requests for relief with the wisconsin state courts,which were denied.he then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.he asserted that his due process rights were violated because he was sentenced based on inaccurate beers figure from the defense presentence report.he also argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court denied the petition,finding that promotor procedurally defaulted his due process claim by not objecting to the information in his report.promotor requested,and the district court granted,a certificate of appealability on this question,and on whether the wisconsin state courts violated promotor due process rights by sentencing him based on inaccurate information.
we agree with the district court that promotor procedurally defaulted his challenge to the allegedly inaccurate information in the report because he failed to object to it.there is no valid cause that excuses this default.and even if he had not defaulted his claim,promotor did not demonstrate that the trial court relied on materially incorrect information in his sentencing.
promotor also requested a certificate of appealability on his ineffective assistance of counsel arguments.the district court denied this request,finding that promotor procedurally defaulted his claim by failing to fully and fairly present it to the wisconsin supreme court.promotor asks that we expand his certificate of appealability to address these arguments.because we agree with the district court that promotor procedurally defaulted his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,we decline to expand the certificate of appealability.
we affirm the district court decision.
background 
on april,after drinking with his friends,rogelio promotor decided to drive.he sped through a residential area and drove through a red light.witnesses described him as careening and swerving down the street,and an accident reconstruction later estimated his speed at between miles per hour.he drove through a second red light and crashed into another passing car.travis cates,antonio mazaba,michael popp,and troy vanderhei were killed.shaun foerster and laura lewis were severely injured.
promotor does not remember driving or the subsequent collision.approximately two hours and forty minutes after the crash,his blood alcohol concentration was measured at.he pleaded no contest in wisconsin state court to four counts of homicide by intoxicated use of a motor vehicle and two counts of causing great bodily harm by intoxicated use of a motor vehicle.
before sentencing,promotor participated in the creation of an alternative presentence investigative report alternative report.the report was prepared by a sentencing disposition specialist at the request of promotor attorney.the specialist used a interpreter during his interviews with promotor.the report was designed to supplement information provided in the department of corrections doc report,and to offer a more detailed picture of promotor,his background,and experiences.the alternative report described promotor upbringing,including the fact that he started working while in grade school and dropped out in the sixth grade so he could earn more money and help support his family.promotor indicated that he is literate in spanish,but not in english.the report continued by describing some of promotor personal relationships,including his interactions with his alcoholic father.his father was a chronic binge drinker who was often physically abusive to promotor.the report also described promotor own problems with alcohol.although he generally limited his drinking to the weekends,he also drank alcohol secretly at work.his mother was concerned about promotor drinking,and lectured him on several occasions.his girlfriend asked him to stop drinking entirely.his usual habit was to drink up to cans of beer with friends,and,the report stated that on at least one occasion,promotor consumed a case of beer by himself,which made him sick.
under a section entitled,client version of offense and surrounding circumstances,the alternative report detailed promotor alcohol consumption on the day of the collision.he first had cans of beer from a case of.when that case was finished,one of promotor friends bought a second one,and promotor had another six beers.promotor recalled starting to drink one more beer from a third but did not remember anything after that.added together,the alternative report describes promotor drinking cans of beer on the day of the fatal crash.
promotor sentencing hearing was lengthy,and a interpreter was present the entire time.first the surviving victims spoke.next to speak were the families of the victims who were killed.videos and letters were also submitted on behalf of the victims friends and families.both the alternative and doc sentencing reports were then presented.the court had previously reviewed each report and found typographical errors and other small mistakes.it suggested corrections,and for each revision,asked the prosecutor and promotor attorney if there was any objection to the proposed change.the court asked defense counsel if he had any other additions,deletions,or revisions to the defense psi.defense counsel answered,no,your honor.in reviewing the doc report,promotor and his attorney discussed individual issues at least three times,and each time promotor attorney stated that there was no objection to the requested change.
following the review of the reports,the prosecutor detailed the plea negotiations.the court asked promotor if he understood the sentence that the state was recommending if he understood that his attorney was free to argue on his behalf and if he understood that the court was not obligated to follow their negotiations.promotor replied yes to each question.the attorneys then presented their sentencing recommendations to the court first the prosecutor,then promotor attorney.promotor attorney noted that this is extremely tough for everybody even the person who did the alternative report.everybody.even my investigator.everybody that involved with this case is taken aback at how devastating and how sad it is for everybody involved promotor is both remorseful and takes full responsibility for his actions.
promotor mother was next to speak.she revealed her suffering over the incident,and how it affected her entire family.the court then noted the letters that were submitted in support of promotor,including one from his brother.the final step before the court announced its sentence was promotor allocution.promotor stated the only thing i like to say is i apologize to the family and for you to forgive me i am very sorry for what has happened,but i leave it in god hands as far as what going to happen now.
the court began its statement of sentencing by describing how it arrived at its decision.it first considered the offense severity,then promotor character,and finally how much of a future risk he posed.the offense severity was of the most serious nature.it was a quadruple homicide by use of a vehicle with a prohibited blood alcohol content and a double injury by intoxicated use of a vehicle with a prohibited blood alcohol content.for those reasons,this is a case of the most aggravated offense severity.second,as to promotor character,the court noted his young age,and that he had spared the victims families and friends the trauma of a jury trial.additionally,he commended promotor consistent employment and good work ethic.he also noted that promotor did not have any weapons,drug,or violent convictions.but the court also noted promotor horrible driving record and underage drinking he had been arrested four times for driving without a license,twice for underage drinking,and on seven occasions bench warrants were issued for his arrest because he failed to appear in court.the court said that the prior incidents should have been warning signs for you.finally,the court decided the future risk to the community was high because promotor did not learn better notwithstanding those warning signs.twice,the court noted the figure from the alternative report.promotor was sentenced to years of initial confinement followed by years of extended supervision.the court stated that under wisconsin truth in sentencing policy,promotor would serve the years.promotor sentence meant he would be in prison until age.
promotor filed a motion for relief.he argued that he was sentenced based on the figure in the alternative report,which was inaccurate.he submitted an affidavit stating that he did not tell the interviewer or anyone else that he drank beers.he remembered saying he may have had as many as beers in total,but that it was more like or.he also said that the alternative report was not read to him in spanish before his sentencing hearing,that the sentencing hearing was the first time he heard the figure,and that he was confused when the judge used the number.promotor also submitted an affidavit from his counsel that included witness statements taken from police reports.both witnesses were with promotor on the night of the crash.one witness said promotor drank beers the second said promotor had eight or more beers and then another four or five more.finally,promotor submitted an affidavit of a chemist and forensic consultant.that affidavit stated that based on promotor blood alcohol measurement of at,it was unreasonable and unlikely that promotor consumed beers if he began drinking at the time he said he began.the required alcohol levels would kill most people,or at best leave them comatose.even chronic alcoholics would not typically exhibit the calculation pattern that would be required for promotor to have consumed beers in the described time frame.the affidavit concluded that promotor consumed somewhere between nine and beers on the night of the crash.
the same judge who presided over the sentencing hearing denied promotor motion for relief.he held that promotor waived his objection to the beers figure by not disputing it.and even if the argument had not been waived,promotor did not offer clear and convincing evidence that the information in the report was inaccurate.finally,the court concluded that even if the information in the report was inaccurate,promotor did not meet his burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the court prejudicially relied on the beers figure.the court stated in its order denying relief that w hether it was nine to beers,or beers the defendant was so that he had no recollection of his crimes.
promotor filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction and the decision denying his postconviction motion.the wisconsin court of appeals held that promotor waived his argument of alleged inaccuracy in the report when he failed to object at sentencing.the court then addressed the claim as one of ineffective assistance of counsel and found that even if promotor attorney erred,promotor was not prejudiced because the sentence would have been the same even if the court had originally been given a lower figure for the number of beers promotor consumed.promotor filed a petition for review in the wisconsin supreme court,which was denied.
promotor filed a timely petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.he argued that the wisconsin courts violated his due process right to be sentenced based on accurate information and that he had not waived that argument.he also argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court denied the petition.it ruled that the due process claim was procedurally barred because the wisconsin court of appeals finding of waiver constituted an adequate and independent state law ground that could not be reviewed absent cause and prejudice.further,the court ruled that promotor procedurally defaulted his ineffective assistance of counsel claim by failing to adequately address it in his petition to the wisconsin supreme court.
promotor requested a certificate of appealability coa from the district court.the court granted a coa as to whether promotor procedurally defaulted his due process claim and whether the wisconsin state courts violated his due process rights by sentencing him based on inaccurate information.it denied a coa on promotor challenge regarding ineffective assistance of counsel.promotor timely appealed.at issue before this court is whether promotor failure to object to the beers figure at sentencing constitutes a procedural bar to his claimed due process violation.promotor also asks us to expand his coa to address his ineffective assistance of counsel claims.
ii.analysis 
due process claim was procedurally defaulted 
promotor petitioned the federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus,asserting that his due process rights were violated because he was sentenced based on inaccurate information.the court denied his petition,ruling that the due process claim was procedurally barred because the wisconsin court of appeals finding of waiver was an adequate and independent state law ground.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its rulings on questions of law de novo.smith gaetz,cir foster schomig,n cir.
generally,a federal court may not grant habeas relief if the state court decision was based on an adequate and independent state law ground.ward jenkins,cir.the adequacy of the state ground decision is a question of federal law,and the ground is considered adequate only if the state court applies the rule in a consistent and principled way.miranda leibach,cir.an adequate and independent state law ground does not,however,absolutely preclude review of a procedurally defaulted claim during federal habeas review.an equitable exception exists if the petitioner can establish cause and prejudice for the default,or establish that the failure to consider the defaulted claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.dretke haley,johnson loftus,cir.
waiver is an adequate and independent state law ground 
promotor contends that the state court finding of waiver was not an adequate and independent state law ground because wisconsin application of waiver law was unsettled at the time of his sentencing.he further argues that even if the law were settled,cause and prejudice precludes a finding of default.we reject these arguments.
promotor accurately argues that a procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim unless the procedure is a firmly established and regularly followed state practice.smith mckee,cir.further,the state rule at issue must have been consistently applied at the time of the alleged default.franklin gilmore,cir.in support of his position that waiver law was not firmly established in wisconsin in,promotor offers state groth,which states whether,given the paramount importance of the integrity of the sentencing process,waiver may be invoked to preclude a defendant challenge to a sentencing based on inaccurate information remains unclear the cases the parties cite simply do not say,internal citations and quotations omitted,abrogated on other grounds by state tiepelman.in groth,the prosecutor repeatedly asserted,without any support in the record,that the defendant beat his pregnant girlfriend.because there was no support in the record for the inflammatory statements and the court apparently relied on them,the court found that the integrity of the sentencing process required resentencing.groth,at.groth is distinguishable from this case for significant reasons.the inaccurate information in groth came from the prosecutor,not the defense.and there was no factual basis for the information,but here,the
