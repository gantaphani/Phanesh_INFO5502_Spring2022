james newton,superintendent of the watertown correctional facility,appeals from an order entered on june,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york block,granting george overton petition for a writ of habeas corpus.overton newton,d.following the affirmance of his state court conviction,people overton,app,dep t,leave to appeal denied,petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that his rights under batson kentucky,d,were violated the district court concluded that habeas relief was warranted.we reverse.
background 
overton,who is,was convicted,along with sonia pegram by a jury in queens county supreme court dunlop,on february,for the criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree,in violation of penal law,criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree,in violation of penal law,and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree,in violation of penal law.overton was sentenced to a six to term of imprisonment and,at the time of the district court order,had been on parole for over two years.overton term of parole would,in ordinary course,expire in.
during jury selection,the trial court employed a modified jury box system.peremptory challenges were to be exercised in rounds.the prosecutor was entitled to fifteen peremptory challenges,see.proc.law b,as were the defendants,collectively.each side had an additional two peremptory challenges to be used in the selection of alternate jurors.sixteen prospective jurors were called from the venire for the first round.two of the sixteen were struck for cause,the prosecutor exercised four peremptory challenges,and the defendants used five.accordingly,five jurors were seated following the first round.another sixteen prospective jurors were called from the venire for the second round.three were dismissed for cause,the prosecutor exercised six peremptory challenges,and the defendants used four.thus,at the end of the second round,three additional jurors were seated.at this point in the jury selection process,no contemporaneous record had been made of the races of either the challenged jurors or those seated.overton,d at.
following the end of the second round,overton counsel raised a batson challenge,claiming that,by her rough count,the prosecutor had used seven of nine peremptory challenges against prospective jurors petitioner counsel then said,i think that shows a clear prima facie showing,and asked the court to make sure that challenges were properly exercised.in response,the prosecutor stated that petitioner challenge was frivolous because three of the selected jurors were and also because the prosecutor had exercised one of his peremptory challenges to exclude a white potential juror.the prosecutor also made a motion to the trial court,alleging that the defense had used every one of its nine peremptory challenges to strike white jurors.after allowing no further discussion,the trial court ruled i find that neither one of you have sic made out a prima facie case of purpose ful discrimination.
the trial court then proceeded to the third round of jury selection,at which point only four prospective jurors remained from the original venire.two jurors were chosen in the third round,and again no contemporaneous record was made of the racial backgrounds of the prospective jurors.following the third round,but before concluding proceedings for the day,the trial judge identified the racial backgrounds of the members of the first two panels.it also noted which jurors had been seated,which had been excused for cause,and which had been stricken by peremptory challenge.the trial judge explained that she had postponed making a record so that we could let the prospective jurors get on their way.the state court findings,as described by the district court below,were as follows 
in the first round,the prosecutor used his four challenges to strike two of five blacks.therefore,of the five jurors seated in the first round,three were black.in the second round,six blacks were put in the box one was struck for cause.the prosecutor then used five of his six challenges to strike all of the remaining black potential jurors.in sum,the prosecutor used his ten peremptory challenges to strike seventy percent out of of the qualified blacks in the first two rounds,including all five qualified blacks in the second round.
overton,d at.
the next day of the proceedings,jury selection was completed.the last two jurors,in addition to two alternates,were selected from a panel of sixteen prospective jurors drawn from a fresh venire.id.the record is incomplete as to the racial backgrounds of the jurors selected in the fourth round or of the members of the venire for the third and fourth rounds.id.at.significantly,the defendants did not renew their batson challenges either when the record was made or at the end of jury selection.
on direct appeal to the new york appellate courts,overton raised batson and confrontation clause claims.the appellate division,second department,rejected the batson challenge,stating that c ontrary to the defendant contention,the record does not demonstrate that a batson violation occurred during jury selection.overton,at.elaborating,the court noted that overton reliance solely upon the number of peremptory challenges made by the prosecutor against black venirepersons failed to make out the requisite prima facie showing required by batson.id.the appellate division also rejected overton confrontation clause claim.leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals was denied.overton,at.
in due course,overton filed pro se a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.pro bono counsel was appointed pursuant to an order of the district court.and,on june,that court granted overton petition,holding that the trial court determination that the petitioner batson challenge did not rise to the level of a prima facie inference of discrimination was an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court law to the facts.overton,d at.citing our decision in united states alvarado,cir hereinafter alvarado ii holding that,where the rate of minority challenges is significantly higher than the minority percentage of the venire,there is a statistical inference of discrimination sufficient to meet the requisite prima facie showing under batson,the court noted that a finding in the present case of a prima facie showing of discrimination squares with the second circuit statistical precedents.overton,d at.the court observed that,as in alvarado ii the prosecutor challenges against blacks out of was statistically more than twice the percent of blacks comprising the venirepersons whose races were known out of.id.at.
having found that habeas relief was warranted,the district court ordered that t he indictment shall be dismissed unless a new trial is commenced within sixty days of the date of entry of this order.id.at.on august,respondent sought an order from the district court staying the grant of the writ.respondent motion was denied on august,and,on that date,the district court ordered that overton be released from parole and that the underlying indictment against him be dismissed.this appeal followed.
discussion 
habeas review of petitioner batson claima.standard of review 
we review a district court ruling on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus de novo.galarza keane,cir mask mcginnis,cir per curiam english artuz,cir.pursuant to,as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,habeas relief may not be granted with respect to a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.a state court determination of a factual issue is,moreover,presumed to be correct,id.e,and is unreasonable only where the petitioner meets the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.id.
in williams taylor,d,the supreme court interpreted d as giving independent meanings to the contrary to and unreasonable application clauses.id.at.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.id.at.a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent if it identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the particular facts of a prisoner case.id.
clearly established federal law batson kentucky and its progeny 
the phrase clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.id.at.see also francis stone,cir.the clearly established supreme court precedent applicable in this case is batson kentucky,in which the court set forth a test that trial courts are to employ in evaluating allegations of exercise of peremptory challenges.batson,at.first,a trial court must decide whether the party challenging the peremptory strike has made a prima facie showing that the circumstances give rise to an inference that a member of the venire was struck because of his or her race.such a prima facie case may be established by,inter alia,showing a pattern of challenges against minority prospective jurors.id.at.second,once a prima facie case is established,the trial court must require the party to proffer a explanation for striking the potential juror.id.this second step in the batson inquiry does not mandate an explanation that is persuasive or even plausible.purkett elem,d.finally,when the party has proffered a explanation,the trial court must determine whether the moving party has carried his or her burden of proving that the strike had been motivated by purposeful discrimination batson,at.
specifically with respect to the first step of the inquiry,the batson court held that,in order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination,a defendant must show facts and circumstances that raise an inference that the prosecutor used the peremptory challenge to exclude potential jurors from the petit jury on account of their race id.at.
we have stated that the threshold decision concerning the existence of a prima facie case of discriminatory use of peremptory challenges involves both issues of fact and an issue of law.united states alvarado,cir,vacated on other grounds,d hereinafter alvarado i see also mahaffey page,cir t he preliminary question of whether a prima facie case has been shown presents a mixed question of law and fact.tolbert page,cir the prima facie batson inquiry involves a mixed question of law and fact,because the court must determine whether the facts are sufficient to meet the requirements of the legal rule and,therefore,to proceed to the ensuing steps of the batson analysis.this means that,once the has been performed,the judge must then determine,as a matter of law,whether these underlying facts suffice to establish a prima facie case.alvarado i,at.
on federal habeas review,mixed questions of law and fact translate to mixed constitutional questions,application of constitutional law to fact,williams,at,concurring.under the aedpa,they are subject to the standard set forth in d,which requires the habeas court to determine whether the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
application of aedpa contrary to and unreasonable application clauses 
it is clear in this case that the state court decision was not contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent.the state court identified the correct governing law with respect to overton batson claim,and it did not,on a question of law,reach a conclusion opposite to that of the supreme court.and,the supreme court has not as yet decided a case that is on its facts materially indistinguishable from the instant case.accordingly,the district court grant of the habeas remedy to overton is proper only if the state court determination that there was no prima facie showing under batson involved an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.
in williams,the court held that a state court decision fails the unreasonable application prong of aedpa analysis,if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.williams,at.the law,however,is not clearly defined on what it means for a state court to apply a principle unreasonably.and,as to this,there are two distinct areas of uncertainty.
first,as the court has observed,t he term unreasonable is no doubt difficult to define.id.at.in doing so,it cautioned that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect or erroneous application of federal law.id.at.emphasis in original.and we,interpreting williams,have added that the standard to be applied falls somewhere between merely erroneous and unreasonable to all reasonable jurists.jones stinson,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.some increment of incorrectness beyond error is required,the increment need not be great otherwise habeas relief would be limited to state court decisions so far off the mark as to suggest judicial incompetence.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted see loliscio goord,cir francis,at.
second,there has been considerable uncertainty as to how broadly or narrowly lower courts should construe principles defined by the supreme court in order to determine whether state courts have applied them reasonably.it is this latter question that is at issue in the instant case.
d.the principle established by batson 
to establish a prima facie case under batson,a defendant must show that the circumstances surrounding the peremptory challenges raise an inference of discrimination.specifically,the supreme court stated 
in deciding whether the defendant has made the requisite prima facie showing,the trial court should consider all relevant circumstances.for example,a pattern of strikes against black jurors included in the particular venire might give rise to an inference of discrimination.similarly,the prosecutor questions and statements during voir dire examination and in exercising his challenges may support or refute an inference of discriminatory purpose.these examples are merely illustrative.
batson,at.other than through these illustrative examples,the court has not,to date,provided a more particularized view of what constitutes a prima facie showing of discrimination under batson.accordingly,respondent argues that,since the supreme court has never directly held that statistics,without more,can satisfy a defendant prima facie batson burden,the state court ruling can not be an unreasonable application of existing supreme court precedent.we disagree.
respondent argument fails because federal law,as determined by the supreme court,may as much be a generalized standard that must be followed,as a rule designed to effectuate such a standard in a particular context.kennaugh miller,cir see gilchrist,cir,cert.denied sub nom.gilchrist smith,d lainfiesta artuz,cir,cert.denied sub nom.lainfiesta greiner,d.in batson,the supreme court made clear that a state purposeful exclusion of jurors based on race violates the equal protection clause of the constitution.batson,at.in subsequent cases,the court has reaffirmed this statement and extended its application beyond race,while also explaining the underlying general antidiscrimination principle that it had established 
discrimination in jury selection,whether based on race or on gender,causes harm to the litigants,the community,and the individual jurors who are wrongfully excluded from parti
