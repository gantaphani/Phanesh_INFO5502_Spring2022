after an evidentiary hearing following remand by this court,the district court dismissed the petition of stewart barnes for habeas corpus relief pursuant to.barnes appeals,urging that his convictions must be vacated because his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance with respect to his state court convictions.for the following reasons,we affirm.
petitioner is a state court prisoner who,following a bench trial,was convicted of one count each of breaking and entering with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct,assault with intent to commit second degree criminal sexual conduct,and felonious assault.the trial judge sentenced petitioner to three concurrent sentences six to fifteen years on the breaking and entering count,three to five years on the assault with intent to commit second degree criminal sexual conduct count,and two and a half to four years on the felonious assault count.
relevant facts 
the victim,who was at the time of the offense,testified that she went to bed at on july,she was sharing a bed with a younger sister and brother.the victim awoke when she felt a man kissing the side of her face.she struggled with her attacker during the struggle he inflicted a serious cut on each of her arms.when the victim sister began screaming,the attacker left the room.the victim saw h im run down the stairs,limping on one leg he ran out the front door.
almost immediately,the police developed a composite picture of the assailant from a description by the victim.within several days of the attack,the victim advised the investigating officer that her assailant had a limp.during the ensuing investigation,the victim viewed a large number of mugshots,a photo,and a live she did not make any identifications during those sessions.no photographs of petitioner were among those shown to the victim by the police,nor did petitioner participate in the live lineup at that time.about six months after the attack,while complainant was at a bus stop,she saw petitioner walking in the area and recognized him as the man who attacked her.on the next day an investigating officer established surveillance of the bus stop.the victim identified the suspect by a hand signal,and the investigating officer arrested barnes.thereafter,the victim viewed a in which petitioner participated the victim identified petitioner as her attacker.
at trial the parties stipulated that barnes suffers from syndrome and wears a brace on his leg.no additional medical evidence was presented at trial.
in proceedings before the state court and the federal district court,petitioner asserted several grounds for habeas relief.in this appeal,he raises only one issue that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to call any medical witnesses to testify concerning his physical limitations.
procedural history 
petitioner attempts in state court to challenge his convictions are summarized in our prior opinion,barnes elo,cir.in the state court proceedings,in support of his contention that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to call medical witnesses to testify concerning his physical condition,petitioner submitted an affidavit by william waring,his treating physician.in the affidavit waring stated that he had not been contacted by barnes trial counsel,that he would have been available to testify,and that he would have testified that barnes was physically unable to run down the stairs and out the door as complainant testified her assailant had done.id.at.
after failing to obtain relief in the state courts,petitioner filed a federal petition for relief,asserting that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance and that he was denied due process as a result of prosecutorial misconduct.the district judge denied relief on all grounds and granted petitioner a certificate of appealability limited to the contention of ineffective assistance of counsel.
on appeal,this court ordered the matter remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of the competence of trial counsel,concluding that i t is unclear from the record whether or to what extent trial counsel investigated barnes medical condition,and why he failed to contact waring.absent an evidentiary hearing and clear findings of fact,it is impossible to determine whether trial counsel failure to investigate and call waring was sound trial strategy.barnes elo,at.
the evidentiary hearing 
upon remand the district judge conducted an extensive evidentiary hearing,which included testimony regarding trial counsel failure to call medical witnesses.marvin barnett,barnes trial counsel,testified at length.despite a diligent search,barnett was unable to locate his file concerning the trial,which had occurred more than nine years before the hearing.barnett admitted that he was unfamiliar with the specifics of syndrome but stated that he knew petitioner had a physical disability,walked with braces,and walked with a significant gait.prior to the trial barnett reviewed waring medical records,which petitioner provided to him.barnett also testified that prior to trial he spoke with someone knowledgeable about petitioner medical condition however,he was unable to recall with whom he spoke.barnett did not dispute waring testimony that barnett had not spoken to him.
barnett testified that he had recommended that the defense pursue a theory of defense.additionally,he stated that the medical condition was important and that it was part of the defense.he testified 
i advised petitioner that it would be in his best interest to allow the parties to stipulate to his medical condition without calling witnesses to testify as to his medical condition because,my recollection was,that those same medical records which indicated he had a medical condition,also indicated that at some point in his life that he was a house painter or something and he played basketball,not withstanding sic the fact that he had a gait in his walk,that he does move around,so we were trying to avoid all the negligence sic inferences that could be drawn from his medical records while at the same time preserving for the trier of fact all positive inferences that may have been drawn from his medical records.
b ased on my review of his medical records there was damaging information in this record that would support some of the allegations that the complainant had made.the eleven year old girl had indicated that the person ran with a limp,and that although there was no question or need to establish that he could not run like a normal person,there were things in his record and his past employment that defeated our argument,and so it was as though we simply ignored medical witnesses but as an experienced attorney i was trying to give the defendant the benefit of everything positive in the record without the negatives associated with other things that were in his record.
barnett opined that the trial judge certainly understood,regardless of the specific nature of his condition,that it certainly mitigated against him running in the matter sic as it appeared and the complainant testified to.barnett testified that petitioner agreed to the entry of the stipulation as to his medical condition in lieu of live testimony.
on barnett provided the following additional detail regarding his concern about the information contained in the medical record.
b ut we got an allegation that somebody is climbing into a house and the idea that somebody at any point was a house painter concerned me,and i also remember there being something in there about him being able to play basketball.now,i do suspect he could have,you know,pushed the ball down the floor or pushed through the lane and did a slam dunk,but the mere fact that you can even play basketball at any point mitigates against not being able to get down some flights of stairs.
barnett was concerned that a medical witness would testify on that petitioner had some mobility and that the witness would have to testify that he could move around quickly if he had to,and that he moved with a limp.my concern would be that the witness would establish exactly the opposite that we do not want to establish and undermine whatever mileage we thought we were going to get out of the stipulation.
petitioner introduced waring deposition into evidence at the evidentiary hearing.waring testified that petitioner had syndrome,would have had difficulty going down a stairway,and would have a very herky jerky sort of motion going down the stairs.he conceded,however,that someone who lacked medical knowledge could describe petitioner abnormal movement going down the stairs as a limp.in commenting on the statement in his affidavit that barnes was physically unable to run down the stairs and out the door as complainant testified her assailant had done,waring testified that in making that statement he assumed that the victim reference to run meant a fast run.waring testified that petitioner could not run with both feet off the ground at the same time and opined that petitioner could not physically run anywhere close to normal gait,normal gait speed.waring testified that petitioner ability to move quickly was impaired and estimated that petitioner moved a third or a fourth of normal running speed with the defects.however,he acknowledged that petitioner could move faster than his normal walking speed if he so desired.
at the evidentiary hearing on remand,petitioner testified that he could not run with both feet off the ground.he stated that barnett had advised him that medical witnesses would testify during the trial.petitioner also testified that he exhibited his leg to the state judge during his trial,and that the trial judge observed his movements in the courtroom.
the district judge credited barnett testimony that he concluded and so advised petitioner that the best course of action was to enter into a stipulation concerning petitioner medical condition as well as barnett testimony that he believed the trial judge understood that the condition mitigated against running.we accord considerable deference to the credibility determinations of the district judge.see united states,cir citing united states cooke,cir.the district judge concluded that the medical records and the potential medical testimony included damaging information concerning defendant capabilities and was less than compelling.he concluded that trial counsel performance was not deficient and that petitioner sustained no significant prejudice as a result of trial counsel decisions concerning medical evidence.

discussion 
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,aedpa,stat,which amended,governs this federal habeas corpus review of a state court conviction.
title d mandates that claims adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings,such as petitioner claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,are subject to the following standards of review 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel presents a mixed question of fact and law we therefore apply the unreasonable application prong of d.hunt mitchell,cir.a state court unreasonably applies supreme court precedent if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular prisoner case.williams taylor,d.however,a federal court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.at.
typically,in reviewing a state court denial of a state prisoner request for relief we accord deference to the state court decision.d.however,as noted in our prior opinion barnes elo,at,in ruling on petitioner motion to remand for an evidentiary hearing and on the merits of the ineffective assistance claim related to the failure to call medical witnesses,the michigan state court of appeals apparently failed to consider waring affidavit,which had been filed by petitioner.indeed,in considering the merits of that claim the state court relied upon what it perceived to be a failure on the part of petitioner to file the affidavit which he had in fact filed.people barnes.march.in these unusual circumstances,a federal court has no alternative but to conduct an independent review of the claim,because there is no foundation in the state court proceedings for aedpa deference.see mckenzie smith,cir.
in strickland washington,d,the supreme court established a two prong test for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel a defendant seeking relief must demonstrate that counsel performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.with regard to the performance prong,the defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.at.it is well established that j udicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential.id.at.at.a fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.id.there is a strong presumption that an attorney performance falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.at.t he defendant must overcome the presumption that,the challenged action might be considered to be sound trial strategy.id.quoting michel louisiana.
in order to satisfy the prejudice requirement,t he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland washington,at.at.if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on either component of the ineffective assistance of counsel inquiry,it is not necessary to examine the remaining prong of the test.strickland washington,at.
failure to call medical witnesses 
barnett strategic decision to enter into the stipulation concerning petitioner medical condition rather than call medical witnesses was not deficient.waring testimony does not establish that petitioner could not have entered the house,assaulted the victim,and escaped in the manner described by the victim.rather,his testimony simply negates the possibility that petitioner could run normally,with both feet off the ground at the same time,or that he could run at a speed approximating that of someone who could run normally.the significance of that testimony is minimal.there was no testimony at the trial that the attacker ran like a normal person.to the contrary,the victim testified that the man was limping on one leg as he ran down the stairs.waring also testified that an individual lacking medical knowledge could describe petitioner gait going down the stairs as a limp.
petitioner focuses too narrowly on the victim use of the word run.run is an imprecise word subject to numerous personal interpretations.it is reasonable to conclude that the young victim description of her attacker movements would not be precise.she saw him for only a brief period of time and under extremely stressful circumstances.
additionally,there were sound tactical reasons not to call waring as a witness.the personal history provided to waring indicated that petitioner had played basketball and that he had previously worked as a house painter.petitioner past participation in those activities would undoubtedly have under
