more than years after his conviction became final,perkins filed his federal habeas petition,alleging,inter alia,ineffective assistance of trial counsel.to overcome aedpa time limitations,he asserted newly discovered evidence of actual innocence,relying on three affidavits,the most recent dated july,each pointing to jones as the murderer.the district court found that,even if the affidavits could be characterized as evidence newly discovered,perkins had failed to show diligence entitling him to equitable tolling of aedpa limitations period.alternatively,the court found,perkins had not shown that,taking account of all the evidence,no reasonable juror would have convicted him.the sixth circuit reversed.acknowledging that perkins petition was untimely and that he had not diligently pursued his rights,the court held that perkins claim allowed him to present his claim as if it had been filed on time.in so ruling,the court apparently considered perkins delay irrelevant to appraisal of his claim.
actual innocence,if proved,serves as a gateway through which a petitioner may pass whether the impediment is a procedural bar,as it was in schlup delo,and house bell,or expiration of the aedpa statute of limitations,as in this case.
a perkins,who waited nearly six years from the date of the affidavit to file his petition,maintains that an plea can overcome aedpa limitations period.this court decisions support his view.the court has not resolved whether a prisoner may be entitled to habeas relief based on a freestanding claim,herrera collins,but it has recognized that a prisoner otherwise subject to defenses of abusive or successive use of the writ may have his federal constitutional claim considered on the merits if he makes a proper showing of actual innocence,at.
the court has applied this fundamental miscarriage of justice exception to overcome various procedural defaults,including,as most relevant here,failure to observe state procedural rules,such as filing deadlines.see coleman thompson.the exception,the court decisions bear out,survived aedpa passage.see,calderon thompson,house,at.these decisions see k to balance the societal interests in finality,comity,and conservation of scarce judicial resources with the individual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinary case.schlup,at.sensitivity to the injustice of incarcerating an innocent individual should not abate when the impediment is aedpa statute of limitations.
b the state urges that recognition of a miscarriage of justice exception would render d d superfluous.that is not so,for aedpa time limitations apply to the typical case in which no claim is made,while the exception applies to a severely confined category cases in which new evidence shows it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted the petitioner,schlup,at.many petitions that could not pass through the gateway will be timely or not measured by d d triggering provision.nor does congress inclusion of a miscarriage of justice exception in b b and e indicate an intent to preclude courts from applying the exception in d d cases.congress did not simply incorporate the miscarriage of justice exception into b b and e.rather,congress constrained the exception application with respect to petitions and the holding of evidentiary hearings in federal court.the more rational inference to draw from the incorporation of a modified version of the exception into other provisions of aedpa is that,in a case not governed by those provisions,the exception survived aedpa passage intact and unrestricted.
a federal habeas court,faced with an gateway claim,should count unjustifiable delay on a habeas petitioner part,not as an absolute barrier to relief,but as a factor in determining whether actual innocence has been reliably shown.a petitioner invoking the miscarriage of justice exception must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence.schlup,at.unexplained delay in presenting new evidence bears on the determination whether the petitioner has made the requisite showing.taking account of the delay in the context of the merits of a petitioner claim,rather than treating timeliness as a threshold inquiry,is tuned to the exception underlying rationale of ensuring that federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarceration of innocent persons.herrera,at.
here,the district court appraisal of perkins petition as insufficient to meet schlup standard should be dispositive,absent cause,which this court does not currently see,for the sixth circuit to upset that evaluation.under schlup demanding standard,the gateway should open only when a petition presents evidence of innocence so strong that a court can not have confidence in the outcome of the trial unless the court is also satisfied that the trial was free of nonharmless constitutional error.at.

justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
this case concerns the actual innocence gateway to federal habeas review applied in schlup delo,and further explained in house bell.in those cases,a convincing showing of actual innocence enabled habeas petitioners to overcome a procedural bar to consideration of the merits of their constitutional claims.here,the question arises in the context of d,the statute of limitations on federal habeas petitions prescribed in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of.specifically,if the petitioner does not file her federal habeas petition,at the latest,within one year of the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence,d d,can the time bar be overcome by a convincing showing that she committed no crime 
we hold that actual innocence,if proved,serves as a gateway through which a petitioner may pass whether the impediment is a procedural bar,as it was in schlup and house,or,as in this case,expiration of the statute of limitations.we caution,however,that tenable gateway pleas are rare a petitioner does not meet the threshold requirement unless he persuades the district court that,in light of the new evidence,no juror,acting reasonably,would have voted to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.schlup,at see house,at emphasizing that the schlup standard is demanding and seldom met.and in making an assessment of the kind schlup envisioned,the timing of the petition is a factor bearing on the reliability of th e evidence purporting to show actual innocence.schlup,at.

on march,respondent floyd perkins attended a party in flint,michigan,in the company of his friend,rodney henderson,and an acquaintance,damarr jones.the three men left the party together.henderson was later discovered on a wooded trail,murdered by stab wounds to his head.
perkins was charged with the murder of henderson.at trial,jones was the key witness for the prosecution.he testified that perkins alone committed the murder while jones looked on.app.
chauncey vaughn,a friend of perkins and henderson,testified that,prior to the murder,perkins had told him he would kill henderson,at,and that perkins later called vaughn,confessing to his commission of the crime,at.a third witness,torriano player,also a friend of both perkins and henderson,testified that perkins told him,had he known how player felt about henderson,he would not have killed henderson,at.
perkins,testifying in his own defense,offered a different account of the episode.he testified that he left and jones to purchase cigarettes at a convenience store.when he exited the store,perkins related,jones and henderson were gone,at.perkins said that he then visited his girlfriend,at.about an hour later,perkins recalled,he saw jones standing under a streetlight with blood on his pants,shoes,and plaid coat,at.
the jury convicted perkins of murder.he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on october.the michigan court of appeals affirmed perkins conviction and sentence,and the michigan supreme court denied perkins leave to appeal on january.perkins conviction became final on may.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,a state prisoner ordinarily has one year to file a federal petition for habeas corpus,starting from the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the of the time for seeking such review.d a.if the petition alleges newly discovered evidence,however,the filing deadline is one year from the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.d d.
perkins filed his federal habeas corpus petition on june,more than years after his conviction became final.he alleged,inter alia,ineffective assistance on the part of his trial attorney,depriving him of his sixth amendment right to competent counsel.to overcome aedpa time limitations,perkins asserted newly discovered evidence of actual innocence.he relied on three affidavits,each pointing to jones,not perkins,as henderson murderer.
the first affidavit,dated january,was submitted by perkins sister,ronda hudson.hudson stated that she had heard from a third party,louis ford,that jones bragged about stabbing henderson and had taken his clothes to the cleaners after the murder.app.to pet.for cert.the second affidavit,dated march,was subscribed to by demond louis,chauncey vaughn younger brother.louis stated that,on the night of the murder,jones confessed to him that he had just killed henderson.louis also described the clothes jones wore that night,bloodstained orange shoes and orange pants,and a colorful shirt,at.the next day,louis added,he accompanied jones,first to a dumpster where jones disposed of the bloodstained shoes,and then to the cleaners.finally,perkins presented the july,affidavit of linda fleming,an employee at cleaners in.she stated that,on or about march,a man matching jones description entered the shop and asked her whether bloodstains could be removed from the pants and a shirt he brought in.the pants were orange,she recalled,and heavily stained with blood,as was the multicolored shirt left for cleaning along with the pants,at.
the district court found the affidavits insufficient to entitle perkins to habeas relief.characterizing the affidavits as newly discovered evidence was dubious,the district court observed,in light of what perkins knew about the underlying facts at the time of trial,at.but even assuming qualification of the affidavits as evidence newly discovered,the district court next explained,perkins petition was untimely under d d.ibid.if the statute of limitations began to run as of the date of the latest of th e affidavits,july,the district court noted,then absent tolling,perkins had until july,in which to file his habeas petition.ibid.perkins,however,did not file until nearly five years later,on june.
under sixth circuit precedent,the district court stated,a habeas petitioner who demonstrates a credible claim of actual innocence based on new evidence may,in circumstances,be entitled to equitable tolling of habeas limitations.at.but perkins had not established exceptional circumstances,the district court determined.in any event,the district court observed,equitable tolling requires diligence and perkins ha d failed utterly to demonstrate the necessary diligence in exercising his rights.at.alternatively,the court found that perkins had failed to meet the strict standard by which pleas of actual innocence are he had not shown that,taking account of all the evidence,it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him,or even that the evidence was new,at.
perkins appealed the district court judgment.recognizing that aedpa statute of limitations had expired and that perkins had not diligently pursued his rights,the sixth circuit granted a certificate of appealability limited to a single question is reasonable diligence a precondition to relying on actual innocence as a gateway to adjudication of a federal habeas petition on the merits certificate of appealability.
on consideration of the certified question,the court of appeals reversed the district court judgment.adhering to circuit precedent,souter jones,the sixth circuit held that perkins gateway allegations allowed him to present his claim as if it were filed on time.on remand,the court of appeals instructed,the d istrict c ourt should fully consider whether perkins assert ed a credible claim of actual innocence.at.
we granted certiorari to resolve a circuit conflict on whether aedpa statute of limitations can be overcome by a showing of actual innocence.compare,san martin mcneil,a court may consider an untimely petition if,by refusing to consider the petition for untimeliness,the court thereby would endorse a fundamental miscarriage of justice because it would require that an individual who is actually innocent remain imprisoned.with,escamilla jungwirth,prisoners claiming to be innocent,like those contending that other events spoil the conviction,must meet the statutory requirement of timely action.see also rivas fischer,collecting cases.
in holland florida,this court addressed the circumstances in which a federal habeas petitioner could invoke the doctrine of equitable tolling.holland held that a habeas petitioner is entitled to equitable tolling only if he shows that he has been pursuing his rights diligently,and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.as the courts below comprehended,perkins does not qualify for equitable tolling.in possession of all three affidavits by july,he waited nearly six years to seek federal postconviction relief.such a delay falls far short of demonstrating the diligence required to entitle a petitioner to equitable tolling.app.to pet.for cert.district court opinion.see also certificate of appealability.
perkins,however,asserts not an excuse for filing after the statute of limitations has run.instead,he maintains that a plea of actual innocence can overcome aedpa statute of limitations.he thus seeks an exception to d,not an extension of the time statutorily prescribed.see rivas,at,distinguishing from equitable tolling a plea to override the statute of limitations when actual innocence is shown.
decisions of this court support perkins view of the significance of a convincing claim.we have not resolved whether a prisoner may be entitled to habeas relief based on a freestanding claim of actual innocence.herrera collins.we have recognized,however,that a prisoner otherwise subject to defenses of abusive or successive use of the writ of habeas corpus may have his federal constitutional claim considered on the merits if he makes a proper showing of actual innocence.at citing sawyer whitley.see also murray carrier,w e think that in an extraordinary case,where a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,a federal habeas court may grant the writ even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default.in other words,a credible showing of actual innocence may allow a prisoner to pursue his claims here,ineffective assistance of counsel on the merits notwithstanding the existence of a procedural bar to relief.this rule,or fundamental miscarriage of justice exception,is grounded in the equitable discretion of habeas courts to see that federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarceration of innocent persons.herrera,at.
we have applied the miscarriage of justice exception to overcome various procedural defaults.these include successive petitions asserting previously rejected claims,see kuhlmann wilson,plurality opinion,abusive petitions asserting in a second petition claims that could have been raised in a first petition,see mccleskey zant,failure to develop facts in state court,see keeney,and failure to observe state procedural rules,including filing deadlines,see coleman thompson,carrier,at.
the miscarriage of justice exception,our decisions bear out,survived aedpa passage.in calderon thompson,we applied the exception to hold that a federal court may,consistent with aedpa,recall its mandate in order to revisit the merits of a decision,at the miscarriage of justice standard is altogether consistent with aedpa central concern that the merits of concluded criminal proceedings not be revisited in the absence of a strong showing of actual innocence.in bousley united states,we held,in the context of,that actual may overcome a prisoner failure to raise a constitutional objection on direct review.most recently,in house,we reiterated that a prisoner proof of actual innocence may provide a gateway for federal habeas review of a procedurally defaulted claim of constitutional error,at.
these decisions see k to balance the societal interests in finality,comity,and conservation of scarce judicial with the individual interest in justice that arises in the extraordinary case.schlup,at.sensitivity to the injustice of incarcerating an innocent individual should not abate when the impediment is aedpa statute of limitations.
as just noted,see supra,at,we have held that the miscarriage of justice exception applies to state procedural rules,including filing deadlines.coleman,at.a federal court may invoke the miscarriage of justice exception to justify consideration of claims defaulted in state court under state timeliness rules.see ibid.the state reading of aedpa time prescription would thus accord greater force to a federal deadline than to a designed state deadline.it would be passing strange to interpret a statute seeking to promote federalism and comity as requiring stricter enforcement of federal procedural rules than procedural rules established and enforced by the states.
the state ties to d text its insistence that aedpa statute of limitations precludes courts from considering gateway claims.section d d,the state contends,forecloses any argument that a habeas petitioner has unlimited time to present new evidence in support of a constitutional claim.brief for petitioner.that is so,the state maintains,because aedpa prescribes a comprehensive system for determining when its limitations period begins to run.included within that system,the state observes,is a specific trigger for the precise circumstance presented here a constitutional claim based on new evidence.ibid.section d d runs the clock from the date on which the factual predicate of the claim could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.in light of that provision,the state urges,there is no need for the courts to act in equity to provide additional time for persons who allege actual innocence as a gateway to their claims of constitutional error.ibid.perkins request for an equitable exception to the statute of limitations,the state charges,would rende r superfluous this carefully scripted scheme.at.
the state argument in this regard bears blinders.aedpa time limitations apply to the typical case in which no allegation of actual innocence is made.the miscarriage of justice exception,we underscore,applies to a severely confined category cases in which new evidence shows it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted the petitioner.schlup,at internal quotation marks omitted.section d d is both modestly more stringent because it requires diligence and dramatically less stringent because it requires no showing of innocence.many petitions that could not pass through the gateway will be timely or not measured by d d triggering provision.that provision,in short,will hardly be rendered superfluous by recognition of the miscarriage of justice exception.
the state further relies on provisions of aedpa other than d d,namely,b b and e,to urge that congress knew how to incorporate the miscarriage of justice exception when it was so minded.section b b,the state observes,provides that a petitioner whose first federal habeas petition has already been adjudicated when new evidence comes to light may file a petition when,and only when,the facts underlying the new claim would by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.b b ii.and e,which generally bars evidentiary hearings in federal habeas proceedings by state prisoners,includes an exception for who present new evidence of their innocence.see e a ii,b permitting evidentiary hearings in federal court if the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense 
but congress did not simply incorporate the miscarriage of justice exception into b b and e.rather,congress constrained the application of the exception.prior to aedpa enactment,a court could grant relief on a petition,then known as an abusive petition,if the petitioner could show that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from a failure to entertain the claim.mccleskey,at.section b b limits the exception to cases in which the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence,and the petitioner can establish that no reasonable factfinder would have found her guilty of the underlying offense by clear and convincing evidence.congress thus required habeas petitioners attempting to benefit from the miscarriage of justice exception to meet a higher level of proof clear and convincing evidence and to satisfy a diligence requirement that did not exist prior to aedpa passage.
likewise,petitioners asserting actual innocence could obtain evidentiary hearings in federal court even if they failed to develop facts in state court.see keeney,at a habeas petitioner failure to develop a claim in proceedings will be excused and a hearing mandated if he can show that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from failure to hold a federal evidentiary hearing.under aedpa,a petitioner seeking an evidentiary hearing must show diligence and,in addition,establish her actual innocence by clear and convincing evidence.e a ii,b.
sections b b and e thus reflect congress will to modify the miscarriage of justice exception with respect to petitions and the of evidentiary hearings in federal court.these do not demonstrate congress intent to preclude courts from applying the exception,unmodified,to the type of petition at issue here an untimely first federal habeas petition alleging a gateway claim.house,at the more rational inference to draw from congress incorporation of a modified version of the miscarriage of justice exception in b b and e is simply this in a case not governed by those provisions,a first petition for federal habeas relief,the miscarriage of justice exception survived aedpa passage intact and unrestricted 
our reading of the statute is supported by the court opinion in holland.e quitable principles have traditionally governed the substantive law of habeas corpus,holland reminded,and affirmed that we will not construe a statute to displace courts traditional equitable authority absent the clearest command.at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.the text of d contains no clear command countering the courts equitable authority to invoke the miscarriage of justice exception to overcome expiration of the statute of limitations governing a first federal habeas petition.as we observed in holland,
aedpa seeks to eliminate delays in the federal habeas review process.but aedpa seeks to do so without undermining basic habeas corpus principles and while seeking to harmonize the new statute with prior law.when congress codified new rules governing this previously judicially managed area of law,it did so without losing sight of the fact that the writ of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitutional rights.at slip,at citations 
and internal quotation marks omitted 
having rejected the state argument that d d precludes a court from entertaining an untimely first federal habeas petition raising a convincing claim of actual innocence,we turn to the state further objection to the sixth circuit opinion.even if a habeas petitioner asserting a credible claim of actual innocence may overcome aedpa statute of limitations,the state argues,the court of appeals erred in finding that no threshold diligence requirement at all applies to perkins petition.
while formally distinct from its argument that d d text forecloses a claim alleging actual innocence,the state contention makes scant sense.section d d requires a habeas petitioner to file a claim within one year of the time in which new evidence could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.it would be bizarre to hold that a habeas 
petitioner who asserts a convincing claim of actual innocence may overcome the statutory time bar d d erects,yet simultaneously encounter a diligence barrier to pursuit of her petition.see,at requiring reasonable diligence effectively makes the concept of the actual innocence gateway redundant,since petitioners seek an equitable exception only when they were not reasonably diligent in complying with d d.
while we reject the state argument that habeas petitioners who assert convincing claims must prove diligence to cross a federal court threshold,we hold that the sixth circuit erred to the extent that it eliminated timing as a factor relevant in evaluating the reliability of a petitioner proof of innocence.to invoke the miscarriage of justice exception to aedpa statute of limitations,we repeat,a petitioner must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence.schlup,at.unexplained delay in presenting new evidence bears on the determination whether the petitioner has made the requisite showing.perkins so.see brief for respondent unjustified delay may figure in determining whether a petitioner has made a sufficient showing of innocence as we stated in schlup,a court may consider how the timing of the submission and the likely credibility of a petitioner affiants bear on the probable reliability of evidence of actual innocence.at.see also house,at.
considering a petitioner diligence,not discretely,but as part of the assessment whether actual innocence has been convincingly shown,attends to the state concern that it will be prejudiced by a prisoner untoward delay in proffering new evidence.the state fears that a prisoner might lie in wait and use stale evidence to collaterally 
attack his conviction when an elderly witness has died and can not appear at a hearing to rebut new evidence.brief for petitioner.the timing of such a petition,however,should seriously undermine the credibility of the claim.moreover,the deceased witness prior testimony,which would have been subject to,could be introduced in the event of a new trial.see crawford washington,recognizing exception to the confrontation clause where witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for.and frivolous petitions should occasion instant dismissal.see rule.focusing on the merits of a petitioner claim and taking account of delay in that context,rather than treating timeliness as a threshold inquiry,is tuned to the rationale underlying the miscarriage of justice exception,ensuring that federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarceration of innocent persons.herrera,at 
we now return to the case at hand.the district court proceeded properly in first determining that perkins claim was filed well beyond aedpa limitations period and that equitable tolling was unavailable to perkins because he could demonstrate neither exceptional circumstances nor diligence.see supra,at.the district court then found that perkins alleged newly discovered evidence,the information contained in the three affidavits,was substantially available to perkins at trial.
app.to pet.for cert.moreover,the proffered evidence,even if new,was hardly adequate to show that,had it been presented at trial,no reasonable juror would have convicted perkins,at.
the sixth circuit granted a certificate of appealability limited to the question whether reasonable diligence is a precondition to reliance on actual innocence as a gateway to adjudication of a federal habeas petition on the merits.we have explained that untimeliness,although not an unyielding ground for dismissal of a petition,does bear on the credibility of evidence proffered to show actual innocence.on remand,the district court appraisal of perkins petition as insufficient to meet schlup standard should be dispositive,absent cause,which we do not currently see,for the sixth circuit to upset that evaluation.we stress once again that the schlup standard is demanding.the gateway should open only when a petition presents evidence of innocence so strong that a court can not have confidence in the outcome of the trial unless the court is also satisfied that the trial was free of nonharmless constitutional error.at.
for the reasons stated,the judgment of the sixth circuit is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.

the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa provides that a period of limitation shall apply to a state prisoner application for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.d.the gaping hole in today opinion for the court is its failure to answer the crucial question upon which all else depends what is the source of the court power to fashion what it concedes is an exception to this clear statutory command 
that question is unanswered because there is no answer.this court has no such power,and not one of the cases cited by the opinion says otherwise.the constitution vests legislative power only in congress,which never enacted the exception the court creates today.that inconvenient truth resolves this case.
actual innocence has,until today,been an exception only to,prudential barriers to habeas relief,or as a means of channeling judges statutorily conferred discretion not to apply a procedural bar.never before have we applied the exception to circumvent a categorical statutory bar to relief.we have not done so because we have no power to do so.where congress has erected a constitutionally valid barrier to habeas relief,a court can not decline to give it effect.
before aedpa,the supreme court had developed an array of doctrines,see,wainwright sykes,procedural default mccleskey zant,abuse of the writ,to limit the habeas practice that it had radically expanded in the early or century to include review of the merits of conviction and not merely jurisdiction of the convicting court,see stone powell,citing frank mangum,brown allen,jackson,concurring in result bator,finality in criminal law and federal habeas corpus for state prisoners,harv.for example,the doctrine of procedural default holds that a state prisoner default of his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule bars federal habeas review of those claims.coleman thompson.that doctrine is not a statutory or jurisdictional command rather,it is a prudential rule grounded in considerations of comity and concerns for the orderly administration of criminal justice.dretke haley,quoting francis henderson.
and what courts have created,courts can modify.one exception to procedural default allows a petitioner to proceed where he can demonstrate cause for the default and prejudice.see coleman,supra,at.as relevant here,we have also expressed a willingness to excuse a petitioner default,even absent a showing of cause,where a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.murray carrier,see schlup delo,house bell.
there is nothing inherently inappropriate as opposed to merely unwise about exceptions to barriers to relief.procedural default,for example,raises no question of a federal district court power to entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus.francis,supra,at.where a petitioner would,but for a doctrine like procedural default,have a good habeas claim,it offends no command of congress for a federal court to consider the petition.but that approach has no place where a statutory bar to habeas relief is at issue.t he power to award the writ by any of the courts of the united states,must be given by written law,ex parte bollman,cranch,marshall,and judgments about the proper scope of the writ are normally for congress to make,felker turpin,quoting lonchar thomas.one would have thought it too obvious to mention that this court is duty bound to enforce aedpa,not amend it.
because we have no equitable power to discard statutory barriers to habeas relief,we can not simply extend exceptions to barriers into the statutory realm.the court insupportable leap from procedural bars to all procedural bars,including statutory bars,does all the work in its opinion and there is not a whit of precedential support for it.mccleskey zant applied a miscarriage of justice exception to the doctrine,at.coleman thompson and murray carrier applied it to the doctrine,at,at.keeney,applied it to a variant of procedural default a state prisoner failure adequately to develop material facts in state court,at.kuhlmann wilson,a plurality opinion,applied it to a statute that merely said lower federal courts need not entertain successive petitions,thus leaving them with discretion to entertain successive petitions under some circumstances.at,emphasis added.not one of the cases on which the court relies today supports the extraordinary premise that courts can create out of whole cloth an exception to a statutory bar to relief.
the opinion for the court also trots out cases to prove the irrelevant point that t he miscarriage of justice exception survived aedpa passage.ante,at.what it ignores,yet again,is that after aedpa passage,as before,the exception applied only to nonstatutory obstacles to relief.bousley united states and house bell were applications of the doctrine of procedural default.see bousley,at stevens,concurring in part and dissenting in part i agree with the court central holding that none of its rules foreclose petitioner collateral attack emphasis added,at scalia,dissenting house,at.calderon thompson,a case,involved the courts of appeals inherent power to recall their mandates,subject to review for an abuse of discretion,at it stands only for the proposition that the exception is an appropriate means of channeling that discretion,at quoting mccleskey,supra,at.
the court opinion,in its way,acknowledges the dearth of precedential support for its holding.prior to aedpa,it concedes,this court had not ruled that a credible claim of actual innocence could supersede a federal statute of limitations.ante,at.its explanation for this lack of precedent is that before aedpa,petitions for federal habeas relief were not governed by any statute of limitations.ibid.that is true but utterly unprobative.there are many statutory bars to relief other than statutes of limitations,and we had never and before today,have never created an exception to any of them.the reason why is obvious judicially amending a validly enacted statute in this way is a flagrant breach of the separation of powers.
the court has no qualms about transgressing such a basic principle.it does not even attempt to cloak its act of judicial legislation in the pretense that it is merely construing the statute indeed,it freely admits that its opinion recognizes an exception that the statute does not contain.ante,at.and it dismisses,with a series of transparent non sequiturs,michigan overwhelming textual argument that the statute provides no such exception and envisions none.
the key textual point is that two provisions of,working in tandem,provide a comprehensive path to relief for an innocent prisoner who has newly discovered evidence that supports his constitutional claim.section d d gives him a fresh year in which to file,starting on the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence,while b b lifts the bar on second or successive petitions.congress clearly anticipated the scenario of a habeas petitioner with a credible innocence claim and addressed it by crafting an exception and an exception,by the way,more restrictive than the one that pleases the court today.one can not assume that congress left room for other,applications of the exception,any more than one would add another gear to a swiss watch on the theory that the watchmaker surely would have included it if he had thought of it.in both cases,the intricate craftsmanship tells us that the designer arranged things just as he wanted them.
the court feeble rejoinder is that its judicially invented version of the actual innocence exception applies only to a severely confined category of cases.ante,at.since cases qualifying for the exception will be rare,it explains,the statutory path for innocent petitioners will not be rendered superfluous.ibid.that is no answer at all.that the court exception would not entirely frustrate congress design does not weaken the force of the state argument that congress addressed the issue comprehensively and chose to exclude dilatory prisoners like respondent.by the court logic,a statute banning littering could simply be deemed to contain an exception for cigarette butts after all,the statute as thus amended would still cover something.that is not how a court respectful of the separation of powers should interpret statutes.
even more bizarre is the court concern that applying aedpa statute of limitations without recognizing an atextual exception would accord greater force to a federal dead
