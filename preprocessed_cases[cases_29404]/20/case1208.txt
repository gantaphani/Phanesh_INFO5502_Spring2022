in,a jury in randall county,texas,convicted timothy titsworth of capital murder of christine marie sossaman by striking her with an ax in the course of a robbery.the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence two years later in an unpublished opinion that court described the crime as follows 
t he evidence shows titsworth and the victim had been living together for approximately two months when this offense occurred.a friend of the victim testified that on the day before the victim murder the victim told her she intended to ask titsworth to move out of the house because the victim believed titsworth was stealing from her.
the next day titsworth killed the victim in her bedroom by striking her with a dull ax approximately sixteen times excluding the defensive wounds on the victims sic hands and legs.the victim probably was asleep in bed when the attack began.at some point during the attack the victim was either taken off or came off the bed.the victim suffered at least seven blows from the ax while she was on the floor.after the attack,titsworth left the victim on the floor.the medical examiner testified the victim could have lived anywhere from twenty minutes to a number of hours after the initial attack.after she died,the victim suffered at least one more blow from the ax in a separate episode from the initial attack.
after the initial attack,titsworth took the victim car and some of the victim personal property.titsworth sold the victim personal property and used the money to buy crack cocaine.over the next couple of days titsworth and other admitted crack cocaine users made a couple of trips to the victim home and took more of her property.they used the victim property to buy more crack cocaine.one of these witnesses testified titsworth acted like he was just having a good time.
after titsworth exhausted his supply of money and drugs,he slept for approximately ten or eleven hours.after he awoke,he and another person decided to make another trip to the victim home in the victim car to get more of her property.however,by this time the victim mother had found the victim body and had alerted the police who were then looking for titsworth.the police arrested titsworth and another person in the victim car while,according to this other person,they were on their way to the victim home.
later that day,after initially denying any involvement in the offense,titsworth confessed to killing the victim and taking her property.in his confession,titsworth claimed he and the victim had some type of argument after she accused titsworth of messing around.after slapping titsworth around,the victim went to bed.titsworth left the house and bought some crack cocaine and a pill he thought was lsd.titsworth ingested the drugs and went back to the house.titsworth retrieved an ax from a closet while the victim was asleep in bed.titsworth claimed he blacked out but he remembered hitting the victim with the ax.he claimed he hit the victim four or five times with the ax.he claimed that when he realized what he had done he did not know what to do so he sold some of the victim property and bought more crack cocaine.on his first trip back to the victim home,titsworth claimed the victim was still breathing and it looked like she had tried to crawl into the bathroom.however,titsworth left the house with more of the victim property which titsworth sold to buy more crack cocaine.titsworth claimed he was taking a friend home when the police arrested him.
titsworth theory at trial was that he was not guilty of capital murder because the evidence showed only that he killed the victim under the influence of drugs as a result of a lover spat and not with the intent to take her property 
titsworth sought state habeas relief in.the state habeas judge,samuel kiser,also presided over the trial.judge kiser found there were no questions of fact and entered findings and conclusions with a recommendation that relief be denied.he did not conduct an evidentiary hearing.the court of criminal appeals adopted his findings and conclusions and denied relief.
titsworth filed a petition for federal habeas relief seeking relief upon eleven grounds.the state makes no contention that any of these federal claims were not first fairly presented to the state courts,except for the claim that titsworth confession was involuntary and should have been suppressed because he was intoxicated united states district judge mary lou robinson referred the case to magistrate judge clinton averitte.he held an evidentiary hearing limited to portions of the four claims involving the testimony of deputy cindy risley.
judge robinson adopted the magistrate findings and recommendation that the petition and a certificate of appealability be denied.titsworth in turn seeks a certificate of appealability from this court on nine claims 
whether titsworth was deprived of due process and a fair trial because the state failed to disclose favorable and material evidence 
whether the admission of titsworth written statement violated his right to due process because he was intoxicated at the time the statement was taken 
whether titsworth right to due process was violated by the state allowance of false testimony at trial 
whether titsworth was denied effective assistance from trial counsel failure to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence 
whether titsworth was denied effective assistance from trial counsel failure to fully investigate and present evidence in support of suppressing titsworth written statement 
whether titsworth was denied effective assistance from trial counsel failure to request a copy of a psychiatric report,to object to the state failure to provide titsworth with a copy of such report,or to make the sealed report a part of the appellate record 
whether titsworth was denied effective assistance from trial counsel failure to raise in a timely and specific manner,a request for the appointment of a psychiatric expert to assist in titsworth defense 
whether titsworth was denied due process by the trial court failure to provide funds for a psychiatrist and 
whether titsworth was denied due process by the trial court order sealing a psychiatric report.
a certificate of appealability is a jurisdictional prerequisite to this appeal a certificate requires a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.this showing requires that reasonable jurists could debate whether or,for that a matter,agree that the district court should have resolved the claims in a different manner or that this court should encourage titsworth to pursue his claims in federal court following oral argument,we refused all requests for a certificate of appealability,save one.we advised counsel as follows 
the court has denied a certificate of appealability on all issues except one.it has granted a certificate of appealability on titsworth contention that the state breached its duty under brady in failing to disclose the opinions of deputy risley regarding titsworth condition when he was booked into jail by her.
if petitioner titsworth wishes to file a supplemental brief,he may do so within fifteen days.the state may reply ten days thereafter.
with the benefit of this additional briefing,we now explain our denial of a coa and our reason for rejecting on its merits the claim for which we issued a certificate.
titsworth first three claims are factually interrelated.they focus upon his intoxication when the murder was committed and when he was taken into custody and interrogated.he asserts that the government withheld evidence of his intoxication that was material both to his contentions about the it was a lover quarrel,not a to whether his confession was voluntary.relatedly,he urges that the officer who took his statement,sergeant white,knowingly gave false testimony at trial concerning the statement.
we turn first to the claim that the prosecution committed a brady violation by failing to disclose that a deputy in the randall county sheriff office had expressed an opinion to that titsworth was intoxicated when she booked him into the jail the law is clear.the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment requires prosecutors to disclose to a defendant,on request,any evidence which is favorable and material to the issue of guilt or punishment evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different had it been disclosed to the defendant a reasonable probability of a different result is shown when the government evidentiary suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.this disclosure requirement imposes a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government behalf in the case,including the police.a brady violation entails three components the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the state,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued.
the state trial judge granted the usual brady request to order the prosecutor to turn over information favorable to the defense,including information regarding any witnesses who would give favorable testimony.titsworth made no contention to the state trial judge before his conviction and sentence that the confession was involuntary because he was intoxicated rather,his motion to suppress his confession contended that it was a product of an illegal arrest.it was denied.he did rely at trial upon evidence of his intoxication and difficulties with drugs and alcohol,but only in mitigation and in support of his contention that the killing was not a robbery but a lover quarrel.
judge kiser,presiding over the state habeas proceedings,found that the failure to disclose risley statement did not violate brady.he filed detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
deputy risley testimony was presented to judge kiser only in an affidavit which she had refused to sign.he refused to consider it.he credited the testimony of john ballard,who was with titsworth on the day he was arrested and confessed.judge kiser found that he gave uncontradicted testimony that titsworth had slept from ten to eleven hours immediately prior to his arrest.during this time,neither ballard nor titsworth consumed any drugs or alcohol.judge kiser held as an alternative basis for denying relief on this claim that it was barred because it was never raised at trial or on direct appeal.
the federal magistrate in turn rejected the claim after an evidentiary hearing at which he heard the testimony of risley.at the federal hearing cindy risley testified that she was the deputy responsible for booking titsworth into the randall county jail.she testified that titsworth was under the influence of drugs or alcohol during the hour or so it took to book him into the jail.she also stated that she had told fellow officers of titsworth condition at the time of booking,but was told not to say such things.she testified that he was grinning and laughing and that he did seem to be aware of the seriousness at the time.according to risley h e would laugh,he nod off.i had to wake him up a couple of times during the booking process.he did seem to understand at the time what he was being brought in for.she recalled that he answered questions as if the victim were still alive.
the magistrate judge concluded that there was no brady obligation to produce this evidence because with due diligence it was available to the defense.specifically,risley had been listed as a trial witness and was available.she in fact testified in the sentencing phase of the trial.the magistrate further pointed out that,at the evidentiary hearing he conducted,titsworth did not testify and offered no other evidence regarding his intoxication.the magistrate judge also noted that titsworth made incriminating statements to persons in addition to sargent white,who took the confession.finally,he credited white testimony regarding titsworth interrogation in which he confessed,concluding that white was in a much better position to observe titsworth intoxication than risley.
we were persuaded that a certificate of appealability should issue on the claim that the failure to disclose the statements made by deputy risley violated brady.reasonable jurists may differ over whether the federal district court should have resolved this claim in a different manner insofar as it rested on the view that there was no breach of duty to disclose risley comments to her because the defendant with due diligence could have learned of them.the principle that there is no duty to produce,evidence equally available to the prosecution and defense is sound but is pushed too far on these facts.the prosecutors had been ordered to produce information favorable to the defense and assured counsel that they had done so.while we granted a certificate of appealability on this issue,with the benefit of full briefing and oral argument,we are persuaded that the claim is ultimately without merit in that the evidence is not material.the judgment of the district court denying relief on this claim must be affirmed.
titsworth made no claim to the trial court or the texas court of criminal appeals on direct appeal that his confession was involuntary because his free will was lost to alcohol and drugs.judge kiser found that the claim is procedurally barred,and that finding was adopted by the court of criminal appeals and the federal magistrate in turn.
this independent state ground for barring titsworth brady claim does not end the matter.it is suggested that various comments made to risley by fellow officers,such as reminding her that she is an employee and she should not be making comments like that,constitute good cause for excusing this procedural default.when titsworth finally raised the brady issue in his state habeas proceeding,his submission did not include risley testimony.only her unsigned affidavit was offered to judge kiser not surprisingly,he refused to consider it and neither side had otherwise secured her testimony.
risley sworn testimony as to titsworth condition at the time of booking was not taken until the hearing before the federal magistrate.he credited her testimony that she always felt free to express her opinion in open court and had told as much.risley testified that she would have cooperated with defense counsel and testified truthfully at trial if asked to do so.both the former district attorney and county sheriff testified that they would not have prevented anyone with evidence from coming forward.we are offered no basis for ignoring these fact findings and reaching a contrary conclusion.regardless,even if the various comments made to deputy risley did frustrate the defendant access to the evidence and excuse the procedural default,we need not rest there.the claim also fails on its merits.that is,assuming the defendant has opened a road,it leads nowhere now because it would have led nowhere then.
the argument is that had risley comments been disclosed to defense counsel,he could have attacked the confession as involuntary and further used her testimony both to support the defensive theory of lover spat,not a robbery as well as in mitigation.this contention is as unpersuasive to us as it was to titsworth trial counsel.as the magistrate judge pointed out,deputy risley was listed as a trial witness.while it was a very long list of witnesses the prosecution handed to counsel,deputy risley name was hardly lost in the crowd as unknown.the defense knew that she was the booking officer and that she had befriended titsworth.photographs of titsworth being booked were received into evidence reflecting behavior seemingly inappropriate to the occasion,such as his laughing and smiling.the level of detail in the confession itself disclosed his significant capacity for recall.trial counsel selden hale explained that titsworth remembered what he told the police officer and intoxication did seem to me at the time to be an issue.joe marr wilson also explained that risley opinion would not have changed the judge ruling on the confession.moreover,he pointed out that risley could have been a harmful witness in the guilt phase,presumably by she later did in the sentencing an escape by titsworth with three oth
