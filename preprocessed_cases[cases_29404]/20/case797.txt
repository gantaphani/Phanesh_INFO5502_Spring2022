opinion of the court 
introduction 
when this appeal originally came before this panel of the court,we decided that state officials hereafter the commonwealth,against whom a habeas corpus proceeding had been filed,can waive the state defense of the statute of limitations that is set forth in the and effective death penalty act aedpa.the members of the panel were unanimous on that issue.judge nygaard authored the opinion of the court,which was filed march.the factual background,and the portion of that earlier opinion reflecting the views of the court on that issue,are incorporated here as part i with only such changes as are required in light of the different posture of the appeals.
the remainder of the opinion considered the application of waiver under the facts of this case.judge nygaard,in the portion of the opinion writing for a majority of the panel,held that the commonwealth waived its limitations defense.i dissented on the ground that under the procedural background in this case,the commonwealth had not waived the statute of limitations defense because it had appropriately asserted it in its first relevant pleading after remand from this court before the district court.
the commonwealth filed a petition for rehearing en banc.on april,the court entered an order granting rehearing en banc and vacating the opinion and judgment filed march.thereafter,on may,the court vacated the april order granting rehearing en banc and remanded the case to the original panel for panel rehearing.
at the direction of the court,robinson,the appellant,then filed his answer to the petition for rehearing,and the commonwealth,with the permission of the court,filed its reply to robinson answer.
the opinion of the court follows,part i taken from judge nygaard original opinion as explained above,and parts ii and iii authored by judge sloviter sur rehearing.
appellant,eric robinson,was convicted in a bench trial before the court of common pleas of philadelphia of first degree murder,conspiracy,theft by unlawful taking,robbery,and possession of an instrument of crime.he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder conviction and a concurrent aggregate sentence of twenty to years imprisonment on the remaining counts.
robinson filed a direct appeal in the pennsylvania superior court,which affirmed the judgment.see commonwealth robinson,table.the pennsylvania supreme court denied robinson request for discretionary review.this ended the direct review of robinson case.
robinson then filed a pro se petition for collateral relief under the pennsylvania post conviction hearing act pcha.ann.et,alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.the court appointed counsel to represent robinson,and it subsequently denied his petition for relief.this denial of collateral relief was affirmed by the pennsylvania superior court.see commonwealth robinson,table.robinson did not petition for allocatur with the pennsylvania supreme court.
on august,robinson filed his first federal habeas petition alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel,insufficiency of evidence,and violation of the fourth amendment.a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation which concluded that robinson failure to pursue discretionary review in the pennsylvania supreme court of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim constituted a procedural default.the district court adopted the magistrate report and recommendation,concluding that the ineffectiveness claim had been procedurally defaulted.see order,robinson vaughn.robinson appealed that decision,and we denied robinson request for issuance of a certificate of probable cause because of robinson failure to exhaust his state remedies.see order,robinson vaughn,cir.thus,as to the ineffectiveness claim,robinson first federal habeas petition was dismissed so that he could exhaust his remedies in the commonwealth.
robinson returned to the commonwealth courts and filed a second petition under the pcra,again alleging ineffective assistance of his trial counsel and now also alleging the ineffectiveness of his appellate counsel.this application was denied,and robinson did not appeal.
robinson filed a third state application for relief.that petition was denied by the court of common pleas.robinson then appealed to the pennsylvania superior court,which affirmed the denial.see commonwealth robinson,phila,table.robinson petitioned for,and was denied,allocatur by the pennsylvania supreme court.see commonwealth robinson,table.
robinson filed his second federal habeas petition,which is the one at issue in this appeal,on september,alleging ineffective assistance of counsel as a ground for habeas relief.his petition also reasserts as grounds for habeas relief the insufficiency of the evidence against him and the allegedly unlawful seizure of evidence in violation of the fourth amendment.
robinson petition was referred to a magistrate judge who ordered a responsive pleading including specific and detailed answers and a brief or memorandum of law in support thereof from the office of the district attorney of philadelphia on november.on january,the district attorney filed a letter pleading which argued that robinson petition should be transferred to the court of appeals for the third circuit because it was a successive petition.the district attorney contended that the denial of robinson first federal habeas petition in precluded relief because he had not received permission for a successive petition from this court as is required by the and effective death penalty act,et.the magistrate judge recommended denying robinson second federal habeas petition,and on april,the district court accepted the magistrate judge recommendation and denied the petition.
robinson appealed that decision,and we ordered the district attorney to show cause why the order dismissing the petition should not be summarily reversed in light of our decision in christy horn,cir,where we held that when a federal habeas petition has been dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust state remedies,a petitioner,after exhausting his state remedies,need not apply to the court of appeals for authorization to file a federal habeas action,but may file his petition in the district court as if it were his first such filing.on december,the district attorney filed a letter brief conceding that robinson second federal habeas petition indeed was not successive.the district attorney did not present any alternative legal grounds for affirming the district court conclusion.thus,we accepted the commonwealth concession and summarily reversed and remanded.
on remand,robinson filed a motion to strike his original petition and for permission to file an amended petition which the magistrate judge granted.the district attorney moved for reconsideration of the order permitting robinson to amend his petition.then on march,the district attorney asserted that robinson second federal habeas petition was by the limitations provision of the aedpa,d.robinson,in return,argued that the commonwealth statute of limitations defense was untimely.
the magistrate judge vacated his initial order granting robinson leave to amend his petition,and instead substituted a report and recommendation adopting the district attorney argument that robinson second federal habeas petition should be dismissed on statute of limitations grounds.in particular,the magistrate judge concluded that robinson third state petition had not been properly filed because it involved claims subject to a state procedural default rule and did not toll the period of limitations therefore,robinson second federal habeas petition was required to be filed on or before april,alternatively,if the third state habeas petition had been properly filed,then robinson second federal habeas petition should have been filed on or before september,and finally,because robinson had access to his legal papers for eleven of the twelve months prior to the expiration of the september limitations period,the period of limitations should not be equitably tolled.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation over robinson renewed objection that the commonwealth had waived its limitations defense and robinson further proffer regarding the efforts he had made to acquire his legal papers.robinson noted a timely appeal,and the district court granted his request for a certificate of appealability robinson was granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis,and we appointed counsel to represent him.
our first question is whether it is even possible for a state to waive its aedpa limitations defense,an issue which we have not yet specifically addressed.the statute of limitations provision of the aedpa provides,in pertinent part 
a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.the limitation period shall run from the latest of the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.
d a.the district court dismissed robinson habeas petition because it was filed beyond this period of limitation.
the law of this circuit clearly holds that the limitations provision of the aedpa is not jurisdictional in nature.see miller new jersey state dep t of,cir.as such,it is subject to equitable modifications such as tolling.id.citing oshiver levin,fishbein,sedran berman,cir.
other courts of appeals which,like us,do not view the aedpa limitations period as jurisdictional have held that a limitations defense may be waived by a state defendant in a habeas proceeding.see,green united states,cir finding that the government had expressly waive d its aedpa statute of limitations defense by advocating a remand and suggesting the conditions for that remand saucier warden,state prison,table,wl cir unpublished opinion finding that government did not waive its aedpa statute of limitations defense,even though it did not assert the defense in its answer,where the petitioner showed no prejudice thus implying that government waiver is possible scott johnson,cir finding that the government did not waive its aedpa statute of limitations defense,thus implying that government waiver is possible samuel duncan,wl,cir table unpublished opinion aedpa statute of limitations defense can be waived.
we join these courts of appeals and now hold that because the aedpa limitations period is subject to equitable modifications such as tolling,it is also subject to other,equitable considerations,such as waiver.
parties are generally required to assert affirmative defenses early in litigation,so they may be ruled upon,prejudice may be avoided,and judicial resources may be conserved.habeas proceedings are no exception.rule of the rules governing section cases in the united states district courts the habeas rules makes the federal rules of civil procedure applicable to habeas petitions to the extent they are not inconsistent with the habeas rules.federal rule of civil procedure c requires that a defendant plead an affirmative defense,such as a statute of limitations defense,in his answer.rule c states 
affirmative defenses.in pleading to a preceding pleading,a party shall set forth affirmatively statute of limitations and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.
the purpose of requiring the defendant to plead available affirmative defenses in his answer is to avoid surprise and undue prejudice by providing the plaintiff with notice and the opportunity to demonstrate why the affirmative defense should not succeed.see,of,d see also williams ashland eng g,cir the purpose of rule c is to give the court and the other parties fair warning that a particular line of defense will be pursued.grant preferred research,cir the supreme court has held that the purpose of rule c is to give the opposing party notice of the affirmative defense and a chance to rebut it.citing marino otis eng g,cir the purpose behind rule c is to put plaintiff on notice well in advance of trial that defendant intends to present a defense in the nature of an avoidance.citations omitted perez united states,cir the central purpose of the rule c requirement that affirmative defenses be pled is to prevent unfair surprise.a defendant should not be permitted to lie behind a log and ambush a plaintiff with an unexpected defense.citations omitted.
technically,the federal rules of civil procedure require that affirmative defenses be pleaded in the answer.rule b states that e very defense shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is required,except that the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion the defenses listed in rule b do not include limitations defenses.thus,a limitations defense must be raised in the answer,since rule b does not permit it to be raised by motion.however,the law of this circuit the third circuit rule permits a limitations defense to be raised by a motion under rule b,but only if the time alleged in the statement of a claim shows that the cause of action has not been brought within the statute of limitations.hanna veterans admin,cir.if the bar is not apparent on the face of the complaint,then it may not afford the basis for a dismissal of the complaint under rule b.bethel jendoco constr,cir.
the commonwealth argues,and we agree,that a limitations defense does not necessarily have to be raised in the answer.but it does not follow that a limitations defense can be raised at any time.consistent with the purpose of rule c,courts require that defendants assert a limitations defense as early as reasonably possible.see davis bryan,cir the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense under.c that must be asserted in a party responsive pleading at the earliest possible moment and is a personal defense that is waived if not promptly pleaded.citations omitted banks chesapeake potomac,paetz united states,cir hopkins andaya,cir day liberty nat.life ins,cir employer waived statute of limitations defense to aeda claim by not raising it until after a jury verdict in its motion to alter or amend judgment.
courts routinely consider the timeliness of a limitations defense.although some have adhered to the strict language of rule c,which requires that a limitations defense be raised in the answer,others have considered the stage of the proceedings at which the limitations defense is first raised.for example,the seventh circuit in venters city of delphi,cir,found that the defendants waived their statute of limitations defense when they did not raise it until late in the proceedings.in venters,the defendants did not include their statute of limitations defense in their answer to the original and amended complaints.id.at.instead,the first and only mention of the statute of limitations came in their reply memorandum in support of the motion for summary judgment,submitted a year after the case was filed.id.the court acknowledged that many cases recognize that the failure to plead an affirmative defense can be harmless,notwithstanding the terms of rule c,but found that in this case the defendants had deprived the plaintiff of fair notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond to their affirmative defense by not raising it until the parties had largely completed an exhaustive discovery process,and the scheduled trial date was only a month away.id.see also strauss douglas aircraft,cir w here the party seeking to amend the answer wishes to raise a defense of limitations long after the answer was first filed,a court would be remiss if it did not carefully balance the effects of such action for it is manifest that risk of substantial prejudice increases in proportion to the length of defendant delay in seeking the amendment in sum,the party wishing to raise the defense is obliged to plead the statute of limitations at the earliest possible moment.hayden ford motor,cir whatever the motives behind the plaintiff and defendant pleading strategy,to allow the defendant to raise the bar of the statute of limitations after so long a delay thirty months and after so many intervening acts had occurred,would make a mockery of the intent and purpose of the statute of limitations.int l of boilermakers,local transue williams,cir rejecting limitations defense as untimely when first raised in a motion to amend the district court judgment over a year after the suit was filed.
we have even found a limitations defense to be waived where it was pleaded in the answer,but where it was not pursued before trial.in ernst whinney,cir,the defendant raised the statute of limitations defense in its answer,but it did not file a motion or present argument before the district court on the statute of limitations issue at any time before or at the trial.id.at.then,following a trial and jury verdict,the defendant attempted to raise its statute of limitations defense in motions.id.at.we did not permit this,finding that it would be grossly unfair to allow a plaintiff to go to the expense of trying a case only to be met by a new defense after trial.id.at.
all of these cases reflect,in one form or another,attempts by the courts to keep the consideration of affirmative defenses consistent with at least the purpose,if not necessarily the language,of rule c.affirmative defenses must be raised as early as practicable,not only to avoid prejudice,but also to promote judicial economy.if a party has a successful affirmative defense,raising that defense as early as possible,and permitting a court to rule on it,may terminate the proceedings at that point without wasting precious legal and judicial resources.
we hold,therefore,that affirmative defenses under the aedpa should be treated the same as affirmative defenses in other contexts,and,if not pleaded in the answer,they must be raised at the earliest practicable moment thereafter.
the issue before us on rehearing is whether the commonwealth assertion of its affirmative defense of the statute of limitations was untimely.
to recapitulate the sequence of events,robinson relevant federal habeas petition was filed september.on november,the magistrate judge ordered that the commonwealth file a responsive pleading and memorandum.in its letter response,the commonwealth sought transfer to this court,arguing that the petition was successive because robinson had filed an earlier federal habeas petition that had been dismissed the commonwealth successiveness argument persuaded the district court,which dismissed the complaint.however,under the holding of christy horn,when a prior petition for habeas corpus has been dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust state remedies,no court authorization is necessary and the petitioner may file his petition in the district court as if it were the first such filing.at.
although robinson relied on the decision in christy in his objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,the district court,in a brief order that did not refer to christy,adopted the magistrate judge recommendation that the habeas petition be dismissed.thereafter,on december,we ordered the commonwealth to show cause why we should not summarily reverse the district court dismissal of robinson habeas petition in light of christy.the commonwealth filed a letter brief conceding that under christy the petition was not successive because the earlier petition had been dismissed on exhaustion grounds.on february,we reversed the dismissal and remanded the case to the district court for consideration as if the petition were robinson first habeas petition.order,robinson johnson,cir.
on february,the magistrate judge ordered the commonwealth to file a response on the merits of the petition.on march,robinson filed a motion in the district court to strike his petition for habeas corpus relief and to permit him to file an amended petition.on march,the magistrate judge granted robinson motion and gave him days to amend his petition.on march,the commonwealth filed a response to the petition,there asserting for the first time its argument that robinson habeas petition was barred by aedpa statute of limitations.in the same document,the commonwealth moved for reconsideration of the order granting leave to amend.the magistrate judge vacated his prior order allowing robinson to amend his petition and issued a report and recommendation that the habeas petition be dismissed as untimely,which the district court adopted.
robinson argues that the commonwealth assertion of the statute of limitations defense was too late and that it should have been asserted at the same time as the commonwealth challenge to the petition on successiveness grounds.he contends that nothing in the federal rules of civil procedure prevented the commonwealth from asserting all of its defenses in its initial answer.on reconsideration of this argument,we do not agree with robinson waiver argument.
because.was promulgated before the enactment of aedpa,the rule does not refer to the successiveness issue and it therefore does not categorize that issue among the defenses referred to in the rule.most courts that have considered the issue treat the successiveness issue as comparable to the defense that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter.see spivey state bd.of pardons paroles,cir per curiam holding that where prisoner claim was the functional equivalent of a second habeas petition,and he did not first apply with this court for permission to file a second or successive petition as required by b a,the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain his claim united states gallegos,cir per curiam concluding that when petitioner failed to obtain prior authorization from the court of appeals before filing his third habeas petition in the district court,the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide the petition and its order on the merits must be vacated nelson united states,cir to the extent the district court dealt with the successive motion on its merits,the judgment of that court be and it hereby is vacated for lack of jurisdiction in that court to entertain the motion because petitioner had not obtained an order authorizing such a petition from the court of appeals.
rule g requires the consolidation of all defenses which th e rule permits to be raised by motion.g.although,as discussed earlier,the third circuit rule permits a limitations defense to be raised by motion,rule does not list it among the enumerated defenses deemed waived if not consolidated with other defenses.see.h setting forth defenses waived if omitted from motion in circumstances described in rule g.
a somewhat comparable situation arose in perry sullivan,cir,where the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim,which was granted in part.in response to the third amended complaint,defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the statute of limitations had run.the district court granted the motion,and the court of appeals affirmed,holding that defendant had not waived the statute of limitations defense because he had not filed an answer.the court stated,defendant did not waive his statute of limitations defense by waiting to file it until after the b motions had run their course.id.at.
the commonwealth letter response to robinson habeas petition seeking transfer to this court was equivalent to a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is an even more favored affirmative defense than a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.see.h.it follows that in initially seeking transfer to this court the commonwealth did not act inconsistently with rule requirements as to the presentation of defenses.
equally important is the recognition that aedpa places the defense of successiveness on a different level than other affirmative defenses,such as the statute of limitations.practically speaking,it is unique.second or successive petitions for habeas relief have always faced significant obstacles to consideration in the federal courts because they are,for the most part,wasteful of judicial time and effort.the passage of aedpa in strengthened these obstacles by creating a special screening process for the consideration of second or successive petitions,often referred to as a gatekeeping mechanism.felker turpin,d.section b provides both procedural and substantive limits on the filing of second or successive petitions.one of the most significant changes is the requirement that the applicant must secure approval from the court of appeals to file a successive petition.b a conf,at,code cong.admin.news.unless the court of appeals grants such permission,the district court may not consider the second or successive petition.
review of the language of b a makes apparent the threshold nature of the inquiry into successiveness.the statute provides 
before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court,the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.
b a emphasis added.
robinson argues that there is no significance to the statute introduction to this requirement with the word before.we are not persuaded.no other defense is accompanied by this statutory imperative,and it is apparent that the statutory structure gives priority to the successiveness challenge.
it is true,as robinson argues,that the commonwealth could have raised its statute of limitations defense in the district court when it raised the successiveness issue in response to robinson petition for habeas,but imposing such a requirement is contrary to the procedure established by aedpa.when a second or successive habeas petition is erroneously filed in a district court without the permission of a court of appeals,the district court only option is to dismiss the petition or transfer it to the court of appeals pursuant to.the statute limits the authority of the district court to consider second or successive petitions without an order of the court of appeals.the district courts recognize this limitation.in united states enigwe,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,citations omitted quoting pratt united states,cir,aff cir unpublished,the court stated th e statutory directive means that a district court,faced with an unapproved second or successive habeas petition,must either dismiss it or transfer it to the appropriate court of appeals.
as the court of appeals for the seventh circuit has stated when considering a similar issue 
o nly this court may authorize the commencement of a second or successive petition from the district court perspective,it is an allocation of jurisdiction to the court of appeals.a district court must dismiss a second or successive petition,without awaiting any response from the government,unless the court of appeals has given approval for its filing.even an explicit consent by the government to beginning the case in the district court would be ineffectual the power to authorize its commencement does not reside in either the district court or the executive branch of government.
nunez united states,cir emphasis in original.
there is no practical opportunity for a district court to consider merits defenses,such as the statute of limitations defense,before this court grants authorization to do so under b a.it would circumvent the intent of the gatekeeping function of for a district court to proceed to rule on the merits of a second or successive petition or on any affirmative defense before the court of appeals has made a decision whether to let the petition for habeas corpus proceed in the district court.defenses such as the statute of limitations would be premature at this stage.we therefore reject robinson argument that the commonwealth waived its statute of limitations defense by not raising it in the district court when it challenged robinson petition on the ground of successiveness.
robinson next argues that the commonwealth was obliged to raise its statute of limitations defense in this court in response to his appeal from the district court dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus.although robinson is correct that aedpa does not preclude a court of appeals from considering the statute of limitations defense in deciding whether to grant permission to file a successive habeas petition,and it may well choose to do so,there is no rule that requires the commonwealth to raise that issue at the appellate level.and,of course,rule governing waiver of defenses and consolidation of affirmative defenses in a motion applies only to pleadings in the district court.moreover,it is not the usual practice of this court to consider and determine a defense that has not been considered in the first instance by the district court.often,such defenses require submission of evidentiary material which appellate courts are not in a position to consider in the first instance.it follows that the commonwealth was not obliged to raise its statute of limitations defense on appeal and therefore can not be deemed to have waived the defense for failure to raise it on appeal.
indeed,as the commonwealth points out,there was no appeal of the district court dismissal as that term is ordinarily construed.instead,robinson sought a certificate of appealability from this court under c.we granted a certificate of appealability limited to w hether the district court erred by dismissing appellant petition for writ of habeas corpus under as a second or successive petition for which appellant did not obtain authorization from this court to file under b.order,robinson johnson,cir,
the commonwealth was directed to show cause within fourteen days why the district court dismissal should not be summarily reversed and remanded for consideration as if it were robinson first petition.the commonwealth limited its response to the issue identified.
this court order was directed specifically to the commonwealth filing an answer as to whether the habeas petition was successive.as proceedings were directed solely to determining whether the petition would be allowed under the successiveness rules,there would have been no reason for the commonwealth to raise an alternate ground to uphold the dismissal,which might require the development of a record.ordinarily,the court of appeals consideration of a request for authorization to file a second or successive petition is limited to whether the applicant has made a prima facie showing that the petition complies with the habeas statute substantive successive petition standards.b c.because of this limited scope of review,the commonwealth appropriately limited its response to the issue of successiveness.
after the commonwealth conceded that robinson petition was not successive in light of the development of the law,this court remanded the petition to the district court for consideration as if it were robinson first habeas petition.order,robinson johnson,cir.this language mirrors that in our decision in christy where we held that when a prior petition has been dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust state remedies,no prior authorization is necessary and the petitioner may file his petition in the district court as if it were the first such filing.at emphasis added.once the issue of successiveness was disposed of,the commonwealth could then move beyond that threshold issue to present defenses to the petition,such as the statute of limitations.it was only at this point that the normal rules regarding the waiver of defenses under.c applied.because the commonwealth raised the statute of limitations in its first pleading that was filed in the district court on remand,we hold that it did not waive this defense.
it follows that we must reject robinson suggestion that the commonwealth failure to raise its statute of limitations defense in this court constituted a waiver.
robinson suggests that if the commonwealth did not waive the statute of limitations defense,then this court should hold that his case warrants equitable tolling and should be remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing on that question.we have held that the statutes of limitations in aedpa are subject to tolling in light of equitable considerations.miller,at.in miller,we explained that equitable tolling is proper only when the principles of equity would make the rigid application of a limitation period unfair.id.at quoting shendock director,office of workers compensation programs,cir in banc alteration in original.generally,this will occur when the petitioner has in some extraordinary way been prevented from
