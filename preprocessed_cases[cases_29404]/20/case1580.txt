the michigan court of appeals stated the following facts in affirming ross murder conviction 
defendant,thomas edward ross,was convicted by a jury of.comp.laws on august,the washtenaw circuit court imposed a term of imprisonment of ten to fifteen years for the underlying assault conviction,which it then vacated upon imposing a life term of imprisonment for the conviction.on appeal,defendant argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his conviction t his case involves the fatal shooting of donald schroeder on january,just outside a kmart store on washtenaw avenue in ypsilanti township.essentially,schroeder had come to the aid of a woman who was accosted by two purse snatchers,including defendant,and,during a struggle,had been shot in the heart by one of the assailants.he died instantly.
the trial judge instructed the jury that in order to find ross guilty of felony murder,it must determine that he acted with intent to cause the victim death,and that at the time of the killing of donald schroeder,ross was committing or attempting to commit or assisting another in the commission of the crime of assault with attempt to rob being unarmed.
on appeal,ross challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury finding that he committed,and his conviction for felony murder.the michigan court of appeals affirmed the conviction,finding that testimony established that ross assaulted the owner of the purse with force,and that he had an intent to rob or steal.therefore,the court found,the jury could reasonably find the elements of to be met.ross did not appeal the decision to the michigan supreme court.
ross first applied for state postconviction relief in.the application,which does not form part of the record here,was denied.ross again sought state postconviction relief in march.his application alleged he was wrongfully convicted of murder because was not a predicate offense for felony murder.the michigan trial court granted ross motion for relief from judgment and directed that ross be resentenced for murder.the michigan court of appeals reversed,holding that was a predicate offense.people ross.at the time of ross conviction,michigan statute provided 
murder committed in the perpetration,or attempt to perpetrate arson,criminal sexual conduct in the first or third degree,robbery,breaking and entering of a dwelling,larceny of any kind,extortion,or kidnapping,is murder of the first degree,and shall be punished by imprisonment for life.
comp.laws,amended by.pub.acts michigan offense provides any person,not being armed with a dangerous weapon,who shall assault another with force and violence,and with intent to rob and steal,shall be guilty of a felony,punishable by imprisonment in the state prison not more than years.comp.laws.the michigan court of appeals reasoned that,although is classified under michigan law as assault rather than as attempted robbery,contains elements similar to those of attempted unarmed robbery,and is in fact viewed as a more dangerous crime than attempted unarmed robbery under michigan law.ross,at.noting that robbery is often viewed as an assault offense,the court concluded that the michigan legislature could not have intended to exclude as a predicate for felony murder,when it had included the lesser offense of attempted unarmed robbery.id.
the michigan supreme court on november,vacated the court of appeals opinion,affirming on different grounds.people ross.the supreme court found that ross was not entitled to relief because he did not show good cause for failing to raise on appeal or in a prior postconviction motion his argument that is not a predicate for felony murder.id.
on november,ross filed a petition for habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.his habeas petition alleges that his conviction for felony murder denied him due process of law because is not a proper predicate for felony murder.further,the petition alleges,ross is actually innocent,because the crime for which he is incarcerated does not exist.the state of michigan moved for summary judgment on the grounds that ross failed to comply with the aedpa statute of limitations for prisoners appealing state convictions,d.
because ross conviction became final before the aedpa effective date,the statute of limitations on ross habeas claim expired on april,one year after the effective date.griffin rogers,cir.ross march application for state postconviction relief did not toll the limitations period,because he applied after the aedpa limitations period ended.see d.further,ross did not argue that the limitations period should have run from the date of a new factual discovery or the recognition of a new constitutional right creating his claim id.d c d.the district court found that ross was not eligible for equitable tolling under the standard of dunlap united states,cir,which takes into account,inter alia,whether the petitioner lacked notice of the filing requirement,and whether late filing does not prejudice the respondent.the court also found that,assuming that proof of actual innocence may form a second situation authorizing equitable tolling,ross had not made this showing.the court,citing schlup delo,d,found that ross had provided no new reliable evidence proving actual innocence.further,the court assumed that if an actual innocence exception existed,the petitioner must show as he must under dunlap equitable tolling reasonable diligence in pursuing his claim.the court found that ross could not make this showing since he first contended that could not support a conviction in his second postconviction application,ten years after his conviction became final.ross then waited a full year after the conclusion of that matter to petition for habeas corpus.therefore,the court granted the state motion for summary judgment.ross timely appealed.
ross petition is untimely,and the district court properly granted summary judgment.ross does not argue that he has complied with aedpa statute of limitations further,ross does not contend that dunlap tolling applies.therefore,the only issue is whether the district court should have equitably tolled the limitations period because ross was actually innocent.first,this case does not fit within the actual innocence equitable tolling rule recognized in souter jones,cir,because ross does not claim that he did not commit the acts forming the basis for his conviction,and because he has not provided new exculpatory evidence.second,even if one assumes that souter rule extends to claims of innocence of a penalty,ross has not proven he was innocent of the penalty of life imprisonment.a michigan court has held that attempted robbery is a offense within assault with intent to rob,and therefore assault with intent to rob may form a predicate offense for felony murder.people akins.
two distinct categories of actual innocence grew out of habeas corpus cases,permitting a court to reach the merits of defaulted,successive,or abusive habeas claims.ross seeks to invoke a theory of equitable tolling grounded in one category,when,as he concedes in his brief,the facts of his case more closely resemble the second category.where a habeas petitioner fails to show cause and
