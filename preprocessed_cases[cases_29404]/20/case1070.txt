denise ann day,the,appeals a district court order that dismissed her habeas corpus application filed pursuant to.day was convicted in texas state court on three counts of injury to a child in violation of texas penal code a.following an unsuccessful appeal of the convictions and the denial of a state court habeas petition,day filed her federal writ petition,arguing in part that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to examine adequately the prosecution medical evidence prior to trial,failing to adequately the state medical experts,and failing to obtain a defense medical expert to challenge the state medical expert testimony.the district court dismissed the petition.day contends on appeal that the district court ruling with respect to her ineffective assistance claim was erroneous because the district court failed to consider properly this court holding in draughon dretke,cir.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
a.the trial 
on january,day was convicted in texas state court on three counts of injury to a child in violation of texas penal code a.the evidence presented at trial showed that during the relevant,day provided daycare for children,including the victims,nathan taylor and emma russell.tina taylor,nathan mother,testified that nathan was born in january and that she left nathan in day daycare periodically between april,and may.between may and may,taylor observed that nathan was displaying fussy behavior,that nathan could not put weight on his right leg,and eventually,that nathan would scream and cry whenever he was moved.after multiple visits to a pediatrician and a visit to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon,the surgeon determined that nathan leg was fractured and immediately performed surgery to repair the fracture.nathan spent three weeks in a full body cast.nathan mother,father,and each testified that nothing had happened to nathan in their presence that would account for the fracture.
taylor called day to find out what had caused the break.day did not offer an explanation at first but later told taylor that a toddler whom she called big nathan had fallen on nathan leg.at the request of the police,taylor allowed them to record a subsequent phone call she made to day.in the call,day again said that big nathan had fallen on nathan.
kris russell,emma mother,testified that day cared for her two children,fes and emma.emma was born on february,and day began looking after emma in april of.after seeing emma vomit repeatedly during may and june of,russell decided to take emma to a doctor.mosier examined emma,discovered that emma had an enlarged head,concluded emma had gastrointestinitis,and sent emma home.day continued to care for emma,yet emma condition continued to decline,so russell took emma to a hospital emergency room and subsequently to a pediatrician.although emma was tested for meningitis,those who examined emma concluded that emma was merely suffering from a virus.
russell again left emma and fes in day care on monday,june.while at work,russell received a message from day telling her that emma was being fussy and that fes had pushed emma out of a swing and possibly injured emma leg.russell would later notice that emma would not stand on her lap and that emma legs looked a little bit bent.emma parents took emma back to the emergency room,where a doctor discovered emma had two broken femurs.emma was placed in traction to straighten her femurs.over the next week,emma underwent a number of tests,received two bilateral subdural taps to relieve the swelling in her head,and had a subdural shunt surgically implanted in her head to drain fluid.after emma was removed from traction,she was placed in a body cast for two weeks.the shunt was removed eight months later.emma mother and father each testified that neither knew of anything that occurred in their presence that could have caused emma injuries.
on june,at the request of police,russell called day twice.the phone conversations were recorded.in the first conversation,day stated she saw fes push a swing seat,causing emma to fall from the seat onto her own legs.
marie brown testified she was a case manager for the texas department of protective and regulatory services,child protective services division.she investigated day and the allegation that day caused nathan injuries.day gave brown different stories on different occasions,telling her nathan injuries were caused when a child bumped him out of a swing and onto the floor,when big nathan fell on him,or when he was in a walker.
richie rhyans,a investigator for the child care licensing division of the texas department of protective and regulatory services also investigated nathan injuries.she testified that day told her that another child had fallen on nathan leg,causing the injury.while working on nathan case,rhyans learned of emma injuries and began to investigate emma case as well.day told rhyans that russell had warned day that fes would pick on emma.day told rhyans that on some unspecified date,day was preparing to change emma diaper when fes jerked emma out of a swing and caused emma to fall awkwardly on her legs.
detective michael johnson testified that he arranged the taping of the parents phone calls to day and obtained two written statements from day.johnson also tape recorded an interview he had with day,admitted and played for the jury,in which day blamed fes for emma injuries,contending fes pushed emma from a swing.she also blamed big nathan fall for nathan injuries.day also implied russell may have been responsible for emma injuries.
the prosecution presented the testimony of five doctors,each qualified as experts.doctor joel leffler,a pediatric opthamologist,testified that he examined emma on june,and found hemorrhages throughout both of her retinas and that her optic nerves were swollen due to cranial pressure.leffler testified that retinal hemorrhaging was quite common with shaken baby syndrome and that emma hemorrhages were not very old.he also testified that retinal hemorrhaging in infants had several causes,but emma did not display evidence of any cause other than shaken baby syndrome.emma hemorrhages did not clear up until november.
doctor david klamer,a musculoskeletal radiologist who examined of emma legs and pelvis taken on june and,testified that each of emma femurs had an acute spiral fracture.klamer stated that a spiral fracture is caused by a twisting force,and would not be caused by a direct fall.he described an acute fracture as a relatively recent fracture that does not show signs of healing.klamer testified that multiple fractures of the type emma suffered are considered indicative of child abuse.
klamer also examined cat scans of emma skull taken on june.klamer testified that one scan showed a very large subdural hemorrhage that appeared to have been present several weeks to months before the scan was taken.according to klamer,emma hemorrhage was indicative of syndrome.klamer also testified another scan taken on the showed emma had a fracture on the left side of her skull.klamer stated that a considerable amount of force was required to cause the kind of skull fracture emma suffered.klamer said subsequent cat scans showed emma subdural hemorrhage slowly getting smaller.
christine quatro,a pediatric orthopedic surgeon,testified that she took of nathan leg on may,and discovered a short spiral fracture in nathan right femur.quatro testified that the break appeared to be healing,which indicated to quatro that the fracture occurred seven to ten days before the was taken.quatro opined that nathan fracture was caused by someone turning nathan right foot or ankle towards his left foot while holding his body still.she testified that a baby,the age nathan was at the time of his injury,would not be able to cause a femoral spiral fracture on his own,nor could the fracture be caused by bouncing in a walker.
quatro testified that a child has bones that are very plastic,meaning they have some give and,as a result,require considerable force to actually break.she testified that spiral fractures of the femur are rare for children less than a year old because they are not yet walking on their own and do not have sufficient body weight to generate the force needed to cause a spiral fracture.when a child femur breaks,the child will immediately scream and cry,and there may be a snapping or a popping noise.
quatro conceded that a falling onto a child could cause a spiral fracture of the femur,but thought that such an occurrence was unlikely.quatro believed that such an incident would probably cause a transverse fracture,or a clean break,rather than a spiral fracture.quatro also examined taken of nathan on may,one of which showed a fracture in his right leg.however,that fracture was not displaced,and the fracture shown in the may was a displaced fracture.quatro testified that a child falling on an leg could cause the fracture to displace.moving a leg to change a diaper could also cause the displacement.
quatro testified that skull fractures and bilateral are highly indicative of child abuse.at trial,quatro compared nathan and emma and declared the leg fractures were v ery similar.quatro testified that the fractures shown in emma could not have been caused by a child fall from a swing similar to the swing from which day said emma fell.quatro concluded that the children injuries were not caused by accident,but were inflicted intentionally and knowingly.
doctor david owen,a pediatric neurologist,testified that he examined emma on june,and concluded that emma was suffering from,among other things,a subdural hemorrhage,probably due to being shaken,and a skull fracture.owen testified that shaking a child can cause small blood vessels in the brain to break and ooze blood and that children are particularly susceptible to injury from shaking.subdural hemorrhages might cause brain damage,cerebral palsy,mental retardation,seizures,and death.owen stated the skull fracture could have been caused by striking an object instead of shaking.owen also believed emma injuries were weeks old at the time he examined her.the pressure from the subdural hemorrhage caused the plates of emma skull to grow abnormally,so she wore a dc band to correct the shape of her skull.owen testified emma injuries were consistent with shaken baby syndrome,that they were not the result of an accident,and that he had no explanation other than child abuse.owen testified that a toddler would not be able to inflict the injuries emma suffered.
doctor frank mcgehee testified that shaken baby syndrome occurs when a baby body is shaken back and forth,causing a whiplash injury to the head.symptoms of the syndrome include cranial bleeding and hemorrhages in the back of the eye or retina.one of the effects of the syndrome is brain damage.he examined emma medical records and concluded she had been intentionally injured and had been shaken,most likely on june.
mcgehee testified that pressure on a baby brain will cause the baby to vomit.mcgehee also testified that a toddler does not have the strength to shake a baby hard enough to cause the injuries associated with shaken baby syndrome.he further testified that a baby is not capable of causing spiral fractures of its own femurs,and the force required to cause those kinds of fractures is equivalent to being hit by a car going twenty.mcgehee stated that a fall from a swing onto carpet would not have caused emma skull fracture and that nathan spiral fracture could not have happened from anything he did in a walker or by a toddler falling on his leg.
the testimony of the state five medical experts thus tended to show that the victims injuries were caused by intentional conduct and that the injuries occurred during the time frame in which the victims may have been under day care.day counsel declined to leffler and owen.day counsel quatro extensively regarding alternative causes of nathan injuries and elicited testimony that called into question the date of nathan initial injury.day attorneys elicited testimony from kramer that he was presuming abuse until shown evidence to the contrary,but they did not challenge his medical conclusions.similarly,day counsel did not challenge mcgehee medical conclusions but elicited testimony from him that he was only testifying that emma injuries were intentionally inflicted,not that day specifically injured emma.
in defense of day,day husband testified as to day character as a good mom and a competent day care provider.he testified her ultimate concern was the welfare of the children she cared for.day husband never saw day hurt or try to hurt any child under her care.
day also testified,denying that she harmed nathan or emma or knowing how they got hurt.she testified that she noticed something was seriously wrong with emma when russell dropped off emma on june.she discussed emma condition with russell,who assured day that emma had been diagnosed with meningitis.day testified that on that day she was preparing to change emma outfit while emma was in a swing and fes was standing right around the swing area.day turned her back to gather the items she needed to change emma,and when she turned back around,emma was lying on the floor.fes had his hand on the swing and had apparently pulled it back,causing emma fall.emma legs were bent underneath her,but she did not fuss or cry.
b.the state habeas corpus proceeding 
after an unsuccessful direct appeal,day filed a state habeas petition in which she alleged that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the phase by failing to review much of the state medical evidence prior to trial,failing to some of the state medical experts,and failing to secure the assistance of a medical expert for the defense 
in support of her petition,day pointed to comments made by her lead attorney before trial that he had not reviewed all available records.approximately one month prior to trial,the state filed medical records it intended to rely upon in prosecuting day.one week before trial,the district court clerk delivered copies of the medical records to day counsel.on the same day,day lead attorney filed a motion to continue,explaining that he would need more time to review the voluminous records,to investigate the state medical evidence,and to secure a medical expert.day counsel did not explain why he did not take the opportunity to review the records in the clerk office before the clerk delivered copies of the records to him.the state attorney responded that she had made the records available in her office for the preceding six months but that day counsel never sought the records directly from her.the trial court denied the continuance.on the first day of trial,day counsel stated that he still had not reviewed many of the medical records received from the state the previous week.
the district court that initially reviewed day petition ordered day trial counsel to file affidavits addressing whether,and to what extent,they reviewed and prepared for the state medical evidence.day lead trial attorney passed away shortly after day trial and before the state habeas proceedings.representing day at trial submitted an affidavit in which he testified that day trial counsel read the medical records prior to trial but sought the continuance to try to slow the train down.he did not explain why they failed to secure a medical expert to assist in day defense.
day submitted to the state habeas court the affidavit of john galaznik.galaznik,a certified pediatrician,testified in the affidavit that he reviewed the state testifying medical experts testimony and the and ct scan reports but did not review the actual studies or photographs of the patients.galaznik concluded that clear evidence existed within the medical record that emma head injury and central nervous system cns pathology occurred before emma was placed in day care owen,who testified that emma cns pathology was weeks old when he diagnosed it,was aware of evidence that the pathology was present more than seven weeks before it was diagnosed mcgehee,who testified that emma was fine until june,when she suffered injuries that exhibited shaken baby syndrome,failed to take note of evidence that proved that emma cns symptoms were well established by may,emma head injury was caused either by her parents abuse or perinatal trauma many contradictions existed within the state evidence that cast doubt as to the validity of the state shaken baby hypothesis and mcgehee theory regarding the cause of emma head injury and clear medical disagreement existed that would cast doubt upon the state theory that nathan and emma femoral fractures were not caused by accidental forces.
the state district court made findings of fact and conclusions of law,including the facts stated in trial counsel affidavit were true trial counsel reviewed the medical records and were prepared for the state medical evidence at trial the failure to contest the majority of the medical conclusions of the state experts was the result of reasonable trial strategy by day counsel it was reasonable not to call a defense expert to contest the state medical evidence in light of the defense strategy that identity of the perpetrator was the primary issue and the jurors would likely find the state doctor testimony credible trial counsel provided representation within the standards of reasonableness established by professional norms and the result of the proceeding would not have differed even if trial counsel adopted a different strategy of the state medical experts.the texas court of criminal appeals adopted the findings and conclusions and denied relief without opinion.
c.the federal district court habeas corpus proceeding 
day subsequently filed a federal writ petition asserting the same grounds for relief as sought in her state application and again submitting galaznik affidavit.the federal district court referred day petition to a magistrate judge for findings of fact,conclusions of law,and recommendations for the disposition of the case.the magistrate judge recommended that the ineffective assistance claim be dismissed because 
day contention that an expert would have provided favorable testimony was speculative and insufficient to demonstrate that there was a reasonable probability that the result would have been different if an expert had been hired to testify at trial.furthermore,galaznik did not state that he was available and willing to testify at day trial.see id.citing alexander mccotter,cir.as a result,day has not shown she suffered prejudice because counsel did not call a medical expert to testify.additionally,day has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different,but for counsel unprofessional error in not reading all of the medical records and in failing to cross examine the state experts.she has not show n that counsel performance was deficient or that she was prejudiced.
day objected to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,contending that her case was materially indistinguishable from the facts presented in draughon dretke,cir,a capital habeas appeal in which a panel of this court affirmed a district court determination that a state court unreasonably applied strickland washington,d,to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court declined to consider draughon,stating merely that the standards for death penalty cases are not applicable to this penalty case.the district court then adopted the magistrate judge recommendations and dismissed the petition.
in a federal habeas corpus appeal,the district court findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and the district court conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.gomez quarterman,cir,cert.denied,d.when a federal habeas petitioner claim has been adjudicated on the merits in a state court proceeding,a federal court may only grant habeas relief if the state court adjudication of the claim either resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable interpretation of the facts in light of evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d gomez,at.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court precedent or if it confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a supreme court decision and arrives at a different result.williams taylor,d.a state court unreasonably applies clearly established federal law if it identifies the correct governing principle but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the case.brown payton,d.the question is not whether a federal court believes the state court determination was incorrect but whether that determination was substantially higher threshold.schriro landrigan,d.further,the federal habeas court must defer to the state court factual findings unless the petitioner rebuts those findings with clear and convincing evidence.e.
because day presents claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,the district court task was to analyze the state court habeas decision in light of strickland washington,d.strickland established a test for deciding ineffective assistance claims,under which the petitioner must show that trial counsel performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant.id.at.counsel performance is deficient where it falls short of reasonable performance under prevailing professional norms.id.at.the standard requires the reviewing court to give great deference to counsel performance,strongly presuming counsel exercised reasonable professional judgment.id.at.in order to prove prejudice,t he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.the petitioner must affirmatively prove,not just allege,prejudice.id.at.if the petitioner fails to prove the prejudice component,the court need not address the question of counsel performance.id.at.
day issue on appeal is whether the district court erred when it declined to apply draughon dretke to her case,concluding that draughonapplies only to death penalty cases the district court determination that draughon precedential value is limited to capital habeas cases is a conclusion of law,reviewed de novo by this court.gomez,at.
draughon was a capital habeas appeal in which a panel of this court affirmed a district court determination that a state court unreasonably applied strickland to draughon ineffective assistance of counsel claim.draughon was convicted for murder as a result of a shooting that occurred during an attempted robbery.the evidence at trial showed that draughon fired a number of bullets as he attempted to escape a crowd that had gathered in the parking lot of a restaurant while he was attempting to rob the establishment.one of the bullets struck and killed one of the gatherers.draughon contended at trial that he was merely attempting to fire shots into the air to scare away his pursuers and that he did not intend to kill anyone.to controvert draughon theory,the state presented a ballistics expert who testified that nothing on the bullet recovered from the victim showed that it hit an object and ricocheted before striking the victim.thus,the state the jury apparently draughon intended to fire directly at the victim.draughon counsel did not present ballistics evidence during trial or obtain a ballistics expert to assist in the defense.
during the subsequent federal habeas proceeding,draughon presented a ballistics expert who analyzed the bullet and concluded that the bullet displayed characteristics that would suggest it had hit an object and ricocheted before striking the victim.the federal district court this court draughon trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to obtain expert forensic examination of the path of the fatal bullet fired from petitioner gun.trial counsel failure to investigate the forensics of the fatal bullet deprived draughon of a substantial argument,and set up an unchallenged factual predicate for the state main argument that draughon intended to kill.draughon,at.
this court did not explicitly limit draughon applicability to capital cases,and we can see no other grounds for so limiting draughon.day see
