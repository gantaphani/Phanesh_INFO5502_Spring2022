this case returns to us for a third time.most recently,we affirmed the judgment of the district court.french jones,cir.thereafter,the united states supreme court granted respondent petition for writ of certiorari,vacated our prior judgment,and remanded the case to our court for further consideration in light of its decision in bell cone,d.jones french,d.pursuant to the supreme court order,the case is again before us for our determination.
with this appeal we examine whether the district court wrongly granted a writ of habeas corpus after a michigan court gave a supplemental instruction to a deadlocked jury.the michigan trial court gave the supplemental instruction,which did not conform with the approved michigan instruction,when the defendant attorney was not present.
at the first appeal to this court,we vacated the district court order granting habeas relief and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing.at that hearing,the district court was directed to review the role of ty jones,an alleged attorney from california.ty jones was present at the time the supplemental instruction was given but it was unclear whether he was licensed to practice law.french jones,wl,at cir.july.
at the ensuing evidentiary hearing,the district court learned jones was not an attorney and was present only to observe cornelius pitts,one of french attorneys.after finding that ty jones was not an attorney,the district court held that french was denied representation during a critical stage of his trial and granted his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.french jones,d.
in our previous decision,we concluded that a defendant whose lawyer was not present when the trial judge gave a supplemental instruction to a deadlocked jury is entitled to habeas relief.after carefully reviewing the cone decision,we see no reason to depart from our previous holding.therefore,finding petitioner french was denied counsel during a critical stage of his trial,we affirm the district court grant of a writ of habeas corpus.
on september,french shot four fellow union officials at the ford motor company rouge facility in dearborn,michigan.after trial to a jury french was found guilty but mentally of one count of murder.comp.laws,one count of murder.comp.laws,two counts of assault with intent to commit murder.comp.laws,and one count of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.comp.laws b.the michigan trial court sentenced french to life imprisonment without parole for the murder conviction,fifteen to thirty years imprisonment for each of the murder and assault with intent to murder convictions,and two years consecutive imprisonment for the firearm conviction.at trial,two attorneys,cornelius pitts and monsey wilson,represented french.ty jones was also present at defense counsel table for portions of the trial.
the confusion surrounding this case stems from representations made by pitts and wilson.at the beginning of the trial,pitts introduced jones to the prosecutor and trial judge as an attorney from california who specialized in jury selection.pitts said jones was present to assist with the trial.based on pitts representation,the trial judge allowed jones to remain at the defense table.
during jury selection,pitts again introduced jones as counsel from california who was assisting with the trial.jones was present at the defense table every day of trial but never spoke in the presence of the jury.
at the evidentiary hearing held in this matter,the district court learned jones was not a licensed attorney.while he had attended one year of law school at new york university,jones worked as a motion picture consultant and screenwriter in los angeles.jones observed the trial as background for the development of a television series based on the detroit legal system.
at the evidentiary hearing,pitts testified that jones told him that he was a lawyer.although pitts did not intend for jones to participate in the trial,pitts said he introduced jones as counsel from california to give the impression of a large defense team.
french trial took more than two weeks before being submitted to the jury.after receiving instructions and choosing a foreperson,the jury recessed thursday,april.the jury reconvened and began deliberating the morning of friday,april.during that day,the jury twice requested copies of trial materials.on both occasions,the prosecutor,wilson,and the trial judge discussed the notes and sent the requested materials to the jury.
late on friday afternoon,the jury sent out a third note to which the trial judge did not immediately respond.instead,the trial judge recessed the trial and excused the jury for the weekend.
on the morning of monday,may,the trial judge read the note to pitts and the prosecutor we ca reach a unanimous decision.our minds are set.pitts requested a mistrial,but the trial judge read the jury michigan standard deadlocked jury instruction.the jury continued to deliberate until late afternoon,when they sent out a second note.the second note also said the jury was unable to reach a decision.the trial judge again recessed the trial and excused the jury for the day.
at on may,the trial judge again instructed the jury and directed them to continue deliberations.after continuing deliberations,the jury sent out a third note at we are not able to reach a verdict.we are not going to reach a verdict.the trial judge responded by sending the jury to lunch and instructing the parties to appear at 
at,neither pitts nor wilson had returned to the courtroom.the trial judge asked jones,who was present,to contact the two attorneys.jones was unable to contact pitts or wilson.at,without pitts or wilson present,the trial judge brought the jury in and gave them a supplemental jury instruction.unlike the first two instructions,the third instruction was not the standard deadlocked jury instruction the trial judge dismissed the jury for the day approximately one hour after giving the supplemental instruction.
the next morning,pitts requested a mistrial because he felt the trial judge supplemental instruction was coercive.while pitts was arguing for a mistrial,the jury returned its verdict.
french moved the michigan trial court to order a new trial,arguing he was prejudiced because his attorneys had not been present during the third supplemental jury instruction.the trial judge noted french argument had some merit,but denied the motion for a new trial.
on july,the michigan court of appeals affirmed the petitioner convictions.the court held that the absence of defense counsel during a critical stage of the trial was subject to harmless error analysis.the court of appeals found the error harmless in french case.on september,the michigan supreme court denied the petitioner leave to appeal.
on october,the petitioner filed a petition in federal court for a writ of habeas corpus.on march,the district court granted the writ.as discussed above,the warden appealed,and we vacated the district court decision and remanded for an evidentiary hearing.
after the evidentiary hearing and with a fully developed record before us,we reviewed the district court decision to grant french petition for a writ of habeas corpus.as grounds for the writ,french argued that the michigan court denied his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel when it supplemented its instruction to the jury when no attorney for french was present.we affirmed the judgment of the district court and held that french was denied counsel during a critical stage of his trial.the respondent petitioned the united states supreme court for a writ of certiorari.the supreme court granted the petition and remanded the case to our court for reconsideration in light of bell cone,d.
despite the supreme court order vacating and remanding the case for our redetermination,our standard of review remains unchanged.we review a district court grant of habeas relief de novo.see,harpster ohio,cir.
