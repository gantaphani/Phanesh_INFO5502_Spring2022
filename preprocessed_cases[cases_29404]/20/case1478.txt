in january of,cedric ivory was charged with the murder of his girlfriend,alanna napier.following a bench trial before a michigan state court later that year,ivory was convicted of murder and a related firearm offense.he was sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment on the two charges.ivory then petitioned for state postconviction relief,but was turned down at all levels of the state judiciary.he subsequently filed a motion for federal habeas corpus relief,with his principal argument being that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance due to counsel addiction to drugs and alcohol.the district court determined that ivory claim was procedurally defaulted and,in any event,without merit.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual.ivory conviction 
the district court summarized the facts of ivory case as follows 
petitioner convictions stem from the shooting death of his girlfriend,alanna napier,on ilene street in detroit,michigan on july.at trial,dwayne glen testified that he was at his home on ilene street at on july,when he heard a female voice say,you want to fight,you want to fight.he looked outside and saw napier walking on the sidewalk toward his home conversing with petitioner who was following her in a burgundy buick lasabre.as they neared glen home,petitioner got out of the car,took a few steps,and fired five to seven shots at napier who fell to the ground.petitioner was to feet from napier when he fired the gun.glen did not see napier approach petitioner or make threatening gestures toward him.he could not recall whether napier had anything in her hands,but said she might have had a purse.after the shooting,glen called and went outside.two other neighbors,janet edwards and william carr,also came outside.glen also testified that he recognized petitioner and napier from his place of employment,where they worked different shifts.
william carr testified that he was at home on ilene street when he heard shooting outside his home.he looked outside and saw a woman lying on the ground.he went outside to help her and asked if she knew who shot her.she responded that it was cedric bernard ivory.carr also testified that the shooting caused damage to his home.the police investigated bullet holes in his windows,a bullet on his floor,and a bullet lodged in his wall.
detroit police officer john harvin testified that he investigated the shooting scene.when he arrived,he observed the victim lying on the ground.an theft club which was about feet away from the victim and a woman purse were taken into evidence.
the medical examiner report indicated that alanna napier was years old,was five feet five inches tall,and weighed pounds at the time of her death.she died from two gunshot to the face and one to the upper left buttock,which caused severe internal injuries.there was not evidence of close range firing.the manner of death was homicide.
the parties stipulated that petitioner mother,pearl ivory,would testify that petitioner borrowed her burgundy buick on the day of the shooting around noon and that he did not return home at as expected.when she was outside her ilene street home around,she heard five or six gunshots from down the street.the police came to her home minutes later and said they were looking for petitioner in connection with the shooting.she knew napier as her son friend or girlfriend.petitioner never returned home.the next day,she received a call from an unidentified male telling her where her car could be located.
petitioner did not testify at trial,but his statement to police was read into the record.in that statement,petitioner acknowledged shooting napier,but claimed that he was provoked that he acted in.specifically,petitioner stated that napier had been his girlfriend for about one year before the shooting.on that day,he was driving in a burgundy buick lasabre with napier,drinking and smoking marijuana,when they got into an argument and started hitting each other.napier pulled out a gun and he took it from her.he then pulled the car over and put the gun in the trunk.he returned to the car.they began to argue again and she hit him with an club.petitioner pulled the car over and told napier that he loved her.she responded that she did not love him and had given him aids.petitioner then lost it and jumped out of the car.he did not know how many times he fired the gun at napier or if she said anything before he shot her.petitioner stated that he left the gun at the scene and fled in his car.later that day,he learned that napier had died.he left town two days later because he was confused and wanted to get money for a lawyer.he testified negative for aids in august or september.
at the close of trial,the court found petitioner guilty of murder and felony firearm.in reaching this conclusion,the trial court relied upon the eyewitness testimony and rejected petitioner assertions of provocation and.
the trial court subsequently conducted a sentencing hearing.at that hearing,petitioner raised no material objections to the report.the victim mother napier,brother jones,and grandmother pierson gave victim impact statements.petitioner also made a statement.the trial court then sentenced petitioner within the sentencing guidelines to a term of to years imprisonment on the murder conviction and a consecutive term of five years imprisonment on the firearm conviction.
ivory jackson,wl.april.
the bench trial lasted just three hours,and the state presented only three witnesses carr,glen,and officer harvin.joshua gordon,ivory attorney,two of the state witnesses,stipulated to the entry of several items of evidence including ivory statement to the police,moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the state case,and gave a closing argument.
in support of his present appeal,ivory sets forth various facts concerning gordon preparation for trial and trial performance,as well as his counsel personal history.the state record reflects that,on gordon advice,ivory agreed to waive his right to a jury on the morning set for trial.gordon also waived the opportunity to present an opening statement and called no witnesses on ivory behalf.furthermore,ivory complains that gordon asked the state witnesses only a few questions.the transcript reveals that gordon questioned both carr and glen,but neither covers more than a few transcript pages.according to ivory,gordon seemed to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol during the trial.
ivory also submitted an affidavit setting forth what he alleged to be gordon inadequate trial preparation.in his affidavit,ivory asserted that gordon met with him only twice in the months before trial,and that gordon ignored ivory requests for updates,documents,and strategy discussions.according to ivory,when gordon did meet with him,gordon appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol,was dressed improperly,and asked ivory for something sweet to eat or for candy,which ivory alleges are slang terms for drugs.ivory also alleged that gordon told me that he was not going to call me to testify,but did not discuss this with me.similarly,ivory claimed that gordon told me that i was going to waive my right to a jury.i did as he told me,but i wish i had.
gordon disciplinary proceedings 
unhappy with gordon allegedly ineffective assistance at trial,ivory filed a grievance against gordon with the michigan attorney grievance commission in september of.commission records,as it turns out,confirm that four other of gordon former clients had also filed grievances against him in the same time period.counsel for gordon conceded during the grievance proceedings that,due to heavy substance abuse,gordon simply gave up and stopped responding not only to the grievance commission,but also,pretty much,all the duties in his life.furthermore,counsel commented that,during the relevant time period,gordon gave up his office and he had difficult personal living circumstances and became a bit of a vagabond for a while.
gordon addiction problems became sufficiently obvious to the michigan third circuit trial judges before whom he practiced that of them arranged an intervention for him in february of.the judges at that time demanded that gordon immediately enter an treatment program or face revocation of his third circuit certification.ultimately,gordon pled no contest to the disciplinary charges brought against him in connection with the grievances and received a suspension of his law license that began in march of.
procedural background 
ivory,represented by newly appointed counsel frederick finn,timely appealed his conviction.finn filed an appellate brief on behalf of ivory in may of,but the only issue raised was a claim that insufficient evidence supported ivory conviction.thus,finn did not raise the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel,nor did he request an evidentiary hearing despite the grievance that ivory himself had filed against gordon eight months earlier.the michigan court of appeals affirmed ivory conviction.people ivory,wl.his application for leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court was also denied.
ivory then initiated state postconviction proceedings by filing a pro se motion for relief from judgment.in november of,the trial court denied ivory postconviction petition for relief on all grounds.both the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court summarily denied ivory postconviction appeals in orders,citing.rule d barring the court from granting relief under various circumstances,including procedural default.
having exhausted his state court remedies,ivory filed a timely pro se petition for federal habeas corpus relief with the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan in april of.his petition sought an evidentiary hearing and set forth the following five grounds for relief that insufficient evidence supported his conviction,that the trial court erred when it found that ivory had insufficient legal justification for the homicide,that ivory presentence report contained incorrect information,that irregularities occurred in connection with one of the statements presented,and that ivory received the ineffective assistance of counsel both at trial and on direct appeal.
the district court denied ivory first two claims on the merits,and ruled that his final three claims were procedurally defaulted because ivory had failed to raise them on direct appeal.ivory,wl,at.despite finding the final three claims procedurally barred,the court went on to determine that,even if it were to address the claims,it would deny each of them on the merits.id.at.the court also denied ivory request for a certificate of appealability coa.ivory then appealed both the denial of his habeas petition and the denial of his motion for reconsideration of his claim.this court granted ivory a blanket coa as to all of his claims,but he has limited his appeal to the issues of whether his trial and appellate counsel were constitutionally ineffective.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in a habeas corpus appeal,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo,but will not set aside its factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.dyer bowlen,cir.the standard for reviewing determinations on habeas,by contrast,is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,codified at d.under the aedpa standard,a federal court 
may not grant a writ of habeas to a petitioner in state custody with respect to any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court or the state court decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings.

a decision is considered contrary to clearly established federal law if it is diametrically different,opposite in character or nature,or mutually opposed.williams taylor,d quotation marks omitted.alternatively,to be deemed an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,a decision on the merits must be objectively unreasonable,not simply erroneous or incorrect.id.at.the state court findings of fact are presumed to be correct unless they are rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.benge johnson,cir.
ivory claim is procedurally defaulted 
as noted above,the district court determined that ivory claim regarding the alleged ineffective assistance of his trial counsel was procedurally defaulted.this court has adopted a test to determine whether a claim has been procedurally defaulted 
the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule with which the petitioner failed to comply the court must determine whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction the state procedural rule must have been an adequate and independent state procedural ground upon which the state could rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim and if the court has determined that a state procedural rule was not complied with and that the rule was an adequate and independent state ground,then the petitioner must demonstrate that there was cause for his failure to follow the rule and that actual prejudice resulted from the alleged constitutional error.
monzo edwards,cir.
whether a state court has actually enforced a procedural sanction depends on whether the last state court from which the petitioner sought review invoked the stated procedural rule as a basis for its decision to reject reviewing the petitioner federal claims.abela martin,cir citing coleman thompson,d.in ylst nunnemaker,d,the supreme court held that,where the last state court decision is silent or unexplained as to its reasons for not granting relief,the federal court may look through that judgment and assume that it relied on the last reasoned judgment issued in the course of the petitioner state appeals.that prior judgment rationale is then taken as the state court basis for denying relief.id.
the last state court to review ivory postconviction claims was the michigan supreme court.in january of,the court issued an order stating,in its entirety on order of the court,the application for leave to appeal the august,order of the court of appeals is considered and it is denied,because the defendant has failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr d.this court has previously held that.d is an independent and adequate ground to bar review of a petitioner federal claims.see,mcfarland yukins,cir.part d of rule,captioned entitlement to relief,first describes the substantive burden a petitioner must meet to qualify for postconviction relief.the rule also contains three subparts that set forth specific procedural requirements.subpart d in particular prohibits courts from granting relief,absent a showing of cause and prejudice,on the basis of claims that a petitioner could have brought on direct review but in fact did not.
ivory contends that because the michigan supreme court denied review based on.rule d than on subpart d in court can not adequately determine whether the michigan supreme court actually applied an independent and adequate procedural sanction.consequently,ivory argues,this court should not attempt to guess what the michigan supreme court might have meant,but should instead determine that ivory claims are not procedurally barred.
ivory argument relies heavily on this court ruling in abela martin,at.in that case,the michigan supreme court issued an order substantially similar to the order it handed down in ivory case.the court in abela first noted that prior sixth circuit decisions have held that a denial of relief based on.d provides an adequate and independent state procedural sanction sufficient to preclude habeas review.id.at citing simpson jones,cir,and burroughs makowski,cir.
nevertheless,the abela court distinguished simpson and makowski on the ground that,in those cases,the last reasoned state court opinion that referenced anything other than.d had without question denied relief on procedural grounds.id.at.the last reasoned opinion issued in abela,in contrast,explicitly denied relief on the merits,stating that the petitioner motion was denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented.for this reason,the court in abela concluded,the michigan supreme court general reference to.d should be interpreted as relying on the portion of the rule,which identifies the petitioner general burden,rather than on the specific procedural bars set forth in the three subparts of the rule.
we conclude that ivory case is much closer to simpson and makowski than to abela.never,at any point in ivory postconviction proceedings,did a michigan court address the merits of his claim.instead,the postconviction trial court specifically addressed ivory four other grounds for relief and concluded that t he foregoing alleged circumstances are without merit.the court then cited.d,explicitly stated that a ll of the legal positions submitted by defendant could have been presented to the appellate court in his initial appeal.it then proceeded to deny ivory motion in its entirety because he could not demonstrate cause and prejudice for the default.significantly,the court never addressed the merits of ivory claim,his fifth ground for relief.both the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court,as noted above,denied ivory postconviction relief in orders that cited.d.
ivory makes much of the fact that the postconviction trial court did not specifically address his claim,and argues that this alleged oversight requires a determination that the claim was not procedurally defaulted.we agree with ivory factual statement,but disagree with his proposed remedy.regardless of what the state postconviction trial court did or did not do,ivory concedes that he failed to raise his claim on direct appeal.the michigan appellate courts that ivory failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr d therefore constitute orders based on an independent and adequate state procedural rule.simpson,at concluding that.d is an independent and adequate procedural bar.we thus turn,in part below,to the question of whether ivory has demonstrated cause and prejudice that would excuse his procedural default.
ivory can not demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the default 
in order to excuse the procedural default identified in part.above,ivory must demonstrate good cause for the default and must show that actual prejudice resulted from the alleged constitutional error.monzo edwards,cir.ivory asserts two different grounds that he claims establish cause for the default recently discovered evidence corroborating his claim,and the ineffective assistance of his appellate counsel in failing to raise on direct appeal the issue of his trial counsel ineffective assistance.we will address both of these grounds in turn.
recently discovered evidence 
ivory asserts that the ruling of the michigan state bar suspending gordon license and the admissions by gordon counsel at those disciplinary proceedings entitle ivory to at least an evidentiary hearing on the question of gordon effectiveness.but ivory himself argued,in a grievance filed just one month after his criminal trial,that gordon assistance at trial was ineffective for multiple reasons and that gordon should be tested for drugs.his september grievance thus demonstrates that ivory was aware of both gordon allegedly ineffective assistance and his counsel drug use well in advance of filing a direct appeal.as ivory acknowledges,the newly discovered evidence he cites simply serves to corroborate his claim.the new evidence can not,therefore,excuse ivory failure to raise the claim on direct appeal because he was obviously on notice of both gordon alleged ineffectiveness and the possible reasons for it prior to filing his direct appeal.
ineffective assistance of appellate counsel 
whether the allegedly ineffective assistance of ivory appellate counsel excuses ivory failure to raise the issue of his trial counsel ineffectiveness on direct appeal presents a more complex question.as this court has held,ineffectiveness of appellate counsel can suffice to show sufficient cause and prejudice for failure to raise an claim.howard bouchard,cir.counsel failure to raise an issue on appeal,however,constitutes ineffective assistance only if there is a reasonable probability that inclusion of the issue would have changed the result of the appeal.id.whether raising the issue might have changed the result of the appeal,in turn,goes to the merits of the claim itself.thus,in order to determine whether the procedural default of ivory claim may be excused by the ineffective assistance of his appellate counsel,we must examine the merits of his claim.
the familiar strickland test governing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has two prongs.first,the defendant must demonstrate that counsel performance fell below the objective standard of reasonableness.strickland washington,d.the defendant must then demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine the confidence in the outcome.id.at.we are also mindful,however,of the supreme court explanation that 
a court need not determine whether counsel performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies.the object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel performance.if it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice,which we expect will often be so,that course should be followed.
taking strickland to heart,we find no need to delve into ivory allegations regarding his counsel performance.even if we assume for the sake of argument that gordon performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,the critical issue regarding ivory claim is whether he can demonstrate a reasonable probability that,but for gordon alleged unprofessional conduct,the result of the proceedings would have been different.rather than attempting to meet this test in the first instance,ivory argues that gordon representation was so deficient as to give rise to per se prejudice under united states cronic,d suggesting that there are circumstances when a presumption of prejudice is appropriate,but requiring the defendant in the case before it to demonstrate that his trial counsel had made specific errors.as this court has explained,three types of cases can lead to a presumption of prejudice under cronic 
the first is the complete denial of counsel,in which the accused is denied the presence of counsel at a critical stage.the second is when counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing.the third is when counsel is placed in circumstances in which competent counsel very likely could not render assistance.
mitchell mason,cir citations and quotation marks omitted.ivory argument focuses on the second type of case,asserting that gordon failed to subject the government case to meaningful adversary testing.such a constructive denial of counsel is limited to situations involving constitutional error of the first magnitude,which can not be cured even if no prejudice is shown.moss hofbauer,cir.
ivory relies in part on this court decision in mitchell to support his claim that gordon representation was per se prejudicial.but the court in mitchell presumed that counsel performance was prejudicial because the defendant was denied the presence of counsel during the critical stage.at emphasis added.the court relied heavily on the fact that counsel had met with mitchell only once prior to trial for six minutes,and thus effectively made no effort to consult with the client.id.at.
in so holding,mitchell distinguished the earlier case of dick scroggy,cir,which held that defense counsel meeting with the defendant for approximately to minutes prior to trial precluded a finding of per se prejudice.in the present case,ivory does not assert that gordon failed to meet with him.he instead claims that gordon met with him only twice,failed to provide documents that ivory requested,and was likely under the influence of drugs.but ivory concedes that,during these meetings,g
