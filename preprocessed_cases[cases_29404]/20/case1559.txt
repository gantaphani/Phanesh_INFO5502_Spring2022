these consolidated appeals concern the grant of habeas relief to wynn satterlee,a michigan state prisoner who was convicted by jury and sentenced after his trial counsel failed to inform him of a favorable plea offer.the district court initially granted a conditional writ,ordering the state to reinstate the plea offer that satterlee never received.when the state failed to comply,the district court granted an unconditional writ,ordering satterlee immediate release and the expungement of his record of conviction.
in,the state challenges the judgment granting the conditional writ,arguing that satterlee failed to exhaust remedies and that the district court made a clearly erroneous factual finding.because the state arguments are without merit,we affirm.
in,the state challenges the judgment granting the unconditional writ,arguing that the remedies of immediate release and expungement exceeded the district court power.because the state arguments are once again without merit,we affirm,albeit with instructions to clarify an ambiguity in the unconditional writ,which is discussed below.we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

satterlee moved for relief from judgment pursuant to michigan court rule,arguing,inter alia,that he was denied his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel under strickland washington,d,and hill lockhart,d,when his trial attorney,david dodge,failed to relay to satterlee a favorable plea offer that he would have accepted.the state trial court denied relief,and both the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal.joint appendix at circuit court decision at court of appeals decision people satterlee,table decision.
satterlee filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing,where dodge,john cipriani the state prosecutor in satterlee case,satterlee,and margaret satterlee satterlee mother testified.satterlee wolfenbarger satterlee i,d,ordering an evidentiary hearing at evid.hr g tr.the district court made two findings of fact the prosecutor made a plea offer on the day of trial to allow petitioner to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of six to twenty years and the plea offer of six to twenty years was never communicated to petitioner by his attorney david dodge.satterlee i,d at.these factual findings were based largely on the determination that satterlee,his mother,and cipriani were more credible than dodge.id.
the district court concluded that there is a reasonable probability that petitioner would have accepted the plea offer that was made in this case.relying on our decision in griffin united states,cir,which had in turn relied on strickland and hill,the district court granted a conditional writ based on satterlee iac claim.id.at.the district court gave the state sixty days to reinstate the plea offer.id.at.the state appeals this order in,arguing that satterlee failed to exhaust remedies and that the district court made a clearly erroneous factual finding.

presentment 
the state first argues that satterlee did not satisfy the exhaustion requirement.a writ of habeas corpus may not be granted unless the petitioner has exhausted available remedies.b.in order to satisfy the exhaustion requirement,a petitioner claim must be fairly presented to the state courts before seeking relief in the federal courts.whiting burt,cir citing baldwin reese,d picard connor,d.it is sufficient if the substance of a federal habeas corpus claim be presented to the state courts,and there are instances in which the ultimate question for disposition will be the same despite variations in the legal theory or factual allegations urged in its support.id.at quoting picard,at.whether a habeas petitioner has satisfied the exhaustion requirement is a question of law that we review de novo,morris dretke,cir stevens delaware corr,cir greene lambert,cir fortini murphy,cir,cert.denied,d.
the state concedes that satterlee legal he was denied his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel under strickland and hill when his trial attorney failed to relay a favorable plea fairly presented to the state courts.appellant br.at.its exhaustion argument is instead premised on the contention that satterlee did not fairly present to the state courts the factual allegations underlying his legal theory.according to the state,although the district court granted the writ based on dodge failure to relay a offer made the morning of trial morning offer,before the state courts satterlee relied on dodge failure to relay a different that dodge allegedly sent via letter to satterlee a week before trial letter offer.thus,the state argues,satterlee did not fairly present his iac claim to the state courts.
the state argument is without merit,as it is wrong on the facts.although his iac argument in the state postconviction proceedings focused on the letter offer,satterlee also notified the state courts of the morning offer 
there will be some factual disputes to be resolved at a hearing.the letter of david dodge of november,which defendant received only after being convicted and sentenced,refers to a plea offer of to years.yet,present counsel spoke by telephone with prosecutor john cipriani,and cipriani states that there was never a plea offer of to years,but that there was a plea offer of to years.see affidavit of james lawrence.something peculiar is going on here,where attorney dodge after sentence comes up with letters never before seen by defendant,allegedly advising him of an offer,yet the prosecutor says that offer was never made.at this point,defendant and his counsel are unsure of who to believe,prosecutor cipriani or attorney dodge,who directly contradict each other.an evidentiary hearing is clearly needed.
at br.in supp.of mot.for relief from at emphases added,br.in supp.of application for leave to appeal at emphases added.therefore,satterlee informed the state courts of dodge failure to relay both plea offers,and the relief eventually granted by the district court was based on one of them.accordingly,satterlee fairly presented both the legal and factual bases of his iac claim to the state courts 
the state next objects to a factual finding made by the district court.we review for clear error a factual finding made pursuant to a habeas court evidentiary hearing.carter mitchell,cir sawyer,at.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.norris schotten,cir.quoting anderson city of bessemer city,d,cert.denied,d.if there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.caver straub,cir quoting united states kellams,cir.we afford the district court particular deference when its factual findings are based on credibility determinations.moss united states,cir,cert.den
