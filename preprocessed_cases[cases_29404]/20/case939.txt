in this proceeding under,john mooney presented evidence that on august,in huntington,west virginia,he seized a firearm from his in,when his,who was intoxicated,pointed it at his head.he then walked several blocks to his place of employment to hand the weapon over to the police.because mooney was a convicted felon,however,he was charged with the unlawful possession of a firearm,in violation of g and a.
despite mooney belief that his possession of the firearm was justified in the circumstances and that he did the right thing in returning it to the police,his counsel advised him that justification provided no defense to a violation of g.his counsel stated,all the prosecutor has to prove was that mooney was a felon with a firearm.relying on counsel advice,mooney reluctantly pleaded guilty,and the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment.on direct appeal,we affirmed with an unpublished opinion.
mooney filed a timely motion,claiming that his guilty plea was involuntary in that his counsel rendered him ineffective assistance by not investigating the justification defense and by advising him to plead guilty because there was no such defense to g.mooney also claimed that pursuant to the district court inquiry,his counsel inaccurately represented to the court during his rule plea colloquy that if this case went to trial,there would be no meritorious legal defense to this charge.in his motion,mooney alleged that a quick search would have revealed that the fourth circuit,as well as most of the other circuits,has explicitly recognized the justification defense in reference to title g,citing united states perrin,cir,and united states crittendon,cir.
the district court denied mooney motion noting,
w hile petitioner may have been able to successfully show that he was under a present threat of death or serious bodily injury at the time he took the gun from his possession,he is unable to show a causal connection between that threat and his continued possession of the gun.petitioner continued possession of the weapon after leaving the home negates his possible defense.
accordingly,the court found that counsel failure to advise petitioner of the defense of justification can be consider ed sound trial strategy and does not support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.we granted a certificate of appealability.
based on the record made in connection with the motion,we conclude that in connection with mooney guilty plea,mooney counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel,and but for that assistance,mooney would not have pleaded guilty.we also conclude that if mooney were able to present the same facts at trial,the trial court would be required,under the criteria we articulated in perrin and crittendon,to submit a justification defense to the jury and that the jury would likely consider it favorably.accordingly,we reverse the district court order denying mooney motion,vacate the judgment of conviction and sentence entered against mooney on may,and remand the case to permit mooney to withdraw his guilty plea.
in denying mooney motion,the district court relied on the entire record,which included the guilty plea colloquy,sentencing hearing,and the materials presented in the course of the proceeding,all of which show the following.
in the early morning hours of august,at approximately,john mooney returned home from his job at whisman bar,a bar seven blocks away.home for mooney was apparently the house he shared with his,florencia sandy mccloud after fixing himself dinner,he retired to the master bedroom,sat on the bed,and began to eat his meal.at that point,mccloud retrieved a caliber revolver from a lockbox under her side of the bed and placed the end of its barrel against the side of mooney head,near the temple.mooney knew that mccloud had been drinking that night and that she had a propensity to brandish and shoot guns at the men in her life.mccloud had pulled a gun on mooney before,had fired a gun at a boyfriend once,and had fired at and actually hit a different with the very same gun whose barrel was touching the side of mooney head.mooney stated he was scared,and he twirled around and grabbed the gun from mccloud grasp.
mooney hurriedly stood up and called his boss terry whisman at whisman bar to say that his had pulled the gun on him again and that he was bringing it in to hand it over to the police.before mooney could leave,however,mccloud angrily demanded the return of the gun and threatened to call the police if mooney did not return it.instead of giving the gun back,mooney himself called,but mccloud disconnected the call.mooney called again,and mccloud again disconnected the call.the transcripts of these two aborted calls,however,recount the verbal fight then ensuing between mooney and mccloud.mccloud repeatedly told mooney that he was going to jail,and mooney responded,i not worried about going to jail.you losing your gun.you never pull it on me again.
unsuccessful in his efforts to call a operator from the house,mooney departed for whisman bar according to his original plan to hand the gun over to the police there.as mooney left the house,mccloud attacked him,ripping off his shirt.immediately after mooney departed,mccloud called and reported that mooney possessed her handgun and was headed for whisman bar.
mooney walked the seven blocks to whisman bar with the handgun in his pocket.when he arrived,the bar was locked,but whisman let him in.as mooney reached for the telephone in order to call,whisman informed him that it was unnecessary to do so because the police were already outside.mooney then walked out of the bar with his hands in the air,and the police took the gun from his pocket and arrested him without incident.
mooney was charged in a indictment for being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g.even though mooney insisted that he was innocent of the charge in the circumstances,he pleaded guilty because his appointed counsel advised him that there was no defense to a charge.
at his sentencing hearing on may,mooney sought to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he did something that was right and was innocent of the charge.but mooney counsel expressed his disagreement with mooney and advised the court that the elements of this offense do not allow for us to make that justification argument in front of the jury.the district court denied mooney request to withdraw his guilty plea,reasoning that once mooney walked out of the house with the gun,he committed a crime for which there was no justification,even though he had a good reason to take the gun from mccloud in the first place.the court denied mooney motion to withdraw his plea and sentenced mooney to months imprisonment.on direct appeal,we affirmed,holding in a brief opinion that the district court had not abused its discretion in refusing to permit mooney to withdraw his plea.see united states mooney.cir.
mooney timely filed a motion under,seeking to vacate his conviction and sentence based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.see hill lockhart,d strickland washington,d.he asserted that he pleaded guilty due to counsel erroneous advice that his charge under g was not subject to a justification defense.if he had known of the possibility of a defense,mooney claimed,he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on proceeding to trial.he also claimed that he likely would have succeeded at trial in persuading the court to submit the justification defense to the jury and in convincing the jury of the defense,based on the criteria for the defense articulated in united states perrin,cir,and united states crittendon,cir.the district court denied mooney motion,holding that counsel failure to research the defense of justification was not unreasonable professional assistance because mooney continued possession of the weapon after leaving the home negate d his possible defense under crittendon.from the district court order dated august,mooney filed this appeal.
the issue presented is whether representation provided to mooney by his counsel when mooney pleaded guilty fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,strickland,at,and whether,but for counsel errors,mooney would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial,hill,at.because the alleged error of counsel is a failure to advise the defendant of a potential affirmative defense to the crime charged,the resolution of the prejudice inquiry will depend largely on whether the affirmative defense likely would have succeeded at trial.id.we resolve this question on the record de novo.see becton barnett,cir.
we address first the question of whether defense counsel performance was reasonable under prevailing professional norms,strickland,at,such that it was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases,hill,at.quoting mcmann richardson,d.
it is uncontested that mooney fully advised his counsel of his version of the facts surrounding his arrest.mooney also told his counsel that he should have a defense to the charge since he was doing the right thing in seizing the gun from his wife in and returning it to the police.as a result of counsel advice that he had no defense,mooney agreed to plead guilty,but only on the condition that the judge agreed with the fact that there was no defense to the charge.
when mooney and his counsel appeared before the district court to plead guilty,mooney tried to explain to the court why he felt his possession of the gun was justified,but,contrary to the arrangement that mooney and his counsel had reached,mooney counsel silenced him,and mooney reluctantly pleaded guilty.the transcript reads 
the court mooney,do you believe you guilty of the charge contained in the indictment 
mooney i did have a gun.
the court all right.do you believe you guilty of this charge if you do believe you guilty,now is the time to say so for sure.
mooney the circumstances surrounding it 
counsel i know what he hung up on,if you give me just a moment.
the court go ahead.
defense counsel and the defendant conferred privately off the record.
the court all right.mooney,do you believe you guilty of this charge 
mooney yes sir.
mooney was not,however,comfortable with his plea,still maintaining that he was innocent.at sentencing,he sought to raise the defense again in a motion to withdraw his guilty plea.he told the court 
i took the gun.i took the gun away from somebody to keep them and me from getting hurt,to turn it in to the huntington police,okay i did what was right.you know,i did do what was wrong.
mooney repeatedly protested that he was innocent,stating,i not guilty of this.his counsel,however,again undermined mooney efforts to present his defense,stating,mooney and i have a slight disagreement on this one.then counsel explained 
he asserts he innocent because,while he had possession of the handgun,he was doing it for the right reason.and i do disagree with that.i think there plenty of evidence that he was doing it for the right reason.he took this gun away from his wife,who he was afraid was going to shoot him or do something bad,and he took it.
i advised him that,in my opinion,legally that may not be legal innocence because i do think that the elements of this offense allow for us to make that argument in front of the jury.
mooney understandably disagrees with that and thinks that he should be allowed to argue to the jury that while,yes,he had possession,that the reasons he had possession should somehow nullify that.
the court denied mooney motion to withdraw his plea.
mooney now contends that his counsel did not meet the required standard of representation when he advised mooney to plead guilty on the erroneous assumption that no justification defense existed.in the language of hill,he argues that counsel fail ed to advise him of a potential affirmative defense to the crime charged.at.but he argues in addition that his counsel denied him the condition on which he agreed to plead have the judge consider the affirmatively advocated against him during sentencing when mooney sought to present the defense through his own explanation.mooney suggests that with only a few minutes of research,his counsel would have discovered not only that courts routinely entertain such a defense,but also that mooney circumstances presented a credible and likely claim for the jury to consider.mooney argument,accordingly,depends on the availability of a justification defense to a violation of g,which provides,in relevant part,that it shall be unlawful for any person,who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,to possess in or affecting commerce,any firearm.
it is well recognized that congress enacts criminal laws against the preexistence of the common law.see united states bailey,d stating that congress enacts criminal laws against the background of common law.and it is equally clear that firmly entrenched in the common law is the justification defense.see,william blackstone,commentaries explaining that the life and limbs of a man are of such high value,in the estimation of the law of england,that it pardons even homicide if committed se defendendo in self defense or in order to preserve them united states gilbert,cir.in bailey,the supreme court held that common law defenses of duress and necessity were generally available in prosecutions under a for escape from federal prison,even though the statutory language provided no such suggestion.at.the proper conclusion from bailey is that congress failure to provide specifically for a common law defense in drafting a criminal statute does not necessarily preclude a defendant charged with violating the statute from relying on such a defense.united states panter,cir.this conclusion is not surprising,however,inasmuch as statutes rarely enumerate the defenses to the crimes they describe,and defenses continue to remain doctrines of the common law,the background against which congress enacts federal crimes.see also dixon united states.at,d assuming that the common law defense of duress would be available to charges under g the same offense at issue here.
to recognize,in particular,the justification defense to the offense is not remarkable.common sense dictates that if a previously convicted felon is attacked by someone with a gun,the felon should not be found guilty for taking the gun away from the attacker in order to save his life.united states singleton,cir.
every circuit to have considered justification as a defense to a prosecution under g has recognized it.see united states leahy,cir united states deleveaux,cir united states gomez,cir united states paolello,cir singleton,at cir united states vigil,cir panter,at cir united states agard,cir.
in this circuit,we have identified the justification defense and have described its elements,but we have never had occasion to apply it because the criteria for its application have never been fulfilled.see,gilbert,at acknowledging that we have recognized the plausibility of a justification defense to a charge perrin,at crittendon,at see also washington united states,d.as we observed in perrin,it has been only on the rarest of occasions that our sister circuits have found defendants to be in the type of imminent danger that would warrant the application of a justification defense.perrin,at.accordingly,we continue to construe the justification defense for possession of a firearm by a felon very narrowly.id.at.
but if the facts were presented at trial that have been established in his proceeding,they would satisfy the demanding criteria set forth in perrin and crittendon,as well as the unanimous views of the other circuits,and mooney would have been entitled to have the justification defense presented to the jury.
in view of this state of the law with respect to the justification defense,it was patently inaccurate for mooney counsel to have advised mooney and to have represented to the court that no such defense was ever available.a justification defense could well have been available if crittendon test were satisfied.counsel erroneous legal advice resulted from a failure to conduct the necessary legal investigation.counsel in criminal cases are charged with the responsibility of conducting appropriate investigations,both factual and legal,to determine if matte
