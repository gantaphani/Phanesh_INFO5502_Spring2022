mousa elias salameh shokeh shokeh appeals the district court denial of his pro se habeas petition,arguing that the district court erred in holding that his release was permissibly conditioned on his posting bond.because we hold that the amount of a bond so imposed must be reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances,and because it is uncertain whether the bond was reasonable given shokeh circumstances,we reverse and remand for further findings on whether the bond is reasonable.
facts and proceedings 
claiming jordanian nationality,shokeh was admitted to the united states at newark,new jersey,on november,as a conditional resident.on december,the ins approved his request for removal of the conditional basis of his permanent resident status,thereby making him a lawful permanent resident.
on may,the ins issued a notice to appear charging shokeh as removable,and on june,the ins took shokeh into custody pursuant to an arrest warrant.at that time,the ins determined that he should be detained without bond.
on july,shokeh appeared before an immigration judge ij for a bond redetermination hearing the ij denied shokeh request for a change in custody status.after several preliminary removal hearings,shokeh appeared before the ij for his merits hearing on september,and the ij ordered him deported to israel or,in the alternative,to palestine.both shokeh and the ins waived their respective rights to appeal this decision of the ij.shokeh therefore became the subject of a final order of removal on september.
the ins unsuccessfully attempted to procure travel documents for shokeh,and,on january,issued a decision to continue detention following file review.on february,shokeh filed a habeas petition arguing that his continued detention beyond six months following the date his removal order became final would violate his constitutional and statutory rights as set forth in zadvydas davis,d 
on february,the ins issued its release on bond notification for shokeh.this notification authorizes shokeh release from custody under an order of supervision,pending removal,upon the posting of a bond.the release concedes that removal does not appear reasonably foreseeable at this time,and does not state that shokeh is a danger to the community shokeh has not posted bond and therefore remains in custody.
shokeh filed a habeas petition challenging the imposition of bond as a condition of his release.the district court,citing denied shokeh petition and dismissed it with prejudice,reasoning that bond is a permissible condition of supervised release.shokeh timely filed a notice of appeal this appeal follows.
ii.jurisdiction 
this court has jurisdiction to review a confined immigrant application for a writ of habeas corpus.ins cyr,d holding that habeas jurisdiction under was not repealed by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,iirira.see also bravo ashcroft,cir noting that federal courts retain habeas jurisdiction to review statutory and constitutional claims zadvydas underdown,cir finding jurisdiction to hear a habeas challenge to a deportable immigrant continued detention,overruled on other grounds by zadvydas davis,d.
as in zadvydas davis,d,where the supreme court held that allows the attorney general to confine a immigrant only for a reasonable period,shokeh challenge s the extent of the attorney general authority under the detention statute t he extent of that authority is not a matter of discretion.zadvydas,at.t he statute contain s an implicit reasonable time limitation,the application of which is subject to review.id.at.
the government argues that this court lacks jurisdiction because iirira section a b ii,a b ii hereinafter section b ii,is a provision ensuring that the proscriptions implemented by congress cover all unenumerated provisions governing discretionary relief.section b ii provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review any other decision or action of the attorney general the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general.a b ii emphases added.
section b ii does not lend itself to the interpretation advocated by the government.nowhere is it specified that the bond determination is a discretionary decision of the attorney general.compare b providing that the attorney general may require the positing of bond in an amount determined by the attorney general to be sufficient to ensure compliance with the conditions of the order,including surrender for removal,but failing to specify that that determination is discretionary,with c noting that the attorney general may,in his or her discretion,grant employment authorization emphasis added.accord spencer,united states,cir holding that the jurisdictional bar in section b ii applies only to acts over which a statute gives the attorney general pure discretion unguided by legal standards or statutory guidelines.simply,it is not specified that the bond determination is discretionary.furthermore,whether to make that determination is not entirely within the authority of the attorney immigrant release is commanded by as interpreted in zadvydas.therefore,the bond determination is not discretionary and this court has jurisdiction to consider it.
situations involv ing application of the law to factual determinations are reviewable,ins,cir situations involving discretionary relief generally are unreviewable.the setting of a bond for a immigrant clearly falls into the former category.in fact,the very regulation cited by the government for its argument on the merits that a condition of bond is permissible,b,authorizes a bond in an amount determined by the attorney general emphasis added.determinations application of law to facts are reviewable explicitly identified discretionary actions are not.see spencer,at,at.
based on the supreme court clear language in zadvydas and cyr,and because the extent of the attorney general authority under the detention statute is not a matter of discretion,zadvydas,at,this court has jurisdiction to hear shokeh claim.
iii.standard of review 
in reviewing denials of habeas corpus relief,this court reviews the district court findings of fact for clear error,but reviews issues of law de novo.barnard collins,cir.
iv.discussion 
zadvydas and the legal framework surrounding immigrants.
after a final order of removal is entered,provides for detention of immigrants pending actual removal.faced with the issue whether aliens that the government finds itself unable to remove are to be condemned to an indefinite term of imprisonment within the united states,the supreme court held in zadvydas davis,d,that once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable,continued detention is no longer authorized by.zadvydas,at.the court explained that has two main purposes ensuring the appearance of aliens at future immigration proceedings and preventing danger to the community.at.b y definition the first weak or nonexistent where removal seems a remote possibility at best.id.and while the rationale behind protecting the community does not necessarily diminish in force over time the supreme court has upheld preventive detention based on dangerousness only when limited to specially dangerous individuals and subject to strong procedural protections.id.at.because cessante ratione legis cessat ipse lex the rationale of a legal rule no longer being applicable,that rule itself no longer applies,id.at,the court read a reasonableness term into the statute.
t he habeas court must ask whether the detention in question exceeds a period reasonably necessary to secure removal.it should measure reasonableness primarily in terms of the statute basic purpose,namely,assuring the alien presence at the moment of removal.thus,if removal is not reasonably foreseeable,the court should hold continued detention unreasonable and no longer authorized by statute.in that case,of course,the alien release may and should be conditioned on any of the various forms of supervised release that are appropriate in the circumstances,and the alien may no doubt be returned to custody upon a violation of those conditions.
zadvydas,at.citing,inter alia,emphasis added.the supr
