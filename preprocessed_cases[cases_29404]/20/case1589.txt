ricky bell,warden for the state of tennessee,appeals the district court order granting ronald harries a writ of habeas corpus as to the penalty phase of his trial,thereby vacating his death sentence.harries from the district court denial of habeas corpus as to the guilt phase.we affirm the district court order granting the writ with respect to the sentence and denying the writ with respect to the conviction.
background 
harries shot and killed rhonda greene,a clerk,during an armed robbery,and a tennessee jury convicted him of murder in.finding two statutory aggravating conviction of a felony involving the use or threat of violence and jury recommended the death sentence.the trial court sentenced harries to death,and the tennessee supreme court affirmed.a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed on harries behalf in,but habeas proceedings were stayed while harries pursued relief in tennessee state courts.
harries filed his first petition for state relief in alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and other constitutional errors.the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing and denied relief on all claims.the tennessee court of criminal appeals affirmed.harries filed a second petition in,challenging the application of the aggravating circumstance,and the trial court again denied relief.the court of criminal appeals found the use of the aggravating circumstance invalid under state law but held the application of that aggravating factor harmless error.
in harries amended his stayed habeas petition.following an evidentiary hearing,the district court found harries prosecutorial misconduct and claims warranted granting the writ with respect to the penalty phase of his trial.the court denied the writ as to all other claims.
ii.standard of review 
because harries filed his habeas corpus petition before the enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,we apply the standard of review.lindh murphy,d.that standard entitles harries to have the federal habeas court make its own independent determination of his federal claim,without being bound by the determination on the merits of that claim reached in the state proceedings.buell mitchell,cir quoting wainwright sykes,d.a district court may grant the writ if the conviction violated the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.estelle mcguire,d.
this court reviews district courts dispositions of habeas petitions de novo and findings of fact for clear error.rickman bell,cir.questions of law or mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo.coleman mitchell,cir.we assume the correctness of state courts factual findings unless convincing contrary evidence exists.mcqueen scroggy,cir,overruled on other grounds by abdur rahman bell in re abdur rahman,cir.
iii.evidentiary hearing 
warden bell relies on this court holding in mitchell rees for his claim that the district court should not have held an evidentiary hearing.in mitchell,we held because d is an express limitation on the district court jurisdiction,a district court is without authority to hold an evidentiary hearing on a matter on which the state court has made findings unless one of the factors contained in d applies,cir.but,as we recognized in abdur rahman bell,mitchell conflicts with sixth circuit and supreme court precedent,cir citing townsend sain,d,overruled in part by keeney,d sims livesay,cir.thus,it seems that despite the holding in mitchell,a district court does have the inherent authority to order an evidentiary hearing even if the factors requiring an evidentiary hearing are absent.id.at.the district court did not err when it held an evidentiary hearing.
iv.competence at trial 
a defendant competence is a question of fact,which we review for clear error.see thompson keohane,d.a defendant is mentally incompetent to stand trial if he lacks a sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.dusky united states,d per curiam.the state trial court did not hold a full hearing on harries competency,so the district court did not defer to any prior determination of competency.the district court found that at the time of the trial petitioner was suffering from bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder,impairments which may have been exacerbated by a organic brain damage,his drug use,his unstable childhood,and the conditions of confinement in sullivan county.slip op.at.the district court nevertheless found harries competent,accepting explanations for his seemingly bizarre behavior that made such behavior appear rational.
harries alleges that his behavior at and around the time of trial was so bizarre that it shows his incompetence to stand trial.his behavior included demanding that tennessee seek the death penalty before waiving extradition from florida talking with the press testifying at his trial and threatening the prosecutor at that trial refusing to seek a change of venue behaving irrationally in jail by staging hunger strikes,throwing food,fighting,attempting to defraud guards,and cursing at guards.
the district court explained why harries conduct failed to prove his incompetence during trial harries demanded that tennessee seek the death penalty only at the time of extradition harries talked with the press to create a favorable impression of himself in the community and to ensure his safety in prison by having the press visit him there harries testified at his codefendant trial out of convict loyalty harries rejected a change of venue because he did not want to be in a smaller community where the jurors would likely be more conservative,and he would not have access to the press and harries believed he could manipulate the situation to his advantage through his jailhouse behavior.further,a review of the trial transcript indicates that harries behaved appropriately throughout the trial,except for saying damn once outside the jury hearing.
the district court determination coincides with the conclusions of both doctors who examined harries before trial and harries trial counsel himself.before trial,doctors twice evaluated harries to be competent to stand trial.harries trial counsel bolstered the competency evidence with his personal confirmation of his ability to communicate with harries.
the contrary opinions offered by harries experts at the evidentiary hearing lack the same of those evaluations occurred well after trial lewis first evaluated harries in,three years after trial.woods submitted his report in october,nineteen years.see wright sec y for the dep t of,cir noting that incompetency to stand trial seven and eight months later than trial is relevant,but it is not enough to counter the best evidence of what his mental condition was at the only time that counts,which is the time of trial.also diminishing the relevance of doctors lewis and woods opinions is their had the benefit of hindsight when evaluating harries allegedly irrational behavior.as the district court noted petitioner experts in particular lewis tend to look back at decisions that turned out badly for harries and label them as irrational based on their ultimate outcome.slip op.at.when measured against the pretrial assessments,the opinions of harries experts fail to counter the evidence in the record that suggests harries had a sufficient present ability to consult with his attorney at the time of trial.see dusky,at.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
strickland standard 
because an ineffective assistance of counsel claim involves mixed questions of law and fact,we review the district court disposition of the claim de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.mapes tate,cir.
to prevail on an claim,a petitioner must satisfy both prongs of the strickland test performance and prejudice.strickland washington,d.to satisfy the performance prong,a petitioner must prove that his attorney representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.to satisfy the prejudice prong,a petitioner must prove that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.when a petitioner challenges a death sentence,the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that,absent the errors,the an appellate court,to the extent it independently reweighs the have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.id.at.
ineffective assistance of counsel during guilt phase 
harries contends that his attorneys were ineffective during the guilt phase of his trial because they failed to argue that he was incompetent to stand trial.but we have already concluded that the district court did not clearly err when it found harries competent during his trial.thus,harries ineffective assistance claim must fail because he can not show prejudice resulting from his attorneys allegedly deficient performance.
ineffective assistance of counsel during sentencing phase 
harries also maintains that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase because his attorneys failed to investigate and,consequently,present mitigating evidence.the district court agreed.
performance 
to evaluate counsel performance,we judge the reasonableness of counsel challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case,viewed as of the time of counsel conduct.strickland,at.strickland mandates that we indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight.id.at.
counsel constitutional duty to investigate a defendant background in preparation for the sentencing phase of a capital trial is.coleman mitchell,cir see also austin bell,cir.the prospect of being put to death unless counsel obtains and presents something in mitigation magnifies counsel responsibility to investigate.mapes coyle,cir.and notwithstanding the deference strickland requires,neither this court nor the supreme court has hesitated to deem deficient counsel failure to fulfill this obligation.see,wiggins smith,d concluding that counsel failure to expand their investigation of the defendant personal background,which included physical and sexual abuse,beyond the presentence investigation and department of social services reports constituted constitutionally deficient performance williams taylor,d finding counsel failure to conduct an investigation that would have uncovered extensive records graphically describing williams nightmarish childhood deficient carter bell,cir concluding that defense counsel failure to investigate the defendant family,social,or psychological background constituted representation at a level below an objective standard of reasonableness.
accordingly,our principal concern in deciding whether counsel exercised reasonable professional judgment is whether the investigation supporting counsel decision not to introduce mitigating evidence of harries background was itself reasonable.wiggins,at.internal quotations and citations omitted.in assessing counsel investigation,we must conduct an objective review of their performance,measured for reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.id.at.quoting strickland,at.the tennessee supreme court established the standard for defense counsel in baxter rose,where it stated that competence would be measured by the duties and criteria set forth in united states decoster,the sixth circuit standard in beasley united states,cir,and the american bar association standards for the administration of criminal justice.more recent aba guidelines,which the united states supreme court has recognized as reflecting prevailing professional norms,emphasize that investigations into mitigating evidence should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor.wiggins,at.quoting aba guidelines for the appointment and performance of counsel in death penalty cases c,and adding emphasis.
guided by the binding precedent just discussed,we can not escape the conclusion that harries counsel failed to conduct a constitutionally adequate investigation.counsel limited their investigation to contacting by telephone harries mother and brother,sending requests for information to some of the institutions in which harries had been confined,and interviewing harries,harries codefendant,and two state witnesses.although counsel requested two competency evaluations,they declined to seek the assistance of a mental health expert or conduct a thorough investigation of harries mental health,even after harries mother alerted them that harries suffered from mental illness.nor did counsel adequately investigate harries family background,despite indications of harries troubled childhood.
attempting to defend their failure to investigate and present this mitigating evidence,harries counsel pointed to harries instructions that they not pursue mental illness as a defense and their belief that evidence of harries background would not persuade the jury.but our prior decisions foreclose such arguments here.in coleman mitchell,we reiterated that defendant resistance to disclosure of information does not excuse counsel duty to independently investigate.at.we cited our prior decision in carter bell,in which we emphasized the sole source of mitigating factors can not properly be that information which defendant may volunteer counsel must make some effort at independent investigation in order to make a reasoned,informed decision as to their utility.id.at quoting carter,at.in austin bell,we rejected counsel argument that he did not present any mitigating evidence because he did not think that it would do any good,concluding that such reasoning d id not reflect a strategic decision,but rather an abdication of advocacy given the availability of witnesses willing to testify on the defendant behalf.at.
the supreme court recent decision in rompilla beard,d reconciles easily with these prior holdings.defense counsel in rompilla,like harries counsel here,abandoned their search after interviewing the defendant and a few family members in addition to three mental health witnesses without developing any useful mitigation evidence.id.at.in dicta,the rompilla court noted that there was room for debate about trial counsel obligation to follow other leads,as counsel may have had good reason to think further investigation would have been fruitless.id.but interviews conducted by harries counsel,unlike rompilla,produced viable leads regarding harries poor mental health and troubled family background.counsel failure to follow these promising leads leaves no room for debate that their truncated investigation was deficient.
we thus conclude that c ounsel failed to conduct a constitutionally adequate pretrial investigation into potential mitigation evidence which,in turn,hampered their ability to make strategic choices regarding the penalty phase proceedings.coleman,at internal citation,quotation marks,and alterations omitted.
for counsel objectively unreasonable performance to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel,strickland requires a petitioner to prove prejudice satisfied by showing a reasonable probability that but for such performance the trial outcome would have been different.id.at.harries thus bears the burden of showing a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome,but need not prove that counsel unreasonable performance more likely than not altered the outcome in the case.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in assessing prejudice,we reweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of available mitigating evidence.wiggins,at.
here,had counsel conducted an adequate investigation,they would have discovered evidence of harries traumatic childhood,including the significant physical abuse harries suffered at the hands of his mother,stepfather,and grandmother.at least once,harries grandmother hit him on the head with a frying pan.when harries was eleven,he was choked so severely that his eyes hemorrhaged.harries family member
