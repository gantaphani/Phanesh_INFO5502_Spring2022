this is an appeal by robert fortini from a federal district court order dismissing fortini petition for a writ of habeas corpus.fortini is currently serving a life sentence,having been convicted in state court of second degree murder.fortini claim depends critically on the facts of the case which we describe in some detail,identifying the few significant details that were disputed.
in,fortini lived in a apartment with his girlfriend,jacie hall,and her cousin,tammy peckham,in plymouth,massachusetts.between and on june,ceasar eventual to the apartment on at least three occasions looking for peckham.on one occasion fortini went downstairs and told monterio that peckham was not at home.shortly after monterio last appearance,hall heard the occupants of a car shouting profanities as the vehicle drove past the house and she told fortini about the incident.
after spending the evening watching television and cleaning his shotgun,fortini went to bed at.at,he was awoken by a car horn and a male voice,screaming curses and racial epithets towards the house fortini is white monterio was black.fortini got out of bed,got dressed and proceeded down to his front porch after sitting on the porch for a period,he returned to his apartment and,at,called the police to report the earlier disturbance.the police did not dispatch officers to the house,but the dispatcher told fortini that if he got a license plate or something the police could check them out.
fortini then retrieved his shotgun and ammunition and returned to his seat on the downstairs porch.although the steps to the second floor were lighted,the porch was not.at approximately,monterio and a friend dana lopes returned to the house.according to fortini,he heard two sets of footsteps and a whispered conversation.he then heard a voice say,watch this shit,we going to wake some motherfuckers up.shortly thereafter,he saw someone who proved to be monterio start up the stairs moving rapidly to the porch.
as monterio reached the porch,fortini stood up and took a couple of steps forward towards the porch steps with the shotgun in his hands.according to fortini,he then yelled hey,get the fuck out of here to the person on the porch in response,fortini said that monterio stared at fortini and the gun,centered his attention on the gun,and then lunged towards fortini and the weapon.fortini took one step backwards and fired,striking monterio in the chest and killing him almost instantly.
fortini was charged with murder in massachusetts superior court.in pretrial proceedings,fortini argued that he believed monterio was attempting to take the gun away from him and that he shot monterio in self defense.in support of this theory,fortini filed a motion in limine asking to introduce evidence of monterio acts only five to seven minutes before he stepped onto fortini porch and was killed.the evidence that fortini wanted to offer was this 
according to witnesses,shortly before monterio arrived at fortini house,monterio ran onto a basketball court where four white males were playing night basketball.monterio then struck,or attempted to strike,all four men.after his companion lopes pulled him away,monterio yelled,i kill them all.remember my face,i ceasar monterio.i the baddest motherfucker in town.immediately after the confrontation,monterio and lopes walked towards fortini house.on the way,a police officer heard monterio again yell,i bad.i the baddest motherfucker in the world.monterio arrived at fortini house a few minutes later.
in his pretrial motion,fortini argued that the evidence of this episode was admissible because the fight and the shooting had a temporal and schematic nexus,and that the showing that monterio had been violent that night and was acting in hot blood supported in various ways fortini claim of self defense rejecting these grounds for admission,the trial court excluded the evidence in a pretrial ruling,finding that fortini was not at the time of the shooting aware of monterio actions on the basketball court a point that fortini did not dispute,see commonwealth fontes,and that fortini was not the subject of monterio threats,see commonwealth rubin.after a jury trial,fortini was convicted of second degree murder and given the mandatory sentence of life in prison.
fortini appealed to the massachusetts appeals court,arguing for the first time that the decision not to admit the disputed evidence was not only error under state law but violated the federal constitution as well.in his brief,fortini stated that the evidence was relevant,trustworthy,and critical to the defendant defense,that its exclusion was inconsistent with chambers mississippi,d,and therefore that his constitutional right to due process had been violated.in its appellate brief,the commonwealth argued that the trial court ruling was correct as a matter of evidence law,but it did not mention fortini constitutional claim,chambers,or the fourteenth amendment.
the appeals court affirmed the conviction and,like the commonwealth brief,only addressed fortini claim in terms of massachusetts evidence law.the court said that the trial court might have erred in not admitting the evidence of monterio behavior,fortini,at,but it found in substance that any error was harmless.the massachusetts harmless error standard for,trial errors is that the error did not influence the jury,or had but very slight effect.commonwealth alphas.the appeals court gave two reasons 
first,the appeals court noted that fortini was permitted to introduce other evidence of monterio actions which supported fortini contention that monterio had acted aggressively that evening.specifically,the court pointed to the evidence of monterio shouting and cursing at the house earlier in the evening.thus,the court held,fortini was already able to establish monterio state of mind and the evidence of the basketball court incident was to some degree cumulative.fortini,at.
second,and more central to its decision,the court found that fortini appearance with a loaded shotgun on the darkened porch,coupled with his decision to eschew any retreat to the safety of his apartment,were deliberate acts of defiance,not defense.fortini,at.on this premise,the court held that even if it was error to exclude the basketball court incident,fortini had suffered no prejudice because he could not,as a matter of law,show that he acted in self defense in light of his decision to lie in wait on the porch rather than retreating to the safety of his apartment when given the opportunity.id.the supreme judicial court denied further appellate review.commonwealth fortini.
fortini filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus,which the federal district court dismissed on the grounds that he had not exhausted available state remedies as the statute governing habeas petitions requires.b.although conceding that fortini state court briefs contained isolated references to his federal constitutional rights,the district court said that they did not include a developed argument elaborating any particular claim.the district court observed that the state appeals court had not addressed fortini constitutional claim,suggesting that it had been unaware that such a claim was being pressed.
fortini now appeals to this court.he argues that the district court erred in finding that he did not properly present his constitutional claim in state court and,in addition,says that excluding the basketball court episode denied him due process under chambers and had a likely effect on the jury verdict.the commonwealth,while partly addressing the merits of fortini claim,rests primarily on the district court waiver argument and on the strict standards for habeas now applicable under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat.see d supp.ii.
the threshold question in this case is whether fortini exhausted his state remedies.the commonwealth says that fortini did little if anything to properly alert the commonwealth courts that he was asserting a federal constitutional claim and thus he is not entitled to habeas review.the district court agreed,finding that while fortini had argued that the exclusion of the basketball court incident implicated state evidence law issues,he had not adequately raised the constitutional claim.we review de novo the district court dismissal on this ground.adelson dipaola,cir.
exhaustion requires that a petitioner have fairly presented to the state courts his constitutional claim.picard connor,d.this requires that the issue be presented in such a way as to make it probable that a reasonable jurist would have been alerted to the existence of the federal question,scarpa dubois,cir,cert.denied,d,for example,by specific constitutional language,constitutional citation,or appropriate federal precedent nadworny fair,cir.by contrast,a passing reference to a constitutional issue will not preserve it for habeas review.martens shannon,cir.
exhaustion is a closer issue than either side admits,but in the end we think that fortini did adequately present his federal claim based on chambers mississippi in the state appellate courts.the first section in fortini brief to the massachusetts appeals the exclusion of the basketball court titled,the trial court violated the defendant state and federal constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial by denying him the right to present highly relevant evidence.his petition for further appellate review to the sjc included virtually identical language.
in addition,the first case cited in the section was chambers mississippi.after discussing the factual predicate for the legal claim,the section concluded with further citations to chambers and webb texas,d due process clause protects defendant right to present witnesses,and the assertion that the exclusion of evidence denied the defendant a trial in accordance with fundamental standards of due process.the brief addendum included the text of the fourteenth amendment,as required by massachusetts rules for appeals raising constitutional claims.proc.f.
in short,fortini papers included many of the trappings that we have previously recognized to be central to presenting a claim.nadworny,at accord williams lord,cir,cert.denied,d.admittedly,fortini constitutional argument may have been obscured by his emphasis on massachusetts cases that deal with rules of evidence.see adelson,at.nonetheless,we think that the briefs language and citations should have alerted the court that a constitutional argument was also being made.that the appeals court did not address the constitutional issue is not controlling.pettijohn hall,cir,cert.denied,d.
we note that fortini apparently failed to raise the constitutional claim in the state trial court when he there urged the admission of the fight evidence.in all likelihood,the appeals court could have refused to consider the due process argument because it was not pressed in the trial court,see commonwealth bibby,although it also had discretion to consider the claim even if it was not raised earlier,commonwealth curtis.
however,the appeals court did not purport to reject the federal constitutional claim on grounds of state waiver law.nor did the federal district court rest on fortini failure to raise the issue at the trial stage.neither in briefing nor in oral argument in this court did the state argue that fortini failure to raise the constitutional issue at the trial stage precludes the argument in federal court.we conclude that the state has itself waived any objection to the habeas petition based on fortini failure to raise the constitutional issue at trial.adelson,at.
turning to the merits,fortini constitutional claim presents a difficult issue that can not be said to be directly governed by existing supreme court precedent.in chambers,a state capital murder case,seemingly reliable hearsay evidence from several witnesses of a confession by someone other than chambers was excluded at his trial.the someone else was called as a witness but denied being the culprit,and chambers ability to question the someone else in court was severely curtailed by the rule limiting impeachment of one own witness.the supreme court reversed it said that in such extreme circumstances,the exclusion of the evidence violated due process principles.chambers,at.
although chambers unquestionably remains the law,crane kentucky,d,the court has rarely used it to overturn convictions and in recent years has made clear that it can be invoked only in extreme cases.most recently,a majority of the court said that a state law justification for exclusion will prevail unless it is arbitrary or disproportionate and infringe s upon a weighty interest of the accused,united states scheffer,d.see also montana egelhoff,d plurality opinion suggestion that any justification is sufficient to satisfy due process.
inevitably,the lower federal courts have tended to balance incommensurate competing interests,taking account of the importance of the testimony to the defense,its inherent strength and reliability,and various kinds of countervailing reasons for excluding it offered by the state,pettijohn,at.nevertheless,in cases less powerful than chambers,a defendant whose proffer of evidence was rejected for any conventionally plausible reason or rule usually has an uphill struggle.
admittedly,fortini has a strong argument that the evidence in question should have been admitted under conventional evidence rules.to begin,the evidence was relevant to fortini claim of self defense,and here the trial judge was misled.although the evidence of the basketball court episode was certainly not relevant to fortini state of mind since he did not then know about the fight,it was relevant to monterio state of mind,making it more likely than it would be without the evidence that monterio lunged at fortini,as the latter claimed.this in turn might have helped fortini if the jury had doubts about his key qualification to which we will return.
of course,relevant evidence is excluded all the time where other considerations override relevance.here,it might look as if the basketball court incident was merely character evidence,tending to portray monterio as a violent man.such evidence is commonly excluded by courts because of its remoteness and tendency to prejudice the jury.see,united states varoudakis,cir.but in a federal court,and so far as we can tell under massachusetts law,the basketball court incident was so close in time to the shooting as to suggest that it might fall within the exceptions that admit where pertinent acts demonstrating state of mind and emotion of the actor,here monterio 
prejudice is a different question.even highly relevant evidence can be excluded if it is unduly prejudicial.the evidence in question was certainly prejudicial in the pertinent sense,that is,it invited the jury to acquit because it made monterio out to be a violent and dangerous man of whom the world was well rid.but the state court did not exclude the evidence on grounds of undue prejudice and there is no certainty that it would have done so if it had appreciated the relevance of the evidence.nor did the appeals court mention prejudice of this kind.
it might thus be argued that there was no valid justification invoked for excluding the evidence.the appeals court itself assumed arguendo that the evidence should not have been excluded.although the sjc has never squarely addressed the issue,it is hard for us to see bad acts would be categorically inadmissible where offered to show the state of mind of the victim rather than the state of mind of the defendant.there is ample precedent elsewhere for admitting evidence on this theory,state day,randolph commonwealth.
yet not every ad hoc mistake in applying state evidence rules,even in a murder case,should be called a violation of due process otherwise every significant state court error in excluding evidence offered by the defendant would be a basis for undoing the conviction.the few supreme court cases that actually undid convictions based on a chambers analysis involved far more egregious situations and the more recent decisions of the court we have cited create serious doubts that the court is interested in carrying the doctrine beyond egregious cases.
chambers and crane both involved highly probative evidence absolutely critical to the defense,at.and at.and the third and last decision
