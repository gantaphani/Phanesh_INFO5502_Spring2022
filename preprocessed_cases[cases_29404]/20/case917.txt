on april,petitioner kent jermaine jackson brutally killed beulah mae kaiser,a woman who lived in the apartment across the hall from him.a virginia jury convicted jackson of,premeditated murder during the commission of a robbery or attempted robbery,robbery,felony stabbing,and burglary,all in connection with kaiser death.the jury sentenced him to death for the murder conviction.
after unsuccessfully working his way through virginia and review processes,jackson filed a petition under west seeking habeas relief in federal court.in his federal habeas petition,jackson raised numerous claims,including a claim that his trial counsel was ineffective under strickland washington,d,for failing to object to the commonwealth of virginia closing argument at his sentencing,an argument that jackson claims rendered his trial fundamentally unfair and violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.the district court denied jackson petition,and,for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
the grisly facts of kaiser murder,as recounted by the supreme court of virginia in its opinion in jackson direct appeal,are as follows 
on april,the body of beulah mae kaiser,years of age,was found in her apartment.according to the medical examiner,kaiser died from a combination of a stab wound to her jugular vein,a fractured skull,and asphyxia caused by blockage of her airway by her tongue.any one of these injuries could have been fatal.in addition to these injuries,kaiser suffered two black eyes,a broken nose,and multiple abrasions,lacerations,and bruises.she had five stab wounds to her head and neck,including the wound to her jugular vein.the medical examiner also testified that kaiser had been anally sodomized with her walking cane and that the cane then had been driven into her mouth with such violence that it knocked out most of her teeth,tore her tongue and forced it into her airway,fractured her jaw,and penetrated the left side of her face.
when kaiser body was found,her apartment was in disarray.personal items were strewn throughout the apartment,blood spatters were on the surfaces of the apartment,and the contents of kaiser purse had been dumped on the floor.the police were unable,however,to find a weapon or any fingerprints of value.
the crime went unsolved for over months until dna testing of saliva on a cigarette butt found in the apartment implicated an individual named cary gaskins.an interview with gaskins led the police to joseph dorsett and kent jermaine jackson,who had been roommates in an apartment across the hall from kaiser apartment at the time of her death.following an interview with dorsett,newport news police arrested dorsett,charging him with kaiser murder,and obtained a warrant for jackson arrest.
police arrested jackson at a girlfriend home in king george county around on august.during an interview with newport news police detectives at the king george county jail that afternoon,jackson confessed to the murder of kaiser.
jackson commonwealth.
on january,a grand jury in the circuit court for the city of newport news,virginia indicted jackson,charging him with murder in the commission of a robbery or attempted robbery,robbery,felony stabbing,burglary,and object sexual penetration id.at.in december of the same year,a jury convicted jackson of all counts except the object sexual penetration count.
pursuant to virginia law,a capital sentencing proceeding was held.ann.the jury found unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt that jackson conduct in committing the offense was outrageously or wantonly vile,horrible,or inhuman in that it involved torture,depravity of mind or aggravated battery to the victim beyond the minimum necessary to accomplish the act of murder.at tracking language from c.based on this finding,the jury recommended that jackson be sentenced to death.the trial court accepted the jury recommendation and imposed a death sentence.
jackson appealed,and the supreme court of virginia unanimously affirmed his convictions and death sentence,jackson,at.the supreme court later denied his petition for a writ of certiorari,jackson virginia,d.
shortly thereafter,the trial court appointed jackson new counsel to represent him in state proceedings,and on december,jackson filed a habeas corpus petition in the supreme court of virginia,raising a host of federal constitutional claims.one of jackson claims focused on the commonwealth closing argument at his sentencing jackson argued that,under strickland,his trial counsel was ineffective because he did not object to the commonwealth comparing jackson to his victim and urging the jury to choose a death sentence based on this comparison.on july,the supreme court of virginia denied jackson petition in a lengthy order,and the supreme court denied jackson attendant certiorari petition on august.jackson true,d.
jackson then turned to the federal courts for habeas relief,filing a petition in the eastern district of virginia that raised essentially the same federal constitutional claims presented in his state habeas petition.the commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss the petition,and a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that the petition be dismissed.on march,the district court accepted the magistrate judge recommendation and dismissed jackson habeas petition.
jackson timely appealed,and on october,during the pendency of the appeal,the district court granted jackson a certificate of appealability coa on the following issue whether,under strickland,jackson trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the commonwealth comparison at sentencing 
we review de novo the district court denial of jackson petition based on the record before the supreme court of virginia,applying the same standards as did the district court.robinson polk,cir.pursuant to the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,the scope of our review is highly constrained.we may grant a petition with respect to any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the decision was either contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.d.
a decision of a state court is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a adjudication is an unreasonable application of federal law when the state court correctly identifies the governing legal rule from the supreme court cases but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular case,id.at,or applies a precedent in a context different from the one in which the precedent was decided and one to which extension of the legal principle of the precedent is not reasonable or fails to apply the principle of a precedent in a context where such failure is unreasonable,robinson,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the state court application of clearly established federal law must be objectively unreasonable,for a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.williams,at.the phrase clearly established federal law refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.id.at.
in deciding whether a petitioner has demonstrated the deficiency of the adjudication under d,we must presume findings of fact to be correct unless the petitioner rebuts that presumption by clear and convincing evidence.e.
this appeal focuses on the commonwealth closing argument at the sentencing phase of jackson trial.the argument proceeded as follows

what you have to do is weigh the evidence to include the evidence in mitigation.you taken an oath to take that into con
