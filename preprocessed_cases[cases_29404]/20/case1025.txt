in,a jury in prince george county,maryland,convicted appellant heath william burch of the double murder of robert and cleo davis,and it sentenced burch to death.burch has unsuccessfully sought habeas corpus relief in the district of maryland,and he requests that we reverse the district court and grant habeas corpus relief.in support of that endeavor,burch makes the following contentions that the sentencing provisions of maryland statute are unconstitutional that the submission of a single verdict form to burch sentencing jury violated his due process rights that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and that a juror reading from a bible during the jury sentencing deliberations violated his constitutional rights.as explained below,these claims are without merit,and we affirm.
in the early morning hours of march,burch burglarized the home of robert and cleo davis in capitol heights,maryland,intending to steal property that could be sold to support his cocaine habit.when confronted by the davises,an elderly couple in their,burch savagely attacked them.following the assaults,burch stole their guns,their money,and davis truck.a family friend discovered the davises the next day,and by that time davis had died.davis,who was alive when found on a couch with blood splattered over her,was hospitalized and died eight days after being attacked by burch.the medical examiner determined that davis died of blunt force injuries and resulting complications.an autopsy performed on davis revealed that he had died from wounds,of which eleven were stab wounds from the blade of a pair of scissors.
there was overwhelming evidence in burch state court trial linking him to the murders of and davis.indeed,burch confessed to the maryland authorities that he had entered the davis home and killed its occupants.a boot found in burch home matched a bloody footprint in the davises home,and traces of the victims blood were found on clothing in burch home.additionally,burch brother testified that on march,the day of the attacks,burch came to the brother home with blood on his neck and hands and acknowledged that he had killed two people.
burch was indicted on april,in the circuit court for prince george county,for the murders of both davis and davis the state also sought convictions under maryland law for the crimes of murder,voluntary manslaughter,robbery with a deadly weapon,attempted robbery with a deadly weapon,robbery,attempted robbery,and first degree burglary.on july,the prosecution notified burch of its intention to seek the death penalty on the murder charges.
on march,following a jury trial,burch was found guilty on all counts except voluntary manslaughter,which had become inapplicable after the jury found burch guilty of the various murder charges.after four days of sentencing proceedings,the same jury was instructed on the sentencing issues.in connection therewith,the jury was provided with a form captioned verdict sheet findings and sentencing determination verdict form to utilize in returning its sentencing verdict.the verdict form generally referred to issues in the singular tense inter alia,the murder,the victim,and the sentence.by way of example,it instructed the jurors to e nter the determination of sentence either life imprisonment or death according to the following instructions.emphasis added.in doing so,the jurors were required under maryland law to consider both aggravating and mitigating circumstances.for example,one listed mitigating circumstance was whether t he murder was committed while the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his or her conduct or conform his or her conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired as a result of mental incapacity,mental disorder,or emotional disturbance.id.at emphasis added.another possible mitigating factor listed on the verdict form was whether t he act of the defendant was not the sole proximate cause of the victim death.id.at emphasis added.
burch trial attorney did not object to the jury use of the verdict form,and on march,the jury returned a verdict of death against burch.the completed verdict form,however,failed to specify whether the jury was returning one or two death sentences.as a result,burch lawyer contended,in proceedings,that only one death sentence could be imposed.the trial court rejected this contention,however,and on april,it imposed two death sentences on for the murder of davis and a second for the murder of davis.burch also received consecutive prison sentences on three other convictions,robbery with a deadly weapon,attempted robbery with a deadly weapon,and burglary.burch remaining convictions merged for sentencing purposes,and his aggregate sentence then consisted of two death sentences plus sixty years of imprisonment.
on direct review,the court of appeals of maryland affirmed each of burch convictions.burch state,however,because the verdict form referred in the singular only to the sentence,the court determined that only one death sentence could properly be imposed on burch.finding no difference between the two brutal murders,the court concluded that it makes no difference which sentence we vacate.id.at.it then affirmed burch death sentence for the murder of davis,vacated his death sentence for the murder of davis,and remanded his case to the circuit court for imposition of a life sentence for the murder of davis.on december,the supreme court denied burch petition for certiorari in connection with his direct appeal process.burch maryland,d.as a result of these proceedings,and with the relief accorded him by the court of appeals of maryland,burch remaining aggregate sentence was the death sentence for the murder of davis,plus sixty years in prison.
thereafter,burch unsuccessfully sought relief in both the circuit court for prince george county,state burch,memorandum and order of court,no.circuit court for prince george county july,burch,memorandum and order,and in the court of appeals of maryland,burch state,subsequently,on april,the supreme court denied burch petition for a writ of certiorari on his state review proceedings.burch maryland,d.burch then turned to the federal district court,unsuccessfully seeking habeas corpus relief in the district of maryland.burch kavanagh,memorandum of decision,no.mjg,burch,memorandum of decision.although the district court denied burch effort to secure federal habeas corpus relief,it awarded him a certificate of appealability this appeal followed.
as a general proposition,the standard of review to be applied by us is quite deferential to the rulings of the state courts.pursuant to the standards promulgated in,a federal court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
the supreme court has recently addressed this standard of review,and it has determined that a state court adjudication is contrary to clearly established federal law only if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.according to the supreme court,a state court decision unreasonably applies clearly established federal law if,despite correctly identifying the governing legal principle,it unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.with these standards in mind,we turn to the issues raised by burch in this proceeding.
in this appeal,burch makes four separate challenges to the district court denial of relief on his death sentence for the murder of davis.he contends,as we have previously related,that the sentencing provisions of maryland statute are unconstitutional under apprendi new jersey,d the verdict form utilized by his sentencing jury violated the principles enunciated by the supreme court in mills maryland,d he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his state court trial and a juror reading from a bible during jury deliberations on sentencing violated his constitutional rights.
burch first challenges the constitutionality of part of maryland statute,contending that its sentencing provisions contravene the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the sixth amendment.these sentencing provisions,found in section of article crimes and punishments of the maryland code instruct a sentencing jury to impose the death sentence if it determines,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances.burch maintains that the sentencing scheme found in section violates the supreme court recent holding in apprendi new jersey,d,that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
significantly,burch raised his apprendi claim for the first time in his effort to obtain federal habeas corpus relief.his claim is therefore precluded by our recent decision in united states sanders,cir.in sanders,we explained that apprendi is certainly a new rule of criminal procedure.id.at.writing for the court,chief judge wilkinson noted that under teague lane,d,n ew rules of constitutional criminal procedure are generally not applied retroactively on collateral review.id.at.there are,however,two limited exceptions in which a new rule may apply retroactively on collateral review if the new rule forbids criminal punishment of certain primary conduct,or if the new rule improves the accuracy of convictions and alters our understanding of the bedrock elements necessary for a fair proceeding,thus making it a watershed,teague,at,rule of criminal procedure.sanders,at.in sanders,we held that the apprendi rule does not fall under either of the two teague exceptions,and that it therefore does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review.
burch judgment of conviction became final on december,when the supreme court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari.see united states segers,cir judgment of conviction of prisoner who petitioned for writ of certiorari becomes final on date supreme court denies petition.because his judgment of conviction was final well before the court decision in apprendi,and because apprendi does not apply retroactively to cases pending on collateral review,burch can not obtain any federal habeas corpus relief under apprendi.as such,we are unable to reach the merits of his apprendi contention 
in his appeal,burch also maintains that his death sentence violates the principles concerning ambiguous verdict forms enunciated by the court in mills maryland,d.he claims that use of the flawed verdict form in the double murder of and davis prevented the jury from applying potentially different mitigating circumstances as to each victim,thereby contravening his rights under the eighth and fourteenth amendments of the constitution.specifically,he maintains that because was a possible defense only to the murder of davis,and the absence of proximate cause was at issue only as to davis death,the use of the verdict form deprived the jury of the ability to apply these mitigating factors individually.
in its mills decision,the supreme court dealt with a verdict form that was ambiguous on the question of whether unanimity was required in order for the jury to find any particular mitigating circumstance.when mills sentencing verdict was returned it was unclear whether the jury had unanimously rejected the existence of each mitigating circumstance,or whether the jury was unable to unanimously agree on the existence of any single mitigating circumstance.as a result,the court vacated mills death sentence and accorded him a new sentencing proceeding.there was,in its view,a substantial probability that reasonable jurors,upon receiving the judge instructions in this case,and in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed,well may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all jurors agreed on the existence of a particular such circumstance.id.at.
burch contends that,just as in mills,his verdict form was so confusing as to preclude the jury from considering mitigating evidence.burch maintains that the verdict form prevented the jury from considering mitigating evidence that his acts were not the sole proximate cause of davis death,and precluded the jury from considering mitigating evidence of as to the murder of davis.as we explain below,we are unable to find merit in either of these contentions 
burch claim as to mitigating evidence,that his acts were not the sole proximate cause of the death of davis,must fail because he is not under a death sentence for that crime.due to the deficient verdict form,the court of appeals of maryland vacated his death sentence for the murder of davis and directed that a life sentence be imposed.even if the jury was precluded from considering mitigating evidence as to the murder of we hold no such is no error for us to correct,in that burch is not under a death sentence as to davis 
burch second challenge to the verdict form is that it precluded the jury from considering the mitigating circumstance of on the murder of davis.in this regard,burch contends that he acted in and attacked davis with a pair of scissors only after davis approached him with a revolver.as we explain more fully below,this challenge must also fail.
the use of the verdict form in burch trial was governed by the provisions of rule g of chapter trial and sentencing,title criminal causes of the maryland rules,entitled in capital cases.rule g mandates that,in cases,the findings and determinations shall be made in writing in the following form,headed findings and sentencing determination.pursuant to the provisions of section iv of rule g,jurors are instructed,based upon the evidence,to make determinations on seven possible mitigating circumstances the verdict form is required to list the seven possible mitigating circumstances contained in rule g,and the jury is provided with boxes to mark one of the following choices 
a we unanimously find by a preponderance of the evidence that the above circumstance exists.
b we unanimously find by a preponderance of the evidence that the above circumstance does not exist.
c after a reasonable period of deliberation,one or more of us,but fewer than all,find by a preponderance of the evidence that the above circumstance exists.
the verdict form utilized by burch sentencing jury followed the form set forth in and mandated by rule g.the third of the seven listed mitigating circumstances,found in both section iv of rule g and the verdict form used by burch sentencing jury,was that t he defendant acted under substantial duress,domination,or provocation of another person,even though not so substantial as to constitute a complete defense to the prosecution.id.this mitigating circumstance is equivalent to a claim of what is known as imperfect.
the burch jury considered and rejected the mitigating circumstance of imperfect,marking the second box w e unanimously find by a preponderance of the evidence that the above circumstance does not exist.notably,the burch jury had been instructed about at the guilt phase of his trial.in that regard,it could have concluded that burch acted in complete and exonerated him of the murder of davis,or it could have utilized the defense of imperfect to justify convicting him of the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter.the jury,however,rejected all possible claims and found burch guilty of the murder of davis.unlike the verdict form used in the sentencing phase,there was no ambiguity in the verdict sheet used in the guilt phase of burch trial the verdict sheet clearly differentiated between the murders of and davis.because the burch jury rejected the claim as to davis at the guilt phase,there is no reason to believe that it was confused when it rejected the mitigating factor of in the trial sentencing phase.thus,there is no basis for burch to contend that the jury was deprived of the opportunity to consider mitigating evidence of as to the murder of davis.
as the court of appeals of maryland has already recognized,the verdict form used by the jury in burch sentencing was flawed.burch state.in comparing burch case to mills,however,we do not see a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.in mills,there was a substantial possibility that a confusing verdict form prevented the jury from considering any mitigating evidence.the flawed verdict form utilized in connection with burch sentencing did not result in confusion precluding the jury from considering mitigating evidence.as such,the decision of the maryland court on this issue,burch,at,was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
in his third appellate contention,burch maintains that the actions of his trial lawyer deprived him of his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.this contention has two prongs.first,burch contends that his lawyer was constitutionally ineffective in failing to seek two verdict forms in the sentencing phase of his trial.second,he asserts that his lawyer was ineffective because he failed to present certain mitigating evidence in the trial sentencing phase.because burch ineffective assistance claims have been adjudicated on their merits in the state court,we must review them under the deferential standard set forth in d,as recently explained in williams taylor,at.stating that prisoner whose claim has been adjudicated on its merits in state court may obtain federal habeas corpus relief only by meeting standard enunciated in d.
we first address burch claim that his lawyer failure to request that two separate verdict forms be submitted to the jury in his sentencing proceedings resulted in the deprivation of his right to effective assistance of counsel.our analysis of this contention is guided by the principles of strickland washington,d,in which the supreme court explained that a meritorious ineffective assistance claim must demonstrate two things first,that counsel performance was deficient and,second,that counsel deficient performance prejudiced the defense.under the second prong of strickland s test,there is a strong presumption that counsel strategy and tactics fall within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.id.at.for counsel trial performance to be deficient,he must have made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment,id.at,and that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.to establish prejudice,a defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.under strickland,a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.furthermore,and of importance here,in conducting the ineffectiveness inquiry,a court need not determine whether counsel performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant.id.at.
even assuming that the failure of burch lawyer to seek and secure two verdict forms for the jury use in the sentencing phase of his trial amounted to deficient performance,thus satisfying strickland first prong,this ineffective assistance claim must fail because burch is unable to satisfy strickland second prong,he can not demonstrate prejudice.as we have already indicated,even if burch lawyer had insisted on two verdict forms instead of one,burch would nonetheless have received the death penalty for his criminal activity.we agree with the conclusion of the court of appeals of maryland that 
there can be no question but that all jurors,after weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors that they found to exist,concluded that appellant should be put to death for at least one,if not both,of the murders.the notions asserted by burch that the jury may have returned two life sentences had it used separate forms to record its decisions have utterly no basis in fact and are no more than unsupported conjecture and speculation.
burch,at.under strickland,the burden is on burch to show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.at.burch has failed to make any such showing.in these circumstances,we are unable to conclude that the district court rejection of this aspect of burch claims was an unreasonable application of the clearly established federal law enunciated by the supreme court in strickland washington.
burch also maintains that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his lawyer failed to present certain mitigating evidence in his trial sentencing phase.burch asserts that his lawyer failed to present evidence that burch would not be dangerous in the future because he had already been incarcerated for days without a disciplinary infraction failed to call witnesses prepared to testify about burch remorse failed to stress that burch could never be paroled if he were spared the death penalty and failed to present witnesses who could have testified about burch positive qualities.appellant br.at.
on state review,the circuit court determined that most of the evidence burch claims was not presented to the sentencing jury had in fact been presented.the court found,inter alia,that burch lawyer offered information regarding burch personality as a child and teenager,the environment in which he was raised,his relationship with his father,and his drug addiction.burch,memorandum and order at.moreover,burch defense lawyer testified in the state proceeding that he had considered and investigated all possible claims of mitigation,and that he had decided,as a matter of litigation strategy,to focus on burch drug abuse and family background.as a result of this testimony,the state court found that the performance of burch trial counsel during the sentencing proceedings demonstrated the exercise of reasonable professional judgment,and that burch had failed to rebut the presumption that his lawyer strategy was sound.on federal habeas corpus review,the district court concluded on this issue that t he state court findings are fully supported by the record are neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of the strickland standard and are objectively reasonable.burch,memorandum of decision at.after careful consideration of the record,we likewise are unable to conclude that the state court rejection of burch ineffective assistance challenge was an unreasonable application of strickland.
we are not permitted to the tactical decision of burch lawyer not to present every conceivable piece of mitigating evidence.in strickland,the court recognized that strategic choices by counsel made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.strickland,at.see also burger kemp,d refusing to lawyer strategic decision not to present any mitigating evidence because defendant would not be served by such evidence darden wainwright,d rejecting ineffectiveness challenge to defense counsel strategy to present only defendant plea for mercy at sentencing hearing.burch defense lawyer made strategic and tactical he was obliged to focus on burch drug use and family background.in so doing,he elicited testimony from burch mother,his two sisters,several acquaintances,and a licensed social worker who had twice interviewed burch.these witnesses painted a consistent picture of burch growing up with an abusive and alcoholic father,as well as a thorough portrait of burch drug use.in this regard,burch lawyer presented a substantial amount of mitigating evidence,and burch is simply unable to overcome the strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional as
