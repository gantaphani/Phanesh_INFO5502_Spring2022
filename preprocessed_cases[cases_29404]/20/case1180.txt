isaac challenges the reinstatement of a removal order.treating this action as a petition for review,we conclude that we are without jurisdiction,so we dismiss the petition.
was removed from the united states in on the basis of a conviction of driving while intoxicated dwi.shortly after removal,he reentered the united states in violation of federal law.the immigration and naturalization service ins took him into custody and initiated proceedings to reinstate the removal order.
after the removal,but before the ins sought reinstatement of the order,this court determined that a dwi conviction is not ground for removal under the relevant immigration statute.citing that decision,brought a habeas corpus action challenging the reinstatement of the removal order on due process grounds.the district court granted habeas relief.
pursuant to the real id act,we reverse the district court finding of habeas jurisdiction and instead consider the challenge to the reinstatement of the removal order as a petition for review.finding no jurisdiction to entertain the merits of the claim,we dismiss the petition.
first entered the united states in and became a lawful permanent resident in.in august he was convicted in state court of dwi,a felony,and sentenced to ten years confinement,suspended and probated to five years community supervision.at that time he had been convicted of dwi on at least three occasions.
on december,the ins issued a notice to appear to,asserting that he was removable pursuant to a a iii on the ground that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony,which is defined by a f to include a crime of violence with a term of imprisonment of at least one year.a withdrawn opinion of this court had indicated that dwi is a crime of violence.see ins,cir,withdrawn,cir.
did not contest removability but,instead,on december,submitted a stipulated request for final order of removal and waiver of hearing in which he conceded that he was removable as charged,waived the right to a hearing,accepted a written order of removal,and waived appeal of that written order.on december,the immigration judge granted the request for a final order and ordered him removed to el salvador he was removed on february.
about two weeks after his removal,reentered the united states in violation of a and was taken into custody by the ins on december.the next day,the ins issued a notice of to reinstate prior removal order pursuant to a,which authorizes such reinstatement by the attorney general when an alien illegally reenters after being removed.after a reinstatement,a allows the attorney general to remove the alien without additional proceedings.was also indicted for illegal reentry under,but the district court dismissed the indictment.
on may,filed motions with the executive office for immigration review requesting a stay of removal and asking that the removal proceedings be reopened and terminated on the basis of united states,cir,in which a panel of this court reached a conclusion opposite to that reached in the withdrawn opinion in and stated that dwi is not a crime of violence.accordingly,in this circuit a dwi conviction is no longer an aggravated felony that triggers removability.
contended that applies retroactively to his removal proceedings,rendering those proceedings,and therefore reinstatement of the resulting removal order,invalid.the immigration judge granted a stay of removal on may,without ruling on the motion to reopen and terminate.on may,filed his habeas petition,contending that the removal order was invalid because,given our subsequent decision in,it was based on an erroneous interpretation of the law the invalidity of the underlying removal order meant that his reentry was lawful and outside the scope of a thus precluding reinstatement of the prior order and the reinstatement proceedings were in violation of due process because they were initiated on the basis of an invalid removal order.
adopting the report of a magistrate judge,the district court conditionally granted habeas relief,holding that pursuant to ins cyr,d,it had jurisdiction under to review the removal order in a habeas proceeding.with regard to the merits,the court held that applies retroactively to the removal proceedings,rendering them fundamentally unfair because the ins misinterpreted the law.on that basis,the court determined that the removal order was void ab initio and therefore held that reinstatement of the order was improper.the issuance of the writ was conditioned on the government failure to vacate both the underlying order of removal and the reinstatement order within ten days.
after the government filed its appeal,congress on may,enacted the real id act,stat,which amends the immigration and nationality act ina by explicitly foreclosing habeas review of removal orders and by providing that a petition for review is the sole and exclusive means of judicial review for all removal orders except those issued pursuant to b.see,stat,a b.more specifically,the real id act amends a c to provide that the wholesale preclusion of judicial review where a removal order is based on,inter alia,the alien commission of an aggravated felony includes a preclusion of habeas review.see,stat,a a ii.the real id act thus supplies,in this context,the clear statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas jurisdiction that the cyr court found lacking.
aside from addressing the clarity with which congressional intent needs to be expressed,the court in cyr also asserted that if the jurisdictional provisions of the ina did in fact preclude all judicial review in certain circumstances,as they now do as a result of the real id act,then suspension clause concerns would be implicated with regard to pure questions of law.cyr,at.the real id act addresses this consideration in a d,which provides that 
n othing in subparagraph b or c,or in any other provision of this chapter other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.
thus,although habeas jurisdiction to review removal orders issued on the basis of an alien conviction of an aggravated felony has been foreclosed by the real id act,federal courts of appeals now have jurisdiction,subject to other provisions of and jurisdictional conditions outside the scope of the ina,to consider,on a petition for review,constitutional claims and questions of law with regard to such orders on a petition for review.congress specified that the provisions of the real id act were to take effect immediately and retroactively upon enactment.see,stat,b.
as a consequence of this new jurisdictional framework,w e can no longer consider challenge s to removal orders in the context of habeas review rather,we must now determine whether petitioner challenge is properly converted into a petition for review under the real id act and,if so,whether we have jurisdiction to entertain that petition.rosales bice,cir per curiam,cert.denied,d,wl,lexis,although congress provided that a habeas petition pending before a district court as of the real id act effective date was to be transferred to the appropriate court of appeals and converted into a petition for review,see,stat,c,it did not specify what was to happen to habeas petitions that were already on appeal as of that effective date.
following the third and ninth circuits we have decided that despite congress silence on this issue,habeas petitions on appeal as of may,are properly converted into petitions for review.rosales,at.exercising our undeniable appellate jurisdiction over the government appeal of the grant of habeas relief,we therefore reverse the district court finding of habeas jurisdiction and convert the instant habeas appeal into a petition for review we turn now to whether we have jurisdiction to entertain the petition for review.
we review questions of law as to jurisdiction de novo.see bissonnet,llc quinlan,cir in re liljeberg,cir.we utilize that standard of review here.
nothing in the real id act precludes our jurisdiction over
