petitioner lavelle chambers was convicted in wisconsin state court in of one count of felony murder as party to a crime and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm.the court imposed a term of fifty years imprisonment on the felony murder charge and eight years imprisonment on the felon in possession charge.the sentences were to run consecutively.after unsuccessfully appealing his conviction in the wisconsin state courts,chambers filed a petition for habeas corpus in the united states district court.the court denied the writ.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
on november,chambers and his friend,eddie brooks,were driving around in brooks car with the intention of committing robbery.as they were driving near north avenue and street in milwaukee,they noticed two men exiting the north avenue smoke shop these two individuals were pushing a safe.brooks stopped the car.both chambers and he jumped out and accosted the men pushing the safe.the men told brooks and chambers that they had just broken into the smoke shop and that they had stolen the safe.they further indicated that the shop remained open and could be robbed of other items.
brooks and chambers ran into the smoke shop and stole various,money,and food stamps.as the pair was looking around the shop for other items to steal,a police scanner in brooks possession indicated that the police were being dispatched to the smoke shop.
as brooks and chambers left the shop,they noticed a dark blue police car located a short distance away on north avenue.the officers in the car apparently spotted them,made a,and drove toward the store.brooks and chambers then ran west on north avenue in an attempt to flee the scene.after approximately yards,the pair split up and ran in different directions.chambers hid under a porch and eventually was found and arrested by the police.while chambers was hiding under the porch,brooks engaged the pursuing police officer in gunfire.a bullet shot by brooks struck and killed sergeant michael tourmo.
b.earlier proceedings 
chambers was tried for felony murder as party to a crime and for being a felon in possession of a firearm.the jury convicted chambers of both counts.he was sentenced to a term of fifty years imprisonment on the felony murder charge and eight years imprisonment on the felon in possession charge.the sentences were to run consecutively.
chambers appealed his conviction to the wisconsin court of appeals.he raised three arguments a juror was improperly excluded for cause during voir dire proceedings the evidence at trial was insufficient to convict him of felony murder,party to a crime,when the felony was completed,and brooks and he had separated before brooks shot and killed the police officer and the jury instruction that a crime is not complete until a successful escape is made impermissibly directed a verdict against chambers because the point of completion of a crime can not be decided as a matter of law rather,it is within the province of the jury to decide whether the death was caused while committing or attempting to commit a crime.
the state appellate court only addressed chambers second argument and found that sufficient evidence existed to convict him.specifically,the state court determined that the conduct undertaken by chambers,as an accomplice to armed burglary,falls within the ambit of the felony murder statute.state chambers.the court held that the evidence only needed to show that chambers committed one of the underlying felonies specified in the state felony murder statute wisconsin law does not require that a defendant have an intent to kill or directly cause the death of a third party.the state met this burden,the court concluded.see id.at.
on june,the wisconsin supreme court denied review.
after the wisconsin supreme court denied review of his direct appeal,chambers filed a motion for postconviction relief in the trial court.he again challenged the jury instruction given at his trial that,for purposes of felony murder liability,a crime is not complete until a successful escape is made.chambers contended that the instruction violated his right to due process of law under the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution because it relieved the state of its burden of proving all elements of the offense of felony murder,in violation of sandstrom montana,d.
the trial court denied chambers motion for postconviction relief because it found the petition to be predicated on the same reasons set forth in his appeal which was decided against him,at.this repetitiousness was dispositive,the court explained,because claims resolved against a defendant on direct appeal can not be reasserted in a subsequent postconviction motion.even if the claim were characterized as new,continued the court,it was barred by state,which prohibits defendants from raising claims on collateral attack if they do not first raise them on direct appeal unless there are sufficient reasons for the defendant failure to present the claim on direct appeal.
chambers appealed the trial court denial of his motion for postconviction relief to the wisconsin court of appeals.he argued that the jury instruction violated his due process rights because it relieved the state of its burden of proving all elements of the offense of felony murder.specifically,the instruction directed the jury to assume an essential element of the chambers caused the death of officer tourmo while committing or attempting to commit the predicate offense of armed burglary.
the appellate court concluded that the trial court properly denied chambers motion.it found that the argument regarding the jury instruction was predicated upon the same factual basis as his contention on direct appeal that there was not enough evidence to convict him because he was not present when the murder occurred.because this issue was adjudicated finally against chambers on direct appeal,the state appellate court held,he could not again raise it.moreover,even if the jury instruction challenge were construed as a new and independent claim,it was barred by because chambers failed to show sufficient reason for not raising the argument on direct appeal.
the wisconsin supreme court again denied review on april.
chambers next sought a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court.see.initially acting pro se,chambers first filed his habeas petition on march.the district court dismissed the petition without prejudice so that chambers could pursue the postconviction relief in the wisconsin courts that we have detailed above.on april,after he had exhausted his opportunities for state postconviction relief,chambers refiled his petition and asserted that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to convict him of felony murder and the jury instruction that a crime is not complete until a successful escape is made violated his due process rights by relieving the state of its burden of proving all elements of the offense of felony murder beyond a reasonable doubt.
the case was assigned to a magistrate judge,who recommended,on april,that the petition be denied and the action dismissed.the magistrate judge believed that the evidence used to convict chambers under wisconsin definition of felony murder was sufficient,and,to the extent that chambers claims the wisconsin courts improperly construed wisconsin state law,such a claim can not support federal habeas relief.at.the magistrate judge also rejected chambers second claim,characterizing the challenge to the jury instruction as one based upon an incorrect application of state law,again not a basis for federal habeas relief.
chambers objected to this recommendation.the district court,upon considering chambers objections to the recommendation,declined to accept the magistrate judge conclusions and ordered that the state file an answer along with transcripts of the state court proceedings.the district court remanded the case to the magistrate judge for a recommendation on the merits.
the magistrate judge then granted chambers request for appointment of counsel and set up a briefing schedule.after receiving the briefs,the magistrate judge again recommended that the habeas petition be denied and the action dismissed.specifically,the magistrate judge disposed of chambers two claims in almost the identical manner as he had in the previous recommendation.the magistrate judge also noted,however,that chambers counsel had created a third argument in his brief by placing a slightly different twist on the due process claim.at.counsel contended that the jury instruction amounted to an ex post facto application of the state felony murder statute the element of felony murder that requires that a death occur while the defendant was committing or attempting to commit armed burglary had not been construed to include a death that occurs while the accomplices are escaping the scene of an armed burglary.
although the magistrate judge indicated that the claim may have been procedurally defaulted and not exhausted in the state courts,he addressed the merits nonetheless.he concluded that wisconsin law at the time of the offense clearly rendered chambers liable as a party to felony murder and that chambers was on reasonable notice that he could be charged with and convicted of a murder committed by his confederate if that murder were committed during the course of an attempted escape from an armed burglary.
in a decision and order dated february,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation and ordered that chambers habeas petition be dismissed.a judgment of dismissal was entered the same day.in another order issued march,the district court denied chambers motion for reconsideration.this appeal followed.
discussion 
chambers appeals the district court disposition of his habeas petition.he contends that he is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus because the state trial court instruction to the jury that a crime is not complete until a successful escape is made violated his right to due process guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment by retroactively imposing a broader,unexpected definition of felony murder.the state,however,claims that chambers failed to exhaust this claim and,therefore,has procedurally defaulted it.even if he has not,the state argues,the jury instruction was not constitutionally infirm.
procedural default 
a federal district court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus unless the petitioner has exhausted his state court remedies.see b a.failure to exhaust available state court remedies constitutes a procedural default.see howard,cir.to avoid procedural default,a habeas petitioner must have presented fully and fairly his federal claims to the state courts before he may obtain federal review of those same claims.see boerckel,d see also rodriguez scillia,cir.fair presentment requires the petitioner to give the state courts a meaningful opportunity to pass upon the substance of the claims later presented in federal court.rodriguez,at see also howard,at.the petitioner must have placed both the operative facts and the controlling legal principles before the state courts.see ellsworth levenhagen,cir wilson briley,cir.a mere passing reference to a constitutional issue certainly does not suffice.fortini murphy,cir.
when applying these standards,federal courts should avoid hypertechnicality.verdin,cir.a petitioner may reformulate his claims as long as the substance of the argument remains the same.see picard connor,d obviously there are instances in which the ultimate question for disposition will be the same despite variations in the legal theory or factual allegations urged in its support we simply hold that the substance of a federal habeas corpus claim must first be presented to the state courts.internal citations and quotation marks omitted see also boyko parke,cir.mere variations in the same claim rather than a different legal theory will not preclude exhaustion.wilks israel,cir.
a petitioner reformulation of his claim,however,should not place the claim in a significantly different posture by making the claim stronger or more substantial.boyko.we previously have noted that the leeway afforded to habeas petitioners in reformulating due process arguments is much more limited than in other constitutional contexts.kurzawa jordan,cir explaining that what the petitioner requested was much more than a mere reformulation of his has raised two entirely new,separate due process arguments on collateral appeal.mere similarity of claims is insufficient to exhaust.see picard,at.
given these principles,we must conclude that chambers has failed to exhaust his claim and,consequently,has committed a procedural default.as the state points out,chambers raised an entirely new and distinct challenge to the jury instruction in his brief to the district court.he argued for the first time that the instruction constituted a retroactive interpretation of the felony murder statute in violation of his right to due process,as set forth in bouie city of columbia,d.this argument had not been presented squarely to the state courts or even in the habeas petition itself rather,chambers consistently argued to the state courts that the jury instruction was violative of due process because it relieved the state of its burden of proving all elements of the offense of felony murder beyond a reasonable doubt.his mention of the ex post facto argument was in a footnote in the middle of an argument on another point.this passing reference hardly placed the wisconsin courts on notice that he was presenting the argument as an independent basis for relief.nor did this reference present the state appellate court with sufficient elaboration,especially in terms of the relevant federal and wisconsin case law,now cited prominently in the current appeal before us,to permit that court to decide the issue.howard,at holding that a footnote reference that presented neither the legal nor factual basis of the petitioner claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel was not sufficient to preserve it for habeas review.in short,the single reference buried in a footnote in an argument on another contention hardly alerted the state judges,as a practical matter,that chambers was seeking relief on the ground now argued at length before us.see bocian godinez,cir noting that a single reference to the fourteenth amendment and the supreme court case of furman georgia,d,did not sufficiently alert the illinois court to the petitioner vagueness claim.
although chambers has challenged the same jury instruction at each level of appellate review,the gravamen of the unfairness about which he complains has changed.the ex post facto argument,like the claim,is a due process argument,but it alleges a distinct a court,by retroactively expanding the definition of a crime,has done what the legislature is forbidden by the ex post facto clause from doing.see bouie,at.if a state legislature is barred by the ex post facto clause from passing a law,it must follow that a state court is barred by the due process clause from achieving precisely the same result by judicial construction.as courts have noted in the past,we must look beyond the due process label to a more meaningful level of specificity.see duncan henry,d noting that the petitioner failure to raise a particular due process argument in state court is especially pronounced in that the petitioner did specifically raise a due process objection before the state court based on a different claim m ere similarity of claims is insufficient to exhaust.riggins mcginnis,cir noting that due process is such a ductile concept that is the equivalent of no argument at all wilks,at concluding that the petitioner failed to exhaust although the claim he presented to the trial court arises out of the same factual circumstance as the constitutional claim,it is a separate legal issue.
because chambers did not present his retroactivity issue to the state courts,he has procedurally defaulted on this contention 
we have determined that chambers has procedurally defaulted on his claim,and the judgment of the district court is affirmed on this ground alone.if we were to reach the merits,however,we still would affirm the judgment of the district court.
