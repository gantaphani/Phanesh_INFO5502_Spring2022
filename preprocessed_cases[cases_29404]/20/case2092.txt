background 
rene rodriguez was charged in a indictment with conspiracy to deliver over kilograms of marijuana from through,in violation of a.in,a jury convicted rodriguez and the district court sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole because of the quantity of marijuana involved in the count of conviction and because of his prior convictions for drug trafficking offenses.see b a at trial,the government presented evidence of his conspiracy that included recorded telephone conversations between him and his,phone records,and testimony of the.rodriguez theory of his defense was that he was not involved in the conspiracy,but was merely attempting to steal money from the drug traffickers.the issue of drug quantity was not submitted to the jury during his trial,but was instead determined by the court by a preponderance of the evidence to be over kilograms.this court affirmed the conviction and the sentence in united states rodriguez,cir,cert.denied,d hereinafter rodriguez i.
in rodriguez i,we addressed rodriguez argument that the issue of drug quantity should have been submitted to the jury,and that the appropriate standard for determining drug quantity for sentencing purposes was beyond a reasonable doubt.see id.at.we held that the district court,not the jury,should have decided drug quantity because it is not an element of the offense.id.at.this court also upheld the preponderance of evidence standard,noting that due process concerns were not implicated by the facts of that case where the sentencing guidelines incrementally increased time served based on drug quantity id.at.
on april,rodriguez filed a motion for collateral review under alleging a variety of constitutional violations,including that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel.his motion did not contain any allegations concerning the constitutionality of the standard of proof used to determine the drug quantity at sentencing.nor did it include an allegation that the district court erred in failing to submit the issue of drug quantity to the jury.rodriguez motion before the district court listed almost a dozen instances of counsel alleged ineffectiveness,only two of which have been preserved for consideration in this appeal first,rodriguez maintains that he involuntarily waived his right to testify in his own defense because his attorney incorrectly advised him that if he took the stand his prior convictions for drug trafficking would be entered into evidence.second,he alleges that during closing argument,his counsel effectively pleaded him guilty by improperly admitting that rodriguez did possess,and agreed to deliver,ten ounces of marijuana.on december,without holding an evidentiary hearing concerning these issues,the district court entered judgment denying rodriguez motion.
after the district court denied his habeas petition,rodriguez filed a motion on january,to amend the denial of his habeas application under.e.the motion alleged a variety of errors in the transcriptions of surveillance tapes that were presented to the jury.eleven months later,on december,while the motion to amend the judgment was still pending,rodriguez filed a motion for leave to the pleadings.in this motion,he petitioned the district court to allow him to include a claim in his petition that the issue of drug quantity should have been determined by the jury on a reasonable doubt standard rodriguez again petitioned the court to amend in february as a result of the supreme court grant of certiorari in apprendi new jersey,d.ultimately,in august the district court denied the rule motion,along with the petitions to amend.the district court then issued a certificate of appealability to rodriguez,limited to his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.rodriguez appeals the district court decision on his application and petitions this court to expand the certificate of appealability to include his apprendi claim.
ii.analysis 
apprendi claim 
on appeal of a district court decision to grant or to deny an application for writ of habeas corpus,we review all questions of law de novo.small endicott,cir.in order to appeal a district court ruling on a writ of habeas corpus,an applicant is required to obtain a certificate of appealability.see c b fed.b.because the certificate in this case is limited to only the ineffective assistance claims,we will first address rodriguez petition to expand the certificate to include his claim under apprendi.a certificate of appealability may issue by a district or circuit judge only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right and the certificate shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy that showing.c see also williams parke,cir.rodriguez fails to make this showing,and therefore his request to expand the certificate of appealability is denied.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right includes showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether or,for that matter,agree that the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.slack mcdaniel,d citing barefoot estelle,d.here,the district court did not address the substantive issues underlying rodriguez proposed habeas claim under apprendi,but instead denied his motions that sought to raise that claim.when a district court denies a habeas claim on procedural grounds,a circuit court should only expand the certificate to include that claim if a prisoner at least demonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.id.at.when a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is free to invoke it to dispose of the case,a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing the petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed further.id.in this case,we find that rodriguez can not show the denial of a constitutional right because he is procedurally barred from raising his apprendi claim.
first,rodriguez is procedurally barred from pursuing his apprendi claim on appeal because he failed to raise that claim in his claim before the district court.in a habeas case,the law is clear that any claim not presented to the district court is waived on appeal.drake clark,cir internal citations omitted refusing to consider the arguments raised in petitioner appeal from a denial of a writ of habeas corpus that were not presented to the district court.see also valenzuela united states,cir stating that by failing to raise an issue in a petition before the district court,a petitioner waived that issue on appeal shillcutt gagnon,cir declining to consider a sixth amendment claim because the petitioner did not raise it in his habeas petition before the district court.in rittenhouse battles,cir,we addressed this precise issue.rittenhouse petitioned this court to expand his certificate of appealability to include issues that he had not raised in the district court.id.however,like rodriguez,he had previously raised the disputed issues in his prior proceedings on direct appeal,but failed to raise them when he filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court.id.we refused to expand rittenhouse certificate because his failure to raise those issues in the district court constituted a waiver.id.in a like manner,rodriguez did not raise the apprendi claim in his original application,and it is therefore waived on appeal.
rodriguez can not rely on the timing of the supreme court ruling in apprendi to avoid a finding of waiver.while it is true that rodriguez was tried and sentenced prior to apprendi new jersey,d,we have held that prisoners in similar situations were not relieved of their duty to bring this type of claim in a timely manner.our case law is clear that the novelty of apprendi does not constitute cause for failing to raise the issue earlier because the foundation for apprendi was laid long before.valenzuela,at citing garrott united states,cir.furthermore,rodriguez was obviously aware of the availability of a claim addressing the standard of review applied to sentencing factors as he himself raised this issue in his direct appeal.nevertheless,he chose not to pursue it in his habeas petition 
we next consider whether rodriguez avoided a waiver,thus preserving his apprendi issue for appeal,by filing a motion to amend his pleadings.prior to moving to amend his petition,rodriguez filed a motion under.in january to alter or amend the judgment of the district court.the rule motion,and the accompanying affidavit from rodriguez,alleged errors with the evidence presented at trial and did not include any claims that the trial court erred in using the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine the issue of drug quantity.in december,while the rule motion was still pending and seven days after the supreme court granted certiorari in apprendi new jersey,d,rodriguez filed a motion to amend his pleadings to include an apprendi claim.rodriguez filed a second memorandum requesting amendment and argument on the apprendi issue when apprendi was decided in june.rodriguez argued that the maximum sentence he should have received for his conviction,in the absence of a jury finding on the issue of drug quantity,was years under b d.because he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole,under b a,he argues that he received a sentence in excess of the maximum statutory penalty,in violation of apprendi.
the rules governing do not deal with amendments for collateral review and therefore proposed amendments to motions are governed by.a.johnson united states,cir.under rule a a court may permit leave to allow amendment of pleadings even after a defendant absolute right to amend has lapsed,freely when justice requires.the aedpa allows a prisoner a full opportunity to seek collateral review,which means that a prisoner receives one complete round of litigation,which as in other civil suits includes the opportunity to amend a pleading before judgment.johnson,at.
in this case,however,the district court entered a judgment denying rodriguez application prior to his attempt to amend his pleadings.this is not fatal to rodriguez claim,as a court may grant a plaintiff motion for leave to amend even after judgment had been entered.see,united states labor party oremus,cir.however,in this circuit,the presumption in favor of liberality in granting motions to amend under rule a is reversed after judgment has been entered.vicom harbridge merchant services,cir citing first bank continental.bank,cir.see also amendola bayer,cir in this circuit,after a judgment has been entered,a party must have the judgment reopened pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e or b and then request leave to amend pursuant to rule a.twohy first bank,cir noting that several courts have recognized that justice may require something less in situations than in situations under rule a.in this case the court denied both his motion to amend and his rule motion simultaneously and without comment.whether or not to grant a defendant motion to amend his complaint is a decision left to the discretion of the district court.bethany pharmacal qvc,cir.under rule,a court may deny the amendment due to undue delay,bad faith,dilatory motive,prejudice or futility.id.at.in this case the court would have been free to deny the motion based on either futility or delay.
a district court may properly deny a motion to amend as futile if the proposed amendment would be barred by the statute of limitations.king v.one unknown fed.corr.officer,cir.under aedpa,a statute of limitations applies to all federal habeas petitions.in this case,rodriguez original claim was filed within aedpa statute of limitations,but his apprendi claim in his motion to amend was filed months after the deadline to file motions expired.under fed civ.c,an amended complaint relates back to the date of the original complaint for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations where the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading.c.in this case,the motion to amend will not be untimely if it relates back to the original filing.we have not addressed rule c in the context of a motion,but we have noted the special considerations for motions that we must consider in light of aedpa limitations on multiple efforts to obtain collateral review.see johnson at holding that motions can count as second or successive applications under,if the petition has reached a final decision.four circuits have addressed this issue and each concluded that an untimely claim will not relate back under rule c unless the claim has more in common with the timely filed claim than the mere fact that they arose out of the same trial and sentencing proceedings.dean united states,cir see also united states pittman,cir united states duffus,cir united states craycraft,cir.in order for an untimely claim to relate back,it must have arisen from the same set of facts as the timely filed claim,not from separate conduct or a separate occurrence in both time and type.dean,at citing pittman,at both time and type duffus,at same set of facts craycraft,at same set of facts and both time and type.in addition,these circuits have been uniform in their denial of amendments that would add a new claim or theory of relief.united states thomas,cir holding that rule c applies to petitions insofar as amendments seek to clarify or amplify existing claims and not add entirely new claims pittman,at affirming a denial of an amendment because it arose out of a separate occurrence craycraft,at cir affirming denial of a proposed amendment because the proposed claim was distinctly separate from claims already pleaded.
rodriguez claim clearly does not satisfy this standard.his original application made no mention of the appropriate standard of review for sentencing factors that increase the maximum available sentence.instead it focused on ineffective assistance of counsel issues.the issues and facts underlying his apprendi claim are unrelated to his ineffective assistance of counsel claims.because there is no claim in rodriguez original petition that his amended claim could relate back to,it violates aedpa statute of limitations.because of this preclusion,it would not have been an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny his motion to amend as futile 
in addition,the court could have denied rodriguez application based on his delay in moving for the amendment.rodriguez did not move to amend his complaint until after months had passed from the time that the government filed its response and months after the deadline to file a motion under the aedpa had expired.additionally,rodriguez was aware of the arguments he eventually presented in his motion to amend because he had raised those exact issues on direct appeal.see,continental bank,meyer,cir holding that failure to move to amend complaint until months had passed,when the basis for the amendment was present at the time of filing the complaint and would have forced the nonmoving party to conduct discovery,constituted undue delay.rodriguez argues that a delay in requesting an amendment is not a sufficient basis to deny a motion to amend when the delay has not caused the opposing party undue prejudice.see textor board of regents of,cir.in this case,rodriguez argues,the government was on notice of the availability of this claim,and it was not prejudiced by the delay because it had briefed the issue when it was raised on direct appeal.however,based on the significant time lapse between the deadline to file motions under the aedpa,the availability of this claim at the time he filed his initial habeas application and the need for the government to reinvestigate this claim,it would not have been an abuse of discretion for the court to have denied this motion to amend based on delay.see johnson,at explaining that delay is a standard reason for denying leave to amend.
rodriguez argues that the time limits in should be equitably tolled because he could not have raised an apprendi claim in his petition to the district court.as we have already established,however,supra,rodriguez was not precluded from raising this argument in his initial motion.at oral argument,rodriguez counsel did state that he did not introduce the issue in his original petition due to fear of sanctions.we have noted on many occasions,however,that arguments raised for the first time at oral argument are waived.see,ricci arlington heights,cir united states beltran,cir dovenmuehle gilldorn mortgage midwest,cir.also,rodriguez did not cite,nor have we been able to find any case where a litigant on habeas review was sanctioned for relitigating issues which were raised and ruled upon on direct appeal.
rodriguez has waived the apprendi claim because he failed to raise it before the district court.rodriguez motions to the district court to amend his application to include an apprendi claim do not cure the waiver of this issue because the motions were properly denied due to the fact that they were late and did not relate back to his original petition.rodriguez inability to show that the district court erred in dismissing the motions to amend his motion precludes him from establishing the denial of a constitutional right.therefore,his motion to expand the certificate of appealability is denied.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
this court reviews a district court ruling on ineffective assistance of counsel de novo.kitchen united states,cir.in order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel,a petitioner must show that his attorney performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,strickland washington,d and but for counsel unprofessional errors the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.see also united states zarnes,cir.in terms of the performance prong,j udicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential.strickland,at.only those who can prove under strickland that they have been denied a fair trial by the gross incompetence of their attorneys will be granted the writ kimmelman morrison,d.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.strickland,at.the burden for a defendant is high when he attempts to contend his counsel trial strategy was ineffective because strickland builds in an element of deference to counsel choices in conducting the litigation.holman gilmore,cir.in order to establish prejudice under the second prong,the unprofessional errors of counsel must be so egregious that the trial was rendered unfair and the verdict rendered suspect.morrison,at.
rodriguez argues that he was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel when his attorney advised him that if he testified,his prior convictions could be used to impeach his testimony.rodriguez contends that this advice was incorrect because his prior conviction was inadmissible character evidence under.he maintains that his attorney compounded this error by failing to even argue that issue during a pretrial conference.this argument fails to satisfy either prong of the strickland test.
first,rodriguez can not show that his counsel advice concerning the impeachment value of his prior crime was unreasonable.under,evidence that the accused has been convicted of a crime within ten years of the present offense punishable by more than one year in prison shall be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial value.a,b see,united states mahone,cir holding that prior to admitting evidence of a prior offense to be used for impeachment purposes,judges should hold a hearing on the matter and explicitly find that the prejudicial effect of the evidence will be outweighed by its probative value.some of the factors that a judge should consider in making this determination are the impeachment value of the prior crime the point in time of the conviction and the defendant subsequent history the similarity between the past crime and the charged crime the importance of the defendant testimony and the centrality of the credibility issue.united states smith,cir citing united states hernandez,cir.in this case,rodriguez prior conviction was for possession with intent to distribute mandrax tablets in,and thus,like he charged offense,involves the distribution of illegal drugs.see united states harding,cir noting that the similarity between a prior offense for possession of pounds of marijuana with the present offense of the sale of one gram of cocaine created a strong risk of unfair prejudice.this prior conviction was also an important factor in determining rodriguez credibility if he took the stand.in this case,rodriguez theory of defense was not that he was innocent of drug distribution,but that he did not intend to join the charged conspiracy.thus,if he took the stand,the prior conviction probative value for determining credibility would outweigh its prejudicial value for his propensity to commit the charged crime.see harding,at allowing evidence of a similar prior drug offense for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of the defendant but not for the purpose of showing a propensity to commit the charged offense see also smith,at permitting the introduction of evidence of prior similar crimes as impeachment when credibility was a key issue.therefore,rodriguez can not show that his counsel advice was incorrect,much less unreasonable.
rodriguez relies upon nichols butler,cir,as holding that an attorney improper advice concerning the right to testify can result in ineffective assistance of counsel.however,his reliance on this case is misplaced.in nichols,the court found that a defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel under the strickland factors when his counsel prevented him from testifying in his own defense.id.at.unlike the case at hand,the court found that the attorney in nichols committed prejudicial error when he actually coerced his client not to testify by threatening to withdraw as counsel if he did take the stand.id.at.rodriguez does not assert that his attorney coerced him not to testify,just that his attorney erred in advising him about the consequences of his testimony.
as further evidence of his counsel deficient performance,rodriguez cites a pretrial colloquy between his counsel and the trial court judge where his counsel failed to argue that the circumstances of the two crimes were so similar that the prior crime should be unavailable for impeachment.because of his counsel failure to argue the issue,and his advice not to testify because of the possibility of impeachment with the prior offense,he argues that he did not receive a fair trial because the waiver of his right to testify was unknowing and involuntary,citing united states poe,defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial when he did not testify,because his counsel misinformed him of the consequences of taking the stand.
however,poe does not support rodriguez argument.in poe,the court upheld a trial court rul
