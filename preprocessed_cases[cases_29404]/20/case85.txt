background 
we must accept the state court findings of fact unless convince d by clear and convincing evidence,that they are in error.lynch ficco,cir quoting mccambridge hall,cir en banc.thus,we recount the facts as found by the sjc,and note supplementary facts from the record as such,cir.
damion linton lived with his wife,andrea harvey,at their apartment in cambridge,massachusetts cambridge apartment.linton met latricia carter in january and began a sexual relationship with her on february.he did not tell carter he was married but claimed he had an who had threatened to buy a bottle of pills to do something to herself and make everyone think that he did it to her if he ended the relationship.
on the morning of february,carter was scheduled to complete tests for work at a facility in somerville,massachusetts,near linton apartment.linton and carter made plans for carter to visit him at the cambridge apartment before her tests.when carter arrived,however,she had to ring the doorbell twice and wait in the entryway.carter was about to leave when linton came downstairs,phone conversation.after linton finished the call,carter asked linton why he had finished the conversation in the entryway despite the cold.then she heard a loud sound coming from upstairs.linton told carter,well you know that crazy,crazy girl i told you about,she upstairs.carter returned to her vehicle,which was parked on the street outside the apartment linton followed and got into the passenger seat.the pair began arguing in the truck carter demanding explanations,linton eventually admitting to living with the woman in the apartment and continued until a woman matching harvey description came outside and discovered them.the woman peered through the vehicle open window she exclaimed,oh,my gosh,another woman,and demanded linton return her phone.he did so,then carter drove away with linton in the passenger seat.the pair circled the neighborhood,once passing harvey walking on the street one block from the apartment,before carter let linton out and left.carter arrived at the testing facility at some point before.she completed two tests,then went to work.
carter next heard from linton while at work,around linton claimed he had fought with harvey over carter and had to pack a bag and leave because harvey was threatening to harm herself and frame him.linton asked to stay with carter.she refused.at,according to videotape and bank records,linton withdrew from a cambridge trust atm that was a walk from the cambridge apartment.linton subsequently traveled to new york city,making his way to the port authority bus terminal by,the time at which he telephoned harvey cell phone from a public phone near a gate where a greyhound bus was leaving for north carolina.
on february,linton arrived in north carolina where his brother lived,and applied for a job at the wal mart where his brother worked,explaining to the manager that he was moving to raleigh after a fight with his wife and seeking employment.that day,linton also spoke to harvey parents and harvey by phone.he told harvey that he was calling from north carolina,claiming that he had traveled there to retrieve items his mother had sent from jamaica.linton also told harvey that he had been trying to get in touch with her daughter but had not been able to do so and was worried because she had threatened to harm herself if he left her.he claimed that harvey had previously attempted to harm herself by ingesting some stuff and that he had revived her using a bush remedy.
linton told harvey that he saw harvey the night of february,close to midnight,when he returned to the apartment,and again the next morning before he left the cambridge apartment for north carolina at.he said harvey murmured something when linton spoke to her as he was leaving.shortly thereafter,however,linton told harvey that he did not see harvey on february as she had gone to the grocery store before he woke at and had not returned by the time he left for north carolina at harvey pointed out the contradiction and asked linton if he had harmed harvey he denied doing so.
as a result of linton phone call,and harvey went to the cambridge apartment.the front door was locked,but they were able to gain access with keys from the rental agent.at or around,and harvey discovered their daughter body on a sheet on the floor of the apartment,her cell phone and a cup of water next to her.harvey,who was stiff as a result of rigor mortis,was lying somewhat on her side,in something like a fetal position,dressed in sweats and wrapped to the neck in blankets.the sheet and carpet were stained with body fluids.the temperature in the apartment was set to degrees.harvey called from his cell phone a cambridge police officer arrived minutes later.police found no evidence of forced entry through the front door and no means of entry through the back door,which was blocked.
on february,state police spoke with linton by phone.he told the trooper with whom he spoke that on the evening of february he had argued with harvey in a phone conversation about money and some items he had taken from her.linton claimed harvey was asleep when he came home that evening and that he did not see her the next day before leaving for florida at to visit an aunt.he admitted he had not made plans with his aunt and was unable to offer any details about her or where in florida she was living.linton stated that harvey had asked him to leave,that he locked the apartment,and that he had his keys.he also gave the trooper the first of several conflicting stories about how he got to north carolina 
on february,linton telephoned a friend of harvey and told her that he and harvey got into a fight,and things went bad,and i left.he also called carter and made plans to see her later in the day without mentioning his whereabouts.linton was arrested that evening when he went to work at wal mart.he waived his miranda rights,and,during a interview with police,denied harming harvey and claimed a former boyfriend may have killed her.he admitted that his relationship with harvey had problems,that they argued over bills,and that he had once had a physical fight with harvey during which he grabbed harvey by the back of the neck.the next day,linton called carter,telling her that harvey was dead and that he had been jailed but was not responsible.carter did not hear from linton again until months later,when he called to t ell her not to go to court because if she testified he would go to jail for the rest of his life.
proceedings in the massachusetts superior court 
the commonwealth of massachusetts proceeded against linton in superior court under two murder theories deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty.the commonwealth medical examiner,richard evans,testified that harvey died as a result of manual strangulation.he noted multiple abrasions to the right side of the victim neck below her jaw,consistent with fingernail marks,and a larger bruise on the left side of the victim rib cage that could have been caused by the force of a knee on the victim chest.the abrasions were inflicted while harvey was still alive.evans also testified that the force applied to harvey neck was so strong that it had caused a separation of the hyoid bone at the base of the victim tongue,under the jaw and the resulting circulatory pressure was so intense that it caused extensive bleeding in her eyes.while struggling to breathe,he testified,harvey bit her tongue so hard that she left marks and drew blood.evans estimated that harvey would have been conscious for about ninety seconds of constant or pressure.
evans noted that determining time of death is an inexact science but estimated that harvey died between eight hours up to hours,maybe even slightly beyond hours before police photographed her body on february,based on rigor mortis,decomposition,and lividity.he also testified that while in normal circumstances it would have taken two to three days to reach the state in which the victim body was discovered,because of the high temperature in the apartment,that time had been cut r oughly in half.a forensic dna analyst testified that dna testing of samples from harvey mouth,neck,and vagina did not reveal male dna.scrapings from under harvey fingernails yielded one partial male profile linton could not be excluded as the potential source.
at trial,harvey testified about a september incident when his daughter called him,very upset,pretty much hysterical,to come over and get her.he stated that when he arrived at the cambridge apartment ten minutes later,he found her outside at a payphone,still hysterical and still crying.at her request,harvey testified,he went up to the cambridge apartment and asked linton for her cell phone linton denied having the phone,so harvey returned to his daughter and they left.harvey stated that harvey was still hysterical in the car on the way to his home and that she told him she had fought with linton and he had taken her cell phone,cut the landline connection,and choked her into unconsciousness when she tried to leave the apartment.no more than twenty minutes passed between harvey call to her father,which immediately followed the assault,and her statement 
the jury convicted linton on one count of murder on the theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty under.laws ann.ch.linton,at.linton moved for a new trial his motion was denied.id.at.
proceedings in the massachusetts supreme judicial court 
linton appealed to the sjc,challenging both the conviction and the order of the trial judge denying a new trial.linton,at.he argued that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support the jury verdict and that the sjc should reverse the superior court denial of his motion for a required finding of not guilty.id.in the alternative,linton claimed a new trial was merited because the superior court erred by admitting the victim statements about a previous assault in violation of his right to confront adverse witnesses id.
the sjc affirmed linton conviction and the order denying his motion for a new trial id.at.the sjc applied the state law standard for a denial of a required finding with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence w hether the evidence offered by the commonwealth,together with reasonable inferences therefrom,when viewed in its light most favorable to the commonwealth,was sufficient to persuade a rational jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of every element of the crime charged.id.at quoting commonwealth lao.the sjc noted that the massachusetts standard is consistent with that of jackson virginia,d.id.citing commonwealth latimore.the court concluded that the jury reasonably could have found linton killed harvey based on the lack of forced entry and linton admission he locked the apartment and kept his keys evidence of his actions and movements on february that established a chronology permitt ing the jury to conclude that linton had opportunity motive,given his marital difficulties and extramarital affair the glass of water by harvey body,which could be meant to leave the impression that the victim had died by suicide and the estimated time of death.id.at.a reasonable jury,the sjc added,could also infer that linton did not know where he would sleep the night of february,as he asked carter if he could stay with her.id.
addressing linton related claim that the evidence was not sufficient to support a conviction of murder based on extreme atrocity or cruelty,the sjc noted that a jury must find one or more factors under commonwealth cunneen,to sustain such a conviction.linton,at.as the sjc stated,the cunneen factors are 
whether the defendant was indifferent to or took pleasure in the victim suffering the consciousness and degree of suffering of the victim the extent of the victim physical injuries the number of blows inflicted on the victim the manner and force with which the blows were delivered the nature of the weapon,instrument,or method used in the killing and the disproportion between the means needed to cause death and those employed.
id.at citing cunneen,at.the sjc concluded that,based on evans testimony,a jury reasonably could have found multiple cunneen factors,including indifference to the victim suffering,the victim high degree of conscious suffering,and the overwhelming force applied during the strangulation.linton,at.
in reviewing linton confrontation clause claim,the sjc relied on a state standard it noted to be consistent with crawford washington,d,and davis washington,d,per commonwealth simon,determin ing whether the statement is admissible under our common law of evidence then determin ing whether admission of the statement is prohibited by the confrontation clause sic of the sixth amendment.linton,at quoting commonwealth nesbitt.the sjc found that harvey statement about her attack to her father was admissible under the excited utterance hearsay exception given the nature of the physical attack,its effect on her,and the relatively short amount of time between the assault and her statement to harvey.id.at.further,the sjc found that the statement admission did not violate the confrontation clause,as a reasonable person would not have anticipated that her statements to her father would be used against linton when she did not report the crime to the police or the court and nothing indicated the statement was made for any other purpose than to explain to her father what had happened.id.at.
proceedings in the district court of massachusetts 
linton timely filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.linton,wl,at.he argued,inter alia,that t he admission at trial of statements made by the deceased victim to her father about a prior assault by linton violated linton constitutional right to confront witnesses against him and t he conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence and therefore violated linton constitutional right to due process.id.at.the district court denied habeas relief,id.at,holding that harvey statement to her father about a prior assault by linton was not testimonial and the sjc application of the supreme court confrontation clause precedents was not unreasonable,id.at,and the sjc did not unreasonably apply the jackson standard when it dismissed linton sufficiency of evidence claim n or did the sjc unreasonably apply jackson in finding sufficient evidence to support a conviction based on extreme atrocity or cruelty.id.at.linton filed a notice of appeal and motioned for a certificate of appealability.the district court granted a certificate of appealability with respect to these two claims only.
ii.the habeas framework 
standard of review 
we review the district court denial of habeas relief de novo.sánchez roden,cir.d e novo review encompasses the district court own determination of the appropriate standard of review of the state court proceeding.id.quoting zuluaga spencer,cir.the district court is not entitled to deference.healy spencer,cir.rather,in these cases,we must determine whether the habeas petition should have been granted in the first instance.sánchez,at.
antiterrorism and effective death penalty act standards 
under aedpa,habeas relief 
shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d see hodge mendonsa,cir zuluaga,at.
we have held that an adjudication is on the merits,giving rise to deference under d of aedpa,if there is a decision finally resolving the parties claims,with res judicata effect,that is based on the substance of the claim advanced,rather than on a procedural,or other,ground.yeboah sefah ficco,cir quoting teti bender,cir.a adjudication of an issue framed in terms of state law is nonetheless entitled to deference under section d as long as the state and federal issues are for all practical purposes synonymous and the state standard is at least as protective of the defendant rights as its federal counterpart.foxworth amand,cir.
clearly established federal law 
to determine whether a decision was contrary to supreme court precedent or constituted an unreasonable application of federal law under such precedent per d,this court look s to the supreme court holdings,as opposed to dicta,at the time the state court rendered its decision.hensley roden,cir citing gonzález fuentes molina,cir see thaler haynes,d.federal habeas courts may not look to circuit precedent refin ing or sharpen ing a general principle of supreme court jurisprudence into a specific rule that th e court has not announced.marshall rodgers,d see also lópez smith,d.nor may a federal habeas court canvass circuit decisions to determine whether a particular rule of law is so widely accepted among the federal circuits that it would,if presented to the supreme court,be accepted as correct.marshall.at.
contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law 
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by the supreme court or confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from its precedent.hensley,at quoting gomes brady,cir alterations in original quoting williams taylor,d.and a state court adjudication constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.quoting abrante amand,cir.
for purposes of d,an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.harrington richter,d quoting williams,at.a state court determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court decision.id.quoting yarborough alvarado,d.the more general the rule,the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in determinations.alvarado,at.thus,to obtain federal habeas relief,a petitioner must show the state court ruling on the claim was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.richter,at.
iii.the claims 
sufficiency of the.applicable law 
the parties acknowledge that jackson is the source of the clearly established federal law applicable to the sufficiency claim in the instant case.under jackson,the relevant question is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.at.t he standard must be applied with explicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.id.at.a criminal conviction may be supported by circumstantial evidence alone.id.at see also magraw roden,cir this principle that direct evidence is not required to uphold a conviction is even more firmly established in connection with the deferential approach to decisionmaking that federal habeas review demands.a federal habeas corpus court faced with a record that supports conflicting inferences must presume that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution,and must defer to that resolution.jackson,at.
a federal court reviewing a habeas petition raising a jackson claim must apply a standard.parker matthews,d.a decision rejecting a sufficiency challenge may not be overturned on federal habeas unless the decision was objectively unreasonable.id.quoting cavazos smith,d.in this context,b eyond a reasonable doubt does not require the exclusion of every other hypothesis it is enough that all reasonable doubts are excluded,at alteration in original quoting stewart coalter,cir.where any reasonable jurist would conclude that evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict gives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt and a theory of innocence,however,this court must reverse because equipoise is tantamount to reasonable doubt.id.quoting united states flores rivera,cir magraw,at emphasizing that this rule takes hold only after we have drawn all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict.
as the sjc adjudicated the case on the merits,the district court correctly applied the highly deferential aedpa standard.zuluaga,at.that the sjc applied latimore rather than jackson does not diminish its claim to deference under aedpa,foxworth,at,as the latimore test is functionally identical to the jackson standard.logan gelb,cir.
proceeding accordingly,we find that linton did not prove a contrary to or unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under jackson and thus is not entitled to habeas relief under aedpa.d.
the commonwealth argues that linton insufficiency of evidence identity argument is waived because he did not raise it in his habeas petition.we note that while linton did not raise this argument in the petition itself,he did raise it in the memorandum of law supporting his petition.however,we need not decide if raising an argument in the memorandum of law is sufficient to prevent waiver.even assuming the insufficiency of identity argument has not been waived,it fails on the merits.
the sjc asked the massachusetts version of the relevant question under jackson,and evaluated all available evidence to find support for identity,opportunity,motive,and consciousness of guilt.the abundance of evidence defeats linton efforts to compare this case to commonwealth salemme,in which the sjc stated that a defendant may not be convicted solely on the basis of consciousness of guilt,id.at,and,where this court reversed the district court denial of habeas relief because there was no physical or forensic evidence linking the petitioner to the crime scene the purported motive was inconsistent with the evidence and the petitioner presented compelling evidence that a third party was the actual assailant.at.here,by contrast,ample evidence ties linton to the crime,shows motive,and indicates consciousness of guilt.for example,the apartment in which harvey was found was locked with no sign of forced entry and linton had keys to the apartment.linton was with harvey the morning of the day the murder most likely occurred,february,and a jury could have inferred that he was in the apartment even later,after harvey ceased answering calls to or making calls from her cell phone and within the extended window for time of death evans estimated,based on a call made to his mother at and a video showing him at an atm a walk away from the apartment at that day.days after the murder,linton told one of harvey friends that he and harvey got into a fight,and things went bad,and i left.the murder also appeared to have been staged to suggest harvey killed herself by ingesting something linton had told carter as well as harvey parents that he was concerned harvey would hurt herself.the alternative explanation that an unknown person,or the to whom he alluded during questioning on february,entered the apartment after linton left,killed harvey
