laypersons sometimes do not realize that the federal government and the state governments are separate sovereigns for purposes of criminal prosecutions,and thus that prosecutors from both may pursue charges for conduct covered by both laws.lawyers should know better.to his regret,charles sweeney made this mistake after his lawyer concluded a plea agreement with the attorney office in conjunction with certain charges stemming from the murder of daniel guthrie.the lawyer told sweeney that this agreement,coupled with an alleged oral promise from the state prosecutor office,protected him from any use the state might have made of these statements.the state of indiana thought differently,and based on the information sweeney gave to the federal authorities,it investigated,brought charges,and convicted him for guthrie murder.after exhausting his appeals at the state level,sweeney sought habeas corpus relief on the ground that his attorneys mistaken advice about the alleged agreement amounted to constitutionally ineffective assistance under the fifth amendment to the constitution not the sixth.because no such right has been clearly established by the united states supreme court,we affirm the district court dismissal of sweeney petition.
guthrie never made it home from a fishing trip he took with sweeney on may.authorities in clark county,indiana,began an investigation,with sweeney as the prime suspect.but after more than a year,detectives had failed to turn up any concrete even a body or murder weapon.the investigation quickly revived,however,after sweeney was arrested and indicted on federal charges for placing a pipe bomb underneath the car of the lead detective in the murder investigation.sweeney arrest for the incident,combined with drug possession charges,placed him in federal custody.
on june,sweeney entered into a plea agreement with the attorney office on the charges relating to the pipe bomb.in return for a promised motion for a downward departure under and the dropping of several of the federal charges,sweeney agreed to plead guilty to planting the pipe bomb,to implicate the others who were involved in the incident,and to disclose both the whereabouts of guthrie body and any information relating to the cause of guthrie death.prior to concluding this agreement,sweeney attorneys telephoned the clark county prosecutor and asked if he would grant sweeney use immunity for any statements he made to the federal authorities in connection with the plea agreement.what happened next is the subject of dispute.defense counsel claims that the clark county prosecutor orally promised to grant full use immunity,or at least suggested that he would file a murder charge only if the charge was supported by other evidence.the prosecutor denies that any offer of use immunity was made.
what is clear,at least for our purposes,is that after this conversation,defense counsel advised sweeney that a agreement was carved in stone and that sweeney should take the deal with federal prosecutors and make as complete a statement as he could.four days later,during a june meeting with federal prosecutors and other authorities,sweeney revealed the location of guthrie body and told his version of events,as follows.he and guthrie had indeed gone fishing on may.on the way home from the fishing trip,the two men agreed to swap some of sweeney marijuana plants for a saddle owned by guthrie.upon arriving at sweeney home,sweeney sent guthrie out into the woods with a shovel,two buckets,and a handgun to obtain the plants.meanwhile,sweeney headed into town to play bingo.when guthrie wife telephoned the next morning to inquire about the whereabouts of her husband,sweeney went into the woods to search for guthrie.he found guthrie dead of a gunshot wound to the head.not wanting to risk discovery of his marijuana operation,sweeney buried guthrie body and disposed of his possessions.
with the benefit of this information,the police obtained and executed a search warrant and soon located guthrie body near sweeney property.sweeney knowledge of the location of the body was an important piece of evidence at sweeney subsequent trial for the murder of guthrie.apparently not believing the bingo story,a jury convicted sweeney of murder.sweeney was sentenced to years imprisonment,to be served at the conclusion of his federal sentence for the pipe bomb incident.
our review of sweeney habeas corpus petition is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,which permits a federal court to issue a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court reached a decision on the merits of a claim,and that decision was either contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d see also williams taylor,d brown sternes,cir.whether a state ruling runs afoul of d is a legal determination that we review de novo.schaff snyder,cir.
at the outset,we need to clarify exactly what sweeney is presenting on appeal.the district court considered and rejected three arguments that the failure of the federal authorities to give sweeney miranda warnings before he made his june proffer statement violated his fifth amendment right against compulsory with respect to the subsequent state murder charges see miranda arizona,d that the statements he made to federal authorities in connection with the plea agreement were not voluntary within the meaning of the due process clause because he was not adequately forewarned,whether by federal agents or his own defense counsel,that his statements could be used as evidence against him by the state authorities and that his defense attorneys mistaken advice concerning the alleged agreement rendered sweeney counsel constitutionally ineffective under the fifth amendment.in his brief before this court,however,sweeney presents only the question w hether sweeney counsel provided ineffective assistance when erroneously advising him that he had use immunity and that he should cooperate with the federal government and give a complete statement regarding the murder of daniel guthrie.although other parts of sweeney brief touch upon the miranda and due process claims,it is not clear whether he is trying to pursue those theories independently,or if he instead is mentioning them only in support of his ineffective assistance claim.
it would not help sweeney even if we gave him the benefit of the doubt and treated all three issues as if they were before us,because we agree with the district court that neither the miranda nor the due process claim has any merit.this is so notwithstanding several apparent missteps on the part of the courts that have already reviewed this.for instance,the indiana supreme court and the district court agreed that defense counsel advising of sweeney of his rights prior to his making the june statement to federal fact established by substantial testimony at as a fully effective equivalent to the usual miranda warnings.see miranda,at.no authority of which we are aware holds that a suspect discussions with defense counsel can double for the usual warnings given by law enforcement officers indeed,the contrary whatever warnings are otherwise required by miranda must be administered by the public quite.the effective equivalent language in miranda has been limited to situations in which police officers have botched or otherwise truncated the usual warnings.see,duckworth eagan,d richardson duckworth,cir.
the record here shows unequivocally that sweeney knowingly and voluntarily waived his miranda rights.we evaluate that question in light of the totality of the circumstances.see united states jackson,cir united states smith,cir.in addition,a waiver need not be express,but may be inferred from the defendant of his rights coupled with a course of conduct reflecting his desire to give up his right to remain silent and have the counsel of an attorney.jackson,at internal quotation marks omitted.at least three facts are relevant here sweeney was accompanied by defense counsel at both the june and june meetings he discussed the concept of use immunity with his lawyer prior to those meet
