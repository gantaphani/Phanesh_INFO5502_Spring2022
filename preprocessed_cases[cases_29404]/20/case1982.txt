on september,leonard hinton was convicted of murdering john durham,dorothy mcdaniel,and edward bradley and sentenced to life in prison.the illinois appellate court,on direct appeal,hinton conviction on three counts of murder.hinton responded with the filing of a pro se petition in the circuit court alleging a laundry list of constitutional violations,which was denied and affirmed by the appellate court of illinois.thereafter,hinton filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court alleging that the police obtained his signed confession through physical coercion,abuse and police brutality and claimed that the admission of his confession at trial was a violation of his fifth amendment rights.the district court ruled that hinton fifth amendment claim did not warrant habeas relief concluding that any error arising from the admission of his confession was harmless when one considers that the state produced an overwhelming amount of evidence of his guilt separate and distinct from the confession.we affirm.
background 
in the early morning hours following thanksgiving day in chicago,illinois,john durham,dorothy mcdaniel,and edward bradley were in the kitchen of durham apartment when hinton stopped in to collect a drug debt from durham.according to hinton,after durham refused to pay the debt hinton pulled a loaded revolver from his coat.durham allegedly tried to grab the weapon,and hinton shot him in the chest and head,killing durham.hinton also shot and killed mcdaniel and bradley,striking each of them behind the ear at the base of the skull gangland style.chicago police officers called to the scene found all three victims lying in a pool of blood.
at this time,the officers only lead as to the identity of the murderer came from one of durham neighbors,diane staton,who told police that immediately after hearing shots fired from the direction of durham apartment,shortly after on november,she observed a man with a gun walking backwards out of durham apartment.staton told police that she had viewed the suspect from her upstairs bedroom window across the street from durham apartment.staton went on to explain that the entire area around durham apartment was and she had an opportunity to see the man face when he turned around and looked in her direction as he was fleeing from the scene.staton initial description of the man was that he was black,about,between and pounds and in his.staton subsequently identified hinton as the man she saw that night in a police lineup,as well as in court during the trial.
later that day,november,at about,the police arrived at hinton apartment and,after investigating an unrelated aggravated battery charge,they arrested him,advised him of his miranda rights and conveyed him to area police headquarters area.while hinton was detained on the battery charge,an undisclosed informant gave police information that led them to suspect that hinton was responsible for the three murders.at this time police also became aware that hinton matched the physical description of the person staton had observed exiting durham apartment.armed with this information,the police brought staton to the station and arranged a physical lineup with the suspect,hinton,and four other males similar in age,stature,build and complexion to ascertain whether staton could identify hinton as the person she witnessed exiting the murder scene.upon viewing the lineup,staton identified hinton as the individual she observed standing in durham doorway with a gun in his hand shortly after on the morning of november,
after her positive identification of hinton in the lineup,police once again advised the suspect,hinton,of his miranda rights and proceeded to question him about the triple homicide.in the course of their investigation the officers questioned david dixon,one of hinton associates.dixon denied any involvement in the murders,but revealed that shortly after the murders hinton told him that he had just shot a couple of people and asked dixon to sell his caliber gun.dixon went on to tell the police that,at hinton direction,he had traded the gun to a man he knew named james randall for cocaine.thereafter,the officers questioned randall,who produced the caliber weapon and confirmed that he had received it from dixon.
with the suspected murder weapon in police custody ballistics tests later established that hinton was the murder weapon,the police continued to question hinton about the murders.initially,hinton denied being present at the murder scene and came up with an alibi,telling police and state attorney lori levin levin,who had been called in to take hinton statement,that he was at home playing cards with his family on the evening of the murders.however,hinton family refused to corroborate his fabricated alibi and,after police confronted him with this information,he changed his story and admitted that he was present at the scene of the murders and that he was responsible for the deaths of durham,bradley,and mcdaniel.
following his confession hinton was interviewed for a second time by levin,on november,at,in the presence of a stenographer.during the interview,hinton gave another,this time more detailed confession in which he accepted responsibility for the three murders.however,in this statement hinton attempted to paint an implausible picture as to how the homicides occurred.hinton told levin that he shot and killed durham in self defense during an altercation the two had over a drug debt and that bradley and mcdaniel had been shot accidently.according to hinton,he went to durham house to collect a drug debt,but encountered durham,bradley and mcdaniel when he entered the kitchen to demand his money.durham refused to pay the drug debt and ordered hinton to leave.hinton next stated that he got his loaded caliber gun out of his coat,and cocked it the gun hammer,at which time durham allegedly made an attempt to grab the weapon and the two started fighting.as they struggled,hinton claimed his weapon just went off four times,hitting both mcdaniel and bradley,before he shot durham directly in the chest.after being shot once,hinton recounted that durham staggered to his feet and he hinton shot him again before exiting the house.however,hinton description of events was in sharp contrast to the physical evidence the police discovered about the slayings during their investigation of the crime scene.
after hinton statement was transcribed by the stenographer,levin read the statement aloud to hinton and suggested that he follow along so that he could make any changes that he thought were needed to accurately reflect the content of his transcribed statement.hinton proceeded to read,approve and initial each page and then duly signed the last page of the document.shortly thereafter,hinton was charged with the murders of durham,mcdaniel,and bradley,and entered a plea of not guilty to each count.hinton then filed a pretrial motion to suppress his written confession statement given to levin,claiming that it was involuntary because it was the product of police brutality.
suppression hearing 
the trial judge held a hearing on june,in response to hinton motion to suppress.during the hearing,hinton testified on direct examination that he was repeatedly physically abused and assaulted by police officers during the nearly hours he was in custody before he gave his confession.he alleged that while he was handcuffed to a wall in the interrogation room,officers repeatedly kicked him in the stomach,slapped him in the face,and punched him in the head.hinton further stated that,at one point during his confinement,officers placed a plastic bag over his head and deprived him of air,denied him water and food,and prohibited him from using the bathroom for a period of eighteen hours.hinton testified that he finally yielded to the police officers demands and gave a confession statement to levin only after officers had escorted him down to the basement of the police station and applied an electric shock rod to his genitals and his said he confessed to the three murders within a short period of time after this episode allegedly occurred.however,when questioned on about whether he had truly sustained any injuries from the alleged assaults,hinton admitted that he was not bleeding nor did he have any bruises on his body after allegedly being assaulted,hit in the head and kicked in the stomach repeatedly.nonetheless,hinton went on to state that after one officer allegedly struck him on the chin,he did have a laceration on his face that bled onto the jersey he was wearing at the time later in the suppression hearing,the prosecutors asked hinton whether the statement he had given to levin concerning the murders was fabricated.hinton replied that he made up the whole confession statement,and that he was never there at the scene of the murder s.
after hinton finished testifying,the state called a number of rebuttal witnesses,including a jon burge of the chicago police department,the officer in charge of the area precinct at the time of hinton arrest and interrogation,who testified that he had neither threatened nor assaulted hinton at any time,nor had he witnessed any other officer assault hinton.additionally,police officers leonard bajenski,thomas kripple,and patrick of whom were present during hinton that they had neither struck nor assaulted him,nor did they threaten him in any manner at any time before,during,or after his questioning.the officers further testified that,although hinton was detained on the aggravated battery charge for nearly two days before he was charged with the murders,he was questioned about the murders on only five occasions,and each period of questioning only lasted between ten and minutes.during the remaining time hinton was in custody while the officers questioned witnesses and continued to investigate the crime scene,the officers stated that hinton was allowed to sleep if he wished and that he was fed and given soda on several occasions.
assistant state attorney levin likewise testified at the suppression hearing that,after she had properly mirandized hinton,he acknowledged that he understood each and every one of his miranda rights,and that he wished to speak to her about the murders.in addition,levin stated that,at no time during the interview nor at any other time,did hinton complain to her about any physical abuse,nor did he request counsel.levin further stated that,after hinton gave his statement admitting responsibility for the murders,the statement was transcribed and read aloud to him,and he was given an opportunity to review it in typewritten form before he initialed and approved each page and signed the last page.when levin was asked if hinton had given her any reason as to why he finally decided to give the confession,levin said that hinton had told her that he had thought about what had happened and that he wanted to tell the truth.
after hearing and weighing the conflicting accounts presented by hinton and the state witnesses,the trial judge concluded that the testimony and evidence adduced at the suppression hearing presented a credibility question and that,based on what he heard and the demeanor of the witnesses and the like,and the evidence presented,hinton motion to suppress should be denied.after the judge denied the motion,hinton waived his right to a jury trial,the judge accepted the waiver and the case proceeded to a trial before the court.
bench trial 
hinton trial commenced on july,less than a month after the suppression hearing.hinton chose to testify in his own defense and offered testimony that was similar in all material respects to the pretrial confession he had given to levin,and once again he implausibly claimed to have fired his weapon at the victims in.as in his confession statement,hinton admitted that he went to durham house the night of the murders to collect a drug debt,and during an ensuing altercation with durham concerning the debt,the two wrestled over his caliber weapon.as the two struggled over control of the gun,hinton claimed that durham made me pull the trigger three times,striking durham,mcdaniel,and bradley.hinton stated further that following his struggle with durham,he shot him twice or three times and ran out of the door of the apartment.when questioned on,hinton acknowledged that after he left the murder scene he asked dixon to sell the caliber gun used in the shootings and further stated that the confession he gave to the assistant state attorney implausibly claiming that the shootings were in was an accurate account of what occurred the night of the murders.
the evidence and testimony presented by the state,however,overwhelmingly established hinton guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to each and every element of the murders charged.the state evidence conclusively proved that hinton actions on the night of the murders were not taken in,but instead were voluntarily and wilfully committed act s,the natural result of which was to cause death or great bodily harm to durham,mcdaniel and bradley.people lee,d.diane staton assisted in providing identification testimony linking hinton to the murders,testifying that,just after she heard five shots fired from the direction of durham apartment on the night of the murders,she looked out her bedroom window and saw an individual matching hinton physical description walking backwards out of durham apartment with a gun in his hand,and that she was able to get a good look at the suspect when he turned around and turned directly toward her.staton then reaffirmed the positive identification she made of hinton in the police lineup at area the morning after the murders.when asked at trial to identify the individual she had identified in the police lineup from the witness stand,staton pointed to hinton.
the state presented additional testimony and evidence linking hinton to the murder weapon as well as the murders themselves.david dixon testified that,as he had told the police during the course of the investigation,approximately two hours after the murders hinton stated that he had just shot a person who owed him money,and furthermore that he had to shoot a couple of people.dixon went on to state that hinton had told him that he had gone to durham house to rob him.according to dixon,hinton,after the murders,asked dixon to sell his caliber pistol the gun that the police subsequently tracked down and,after testing and examination,established as the murder weapon.dixon next stated that he later sold the gun to a man named james randall.the state corroborated dixon testimony concerning the sale of the murder weapon to randall with the testimony of detective thomas kripple of the chicago police department,who recounted that after questioning randall concerning the whereabouts of the caliber weapon he received from dixon,randall delivered the weapon to kripple at the area station.the state also submitted hinton signed statement given to levin in which he confessed to having fired the weapon that killed durham,bradley and mcdaniel in support of its theory that hinton had indeed committed the three murders charged.additionally,the state presented the testimony of two forensic medical examiners and a ballistics expert who each identified the caliber weapon brought to the station as having been used in the triple murders charged to hinton 
the state also presented testimony from the state medical examiners,choi and beamer,about the victims causes of death and the location of their gunshot wounds.the doctors testimony made clear that the murders were carried out in a manner completely contradictory to that of hinton recitation that he had shot the three victims in.indeed,both choi and beamer testimony established that the murders were carried out in a vicious and methodical manner,with all three victims being shot in the head at close range 
after weighing the totality of the evidence against hinton,the judge rejected his implausible explanation that he had shot the victims in and found hinton guilty of having intentionally murdered durham,mcdaniel and bradley.see,ch,a.after the filing of the report and the sentencing hearing,the judge sentenced hinton to concurrent terms of life imprisonment as to each count,without the possibility of parole.hinton appealed his convictions and the sentences imposed,but did not appeal the trial court denial of his motion to suppress.
proceedings 
after an unsuccessful direct appeal,hinton filed a petition in the circuit court of cook county,claiming that the chicago police had violated his fifth amendment protection against by illegally coercing his confession.according to his petition,police officers coerced him into confessing to the murders by allegedly physically beating and electrocut ing him.in support of his claim,hinton presented court documents,published reports,court opinions and newspaper articles detailing complaints by other criminal detainees who claimed that they had also been physically assaulted and coerced into giving confessions by police officers while confined at area including burge the officer in charge at the time of hinton interrogation.see,people hobley,people wilson.
included in hinton presentation were the february findings of the chicago police board investigation into allegations of police abuse at area concerning the time frame in question.the report concluded that burge should be separated from the police department as a result of his improper treatment of a murder suspect andrew wilson,see people wilson.hinton requested an evidentiary hearing in order to develop this evidence that his confession was the product of police coercion.
the circuit judge dismissed hinton petition after concluding that hinton evidence of police brutality at area did not entitle him to an evidentiary hearing.the judge concluded that the evidence hinton presented in his petition was insufficient to demonstrate any likelihood that his confession was coerced.furthermore,the judge,after reviewing all of the testimony,found that hinton had failed to present sufficient evidence that he was physically injured in a manner consistent with police brutality,and had not provided a scintilla of direct evidence to suggest that the police officers who testified at his suppression hearing gave perjurious testimony when they denied that they had physically abus ed hinton during his custody.hinton appealed the circuit court decision,and the state appellate court affirmed the judgment.thereafter the illinois supreme court denied review.
subsequently,hinton filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court,claiming that the admission of his confession at trial violated his fifth amendment protection against because he had been forcibly coerced into giving it.hinton requested,but was denied,an evidentiary hearing to allow him to develop his claim that his evidence of police abuse at area demonstrated that his confession was coerced.see townsend sain,d,overruled on other grounds by keeney,d.the district court concluded that even if hinton confession was coerced and thus should not have been admitted at trial,the judge decision to allow it in evidence was harmless in view of the overwhelming evidence of guilt the state had introduced,independent of the confession.accordingly,the district court denied hinton petition for habeas relief.hinton appealed,and we granted a certificate of to consider whether hinton confession should have been admitted at trial,and whether its admission prejudiced his defense.
ii.analysis 
our review of the state courts adjudication of hinton alleged involuntary confession claim is governed by the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.codified at under the aedpa,a state prisoner who petitions for a writ of habeas corpus must establish that the state courts adjudication of his case was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.we review these questions de novo.schaff snyder,cir.
hinton argues that the illinois courts application of clearly established federal law governing the voluntariness of confessions,see miller fenton,d,to the facts of his case was unreasonable see d.he posits that he presented the state courts with sufficient evidence concerning alleged abusive police conduct at the chicago police department area to demonstrate that his confession was coerced and thus should not have been admitted at his trial.
hinton faces an uphill battle as he did in the three other courts to render a decision on the same facts in his attempt to convince us that the trial judge decision to admit his confession was in error.the only evidence that hinton produced at his suppression hearing in support of his coerced confession claim was his own statements and testimony.however,he failed to corroborate his allegations of the physical abuse that he alleged he sustained with any evidence such as eyewitness reports,medical records,photographs,in support thereof,see wilson city of chicago,cir.indeed,his failure to produce any corroborating eyewitness testimony,medical records or supporting evidence at the suppression hearing,dealing with the injuries he alleges he sustained while in custody,significantly undermines his involuntary confession claim.see mahaffey schomig,cir.because hinton failed to offer any evidence at the suppression hearing aside from his own testimony,he presented the trial judge with a clear question of the credibility of the witnesses,which was properly resolved in the state favor.on habeas review,we are required to accord credibility determinations by a state trial court a presumption of correctness,and we can only disturb the court conclusions if hinton demonstrates with clear and convincing evidence that its determinations were erroneous.see e sprosty buchler,cir.
however,we need not determine if the evidence hinton presented regarding abusive police practices at the area station is sufficient to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the trial court credibility determinations were erroneous,because any potential error caused by the admission of his confession was harmless in light of the wealth of evidence of his guilt,separate and distinct from his confession.see,hopkins cockrell,cir johnson cain,cir.even were we to assume that hinton confession was coerced and should not have been admitted at trial,he is only entitled to habeas relief if the state court admission of his allegedly coerced confession actually caused his custody.aleman sternes,cir.however,if the constitutional error alleged on the part of the state court did not cause hinton custody,then the error is harmless and the writ should not issue.id.this court has previously held that the harmless error doctrine applies to alleged coerced confessions.arizona fulminante,d united states alwan,cir.when applying the harmless error doctrine on collateral review,we may only grant hinton petition for a writ of habeas if we conclude that the admission of his confession had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict,which it did not.brecht abrahamson,d quoting kotteakos united states.see also aleman,at holding that the brecht standard applies on federal collateral review,even after passage of the aedpa.
hinton somehow contends that without the confession,the trial court would have been reluctant to convict him and also argues that the trial court admission of his confession was not harmless.aside from the confession,hinton claims the state had no evidence that linked him to the crime except for the testimony of diane staton and david dixon,which hinton attempts to characterize as weak and unreliable.we disagree and conclude that the trial court would have convicted him even if the confession were not introduced at trial due to the wealth of other corroborating evidence that the state produced which established hinton guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
hinton himself provided much of the evidence that the state needed to establish his guilt.at trial,hinton voluntarily took the witness stand and admitted that,on the night of the murders,he went to durham house armed with a loaded caliber pistol and fired five shots killing durham,mcdaniel,and bradley.hinton also bolstered any weakness or unreliability in staton testimony by corroborating staton identification of him when admitting that he was the gu
