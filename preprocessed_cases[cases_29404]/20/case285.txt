damon brown is a state prisoner convicted of armed assault with intent to murder and related charges arising out of a shooting spree that left several people injured during a caribbean festival in boston in.his conviction was affirmed on appeal.commonwealth blake.brown filed a federal petition for habeas corpus,which was denied by the district court.petitioner brown,ably represented,presents two issues,challenging the determinations of the supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc as contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court constitutional precedent.d supp.ii.
brown first attack is on the sjc rejection of his constitutional challenge,based on bruton united states,d,to the admission of testimony from two codefendants.his second attack is on the sjc determination that there was adequate evidence to support his conviction of assault with intent to murder in light of what he claims is inadequate evidence as to one of the two theories of conviction.two theories had been argued by the prosecution that brown was a principal shooter and that,in any event,he participated in a joint venture with others in the shootings.the sjc rejected brown argument that there was insufficient evidence of joint venture,and so rejected his argument that he was entitled to a new trial under the massachusetts rule established in commonwealth plunkett,holding that,if there is insufficient evidence to support one theory in an alternative theory murder conviction,then the defendant is entitled to a new trial.plunkett,as the opinion acknowledges,id.at,is more than the parallel federal rule established in griffin united states,d,which holds that no new trial is required on a conspiracy conviction where there is insufficient evidence on one object,but adequate evidence on other objects,id.at.brown asserts that the supreme judicial court factual determination was unreasonable,that a reasonable determination required use of the plunkett rule,and that the state failure,in turn,to apply the state plunkett rule violates his federal due process rights.
we affirm the denial of habeas relief.
the evidence at trial,taken favorably to the conviction,shows brown fired into the celebrating crowd after he attempted to snatch a gold chain from the neck of a man at the festival in the dorchester neighborhood of boston.as his victim pulled away,brown pulled out an automatic pistol and started shooting at him.two others,friends of brown,also started shooting,scattering the crowd.several people were wounded in the shooting.
brown was tried along with two codefendants who were charged with shooting into the crowd after brown began firing.brown defense was that this was a case of misidentification.the defense was not strong the first victim and at least one witness to the shootings knew brown from high school and identified him.the defense countered this by questioning the reliability of eyewitness identification in the confusion of the crowd.
brown codefendants,rentas and blake,did not testify at trial,but their statements to the grand jury were introduced as evidence against rentas and blake.in those statements,the codefendants said that,on the evening in question,they,along with brown,were at a birthday party at rentas apartment,which was located near the site of the shooting.according to the codefendants confused and somewhat contradictory statements,brown was at the party from approximately seven in the evening until somewhere between eight and ten at night.the shooting took place,approximately,shortly after eight.
the commonwealth had argued two different theories to the jury in support of the assault with intent to murder charges that brown was himself a principal shooter and that brown was a joint venturer with blake and rentas.the jury was properly instructed as to both theories.it was also instructed not to use the statements made by one codefendant as evidence of guilt of a different defendant.the jury verdict of guilt on assault with intent to murder did not specify the theory or theories relied upon.
on appeal to the sjc,brown argued that the admission at trial of the statements of his codefendants violated his right to confront witnesses against him granted by the sixth amendment to the united states constitution,as articulated in bruton,d.in bruton,the supreme court held that a nontestifying codefendant confession that directly inculpated another defendant by name could not be admitted at trial,and the confrontation clause problem was not cured by a clear instruction to the jury to consider the statement only as evidence against the codefendant.id.at.addressing brown bruton claim,the sjc observed that a codefendant statement which becomes incriminating only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial,however,generally does not offend the sixth amendment,so long as an adequate limiting instruction is given.blake,at quoting richardson marsh,d.therefore,the sjc held that bruton did not apply because the evidence did not expressly implicate brown in the shooting and was even exculpatory.id.at.
brown also argued he was entitled to a new trial under plunkett because there was not sufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict under the joint venture theory.the sjc rejected that based on its review of the record.the court noted that e vidence of a prior agreement between brown and the others is not required because brown continued firing after being joined by others supports the inference that they shared the intent to aid each other and noted that brown was seen fleeing the scene with the others.id.at.brown also now argues,as he did in the district court and in his petition for rehearing to the sjc,that the failure to apply plunkett constitutes a due process violation.however,he did not make this argument in his initial filings with the sjc.nonetheless,the commonwealth has not argued either waiver or a failure to exhaust,but has addressed the claim on the merits and so shall we.
a habeas petition may not be granted unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.a state court holdings on factual issues shall be presumed to be correct and the petitioner bears the burden of disproving factual holdings by clear and convincing evidence.e.
the unreasonable application prong under d reduces to the question of whether the state court derivation of a rule from the supreme court jurisprudence on the point appears to be objectively reasonable.the test is not so stringent as to require that all reasonable jurists agree the state court decision was unreasonable.see williams taylor,d hurtado tucker,cir rejecting state prisoner habeas application based on insufficiency of evidence claim.
the sjc decision does not discuss brown due process claim,since,as noted above,brown did not raise this claim until his petition for rehearing.in the absence of reasoning on a holding from the state court on the issue,we can not say the claim was adjudicated on the merits within the meaning of d.therefore,we review the due process issue de novo as we can hardly defer to the state court on an issue that the state court did not address.fortini murphy,cir.
bruton issue 
the parties hold fundamentally different views as to the reach of bruton.bruton granted a new trial,finding error in the admission in a joint trial of a nontestifying codefendant confession which directly implicated the defendant.at.the court held this violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the constitution,even though the jury had been instructed not to consider the codefendant statement on the issue of the defendant own guilt.id.at.
the commonwealth takes the position that the alibi evidence from the codefendants was exculpatory on its face,that the sjc was correct in so viewing it,and that bruton does not apply to codefendants statements which appear to be exculpatory.the real question,initially,is not whether the statement i
