this is an appeal by kenneth lee from an order of the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he had failed to exhaust available state court remedies.lee contends that we must excuse the exhaustion requirement because of the delay in his collateral proceedings in the pennsylvania state courts.we agree.we therefore reverse the order of the district court and remand the case for consideration of lee habeas petition on the merits.
if william shakespeare were to summarize lee experience with the pennsylvania state courts,he might describe it as a tale told by an idiot,full of sound and fury,signifying nothing.william shakespeare,macbeth,act,sc,lines.the epic begins on april,when a jury convicted lee of possession of cocaine,possession with intent to deliver cocaine and resisting arrest.on june,lee was sentenced by the court of common pleas of allegheny county to years imprisonment followed by five years of probation.after an unsuccessful direct appeal,lee filed a pro se petition under the pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra on february.ann.et.in his pcra petition,lee raised five arguments the trial judge abused his discretion in denying a motion to suppress the trial judge wrongfully denied a motion to arrest judgment one of the jurors was biased because of his employment with the allegheny county court of common pleas the evidence did not support a conviction and the trial judge wrongfully lee in front of the jury.most of these arguments have never been considered on the merits by any court.
on february,a pcra counsel was appointed for lee.on may,after hearing nothing from the court,lee filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the same court.this petition was denied because the pcra petition was pending.on june,pcra counsel requested that he be relieved as counsel since lee wanted to represent himself.this request was granted.on june,the court ordered lee to provide notice of whether he intended to pursue his pcra petition pro se.the order noted that if lee failed to provide notice within thirty days,the petition would be dismissed.
for reasons unknown to this court,lee did not respond to this order.in january,lee was still awaiting a decision on his pcra petition,so he filed a motion for relief disposition without hearing.in this application,lee reiterated the jury bias claim,but did not reassert the other claims he had made in the pcra petition.on february,the court dismissed lee motion for relief disposition without hearing,explaining that lee had waived the right to challenge the juror by not raising the issue earlier.on august,eighteen months after lee submitted the pcra petition,the court dismissed that petition for the sole reason that lee had failed to indicate whether he would proceed pro se.on august,lee appealed this dismissal.
on march,eighteen months after this appeal,the superior court of pennsylvania vacated the august,order of the lower court because the court of common pleas had failed to provide notice of intent to dismiss the pcra petition,notice of the reasons for dismissal and an opportunity for lee to respond before dismissal.the superior court also noted that lee had made clear his intent to proceed pro se long before the court of common pleas dismissed his petition.app.vol.ii at 
on august,five months later,the court of common pleas issued a new opinion in response to the ruling of the superior court.this new opinion,however,mistakenly did not address the pcra petition,but instead addressed only the motion for relief disposition without hearing,which it had already dismissed.nonetheless,the court concluded its opinion by ordering that the pcra petition be dismissed within twenty days unless lee could show cause why the court should rule otherwise.within that deadline,lee filed a response in which he reiterated the five claims in his original pcra petition and also added an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.on september,the trial court dismissed the pcra petition without further comment.
lee filed a timely appeal on october.the case was not submitted for a panel review in the superior court until almost three years later,in september of.according to the superior court the delay occurred because i nexplicably,the trial court record was not filed in this court until april.id.at.on march,almost six months after the case had been submitted for review,the superior court issued its decision.the superior court noted that t he procedural history in this case is torturous and called it an ongoing odyssey of litigation.id.at.nonetheless,instead of deciding the pcra petition on the merits or directing the court of common pleas to do so,the superior court remanded the case to the court of common pleas to determine whether lee was still serving his sentence 
on june,lee filed a third amendment to the pcra petition,attempting to highlight the fact that no court had addressed his claims.the commonwealth moved to dismiss this application contending that lee had served his sentence in full.on july,the commonwealth withdrew this motion when it realized that lee was still serving his sentence.on february,almost a year after the remand,the court of common pleas reinstated its september,order.lee appealed this decision to the superior court,which has not yet ruled on his appeal.
on june,lee filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court.in that petition,lee alleged ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial and appellate level,denial of due process,denial of fair trial,denial of equal protection and prosecutorial misconduct.lee also filed a brief explaining his failure to exhaust state remedies.on september,the district court dismissed the habeas petition for failure to exhaust state remedies.at the time of this appeal,lee was serving probation which was scheduled to end on october.
under ordinary circumstances,a federal court may not entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus unless the petitioner has first presented each of his claims to the state highest tribunal.see b,c rose lundy,d.exhaustion,however,is not a jurisdictional matter but a matter of comity.see story kindt,cir.federal courts need not defer to the state judicial process when there is no appropriate remedy at the state level or when the state process would frustrate the use of an available remedy.b b.we have held that inexcusable or inordinate delay by the state in processing claims for relief may render the state remedy effectively unavailable.wojtczak fulcomer,cir.the existence of an inordinate delay does not automatically excuse the exhaustion requirement,but it does shift the burden to the state to demonstrate why exhaustion should still be required.story,at noting that this burden is difficult to meet.
in the past,we have excused the exhaustion requirement for petitioners who have undergone significantly shorter delays than presented here.wojtczak,month delay between filing pcra and habeas petitions burkett cunningham,cir five year delay in sentencing united states ex rel.senk brierley,cir three and a half year delay united states ex rel.geisler walters,cir stating in dicta that three years and four months to decide a motion for a new trial was an inordinate delay sufficient to obviate the exhaustion requirement.the government attempts to distinguish this precedent by noting that these cases were inactive for years,no hearings,decisions,while in lee case there has been a great deal of movement.gov br.at.the same,however,can be said for a grand mal seizure.unfortunately,in both cases,the movement is painful and aimless.
it took the lower court eighteen months to dismiss lee petition for the sole procedural reason that lee failed to officially state whether he intended to proceed pro se.it then took another eighteen months for the superior court to vacate that order and remand the petition.when the lower court finally decided the petition on the merits,it decided the wrong petition.due to what appears to be an administrative error or a string of such errors,the record was not available to the appellate court
