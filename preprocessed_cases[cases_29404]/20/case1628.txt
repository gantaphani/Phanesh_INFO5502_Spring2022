a michigan jury convicted aaron leigh cyars petitioner on two counts of premeditated murder.comp.laws ann.a,one count of assault with intent to commit murder,id,and one count of possessing a firearm during the commission of a felony,id.b.the michigan court of appeals affirmed.people cyars,wl,unpublished.the michigan supreme court and united states supreme court denied review.
petitioner subsequently filed an application for habeas corpus in the district court pursuant to petitioner asserted,among other things,he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to proffer a limiting instruction on the jury use of impeachment statements.the district court denied the petition.we granted a certificate of appealability,see c,on the limited issue of whether petitioner was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.applying the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act highly deferential standard for reviewing decisions,see woodford visciotti,d per curiam,we affirm because the michigan court of appeals reasonably applied the correct principle governing ineffective assistance of counsel claims to the facts of petitioner case.
petitioner used and dealt crack cocaine during the summer of.he sold crack primarily for two individuals,known on the streets as rob and lucky or batman and robin.petitioner rolled,distributed drugs out of a house on asbury park street asbury house in west detroit.veronica taylor resided in the asbury house however,rob and lucky rented the house from taylor to use as a crack house.petitioner earned roughly a day,less the cost of any drugs used on the job,for his services.
petitioner lost and a handgun rob and lucky fronted him in july.rob and lucky were not pleased.lucky informed petitioner he would have to work at the asbury house for seven days to pay for the lost money and three days to pay for the handgun.petitioner went to the asbury house around midnight on august,to commence work.petitioner met thomas lewis on the porch.lewis,a known henchman for rob and lucky,supervised the activities at the asbury house.once inside,lewis moved a refrigerator to block the house front door.the refrigerator served as a barricade to slow law enforcement officers in the event of a raid.all of the house windows had bars save the window in taylor room.the house backdoor was also inaccessible.
shortly after entering the house,lewis put petitioner to work selling drugs.lewis told taylor to page rob and lucky.petitioner was scared of what might happen when they arrived.rob and lucky never showed,but leatha christon arrived at the asbury house sometime after christon had arranged to engage in sexual intercourse with lewis in exchange for crack.petitioner let christon into the house and then,by himself,moved the refrigerator back across the front door.lewis gave petitioner a bag of crack to sell while he was in the bedroom with christon after lewis and christon consummated their transaction,petitioner again moved the refrigerator,by himself,to let christon out of the house.the record is silent as to whether petitioner moved the refrigerator back across the front door after he let christon out of the asbury house.
nimrod lumpkin arrived at the asbury house around.the refrigerator was not blocking the front door when he arrived.he went straight to taylor bedroom where they smoked marijuana and crack.lumpkin was not aware anyone else was in the house.meanwhile,petitioner was in the house other bedroom selling crack out of a barred window to customers.lewis was lying on his stomach on a bed in the same room facing petitioner.a handgun was on the bed next to lewis.
petitioner sold the crack for approximately per rock.after petitioner sold a or so worth of crack,he would give the money to lewis who in turn would supply him with more crack.lewis,however,fell asleep after about an hour of work.petitioner then got up,grabbed lewis gun,and shot lewis once in the back of the head.shortly thereafter,taylor yelled what that petitioner cracked the door to taylor room and said lewis was playing with a gun.petitioner then immediately entered the room with the handgun pointed at taylor who was moving toward her window and saying,repeatedly,aaron do do it.petitioner shot taylor in the back of the head.lumpkin,however,was able to kick the gun as petitioner turned and fired in his direction.the kick redirected the shot into lumpkin arm and leg.petitioner fired again,but was out of bullets.petitioner left the room and exited the house through its front door.lumpkin never heard any appliances being moved after petitioner left taylor room 
petitioner never called the police or any paramedics after leaving the asbury house.instead,petitioner visited two groups of friends and explained to them how he killed two individuals.he showed one friend,james morrison,the gun and crack he took from the house.later,petitioner discarded the gun in a field and the crack in the sewer.the detroit police department arrested petitioner.he confessed to shooting lewis,taylor,and lumpkin after waiving his miranda rights.
petitioner claimed at trial.the state called,among others,james morrison,don bailey,and todd cyars to testify in its.james morrison was petitioner friend.during the homicide investigation,and at the preliminary hearing,morrison made the following statement 
petitioner said,man,i shot veronica taylor,stormy thomas lewis and another basehead.man,i popped stormy in the head one time.i shot veronica somewhere in the chest.i shot the other guy all over the place.
at trial,morrison first testified he was honest with the police during the homicide investigation and when he testified at the preliminary hearing.as the state examination of morrison proceeded,however,his memory faded and he ultimately testified n one of those statements c a me out of my mouth.joint app.at.the state impeached morrison with the signed statement he gave police and the preliminary hearing transcript.
the state also called don bailey,an acquaintance of petitioner.the detroit police interviewed bailey during the homicide investigation.bailey gave the police a signed statement in which bailey said petitioner told him that a fter he shot thomas lewis,he shot the other two people because they were witnesses.joint app.at.at trial,the state asked bailey if he made this statement.bailey denied making the statement,and then later admitted making the statement,but attributed it to a person other than petitioner.
the state also called petitioner brother,todd cyars.during the homicide investigation,todd cyars gave a signed statement to the police.todd cyars informed the police petitioner stated prior to the murders he was thinking about sticking up the asbury house and taking the dope and,after the murders,stated i did it.i did what i said i was going to do.joint app.at trial,todd cyars admitted making the statements to the police,but denied their truth and claimed they were the product of a coercive custodial interrogation.
after morrison testimony on direct examination,petitioner counsel asked for a limiting instruction regarding the state impeachment of morrison.specifically,counsel asked for an instruction providing that impeachment testimony did not constitute substantive proof of the matters asserted,but instead went to the believability of the witness.the trial judge responded that he had never given such an instruction and was not going to give it from the hips.joint app.the judge instructed petitioner counsel to prepare an instruction and,afterwards,he would be glad to look at the proposed instruction and give it at an appropriate time.petitioner counsel never renewed his request for a limiting instruction,nor provided the judge a proposed instruction.the court consequently never instructed the jury on the proper use of impeachment statements.after the court final jury charge,petitioner counsel stated t he defendant thinks the jury has been appropriately instructed.joint app.at.
the writ of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitutional rights.slack mcdaniel,d.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings,however,severely circumscribes a federal court ability to grant the writ.lindh murphy,d.congress enacted aedpa i n the interest of finality,cockrell,d,to reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences,woodford garceau,d,to prevent federal habeas retrials,and to ensure that convictions are given effect to the extent possible under law.bell cone,d.aedpa is thus premised on judge learned hand observation that,if courts are to survive as an institution,they can not become penelopes,forever engaged in unravelling the webs they wove.jorgensen york ice mach,cir.to these ends,provides in relevant part 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.
petitioner concedes,as he must,d unreasonable application clause governs the disposition of his case aplt br.at.a federal habeas court may grant relief under the unreasonable application clause if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case.cone,at.the court has repeatedly stressed that i n order for a federal court to find a state court application of its precedent unreasonable,the state court decision must have been more than incorrect or erroneous.wiggins smith,d.instead,the state court application of clearly established law must be objectively unreasonable.id.
a federal habeas court,therefore,may not grant the writ simply because,in its independent review of the legal question,it is left with a firm conviction that the state court was erroneous.lockyer andrade,d.quite the opposite,as the court recently clarified,the range of reasonable judgment can depend in part on the nature of the relevant rule.yarborough alvarado,d.specifically,a pplying a general standard to a specific case can demand a substantial element of judgment.as a result,evaluating whether a rule application was unreasonable requires considering the rule specificity.the more general the rule,the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in case by case determinations.id.the federal habeas scheme thus vests state courts with the primary responsibility of determining whether a particular defendant constitutional rights were violated and,a federal court may only intervene in that judgment when the decision is objectively unreasonable.visciotti,at.
petitioner argues on appeal habeas relief is appropriate because the michigan court unreasonably applied supreme court precedent to his ineffective assistance claim.petitioner specifically argues the michigan court erred in holding he did not suffer any prejudice as a result of his counsel failure to proffer a limiting instruction on the statements used to impeach the state witnesses at trial.see cyars,wl,at.
the sixth amendment provides a criminal defendant with the right to effective assistance of counsel because of the effect the right has on a defendant ability to receive a fair trial.mickens taylor,d.the benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial can not be relied on as having produced a just result.strickland washington,d.consequently,defects in assistance that have no probable effect upon the trial outcome do not establish a constitutional violation.mickens,at.whether a constitutional violation occurred as a result of counsel assistance is determined under the familiar strickland test first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.strickland,at.we assume without deciding petitioner satisfied the first prong.see id.at.explaining i f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice,that course should be followed.
the issue,then,is whether the michigan court rejection of petitioner ineffective assistance claim was an unreasonable application of strickland prejudice prong.to demonstrate prejudice,t he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.aedpa circumscribes our review of the michigan court conclusion that petitioner did not suffer any prejudice.wiggins.in fact,d demands that the decision be given the benefit of the doubt.visciotti,at.
the michigan court reasonably applied strickland prejudice prong to the facts of petitioner case.the court explained that b ecause the weight and strength of the untainted evidence presented in this case overwhelmingly supports defendant convictions,and because the error is relatively innocuous indeed,it was not error for the prior inconsistent statements to be put before the jury,only that the jury could not consider those statements as substantive evidence,we conclude that defendant was not prejudiced in this regard.cyars,wl,at emphasis added.we agree.the state had the burden of proving petitioner intentional killing of the victims was deliberate and premeditated.people coddington.premeditation and deliberation may be inferred from the facts and circumstances established on the record.id.circumstantial evidence demonstrating premeditation includes,but is not limited to the prior relationship of the parties,defendant actions before the killing,the circumstances,including the wound location,of the killing,and defendant conduct after the killing.see also people anderson.premeditation and deliberation require sufficient time to allow the defendant to take a second look.id.
the record overwhelmingly supports the jury first degree murder verdicts,as the michigan court held,even without considering the statements used to impeach morrison,bailey,and todd cyars.a reasonable jury could infer petitioner knew,from past experience,nefarious activities would be afoot during his visit to the crack house on august.the jury could also infer petitioner formulated a plan to kill lewis as he distributed drugs from the house backroom window.indeed,petitioner claim that he was scared of rob and lucky arrival at the asbury house was undermined by the fact he could have left the house while lewis was with christon,but instead opted to stay and sell drugs.petitioner sat patiently until lewis fell asleep and then got up,stole his gun,and shot him in the back of the head.a jury could reasonably infer petitioner had the opportunity to take a second look before he executed lewis in his sleep.
a reasonable jury,moreover,could have easily rejected petitioner theory that he was unable to leave the asbury house after killing lewis because a refrigerator,which he had twice moved himself that evening,was blocking the front door.in fact,the evidence demonstrated the refrigerator was not even blocking the front door after petitioner shot lewis.a reasonable jury thus could infer that instead of simply leaving the asbury house after killing lewis,petitioner took a second look and elected to enter taylor room.upon entering taylor room,petitioner shot her in the back of the head as she pleaded with him not to kill her.a reasonable jury could thus infer petitioner had the opportunity to take a third look before shooting taylor.petitioner then turned on lumpkin who likely would have also been killed but for the fact petitioner ran out of ammunition.petitioner then left the house through its front door the very door petitioner claimed prevented him from exiting the house in the first instance.
after the murders,petitioner did not call the police to inform them he had escaped from a hostage situation.instead,he told various friends about the kill
