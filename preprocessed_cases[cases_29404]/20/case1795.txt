background 
factual background 
on february,an elderly chicago man,frank svec,attended a neighborhood mardi gras festival.policemen saw him there with his downstairs neighbor,sharon brasher sharon daughter,michelle sharon boyfriend,james maynard and robert english,a friend of sharon and maynard who had recently moved into an extra bedroom in the apartment svec shared with another elderly man,albert jevorutsky.at the festival,svec paid for everyone food and drinks with money from his recently cashed retirement check.
the group left the festival sometime between and sharon son,michael,observed that sharon was kind of drunk when she and michelle returned to the converted tavern below svec and jevorutsky apartment that the brasher family was temporarily calling home.around,by michael estimation,he and michelle were awakened when maynard and english knocked on the front door of the.michelle let them in,and michael saw them attempting to open a door to some stairs that led from the tavern to the upstairs apartment shared by svec,jevorutsky,and english.english,who had moved in just a few days earlier and had not yet paid his first month rent in full,did not have his own key to the upstairs apartment.michael testified that he did not see whether english and maynard got the door open,though when the police later examined the door they found it unlocked.
sometime between and,according to sharon,who reportedly looked at a large illuminated clock when she awoke,maynard reentered the downstairs tavern.maynard was covered with blood and told sharon that he had killed two people and liked it.he changed out of his bloody jean jacket and cowboy boots,threw about on the floor,and,after arguing with sharon,left the tavern with her.when sharon and maynard got outside,they saw petitioner ebert standing there yelling franco,a name he used to refer to svec.this was not unusual ebert often yelled for svec to let him in so he could watch television.ebert and maynard decided to go get some drinks elsewhere,and sharon went back inside the tavern to go to sleep.
in the morning,sharon gave michael from the maynard had brought home so he could buy some shoes.she told michael not to ask where the money had come from,and instructed him to throw away a bag of garbage that contained maynard bloody boots.she also washed maynard bloody clothes.sharon later pleaded guilty to concealing a homicide,and told the jury as much at ebert second trial.
later that day,march,during the afternoon,the police found svec and his roommate jevorutsky dead in their apartment.both had been repeatedly stabbed and beaten,and jevorutsky throat had been slit.the men rooms were ransacked and there was blood all over the floors and walls.the police found two knives beneath jevorutsky body and one near the foot of his bed.they did not find any knives or weapons near svec body,nor were they able to recover any fingerprints from his bedroom.the medical examiner concluded that svec and jevorutsky had died from their stab wounds,but she did not determine the precise time of death.the bedroom and belongings of the apartment newest inhabitant,english,were undisturbed.
the police questioned various people throughout the neighborhood about the murders but did not immediately make any arrests.on april,delores esparza,the owner of a building down the street that maynard and the brashers moved into in,came forward and told the police that she had overheard a conversation between english,maynard,sharon brasher,and petitioner ebert.she reported that she had seen the foursome enter the brashers basement apartment and then heard three male voices talking and laughing about how they had robbed and murdered two old men,whom they said bled like stuffed pigs.after obtaining this information from esparza,the police michael and michelle brasher.on the afternoon of may,michael told them about the mysterious he received,and about sharon instructions to dispose of maynard bloody boots.michael also reported that mother told him in confidence that ebert was one of the three people involved in the stabbings of svec and jevorutsky.armed with this information,the police went looking for ebert.
ebert learned from the owner of a local bar he frequented,jeannette place,that the police were looking for him that same evening.he called the police,and when they came to jeannette place,he went with them voluntarily.the trial court nonetheless concluded that ebert was in custody because he was not free to leave after he agreed to accompany the officers to a nearby police station.after ebert spent about an hour alone in an interview room at the station,some officers drove him to a different station to get his palm print,returned him to the original station,and placed him in another interview room after explaining that he needed to wait for his palm print to clear.ebert spent the night and a good part of the next day in the interview room alone.on may,an assistant state attorney and a detective came in to interview him,and at he gave a statement implicating himself,english,and maynard in the robbery and murders.
in his statement,ebert explained that on march,he had been outside svec apartment at about.he said that he had yelled upstairs and english let him in to watch television svec and jevorutsky were asleep in their rooms.a short while later,maynard yelled upstairs.ebert and english let him in,at which point maynard said he needed some money and proposed that the men rob svec.ebert agreed that they should rob svec and went into svec bedroom to start looking for money.svec woke up and ran into the apartment common living room.maynard was waiting there and began to hit,punch,and kick svec,while ebert,accompanied by english,returned to svec room to continue the search for money.english found some coins,and ebert found a drawer full of knives.ebert showed maynard the knives,and maynard took one and went to jevorutsky room with english.ebert continued searching svec room and eventually found in cash,which the trio divided evenly.ebert then suggested that they should break the lock on the front door so that the robbery would look like a forced entry.english instructed ebert to dispose of a white plastic bag containing knives,a task he carried out on his way to reconvene with the others at white castle later that morning.the police reported that the lock on jevorutsky bedroom door was broken,and sharon testified that english retrieved a pillowcase full of coins from a nearby taco bell a few days after the murders.
procedural background 
the state charged ebert,english,and maynard with armed robbery and murder.before his trial,ebert moved to quash his arrest on the grounds that the police lacked probable cause to arrest him,and to suppress his confession as fruit of the poisonous tree.see united states swift,cir evidence which is obtained was the result of an illegal arrest is fruit of the poisonous tree and it must be excluded unless the government can show that it was obtained as a result not of the illegality,but rather by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.english made a similar motion,and the trial court held a joint hearing at which both ebert and english testified.ebert and english were tried separately.english was acquitted after a bench trial.the trial court also heard testimony from two police detectives who had worked on the case.the first detective provided hearsay testimony about esparza relayed that another officer told him what esparza had said.this testimony was largely corroborated by the nonhearsay testimony of the second detective,who had actually interviewed esparza.the second detective also testified about michael statements.he admitted on that michael statements had not been completely consistent throughout the investigation,but ebert attorney did not pursue the matter beyond eliciting that admission.
the trial court denied ebert motion.it also denied english.it found that by the time ebert was under arrest on may,the police had esparza,michael,and michelle statements,which it concluded provided adequate probable cause to support the arrest.it had no need to make a finding as to ebert poisonous tree claim.
ebert proceeded to a jury trial.at ebert trial,the assistant state attorney who obtained his inculpatory statement read it to the jury,and sharon brasher testified for the state.the jury convicted ebert of armed robbery and murder,but ebert got the convictions reversed on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds.his counsel had asked the judge in open court,on the second day of trial,for permission to amend ebert answer to include an alibi defense.the defense that ebert counsel had already begun presenting to the jury,compulsion,was wholly inconsistent with an alibi defense in addition to being legally unavailable to refute murder charges.indeed,when counsel asked to add the alibi defense,he had already told the jury that ebert had been present at the crime scene and was compelled to participate in the criminal acts because he was afraid maynard would kill him if he did.the trial court allowed the amendment over the state objection,and ebert counsel thereafter presented a alibi defense.
the appellate court determined that ebert counsel trial preparation was questionable and found the change of tactics,precipitated by sharon brasher testimony that the murders happened sometime before,objectively unreasonable.it explicitly criticized counsel apparent failure to question the brashers about the timeline of the crime.the appellate court also concluded that ebert had been prejudiced by his counsel actions.it stated that the evidence against defendant at trial was not so overwhelming as to render counsel deficient performance innocuous,and noted specifically that no evidence of michael statements regarding maynard implication of the defendant or esparza statements concerning the conversation in the basement apartment were introduced at trial.
ebert also argued to the appellate court that his motion to quash and suppress should have been granted.the appellate court articulated the familiar totality of the circumstances probable cause standard,see illinois gates,and proceeded to scrutinize the essentially two pieces of information which the state argued established probable cause to arrest ebert the statements from michael brasher and delores esparza.the appellate court noted that probable cause to arrest can rest upon information that would not be admissible at trial,such as hearsay,if the information is supported by some indicia of reliability.the appellate court found such indicia of reliability in michael statements,and noted that the police also had esparza statement when they arrested ebert.the court concluded that esparza statement,when viewed in combination with the other information known to police,supports,at least minimally,a reasonable belief that the defendant was involved in the murder,and further concluded that the trial court probable cause finding was not manifestly erroneous.the illinois supreme court declined to grant ebert leave to appeal the probable cause issue.
ebert went to trial again in.his new counsel did not refile or otherwise seek to relitigate ebert motion to quash and suppress.he did,however,present a alibi defense he found three unrelated witnesses who all testified that ebert had been at jeannette place from about until about on the night of the murders.the exculpatory timeline posited by ebert witnesses dovetailed with that proposed by sharon brasher,who again testified that maynard returned home covered in blood sometime between and,and that of michael brasher,who testified that maynard and english tried to get upstairs at around it was also consistent with ebert inculpatory statement,however,which was again read to the jury.ebert counsel highlighted the dearth of physical evidence against police had been unable to match ebert finger or palmprints to the few prints found at the crime drew the jury attention to discrepancies between ebert statement and the other evidence.he also called ebert sister to testify that she frequently gave him money in an apparent attempt to undermine any motive ebert might have had to commit robbery.the jury nevertheless found ebert guilty of armed robbery and murder,and the court,as required by statute,sentenced him to natural life imprisonment,to be served concurrently with a term for the robbery.
ebert counsel filed a motion for a new trial in which he accused himself of providing ineffective assistance because he failed to relitigate ebert motion to quash and suppress.counsel alleged that he had in his possession but did not take any action with respect to two statements purportedly made by delores esparza soon after the hearing on ebert motion to quash and suppress in the first statement,which was handwritten but signed by esparza and an assistant public defender,esparza claimed that the conversation she had overheard involved ebert,maynard,sharon brasher,and,instead of english,michael brasher.she noted that she had confirmed the participants identities with sharon.esparza also changed the time at which she heard the conversation,from the afternoon to about,but she maintained that the conversation contained a statement about pigs bleeding when their throats are cut.the second statement ebert counsel attributed to esparza was an unsigned typed memorial of an unidentified person interview with delores esparza on monday,march.in this statement,which was riddled with typographical errors and misspellings,esparza again placed the conversation around or,and again stated that the four participants were ebert,maynard,and sharon and michael brasher.she further stated that she heard discussion about pigs throats bleeding when they are slit,but,according to the statement final line,s he did not hear or tell the police that she heard any conversation regarding robbery or murder.
the trial court denied ebert motion.ebert then pursued an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal.echoing the claims his counsel made in the motion,ebert contended that counsel failure to seek to quash his arrest and suppress his statement before the second trial constituted ineffective assistance.ebert further argued that his counsel should have more fully investigated the new statements allegedly made by esparza.the appellate court considered the two new esparza statements,and,applying the familiar test articulated in strickland washington,speculated that ebert counsel may well have made a tactical decision that further investigation would be fruitless,given the other evidence of probable cause.the appellate court much more explicitly concluded that ebert could not satisfy the prejudice prong of strickland.it found that there was no reasonable probability that the final result in this case would have been different had defense counsel investigated further and made a motion to suppress.it noted that it was applying the probable cause conclusions it had announced when it heard ebert case previously,because the facts had not substantially changed.this is the law of the case doctrine,the purposes of which are to further consistency,to avoid constantly revisiting rulings,and to conserve judicial resources.sharp elecs.metro.life ins,cir.the appellate court found that esparza new statements did not negate the detectives testimony that she originally told them she overheard a conversation about a murder.it also found that there were no new developments with respect to michael statements,and reiterated that michael and esparza statements provided an adequate basis for probable cause.the illinois supreme court denied leave to appeal the ruling.
after exhausting his direct appeals,ebert sought and was denied postconviction relief from the illinois courts.he then turned to the federal courts,where he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court denied ebert petition on all grounds.with respect to his ineffective assistance claim,it rested its conclusion on our holding in holman page,cir that,under the strickland standard for ineffective assistance,no prejudice exists when evidence gathered in violation of the fourth amendment is erroneously admitted at trial.after we granted ebert a certificate of appealability,we overruled holman,see owens united states,cir,and remanded ebert case to the district court for reconsideration of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
the district court dutifully reexamined the claim.it concluded that it is far from clear that ebert motion to suppress would have been granted had trial counsel interviewed esparza and renewed the motion to suppress his confession.the district court considered the information the police had at the time they arrested ebert,and determined that e ven if esparza had repudiated her statement to the police,the totality of the circumstances at the time of ebert arrest was sufficient to establish probable cause.the district court ultimately found little reason to believe that a renewed fourth amendment challenge would have been meritorious such that the illinois appellate court conclusion to the contrary could be considered erroneous,or beyond that,well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.quoting hardaway young,cir.ebert disagreed and sought a certificate of appealability on the ineffective assistance issue.the district court granted his request,and we now consider his arguments.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court denial of a petition for habeas corpus de novo.smith mckee,cir.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,we conduct our review with a great deal of deference to the illinois courts that previously evaluated ebert claim.buss,cir u nder habeas law,we defer to a great extent to the decisions of the state courts,and review these decisions for reasonableness only.we may grant habeas relief only if the illinois courts adjudication of ebert claim was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.d.unreasonableness is a high bar in this context a state court decision is unreasonable within the meaning of d only if it is so erroneous as to be objectively unreasonable and well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.bennett gaetz,cir quoting emerson shaw,cir.we review the decision of the last illinois court that substantively considered ebert claim,gonzales mize,cir,and we will presume that court factual findings to be correct unless ebert rebuts that presumption with clear and convincing evidence,at citing e and dretke.
the supreme court set forth the legal principles that govern claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in strickland washington.under strickland,a defendant must demonstrate both that his counsel performance was deficient when measured against prevailing standards of professional reasonableness,and that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense.strickland,at brown finnan,cir citing wiggins smith,u.when the ineffective assistance claim is based on counsel failure to file a motion to suppress,as it is here,the defendant must also prove that his fourth amendment claim is meritorious and that there is a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different absent the excludable evidence in order to demonstrate actual prejudice.kimmelman morrison,see also united states cieslowski,cir.these are at best difficult showings to make,particularly since strickland requires that we presume counsel rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment,strickland,at,and evaluate his performance as a whole rather than focus on a single failing or oversight,peoples united states,cir.ebert uphill slope is even steeper under aedpa,which adds an extra layer of deference to our review.see ellison acevedo,cir,at conner mcbride,cir w e do not apply the strickland standards directly,but instead ask whether the court factual findings and conclusions pass aedpa muster.
ebert argues,as he has consistently,that his counsel performance was deficient because he did not sufficiently investigate the new statements from esparza and relitigate the motion that was raised before ebert first trial in evaluating counsel decision not to investigate the new statements,the second appellate court concluded the decision was a tactical one that it saw no reason to.see eckstein kingston,cir.the court came to this conclusion after accurately recognizing strickland as the governing precedent.we therefore examine only whether the state court applied strickland unreasonably,which occurs only when the state court application of clearly established federal law is wholly outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.bennett,at.
here,this inquiry requires us to delve deeper than is ordinarily required.the second appellate court rested its finding that counsel decision was a legitimate strategic one on its concomitant conclusion that the other evidence of probable cause was adequate to support ebert arrest and would remain so even if esparza new statements had been pitted against it.that finding,in turn,rested on the first appellate court determination that probable cause supported the arrest and that the motion to quash was not denied erroneously.this recursion runs us right into ebert other primary contention that a motion to quash his arrest and suppress his confession would have been meritorious because the courts relied on unreliable evidence to find probable cause.
police have probable cause to make an arrest when the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the petitioner had committed or was committing an offense.beck ohio.probable cause is a practical,nontechnical conception,id.quoting brinegar united states,and its existence is determined using a approach,illinois gates.the police must consider the veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information,id.at,but those two considerations are complementary a deficiency in one may be compensated for,by a strong showing as to the other,id.at.in short,it does not take much to establish probable cause.the officers must have more than a bare suspicion that they have the right guy,but they need not have enough evidence to support a conviction or even to show that their belief is more likely true than false.fox hayes,cir.
the first appellate court accurately laid out the applicable law governing probable cause even though it did so largely in terms of state rather than federal law.see early packer.it then stated that there were essentially two pieces of information which the state argued established probable cause to arrest ebert the statement from michael brasher and the statement from delores esparza.ebert challenged both statements,but the court found the statements sufficiently reliable to support a finding of probable cause.
the court addressed ebert concerns about the reliability of michael statements first.it reasoned that michael was not a confidential informant,and noted that ebert failed to provide evidence showing that michael connections to sharon and maynard undermined the heightened reliability that citizen informants are often accorded.it went on
