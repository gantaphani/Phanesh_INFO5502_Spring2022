paul hanson hanson appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york colleen mcmahon,judge denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.this appeal presents two issues.the first issue is whether we should dismiss this appeal pursuant to the fugitive disentitlement doctrine because hanson was a fugitive from justice for two months.as hanson has been apprehended and prosecuted for bail jumping,we conclude that there are no legitimate justifications for dismissing this appeal.the second issue presented is whether the state appellate court unreasonably applied boykin alabama,d,in determining that hanson entered his plea of guilty intelligently and voluntarily.because the record does not affirmatively disclose that hanson intelligently and voluntarily pleaded guilty,as required under boykin,we reverse and remand for issuance of the writ.
background 
facts and procedural history 
the basic facts underlying this appeal are undisputed.on march,hanson appeared with counsel before the michael schwartz,city court judge for the city of middletown,on two counts of aggravated harassment in the second degree and two counts of criminal contempt arising from alleged violations of an order of protection then in effect against him.after a series of case calls,conferences,and discussions,defense counsel and the prosecutor reached a plea arrangement,allowing hanson to plead guilty to one count of criminal contempt in the second degree in satisfaction of all the outstanding charges.
the plea colloquy was brief and,as it is central to our decision today,we reproduce the transcript of that hearing in its entirety

court hanson,i hope not to see you on this side of the court.
hanson also executed a written waiver of his right to appeal 
before sentencing,hanson sought to withdraw his guilty plea,claiming that at the prior hearing he did not understand either the nature of the proceedings or the consequences of his plea.hanson also claimed that he suffered from a mental impairment caused by a then injury sustained in a motorcycle accident.hanson motion to withdraw his plea was denied by judge schwartz in an unpublished written decision dated june.judge schwartz held that given the totality of the circumstances,hanson guilty plea was knowing,voluntary,and intelligent.
hanson was subsequently sentenced to fifteen days incarceration to be followed by three years probation he appealed his conviction and sentence to the new york state supreme court,appellate term arguing that his guilty plea was involuntary.the appellate term rejected hanson claim and unanimously held that d espite defendant contention to the contrary,we are of the opinion that defendant plea of guilty was made knowingly,voluntarily and intelligently.people hanson,or cr,wl.term june,citing people harris.new york state court of appeals denied hanson application for leave to appeal.people hanson.
having exhausted his final state appeal but prior to serving his sentence,hanson filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in the southern district of new york under.the matter was assigned to judge mcmahon,who,in turn,entered an order referring the matter to magistrate judge lisa margaret smith.the district court also stayed hanson sentence pending its resolution of the petition.
in a report and recommendation dated november,the magistrate judge recommended that the writ be granted because the record underlying hanson plea was silent as to hanson complete,knowing,and voluntary waiver of essential constitutional rights.the respondent filed timely objections to this recommendation and,in an order dated february,the district court accepted the report but rejected the recommendation before denying the petition and dissolving the stay.hanson now appeals the district court judgment 
circumstances regarding hanson failure to appear 
after oral argument,respondent filed a motion to dismiss the appeal and revoke our stay of hanson state sentence based on the fugitive disentitlement doctrine.hanson had failed to appear and answer state criminal charges unrelated to those underlying the present appeal.hanson,through counsel,filed papers in opposition on february,requesting that the case be decided on the merits.
by summary order dated february,we remanded the matter to the district court to determine,by whatever procedures it deemed necessary and appropriate,the exact circumstances surrounding hanson failures to appear in state court.we retained jurisdiction to rule upon the motion and,if appropriate,decide the issues on appeal once the record had been supplemented.see united states jacobson,cir.
on april,the mandate was filed with the district court,which again referred the matter to magistrate judge smith.after consulting with the district court,the magistrate judge determined that she would hold a hearing and prepare a report concerning hanson failures to appear in court.the magistrate judge met with the parties on two occasions and reviewed various state court transcripts and court papers relating to hanson cases.on july,the magistrate judge issued a report.hanson did not object to the magistrate judge report,and on august,the district court issued an opinion adopting the magistrate judge report,with two modifications 
the district court factual findings are not clearly erroneous.we provide the following summary.in january,hanson was a defendant in three separate criminal cases against him indictment number in orange county court one count of criminal contempt in the first degree,three counts of criminal contempt in the second degree,one count of stalking in the third degree,and one count of menacing in the second degree docket number in city court for the city of middletown harassment in the second degree and docket number in city court for the city of middletown harassment in the second degree.hanson was found guilty after a jury trial on all counts in indictment number on november.
hanson failed to appear for both a sentencing on january,in indictment number,and a conference on february,in the two cases before the city court for the city of middletown.hanson admits that he knew of both proceedings and that he was not in the united states at the time of either the sentencing or the conference.although he appeared in middletown city court on january,he left the united states soon after and arrived in thailand on january.he subsequently traveled to the united kingdom,arriving at heathrow airport on february.
hanson attempted to enter canada from the united kingdom on either the second or third of march there is a slight discrepancy in the documentation.canadian authorities detained him because there were outstanding warrants for his arrest in new york state.on march,canadian authorities transported hanson to new york,where he was handed over to law enforcement authorities.the next day,hanson appeared in orange county court on indictment number and was remanded without bail.
on march,hanson was charged with one count of bail jumping in the second degree.he pleaded guilty to this charge on may.on june,hanson was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one and to four years on the charges contained in indictment number.on the bail jumping charge,the court also sentenced hanson to a term of one to three years to be served consecutively with his other sentence.
we agree with the district court rejection of hanson explanation his he traveled abroad to seek medical treatment for his brain injury.the only evidence supporting this claim is a medical report from october stating that hanson was contemplating stem cell for longstanding right brachial plexus injury.hanson failed to offer any evidence showing that his absence was the result of medical necessity.indeed,he failed to come forward with any evidence that he attended any medical appointments while abroad.
ii.discussion 
a.the fugitive disentitlement doctrine 
federal courts have authority to dismiss an appeal or writ of certiorari if the party seeking relief is a fugitive while the matter is pending.degen united states,d.even if the appellant is no longer a fugitive during the pendency of his appeal,courts have the authority to dismiss a criminal appeal under the fugitive disentitlement doctrine where there is some nexus between a defendant prior fugitive status and his appeal.united states,d.
although we have never dismissed an appeal of a habeas proceeding on fugitive disentitlement grounds,other courts have done so.see bagwell dretke,cir holding that the doctrine applies in cases under lopez malley,cir applying the fugitive disentitlement doctrine to dismiss a petition for habeas corpus.
there are four independent justifications for disentitlement assuring the enforceability of a decision against a fugitive imposing a penalty for flouting the judicial process discouraging flights from justice to promote efficient operation of the courts and avoiding prejudice to the other side engendered by a defendant flight.united states dep t of justice,cir.fugitive disentitlement is an equitable doctrine that may be applied at court discretion.sec berger,cir.
as hanson is now in custody and has been prosecuted and sentenced for bail jumping,all of the justifications for disentitlement militate against dismissing this appeal any decision we render will be enforceable against hanson.see,at.finding that there were no enforceability concerns because the defendant had been returned to custody united states awadalla,cir dismissing appeal where fugitive whereabouts were unknown.his incarceration prevents him from hedging against an unfavorable outcome by being beyond the reach of law enforcement.
there is no need for us to impose a penalty for flouting the judicial process.the orange county court has already sentenced hanson to a term of one to three years for bail jumping.adding the second punishment of disenfranchisement would introduce the type of arbitrariness and irrationality into sentencing for escape that the supreme court has cautioned against,at.see also degen,at.moreover,using the blunderbuss of appellate dismissal,at,in this case to discourage flights from justice to promote efficient operation of the courts is too blunt an instrument for advancing that goal,degen,at.the orange county court has already crafted a more appropriate response.
it is true that his flight has given rise to a flurry of extraneous matters diverting not only our attention from the merits of this matter,but also the district court and the magistrate judge from other matters on their already crowded dockets,at.efficient operation of the courts,however,is not a sufficient justification for disentitlement in this case because hanson is now in custody.see,at.e fficient operation of the appellate process will not be advanced by dismissal of appeals filed after former fugitives are recaptured.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
finally,hanson flight has not caused any prejudice to the state in this case.certainly,a long escape,even if ended before sentencing and appeal,may so delay the onset of appellate proceedings that the government would be prejudiced in locating witnesses and presenting evidence at retrial after a successful appeal,at.noting the eleventh circuit position.hanson flight lasted only two months and can not be correctly classified as a long escape.the delay in this case derives primarily from the nature of the proceeding a habeas petition,the state motion to dismiss,and the time we have taken to resolve the matter.
even though hanson intentionally fled during the pendency of this appeal,we can not conclude that the relevant justifications for disentitlement apply.accordingly,we deny the motion and will decide the merits of his appeal.
b.the merits of hanson petition 
we review de novo the district court denial of hanson petition for habeas relief.hines miller,cir,cert.denied,d.hanson habeas corpus petition is governed by d as modified by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.title,section d provides in pertinent part 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,when the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.under the unreasonable application clause of d,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.williams,at.
it is beyond dispute that the supreme court decision in boykin alabama,d was,at the time of the appellate term decision,and continues to be clearly established federal law for the proposition that the trial court must produce a record affirmatively showing that the defendant guilty plea was knowing and voluntary.see,bradshaw stumpf,d t he court taking a defendant plea is responsible for ensuring a record adequate for any review that may be later sought.quoting boykin,at.united states dominguez benitez,d w hen the record of a criminal conviction obtained by guilty plea contains no evidence that a defendant knew of the rights he was putatively waiving,the conviction must be reversed.citing boykin,at.parke raley,d in boykin the court found reversible error when a trial judge accepted a defendant guilty plea without creating a record affirmatively showing that the plea was knowing and voluntary.bordenkircher hayes,d noting the need for a public record indicating that a plea was knowingly and voluntarily made under boykin.
the district court correctly analyzed hanson claim under the unreasonable application clause of section d analysis under the contrary to clause would have been inappropriate because,as discussed below,the case cited by the appellate term,people harris,is not diametrically different,opposite in character or nature,or mutually opposed to boykin.see lindstadt keane,cir analyzing case under the unreasonable application clause where the standard applied by the state court was not diametrically different,opposite in character or nature,or mutually opposed to the federal standard internal quotation marks omitted harris kuhlmann,cir holding that the district court should have analyzed the petition under the unreasonable application clause rather than the contrary to clause where the state appellate court cited to a state court case that applied the applicable supreme court precedent.nor are the facts of hanson case governed by any case in which the court encountered a materially indistinguishable set of facts.lindstadt,at.therefore,relief is appropriate only if the appellate term unreasonably applie d clearly established federal law.
the appellate term correctly identified harris,a new york court of appeals case applying the holding of boykin and other supreme court precedent on the voluntariness of guilty pleas,as containing the appropriate federal legal standard.see harris,at,see also harris kuhlmann,at the appellate division reviewing harris case correctly identified the relevant federal law applicable to harris batson claims,because in summarily affirming the trial court it cited a case applying the holding of batson.to obtain relief under the unreasonable application clause of d,hanson must show that the appellate term applied the federal principle from boykin,through harris,to the facts of his case in an objectively unreasonable manner.see eze senkowski,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a showing that the appellate term was merely incorrect is insufficient.see also williams,at.a n unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.emphasis in original.rather,some increment of incorrectness beyond error is required.francis stone,cir.
a guilty plea operates as a waiver of important rights,and is valid only if done voluntarily,knowingly,and intelligently,with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.bradshaw.at quoting brady united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.a court may not accept a plea without an affirmative showing that it was intelligent and voluntary.boykin,at.brady,at.noting that boykin stands for the proposition that the record on appeal must affirmatively disclose that a defendant who pleaded guilty entered his plea understandingly and voluntarily.while a trial judge is required to make a record that affirmatively discloses that the defendant guilty plea is intelligent and voluntary,he or she is not required by federal law to engage in any particular interrogatory catechism akin to that required of federal courts by federal rule of criminal procedure.see siegel new york,cir.the voluntariness of a guilty plea is reviewed by examining the totality of the relevant circumstances.willbright smith,cir per curiam citing brady,at.
viewing the record as a whole,we find that it fails to affirmatively disclose that hanson entered his plea intelligently and voluntarily.we find the record deficient in establishing both the defendant understanding of the immensely important procedural step he was taking and that he was acting voluntarily.a plea can not be intelligent unless,at the very least,the defendant understands that he has the right to a trial to determine whether he is guilty,and that,by pleading guilty,he gives up that right and consents to the entry of a guilty verdict,upon which he may be sentenced.a plea is not voluntary unless the defendant understands he is under no compulsion to plead guilty and makes the decision of his own free will.
nothing in the record affirmatively discloses hanson awareness that he had the right to have his guilt determined at a trial and that by pleading guilty he was giving up that right.nor does the record affirmatively disclose that hanson voluntarily chose to plead guilty.it is not sufficient that the record contain some references to the right to trial and the nature of the plea.the proceeding must be conducted in a manner that supports a reasonable inference of the defendant understanding of the significance of his plea and of its voluntariness.here,the court ran together a series of confusing questions and statements in such a way that hanson occasionally interspersed yes answers leave wholly to conjecture the meaning of his responses.
at the start of the allocution,the court said to hanson that after a conference with me and the assistant district attorney they have agreed to a disposition of this matter.the defendant responded yes.even assuming hanson understood that they referred to the assistant district attorney and his defense attorney,this certainly did not constitute a statement to the effect that hanson chose to plead guilty.it does not communicate to us that his plea was voluntary.
the court came close to remedying part of the problem by then saying,as i understand it,you have agreed to plead guilty,to one count of criminal contempt in the degree had hanson answered yes at this point,this might have established at least his intent to plead guilty.but instead of allowing hanson to answer the question,the court continued that it was not putting any sentence limits on this,that the court would read the probation report,that the sentence could be anything up to a year,and that any further violation of the order of probation that is outstanding will result in a willfulness hearing on this,and if,if i feel that you willfully violated the order of this court,i have the right to 
at this point hanson said,yes,and the court continu
