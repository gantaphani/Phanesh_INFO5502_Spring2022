appellant james harrison,a kentucky state prisoner convicted of murder with aggravating circumstances,appeals a district court judgment dismissing his petition for habeas corpus filed pursuant to.harrison was represented by two attorneys at his criminal trial,and argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial due to conflicts that arose between his attorneys,due to his attorneys alleged failure to call certain witnesses to testify at trial,and due to his attorneys alleged failure to fulfill promises made to the jury during opening statements.for the reasons below,we affirm the district court dismissal of harrison habeas petition.
on october,harrison was convicted by a madison ky circuit court jury of murder with aggravating circumstances following the shooting death of robert walker,police chief of irvine,kentucky.although charged with a capital offense,harrison was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment,without the privilege of parole for years.the kentucky supreme court affirmed harrison conviction on november.harrison then moved the trial court to vacate his conviction and sentence,alleging that he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel due to his attorneys conflict.the court denied harrison motion.
before his trial,harrison attorneys,max smith and campbell cantrill iii,gathered statements from alibi witnesses in preparation for a defense that he was not the shooter.as trial approached,witness becky johnson recanted her proposed testimony,claiming that harrison wife had attempted to bribe her in order to provide an alibi for harrison.despite johnson recantation,harrison attorneys decided to continue with their alibi defense.during his opening statement,cantrill told the jury that another man was operating harrison car at the time of the murder and that harrison was not present at the crime scene.
after trial commenced,the second proposed alibi witness also recanted,claiming that attorney smith had attempted to bribe him for his testimony as the commonwealth case closed,cantrill worked with harrison and his wife to prepare them to testify at trial.he found their testimony troublesome,however,as it became inconsistent and often changing.these cumulative witness problems created a rift between smith and cantrill,as they disagreed over whether to call the remaining witnesses to testify at trial.on september,smith filed a motion to withdraw as counsel,claiming that he could not represent harrison and comply with the ethical codes of the kentucky bar association.cantrill also orally moved to withdraw,claiming the same grounds.the trial court denied both motions to withdraw 
after these alibi witnesses recanted,other potential witnesses remained available to testify,but none provided an alibi for harrison at the time of chief walker murder.the attorneys presented harrison with their differing opinions regarding the witnesses,and harrison ultimately decided not to call any witnesses on his behalf.harrison was subsequently convicted of murder with aggravating circumstances and sentenced to a term of life imprisonment,without the privilege of parole for years.
on appeal of the trial court denial of harrison motion to vacate,the kentucky court of appeals remanded harrison motion to the madison circuit court to conduct an evidentiary hearing.the madison circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on april,receiving testimony from fourteen witnesses.on august,the court issued a page order denying harrison motion to vacate judgment.in its order,the madison circuit court summarized the evidence admitted against harrison at trial as follows 
at the trial,the commonwealth presented evidence of a shooting incident in at the defendant home where both chief walker and the defendant were seriously injured.the defendant was charged with the assault of chief walker.
delores gail jones testified that prior to the chief death,the defendant told her that he was going to kill the chief.kenny plowman testified that on february,shortly before the murder,the defendant told him that he would like to get a chance to follow chief walker and blow his head off.
hazel roberts testified at trial that she saw the shooting by a person driving a little white colored car.
witnesses testified that on the day of the murder,they saw the defendant alone driving his small white or beige car before,during and after the murder.
mildred schuler identified the defendant as the person she saw commit the murder and that he alone was in the vehicle at the time,and that she recognized him,but did know his name at the time.during the investigation,she identified the defendant from a photographic and then affirmed the identification at trial.
schuler testified that at the time of the chief murder,her hubert chaney truck was at the scene and sped off.she also testified that chaney had been harassing her.
however,the undisputed testimony of hazel roberts was that the person driving the little white colored car shot chief walker.the evidence adduced at trial is individual driving the small,vehicle identified later by schuler as the defendant murdered chief walker and the broken tail lights found at the scene fit the broken tail lights on the defendant small,vehicle.
robert lee dixon testified that the defendant told him,i shot bob walker at approximately on the day of the chief murder.kenneth jones observed the two holding a conversation that afternoon.
billy norton testified that the defendant told him,i shot ole bob with a five times,and then threw the gun off of the irvine bridge.neddie powers heard the defendant tell norton that he killed the chief with a and threw the gun in the river.
physical evidence was produced at trial that proved the defendant vehicle was the vehicle that collided with chief walker vehicle during the shooting that resulted in the chief death.kentucky state laboratory personnel identified the bullets taken from the chief body as those that can be fired with a smith and wesson revolver and a photograph was produced showing the defendant in possession of such a handgun.
in summary,the commonwealth presentation provided overwhelming evidence of the defendant guilt.
on march,the kentucky court of appeals affirmed the denial of harrison motion to vacate.on november,the kentucky supreme court denied harrison request for discretionary review concerning his motion to vacate.
harrison filed this federal habeas petition in the eastern district of kentucky on november.the united states magistrate judge adopted the findings made by the madison circuit court following the april evidentiary hearing and recommended that harrison habeas petition be dismissed.on september,the district court adopted the magistrate findings of fact and dismissed harrison petition.the district court granted a certificate of appealability on the issues of whether harrison was denied his rights to testify and to effective assistance of counsel.upon harrison motion,we expanded the certificate of appealability to include harrison claim that his attorneys were ineffective for failing to call defense witnesses and for failing to fulfill promises made to the jury in opening statements.we also appointed harrison counsel to represent him in this appeal.
in evaluating a petition for habeas corpus,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.stallings bobby,cir hill hofbauer,cir.because harrison filed his petition in,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,applies.stallings,at.under the aedpa,a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court decision 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the supreme court has explained that a state court decision is contrary to federal law under the aedpa standard if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.the court has explained further that a decision is an unreasonable application of federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.
harrison first contends that,due to the conflict that arose between smith and cantrill,he was de facto denied his right to counsel to offer a defense at trial.harrison relies on united states cronic,d,to argue that prejudice to harrison defense should be presumed and that harrison need not show how specific errors made by his counsel undermined the reliability of the jury finding of guilt.
in cronic,the court considered whether a defendant sixth amendment right to counsel was denied where the defendant was appointed a young real estate lawyer to represent him,allowing the lawyer only days for pretrial preparation.cronic,at.in discussing the necessity for adequate representation to ensure the adversarial process that the sixth amendment envisions,the court noted that,although a defendant generally bears the burden of showing that the challenged conduct actually prejudiced the defendant,there are circumstances that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.id.at.the court identified at least two instances where surrounding circumstances justify a presumption of ineffectiveness where the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial,and where counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing id.at.harrison claim is focused on the first instance he contends that prejudice should be presumed because the conflict that arose between smith and cantrill effectively left harrison without the aid of counsel as he prepared his defense at trial.
harrison argument is without merit.first,although harrison claims that his attorneys refused to put on a defense at trial,the kentucky state courts found that harrison was faced with conflicting advice by his attorneys concerning whether he should take the stand to testify in his own behalf and whether witnesses should be called and that harrison ultimately elected not to testify or have other witnesses called.the madison circuit court found that smith and cantrill presented differing concerns and strategies regarding potential defense witnesses and stated that the trial record is clear that ultimately,harrison made an informed and considered decision not to present a defense at the guilt or innocence stage.harrison has not offered any evidence that suggests this finding was clear error.
moreover,neither cronic nor the cases it cites provide support for harrison argument that he was left without counsel due to his attorneys conflicting advice.in support of its assertion that prejudice is presumed where the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial,the cronic court cited the following cases geders united states,d herring new york,d brooks tennessee,d hamilton alabama,d white maryland,d per curiam ferguson georgia,d williams kaiser.cronic,at.as the court acknowledged in its citation to the above opinions,these cases involve claims that counsel was either totally absent,or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding.id.in geders,for example,the court found a trial court ruling that sequestered the testifying defendant and prevented the defendant from conferring with his attorney during an overnight recess denied the accused the guiding hand of counsel.geders,at.quoting powell alabama.likewise,in herring,the court found that a procedural rule which allowed the trial court to deny the defendant counsel the opportunity to make a final argument to the jury denied the defendant his right to the assistance of counsel.herring,at.similarly,the court found in brooks that a procedural rule which required testifying criminal defendants to testify before any other defense witnesses infringed on an accused right to confer with counsel.brooks,at.in hamilton and white,the court held that a defendant sixth amendment rights are violated where he is denied access to counsel during arraignment.hamilton,at.white,at.
these cases do not apply to the present situation.harrison was never denied access to his attorneys,neither during trial preparations nor after trial had commenced.harrison argues that because he had to consider conflicting advice from his attorneys and decide whether to testify himself and present any other witnesses,he was effectively left without counsel.as the court has noted,however,defense counsel has an obligation to discuss potential strategies with his client and a criminal defendant is often called upon to consult with his attorney and decide whether to present a defense and whether to testify himself.florida nixon,d godinez moran,d noting that all criminal defendants may be required to make important decisions once criminal proceedings have been initiated,including whether to take the stand himself,present a defense,and whether to raise affirmative defenses.that harrison was ultimately responsible for deciding whether to testify himself or to call certain defense witnesses did not render him without the aid of counsel.
harrison also cites the supreme court decisions in holloway arkansas,d,and cuyler sullivan,d,to support his contention that he is entitled to a presumption of prejudice.both holloway and cuyler,however,involve an attorney concurrent representation of multiple criminal whose interests were in conflict at trial.see holloway,at.holding that presumption of prejudice applies where trial court,over timely objection,improperly requires joint representation of with conflicting interests cuyler,at.holding that no presumption of prejudice arises unless defendant shows that his counsel actively represented conflicting interests.this case does not involve any such joint representation of with conflicting interests,and so we find that neither holloway nor cuyler are applicable.
because harrison was advised by counsel throughout the proceedings and neither cronic,cuyler,nor holloway suggest that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate here,harrison must show both that his attorneys representation was objectively unreasonable and that their allegedly deficient performance prejudiced harrison defense.strickland washington,d.to show prejudice,harrison must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.we conclude that harrison can not satisfy either prong of the strickland test.
harrison argues that smith and cantrill had a conflict of interest in representing him,alleging that each attorney was subject to a conflict of interest based on their fears of criminal prosecution and malpractice for witness tampering.although a conflict of interest may arise where defense counsel is subject to a criminal investigation,see taylor united states,cir,we have noted previously that t here lacks any controlling authority to support the proposition that an attorney fear of investigation may give rise to a conflict of interest.moss united states,cir emphasis added.there is no evidence in the record to suggest that either smith or cantrill were ever criminally investigated for their representation of harrison,nor did harrison ever inform the trial court that he had a conflict of interest with either smith or cantrill.smith and cantrill concerns over being indicted or sued as a result of their representation of harrison did not,therefore,give rise to a conflict of interest.rather,we agree with the kentucky court of appeals that harrison case was not one involving a conflict of interest but was one involving a personal conflict between his attorneys.
harrison has also failed to show that his attorneys alleged conflict of interest resulted in prejudice.as the madison circuit court concluded,the evidence admitted against harrison at
