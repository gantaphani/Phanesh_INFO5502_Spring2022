factual and procedural history 
mary hanna joined the army in as a member of the army health professions scholarship program hpsp and thereafter attended medical school.in exchange for financial assistance with medical school,hanna promised to serve on active duty in the army for four years and to remain in the army reserve for an additional four years.after hanna finished medical school,the army deferred her active duty obligation for four years while she completed a residency in anesthesiology.on october,the army sent hanna a letter directing her to report for active duty in august.hanna was later scheduled to report to william beaumont army medical center in el paso,texas.
on december,hanna filed an application for discharge as a conscientious objector co.in her application,hanna declared that she sought discharge because,as a christian,she believed in the inherent sanctity of human life and that it would be committing a crime against god to take another human life.she further explained 
i believe that violence and killing are in direct contradiction to all of jesus teachings.i am unable to put christ words into practice while simultaneously participating,whether directly or indirectly,in war,violence,and killing.all of jesus preaching reiterates love,peace,forgiveness and cautions against anger,hatred,and their end product,murder.based on christ example,i believe that i must take things one step further and constantly strive to eliminate conflict with others by seeking prompt reconciliation with adversaries.love of god and love of fellow humans drives christian life,and i have incorporated this principle into my own life.
hanna declared that she would be incapable of attaining these qualities by participating in war and killing and would betray these moral and religious principles by participating in war in any way.she explained that her parents were deeply involved in the coptic orthodox church coc and that her father had planned to become a monk and her mother a nun until they met each other and chose to marry.as a child,hanna attended church weekly in los angeles,where she grew up.her parents taught her to believe in love for god first,love for all other humans as a direct reflection of our love for god,respect for elders,respect for the traditions of our church,honesty,sincerity of heart,and constant striving for goodness.hanna became a coptic hymn teacher in high school and later served as a sunday school teacher while she attended ucla.she also participated in the coptic club at ucla.
in,in her senior year of college,hanna applied and was accepted for medical school at tufts university.in her co application,hanna described her last year of college as a time that greatly tested her faith and her proximity to the church.at the time she applied for the hpsp,hanna was experiencing a period of change and uncertainty during which she questioned everything.she turned to atheism for several months,followed by agnosticism for several more months.during this time,she had no particular convictions one way or the other regarding war.
hanna father died in,and during the mourning period that followed his death,hanna faith was rekindled and she found herself again drawn to god.she explained that i had lived both without god and with him,and i liked myself immensely more when striving to emulate his nature,his mercy,his love,his generosity,his forgiveness.hanna further explained that it took some time for her to make the connection between this newly rekindled faith and its incompatibility with certain aspects of her life.for example,she became increasingly concerned about her participation in elective abortions as an anesthesiology resident because she felt she was participating in an act in direct contradiction to the bible teachings.she asked her floor manager if she could abstain from abortion procedures and her request was granted.
during the summer of,hanna watched several war documentaries and growingly began to view all war from a christian perspective complete separation from god.she explained that she started to gradually understand the spectrum christ described which connects anger to hatred to violence to murder war on a larger scale.after watching the documentaries,she finally understood how christ equated them all as the same sin,with anger being the stem.her new understanding motivated her to participate in a war protest in september,where she realized that she was no longer able to play a role in propagating violence.in early october,hanna watched a television program during which a man discussed the destructive role of war and violence,citing the beatitudes.she then realized that to live the rest of my life with integrity,in harmony with god nature of love and compassion,i could not participate in military service.reflecting on her choice to join the army,hanna commented,i realized then the full implications of the path i had chosen years earlier and the incompatibility of war and violence with christ teachings.
hanna submitted six letters in support of her co application,four from coptic orthodox priests who knew her personally,and two from supervisors in her residency program.one of the priests,who had known hanna since infancy,stated that he had spoken with hanna recently about her belief that war is the direct opposite of christ call to peace and love.the priest wrote 
i have read her application for conscientious objector status,and it is consistent with her character,ethics,and approach to christianity.i know mary well,and she is both honest and sincere in her application.i strongly urge you to approve her application in order to allow her to live a life that does not contradict her beliefs.
a second priest,who had known hanna for more than years,wrote that hanna was both honest and sincere in her application,that he knew hanna well,and that she was trying to live a life consistent with her beliefs.he urged the army to approve her application.a third priest,who had known hanna for years,described her as one of the most dedicated conscientious and compassionate young ladies in our church.he described her as trustworthy,honest and sincere.a fourth priest wrote that hanna had been a member of mark coptic orthodox church in natick,massachusetts since.hanna attended church there regularly during medical school and as often as her call schedule allowed during her residency.hanna supervisors wrote that her co application was a sincere representation of who she is,and what she believes,described hanna as a gentle soul and the mother to all our sickest patients and urged the army to approve her application.
after hanna submitted her application for discharge,colonel john powers in the office of the surgeon general issued a memorandum regarding her application.powers commented that t he army is in anesthesiologists.turning to hanna application,he noted that he did not question hanna religious belief but that he found some aspects of her application troubling.powers stated that although hanna stated in her co application that she was experiencing doubts about her religious faith at the time she applied to the army,her hpsp application indicated that she had been teaching sunday school during the same time period.powers also noted the late timing of hanna co application,commenting that she never raised concerns about conscientious objection during medical school or her residency.powers observed that hanna application was received around the same time as a co application submitted by another anesthesiologist and shortly after the army approved the co application of a third anesthesiologist.he pointed out that all three applicants were represented by the same attorney.powers also commented that the army had paid more than for hanna medical school expenses.he recommended that the army either deny hanna application and order her to active duty,or grant the application with recoupment of her medical school costs plus interest.
pursuant to army regulations,hanna was interviewed by a military chaplain and a psychiatrist.the chaplain report stated that the coptic orthodox church does not teach pacifism.he reported that,based on his research,he believed the coc endorses military service through the example of its saints and religious leaders.the chaplain also questioned hanna sincerity because she worked in a hospital that provided abortions.he added that hanna had not made significant lifestyle changes since becoming a conscientious objector.
the psychiatrist found that hanna did not suffer from any psychiatric disorders.he also found that hanna application was a convenient,if not opportunistic choice in refuting her basic military contract based on her newly found faith.during her interview with the psychiatrist,hanna related that her father had served in the egyptian military for six years and was very proud of her decision to join the army.she told him that her father would have been devastated to know of her decision to file for discharge as a conscientious objector.hanna also told him that she was prepared to repay the army for her medical school costs plus interest.
hanna application was assigned to an investigating officer io.the io conducted a hearing lasting more than six hours at which he heard testimony from hanna,two coptic orthodox priests who knew hanna personally,and the army psychiatrist who had interviewed hanna.one of the priests,who had known hanna for six years,testified that she was an honest and sincere person and that her application accurately described the source of her beliefs.the priest also testified that there is no uniform position on military service in the coptic orthodox church.rather,the church supports both conscientious objectors and those who choose military service.the priest disagreed with the chaplain conclusion that the coc endorses military service and also with the chaplain statement that some coc saints were warriors.he testified that military service by these saints occurred before their religious phase.the second priest,who had known hanna since she was seven or eight years old,testified that she is a truthful person and that he supported her co application.he also testified that the coc supports both conscientious objectors and those who serve in the military.the io credited the testimony of both priests.
in his summary of hanna testimony,the io stated that when hanna applied to the hpsp in,she was naive and her personal belief system was not fully developed.she did not give much thought to the morality of war.during college,her religious faith waxed and waned and she began to question her religious beliefs and this caused discord with her father.when she watched the war documentaries in,she was shocked by the civilian deaths.after watching the movies,she adopted a pacifist approach.she began praying more.she read scripture and the writings of religious philosophers.she noted that jesus christ was a pacifist.hanna testified that by treating soldiers,she would be repleting the force and assisting it in waging war.she stated that her objection to war was based on her religious upbringing,her personal belief system and christian theology.
hanna further testified that there was a distinction between serving in the army and working at a civilian hospital that provides abortions.hanna reasoned that a civilian hospital is not an organization that is dedicated to war.by treating soldiers,she would be assisting the army to wage war,whereas at a civilian hospital,she had the option to refrain from participating in abortions.she stated that she had no offer or prospects for private practice if her co application was granted.
in addition to hearing the testimony of witnesses,the io reviewed hanna co application,her hpsp application,the reports of the chaplain and psychiatrist,the powers memorandum and attached documents,the letters of support from coptic clergy members and hanna professional supervisors,and various research materials related to eastern orthodox churches.
the io concluded that hanna sincerely opposed participation in war in any form because of her religious,moral and ethical beliefs.in his report,the io observed that hanna was open,cooperative,courteous and sincere during the hearing.he concluded that she was 
sincere and very credible i was impressed by cpt hanna sincere expressions of her beliefs and her interaction with father bishara in person and father henein by telephone at the hearing.i was left with the impression that she was a devout member of the coc and sincerely held the beliefs she professed in her co application.
the io found that hanna objection to war became fixed in.he credited hanna testimony that when she applied to join the military in her belief system was still developing and,in fact,she was experiencing doubts as to the existence of god.he also credited her explanation of how her beliefs developed from the death of her father in through the summer and fall of,when she began to view war from a christian perspective.the io concluded his report by stating 
i assessed hanna credibility at the hearing and considered the opinions as to her sincerity honesty proffered by fathers bishara and henein,philip hess,father megally,and stephanie jones,i concluded that cpt hanna is an honest and truthful person and credited her statements that her beliefs became incompatible with military service in october.
the io also discussed the reports of the chaplain and the psychiatrist,as well as the powers memorandum.the io concluded that the chaplain was incorrect in his opinion that the coc is not supportive of conscientious objectors.he noted that two coptic priests had testified that the coc supports conscientious objectors,and that this testimony was consistent with materials he reviewed regarding the treatment of war by eastern orthodox religions.the io also noted that,under army regulations,an applicant personal convictions dominate over the teachings of her church,so long as they derive from the person moral,ethical,or religious beliefs.the io found that 
i n addition to her involvement with the coc,cpt hanna made reference to her personal research into christian philosophy and the development of her own,individual beliefs as to god and morality and her personal moral belief system.i find that in the case of cpt hanna,her opposition to war in all forms is derived from moral,ethical and religious beliefs and that her beliefs are sincerely held.
regarding the chaplain views on hanna work at a hospital that provides abortions,the io credited hanna explanation that serving in the military is not analogous to working in a civilian hospital.the io concluded that hanna work at a hospital that provides abortions and her willingness to treat police officers and gang members had no bearing on the sincerity of her objection to war.
turning to the powers memorandum,the io credited hanna testimony that she did not know the other anesthesiologists who had submitted co applications.the io also commented that no adverse inference could be drawn from the fact that hanna had hired an attorney experienced in co applications because a prudent person would not pay attorney fees to someone who did not have the requisite experience to provide effective representation.the io further noted that hanna attorney was a west point graduate,that he had served on active duty,and that he had previously represented numerous soldiers who were seeking to be retained by the army.
regarding the psychiatrist report,the io stated that the psychiatrist admitted during testimony that his report contained several errors,including an incorrect characterization of hanna beliefs as not based on any religious conviction.in his testimony,the psychiatrist clarified his opinion that while cpt hanna beliefs were not anchored in the tenets of a particular religion they were a product of her personal faith system.the io commented that he interpreted the psychiatrist testimony to mean that hanna beliefs were a product of her personal relationship with god.the io also noted that the powers memorandum,which the psychiatrist reviewed before hanna interview,may have prompted the psychiatrist to engage in an unnecessarily involved discussion of the issues in the memo,particularly her choice of attorney,putting hanna on the defensive and possibly influencing hanna demeanor during the interview,which the psychiatrist reported as tense and guarded.the io found that,in contrast,hanna demeanor during the hearing was open,cooperative,courteous and sincere.
the io report was forwarded to officers up the chain of command,each of whom recommended approval of hanna application based on their findings that hanna sincerely opposed participation in war because of her religious beliefs.colonel robert marsh found that hanna church involvement does not appear to be a recent effort to avoid military service.colonel marsh further stated that t he strength and intensity of her evolving convictions against war and violence,beginning with the death of her father in may and becoming firm by october,are reflective of sincere belief and are supported by clear and convincing evidence.a staff judge advocate sja recommended approval after concluding that t he investigating officer conducted a thorough inquiry into hanna convictions.numerous witnesses were called on her behalf.the sja noted that after the death of her father,hanna felt free to consider the contradiction in her religious beliefs and the army mission.the sja further commented that hanna application is not a means to avoid her military commitment.brigadier general todd semonite found,after thoroughly reviewing the file,that hanna objection was sincerely held and that t he solemnity of her convictions is clear throughout the investigation and they do not appear to have been born of a desire to avoid service.general semonite emphasized that his conclusion was based on the investigating officer credibility determination,cpt hanna testimony,and the opinions of the leaders of her church.
hanna application was ultimately reviewed by the dacorb,which voted to reject it.the president of the board voted to disapprove the application,stating 
applicant has shown that she is a devout coptic christian but has failed to show that she sincerely meets the co criteria.her statements are logical but lack passion and sincerity they appear as repetition rather than personally held beliefs.
the chaplain voted to disapprove the application,stating 
the statement by the priest that the coc does not teach pacifism leads one to believe that there is more to cpt.hanna position then merely religious conviction.also,her timing is too convenient completion of her schooling and her entry on active duty.
the staff judge advocate voted to approve the application,finding that the applicant has a firm,fixed and sincere objection to participation in war in any form.
hanna petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court,after a lengthy and detailed review of the record,held that there was no basis in fact for the dacorb decision and granted hanna petition permanently enjoining the army from ordering hanna to active duty 
the army timely appealed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant or denial of habeas de novo.healy spencer,cir.our review of conscientious objector claims turns on whether a basis in fact exists for the military decision.bates commander,first coast guard district,cir citing estep united states.lobis sec y of the united states air force,cir.denial of an application will be upheld on review if there is a basis in fact for the decision.hager sec y of the air force,cir.although this standard of review is a narrow one,it is not toothless.a basis in fact will not find support in mere disbelief or surmise as to the applicant motivation.rather,the government must show some hard,reliable,provable facts which would provide a basis for disbelieving the applicant sincerity,or it must show something concrete in the record which substantially blurs the picture painted by the applicant.id.the dacorb reasons for its decision must be grounded in logic and a mere suspicion is an inadequate basis in fact.id 
ii.whether there was a basis in fact for the dacorb decision 
the army attack on the district court decision is narrowly focused.it argues first that the timing of her application casts doubt on her sincerity and that her explanations for the change in her beliefs were inconsistent.second,it argues that her beliefs were not gained through rigorous training,study or contemplation.we address each of those contentions in turn 
a.the army first argument is that the late crystallization of hanna opposition to war coupled with inconsistencies in her explanations for the change in her beliefs provide a basis in fact for the decision.
the army concedes,as it must,that t he timing of an application alone is never enough to furnish a basis in fact to support a disapproval.ar.see also hager,at it is universally the law that late crystallization of conscientious objector convictions is not a sufficient basis in fact to reject the claim.a sincere conscientious objector is entitled to release from his service obligations whether his view crystallizes late or early.lobis,at citing ehlert united states,d.if decisive weight could be given to timing,there would be nothing to prevent the services from indulging an absolute presumption against late crystallization id 
in an effort to fortify its timing argument,the army points to what it regards as inconsistencies in hanna explanation as evidence of insincerity.in her co application,hanna stated that in,when she applied for the hpsp scholarship,she was experiencing a period of change and uncertainty that greatly tested her faith and her proximity to the church.she further stated that during this time,she questioned everything,turning to atheism for several months,followed by agnosticism.the army contrasts this description with her application,in which hanna described her activities and achievements as an undergraduate and expressed a desire to take on the myriad challenges of serving in the army and practicing medicine.the army argues that hanna motivation statement,which reflects hanna,driven nature and her ability to overcome obstacles in her life based on her strength and determination is inconsistent with the statement in her co application that she applied for the hpsp scholarship during a time of change and uncertainty.the army argues that the dacorb could have found hanna explanations to be inconsistent and hence evidence of insincerity.
the first response to this argument is that it rests on pure speculation.nothing in the dacorb decision suggests that any dacorb member had found hanna explanations to be inconsistent.the statements of the president and the chaplain are sufficiently specific that had they found hanna to be insincere on the basis of inconsistencies in her explanations,one would have expected one or the other to have said so moreover,the army interpretive gloss on hanna statements can not pass muster as hard,reliable provable facts which would provide a basis for disbelieving the applicant sincerity something concrete in the record.hager,at koh secretary of the air force,cir finding of insincerity was supported by basis in fact where applicant,who had submitted her application one month after receiving active duty orders,had made two previous applications for discharge based on grounds other than opposition to war and had enrolled in a medical training program conflicting with her military commitment.
in any event,we do not find hanna explanations to be inconsistent.that hanna might have questioned her religious beliefs at the time when she applied for the hpsp is not inconsistent with her being highly motivated to attend medical school and join the military during that same period.the io credited hanna testimony that her personal belief system was not fully developed and that she had not give n much thought to the morality of war at the time she applied to the hpsp.as the io noted,eight years had passed between hanna application to join the army and her application for discharge.we think that was more than sufficient time for crystallization.see lobis,at.
here,as in lobis,the army has blotted out entirely the finding of sincerity made by its own investigating officer.at.after conducting a hearing at which he heard testimony from hanna and other witnesses and examined documentary evidence,the io concluded that cpt.hanna is an honest and truthful person and credited her statements that her beliefs became incompatible with military service in october.he found hanna to be sincere and her beliefs to be sincerely held.when the io recommendation was forwarded to the officers in the chain of command,it was endorsed at each level.at the first level,the commanding officer of the human resources command found that hanna has provided clear and convincing evidence supporting her request for conscientious objector co status and discharge.the staff judge advocate found that the evidence supports the findings of the investigating officer.finally,the commanding general,in his recommendation to the dacorb,stated that hanna has put forth clear and convincing evidence that she is opposed to participation in war in any form based on her religious,moral and ethical beliefs.where,as here,the applicant has established her sincerity to the satisfaction of the officer charged with investigating her application and has provided a plausible explanation for the late crystallization of her beliefs,inferences of insincerity drawn from the timing of the application are insufficient objective facts to provide a for rejecting the claim.lobis,at.
b.the army second argument in support of the dacorb decision is that hanna application does not comply with army regulations.citing the regulations,it argues that hanna beliefs were not gained through rigorous training,study or contemplation.instead,it points out,according to her application,her beliefs crystallized in october when she watched war documentaries and a television program discussing war and violence and their destructive roles.thus,she has failed to show that her beliefs were developed through activity comparable in rigor and dedication to the processes by which traditional religious convictions are formulated.c ii.
this argument too is an rationalization which finds no support in the dacorb decision or in the record.in any event,it lacks merit.
the regulation on which the army relies states 
ii relevant factors to be considered in determining an applicant claim of conscientious objection include training in the home and church general demeanor and pattern of conduct participation in religious activities whether ethical or moral convictions were gained through training,study,contemplation,or other activity comparable in rigor and dedication to the processes by which traditional religious convictions are formulated credibility of the applicant and credibility of persons supporting the claim.
c ii emphasis added.
the army argument misreads its regulation.the reference to rigor and dedication appears in the context of comparing traditional religious convictions with ethical or moral convictions.the rigor and dedication consideration applies only to applicants whose objections stem purely from secular beliefs,ethical and moral convictions,as opposed to those whose objections are based on traditional religious conviction.see welsh united states,d holding that an applicant whose beliefs are purely ethical or moral in source and content is as much entitled to a religious conscientious objector exemption as is someone who derives his conscientious opposition to war from traditional religious convictions rogowskyj conway,wl,at,holding regulation applicable w hen,as here,an applicant does not claim adherence to a traditional religion.the army reading would obliterate the distinction between objectors asserting purely moral or ethical grounds and those whose objection is based on traditional religious convictions and would render the regulation nonsensical 
the dissent acknowledges hanna religious convictions but argues that her objection to war can not be religious because pacifist views are not part of her church doctrine.it is well settled that membership in a church that does not teach conscientious objection does not render an applicant beliefs.united states seeger,d.an applicant objection may be religious though she belongs to no church at all,or an applicant may through religious reading reach a conviction against participation in war though she belongs to a church that is not opposed to war.id.see also clay united states,d holding applicant objection sincere where based on tenets of the muslim religion as he understands them emphasis added.in bates commander,first coast guard,cir,we rejected the military argument that the applicant opposition to war was derived from a secular personal code simply because conscientious objection was not an essential tenet of his religious faith.noting that the applicant religious belief was amply documented and that the applicant identified as his religious faith a social kinship with jesus,the court held that great weight must be attributed to a registrant claim that his belief is rooted in religious faith.this is particularly compelling where there has been a finding of sincerity id.at citing seeger,at.the army must evaluate whether the beliefs professed by a registrant are sincerely held and whether they are,in his own scheme of things,religious.seeger,at.indeed,the army own regulations recognize that an applicant opposition to war may be religious in nature even though her church does not teach conscientious objection.see ar.c iii d disagreement with tenets of church does not necessarily discredit claim,so long as objection derives from the person moral,ethical,or religious beliefs.
in her co application,hanna identified herself as christian and christianity as the source of her objection to war.she explained in detail her belief that christianity required her to refrain from participation in war.the io found,based on hanna testimony and the testimony and letters of several coptic priests that knew her personally,that hanna was a devout member of the coptic orthodox church.he found her to be sincerely opposed to war in any form because of religious as well as moral and ethical beliefs.the fact that documentaries contributed to hanna view that there is a conflict between her religious faith and her military service does not mean that her beliefs are purely ethical or moral or that they lack religious grounding.as hanna explained in her co application,the documentaries caused her to view all war from a christian perspective complete separation from god.indeed,the dacorb did not question hanna religious belief.the president acknowledged that hanna is a devout coptic christian,and the chaplain thought that there is more to cpt.hanna position than merely religious conviction.
thus the army citation of aguayo harvey,is inapposite.there the court upheld a denial of co status where the applicant beliefs did not have a religious foundation and the applicant had failed to identify the source of his objection to war.id.at.the court reasoned that the applicant had failed to show that his ethical objection to war had developed through activity comparable in rigor to the processes by which religious convictions are formed.id.here,because hanna objection to war stems from religious convictions,the regulation provides no basis in fact for the army decision to deny hanna application 
iii.remand 
finally,the army argues that even if we find that there is no factual basis for the dacorb decision,we must remand to the dacorb for additional proceedings.because the army raised this argument for the first time in its reply brief,the issue is waived.waste management holdings,mowbray,cir stating that w e have held,with a regularity bordering on the monotonous,that issues advanced for the first time in an appellant reply brief are deemed waived.
even if there were some reason why this appeal should escape this settled principle and we discern none,remand wou
