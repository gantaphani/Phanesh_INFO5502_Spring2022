we confront here a situation in which two persons,both expressly stating an inability to serve as fair and impartial jurors,found their way onto the jury that convicted frank virgil and sentenced him to thirty years in prison.virgil,now seeking a writ of habeas corpus,contends that counsel failure to challenge for cause these two jurors deprived him of his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.we agree and hold that the state court decision to the contrary was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.
frank virgil was convicted and sentenced to thirty years in prison for causing bodily injury to an elderly person in violation of texas penal code his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal and his petition for discretionary review was denied virgil,proceeding pro se,initiated state habeas proceedings,and the court ordered defense counsel,john carrigan,to file an affidavit in accordance with the guidelines set out in ex parte morse the texas court of criminal appeals denied virgil petition on the findings of the trial court without hearing or written order.
again proceeding pro se,virgil sought federal habeas relief under,claiming,among other things,ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court denied virgil habeas petition and,sua sponte,denied virgil a certificate of appealability coa virgil timely filed a notice of appeal.
a single judge of this court granted a coa on the issue of whether virgil counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge for cause biased jurors,finding that the affidavit submitted by virgil counsel in connection with the state habeas proceeding fell short of demonstrating sound trial strategy inasmuch as he failed to explain why he did not challenge for cause the five jurors that virgil identified as being biased.thus,c ounsel strategy appears to have been so ill chosen that it permeate d the entire trial with obvious unfairness.the judge denied a coa on all other issues.
virgil ineffective assistance of counsel claim centers on the performance of his attorney during voir dire.specifically,virgil contends that carrigan was ineffective for failing to challenge for cause roger sumlin,thomas sims,eva saddler,grant faulconer,and mary jarboe the challenged jurors all members of the venire that sat on the petit jury.virgil argues that each of the five challenged jurors stated during voir dire that they could not be fair and impartial in his case.as part of our analysis in deciding ineffective assistance of counsel claims is to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time,we provide an extended discussion of the voir dire proceeding.
carrigan strategy during voir dire appears to center around a single question.specifically,carrigan stated 
my general question to each of you is this and i may ask each of you individually let assume in a hypothetical case,you as a necessarily in this jury panel,but in any kind of find out that a defendant has been convicted before of an offense which is not the same offense for which that person is charged and which you are on a jury,would you served on that particular jury,would you believe that defendant who had a prior case filed against him would you believe him at all or disbelieve him at all 
in other words,would you give that defendant the same benefit of credibility as you would anybody else if you do mind,i like to go down the list simply by juror numbers 
carrigan proceeded to ask each venireperson the above question,varying the phrasing at times to ask whether they could be fair with respect to the testimony of a person convicted of a prior offense of the venirepersons struck with peremptory challenges,all but one responded in a fashion similar to the five challenged jurors.
with three of the challenged jurors,saddler,faulconer,and jarboe,their response to this question was essentially their only testimony during voir dire.the following colloquy occurred 
carrigan okay,is that saddler 
a venireman yes.no.
carrigan you could not be fair 
a venireman no.
carrigan faulconer 
a venireman no.
carrigan johnson 
a venireman no.
carrigan jarboe 
a venireman 
both sumlin and sims responded in similar fashion to carrigan general question.specifically,
carrigan all right.okay.is it.roger sumlin.
a venireman my answer would be no.
carrigan you would not believe that witness.
a venireman i would tend not to believe that witness.
carrigan okay.sims,would you be able to believe a witness under those circumstances 
a venireman 
both sumlin and sims volunteered additional testimony that virgil now contends illustrates their inability to be impartial jurors.carrigan asked the venire whether relationships with officers would prejudice them as jurors in virgil case.of the challenged jurors,only sumlin responded 
carrigan okay.how many on this panel have either been prior police officers,peace officers or related to someone in law enforcement a whole bunch of you.
well,let me put it this way if you were chosen on this jury panel,is there anything about your prior experience with having been related to a peace officer that would disqualify you or cause you to be prejudiced against a criminal defendant 
any of you that held up your hand,do you think you would be prejudiced against the defendant from any way because of your association with any person in your family or anyone that you have known was a peace officer anyone would be prejudiced at all.
carrigan okay.anyone else on that second row you number 
a venireman sumlin.
a venireman.and my concern would be repeated offenses,a pattern of past behavior,repeated offenses.
carrigan okay.but have you had any association in the past with police officers in your family or friends 
a venireman yes,i have relatives.i just saying from their experience that they told me about,repeated offenders.
carrigan so therefore you could not serve as an impartial juror in this case 
a venireman perhaps not.
carrigan is your answer no or yes 
a venireman i would say 
as carrigan concluded voir dire,he asked a final,question concerning prejudice.of the challenged jurors,only sims responded 
carrigan i guess what i asking each of you is is there anything in your background which would cause you to be prejudiced or have an unfavorable opinion against a defendant charged with such a crime 
is there anything in anybody background that would cause you not to be a fair and impartial juror in virgil case,in this particular case,at this particular time,in this courtroom 
carrigan anyone else your number 
a venireman.
carrigan you sims 
a venireman yeah.i do know that it going to be partial or impartial,but my mother was mugged and they never found the mugger.the thought keeps crossing my mind while we talking about this,as far as assault on an elderly person.so it weighing me because of the fact that they never did find the person.i thinking about that.
carrigan would this cause you to be a juror who could not be fair and impartial in this case 
a venireman yeah,i believe so.
carrigan all right.not believe or is it so 
a venireman i said yes,i do believe so.
carrigan okay.thank you.i do know what else i can ask you folks.
this sets out the bulk of the testimony of the five challenged jurors at no point during voir dire did counsel attempt to clarify,confirm,or rehabilitate this testimony.moreover,the trial judge never expressed any concern regarding the statements by the five challenged jurors regarding their ability to be fair.
as this case comes to us under,our review is limited by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,which provides that habeas relief may not be granted unless the state court proceeding resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.a merely incorrect state court decision is not sufficient to constitute an unreasonable application of federal law rather,the decision must be objectively unreasonable habeas relief is inappropriate when a state court,at a minimum,reaches a satisfactory conclusion.
because we review only the reasonableness of a state court ultimate decision,the aedpa inquiry is not altered when,as in this case,state habeas relief is denied without a written opinion in this situation,we assume that the state court applied the proper clearly established federal law,and then determine whether its decision was contrary to or an objectively unreasonable application of that law.virgil ineffective assistance of counsel claim involves mixed questions of law and fact we review the federal district court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo 
our criminal justice system rests firmly on the proposition that before a person liberty can be deprived,guilt must be found,beyond a reasonable doubt,by an impartial decisionmaker.the sixth amendment provides in part in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.put simply,t he right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial,indifferent jurors.
the supreme court has unfailingly protected the jury room from juror bias in a variety of contexts,recognizing,for instance,that extensive pretrial publicity can taint the pool of prospective jurors to a substantial degree,warranting reversal of any conviction stemming from such hostility likewise,the supreme court polices the exercise of peremptory challenges,refusing to allow conviction when a prosecutor measures of fitness for jury service are impermissible and this is consistent with the court view that the impartial jury is critical in determining guilt and punishment 
most relevant here are the supreme court decisions concerning biased decisionmakers.starting with tumey ohio the court has consistently found a breakdown in the adversarial process when the judge has a direct financial interest in the outcome of the proceedings.i t certainly violates the fourteenth amendment and deprives a defendant in a criminal case of due process of law to subject his liberty or property to the judgment of a court,the judge of which has a direct,personal,and substantial pecuniary interest in reaching a conclusion against him in his case.this is so,despite the fact that men of the highest honor and the greatest could serve as a decisionmaker without danger of injustice and despite sincere protests by interested judges that they can be fair 
the clarity of the supreme court reading of the simple command of the sixth that liberty will not be deprived until guilt is found beyond a reasonable doubt by an impartial evidenced by its consistent application by our sister circuits under factual circumstances quite similar to those in this case.virgil directs our attention to the sixth circuit decision in hughes united states.there,in response to a question from the judge concerning whether the venireperson could be fair in this case,one venireperson indicated that her relationship with officers would affect her impartiality.specifically,the following colloquy occurred 
juror i have a nephew on the police force in wyandotte,and i know a couple of detectives,and i quite close to em.
the court anything in that relationship that would prevent you from being fair in this case 
juror i do think i could be fair.
the court you do think you could be fair 
the court okay.anybody else okay.where did we leave off 
neither the court nor defendant counsel with the potential juror,and defense counsel made no attempt to remove the juror with a peremptory or challenge.with only this testimony,the sixth circuit found the potential juror actually biased against the defendant 
the sixth circuit relied,in part,on this court opinion in united states nell,which found actual bias on the part of a venireperson that expressed a strong dislike for unions there,a defendant appealed the denial of challenges to two jurors.this court ordered a new trial,finding both jurors actually biased and noting that d oubts about the existence of actual bias should be resolved against permitting the juror to serve.both the sixth circuit,in hughes,and this court,in nell,found it telling that neither venireperson ever stated that they would be able to render a fair and impartial verdict 
we are also mindful that certain errors in the trial process are so basic to a fair trial as to defy harmless error review it is clearly established that the supreme court views the denial of the right to an impartial decisionmaker to be such an error that taints any resulting conviction with constitutional infirmity although we do not hold that a structural error alone is sufficient to warrant a presumption of prejudice in the ineffective assistance of counsel context the fundamental nature of such the right to an impartial as an important guidepost in our evaluation of whether the state court denial of virgil ineffective assistance of counsel claim was objectively unreasonable under aedpa.more so,the supreme court treatment of the right to an impartial jury is more than a mere backdrop to our analysis it is the lens through which we must examine counsel performance in this case to that,we now turn.
we granted virgil a coa to determine whether counsel was ineffective in failing to use challenges for cause to remove biased jurors.to succeed,virgil must meet the familiar test from strickland washington deficient performance and prejudice 
to prove deficient performance under strickland,a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.we give substantial deference to counsel performance,applying the strong presumption that counsel performed adequately and exercised reasonable professional judgment.because we must make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,a conscious and informed decision on trial tactics and strategy can not be the basis for constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel unless it is so ill chosen that it permeates the entire trial with obvious unfairness.
virgil contends that his counsel was constitutionally deficient in failing to challenge for cause the five challenged jurors who were actually and admittedly biased.the state responds,first,that the challenged jurors statements that they were disinclined to believe a witness with a prior conviction do not show bias toward virgil.second,the state offers several justifications for keeping two of the challenged jurors on the jury.
counsel performance in response to the testimony of three of the challenged,faulconer,and not deficient under strickland.each juror testified,with merely a single no answer,that they could not fairly consider the testimony of a person with a prior conviction this answer must be considered in context with the initial question asked by carrigan as well as the subsequent modifications.first,carrigan asked,would you give a defendant with a prior conviction the same benefit of credibility as you would anybody else then,after an objection by the prosecutor,carrigan restated the question is a witness who has a prior criminal case,if you are on a jury,is that witness worthy of belief in context,we can not say that it is unreasonable to conclude that the no answers from saddler,faulconer,and jarboe merely indicate that,as between a witness with a prior conviction and a witness without,they are more likely to believe the witness without a prior conviction.
this is,at its heart,an honest answer.given that evidence of a prior conviction is admissible because it bears on the credibility of the witness the response of the potential jurors hardly suggests a showing of bias.rather,the law accepts the natural inference that a prior conviction lessens the credibility of a witness.we suspect that most potential jurors would be inclined to disbelieve the testimony of a person with a prior conviction.moreover,the supreme court has never required that jurors come ready to serve with a blank slate,without preconception or understanding of the real world.as the supreme court noted in irvin dowd,
to hold that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to guilt or innocence of an accused,without more,is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror impartiality would be to establish an impossible standard.it is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court 
the reality is that the role of the juror in our government would be weakened if our system expected each juror to lack any sense of who is or is not testifying truthfully,and we are not convinced that this testimony alone would give rise to a valid challenge under texas law such a limited and natural response is insufficient to raise any obligation on the part of counsel to respond with a peremptory or challenge.as such,we can not conclude that the state court decision was an unreasonable application of federal law.
we find merit,however,to virgil finding of fault with counsel lack of response in the face of express statements by sumlin and sims conceding bias against virgil.sumlin stated that his relationship with officers would preclude him from serving as an impartial juror sims,likewise,volunteered that his mother mugging was weighing on him as to whether he could be partial or impartial,finally concluding that he could not be fair and impartial.we hold that sumlin and sims unchallenged statements during voir dire that they could not be fair and impartial obligated virgil counsel to use a peremptory or challenge on these jurors.not doing so was deficient performance under strickland 
moreover,defense counsel conclusory affidavit,submitted in connection with the state habeas proceedings,fails to rehabilitate his performance,as it lacks any suggestion of a trial strategy for not using peremptory or challenges on sumlin and sims.in relevant part,counsel affidavit provides 
i spent approximately thirty minutes talking to and questioning the jury in this case.i was able to ask all of the questions that i thought were necessary to determine if there was any prejudice or bias against my client.i was also able to question the potential jurors regarding any issues that i thought might arise in this case.
in determining the final jurors,i used all peremptory strikes that were available to me.i have reviewed the record and confirmed the number of strikes i used in this case.i struck all persons whom i thought had some type of bias,prejudice or issue based upon my voir dire.
this is lacking in two respects.first,it speaks only of peremptory challenges and fails to indicate why challenges were not used against sumlin and sims.as we have noted,counsel error in this case was the failure to use either a peremptory or a challenge on sumlin and sims.second,counsel affidavit fails to explain why the answers given by sumlin and sims did not indicate prejudice or bias against virgil.in light of the statements of sumlin and sims and absent some explanation for keeping them on the jury,we consider counsel failure to use a peremptory or challenge on sumlin and sims to be constitutionally deficient.
we must also reject the state attempt to support counsel affidavit with justifications for keeping sumlin and sims on the jury.specifically,the state notes that sumlin,in response to a question from the state,testified that he favored a criminal justice system over a system,an answer favorable to the defendant.in addition,sims testimony regarding his mother mugging occurred at the end of voir dire,which,according to the state,may have been a effort to avoid jury service.
we are not persuaded.these arguments have little relevance to our inquiry,and counsel action in response to other venirepersons illustrates why.virgil counsel exercised peremptory challenges on timothy bockmier and pamela oliver,two venirepersons who offered testimony similar to sumlin.each favored a criminal justice system,but also testified that they could not be fair with respect to the testimony of a person with a prior conviction neither the state,nor counsel in his affidavit,give any reason why bockmier and oliver should be struck while sumlin should not,especially given sumlin testimony regarding his relationship with officers.similarly,counsel used a peremptory challenge on lisa fitch who testified,like sims,that she could not fairly consider the testimony of a person with a prior conviction yet also like sims,fitch testified near the end of voir dire that her experience in nursing homes,seeing the rough treatment of the elderly,may prejudice her in some way 
both justifications are equally applicable to veniremembers that were struck by virgil counsel,and both justifications were offered by the state,not by virgil counsel.when trial counsel presents an affidavit attempting to justify his performance at trial for facially unexplainable conduct,the justifications not evident on the record and presented for the first time in response to a petition for writ of habeas corpus by the state have little value.thus,respecting the supreme court caution in strickland that the purpose of the effective assistance guarantee of the sixth amendment is not to improve the quality of legal representation,we find counsel performance in this case to be constitutionally deficient and the state court decision to the contrary to be objectively unreasonable.
a showing of constitutionally deficient performance is not sufficient to sustain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under strickland.virgil must traverse two additional burdens he must establish that counsel deficient performance prejudiced his defense then,he must show that the state court decision to the contrary was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.we conclude that virgil has met each burden.
our inquiry into strickland prejudice is tailored to our conclusions under strickland performance.since we did not find counsel performance with respect to jurors saddler,faulconer,and jarboe to be constitutionally deficient,our inquiry is only whether virgil defense was prejudiced by counsel failure to challenge for cause jurors sumlin and sims.furthermore,we examine only sumlin and sims testimony regarding their inability to be impartial jurors 
strickland prejudice standard is a phrase in the inferior federal courts the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.that prejudice shorthand is guided by principles underlying the sixth amendment right to effective counsel,and it is those principles that the state court virgil ineffective assistance of counsel afoul of in this case 
strickland prejudice inquiry is given counsel deficient performance,do we have confidence in the process afforded the criminally accused the purpose of the sixth amendment guarantee of counsel is to ensure that a defendant has the assistance necessary to justify reliance on the outcome of the proceeding.prejudice is presumed in a narrow category of cases none of which are present here.absent mechanical rules,the ultimate focus of the inquiry must be on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is being challenged.we focus on ferreting out unreliable results caused by a breakdown in the adversarial process that our system counts on to produce just results.guiding our prejudice inquiry,the supreme court requires lower federal courts to presume that the judge or jury acted according to law.most importantly for our purposes,the assessment of prejudice should proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably,conscientiously,and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision.even according the state court the deference warranted under aedpa,these basic principles,encapsulated in strickland prejudice standard,were unreasonably applied by the state court when it denied virgil ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
here,we are confronted with a situation in which,due to counsel failure,two persons,each expressly stating that they were unable to serve as fair and impartial
