petitioner rameen smith,who was convicted in a new york state state court in of robbery,grand larceny,and criminal possession of stolen property,for which he was sentenced to a determinate term of a total of years imprisonment,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,john gleeson,judge,denying his habeas corpus petition pursuant to.smith alleged principally that his right to be free from double jeopardy was violated when,after he had been imprisoned for years but had not been released because of additional convictions,the sentencing court resentenced him in order to add to his sentence a term of supervision or prs whose imposition had been required as a matter of new york law.the district court,applying the standards set forth in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,denied the petition on the ground that the new york court rejection of smith constitutional challenges to the resentencing neither was contrary to,nor involved an unreasonable application of,united states supreme court precedent.on appeal,smith contends that the appellate division ruling was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,the supreme court decisions in hill united states ex rel.wampler,wampler,and united states difrancesco,difrancesco.finding no merit in his contentions,we affirm the judgment.
background 
the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment,which is made applicable to the states by the fourteenth amendment,see benton maryland,provides that no person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy,const.amend.v.this provision protects against,inter alia,multiple punishments for the same offense.difrancesco,at internal quotation marks omitted.it is in this respect that smith contends that his right to be free from double jeopardy has been violated.
smith original sentence 
in,smith was convicted in state court on two counts of robbery in the second degree,one count of grand larceny in the fourth degree,and one count of criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree.he was sentenced in april,as amended in may nunc pro tunc,to concurrent prison terms of varying types and lengths,including determinate terms of years on the robbery counts,resulting in a determinate sentence totaling years imprisonment original sentence or sentence.
when smith was sentenced,the new york penal law provided that e ach determinate sentence also includes,as a part thereof,an additional period of supervision,penal law mckinney.smith sentence,though determinate,did not indicate that supervision was included.
in,was amended to provide that,when imposing a determinate sentence,the sentencing judge shall state the period of supervision,penal law mckinney.in the same legislation,additional procedures were introduced to deal with cases in which the imposition of prs should have been,but was not,stated by the court at sentencing.see generally people williams,cert.denied.
smith resentencing 
as smith had been in custody during his prosecution for the above crimes,his prison term would have been due to end in,see penal law mckinney.however,smith committed two additional crimes during his imprisonment he was convicted of promoting prison contraband in the first degree in and in.for the conviction,he was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of years,to be consecutive to his determinate term,thereby postponing his release by two years,see penal law d mckinney if the defendant is serving one or more indeterminate sentences of imprisonment and one or more determinate sentence of imprisonment which run consecutively,the minimum term or terms of the indeterminate sentence or sentences and the term or terms of the determinate sentence or sentences are added to arrive at an aggregate maximum term of imprisonment that is no t less than the term or maximum term of imprisonment of the sentence which has the longest unexpired time to run.emphases added.for his conviction of promoting prison contraband,smith was sentenced to a consecutive indeterminate prison term of one years,further extending his prison stay,see id.
in december,the new york state department of correctional services,now known as the department of corrections and community supervision collectively doccs,sent a letter to the judge who had imposed smith sentence the sentencing judge with a copy to smith stating that although smith had been given a determinate sentence of imprisonment,for which required the imposition of a period of prs,the sentence and commitment order received by doccs did not indicate that prs had been imposed.doccs cited a statutory provision that requires it to notify the court whenever it appears to doccs that a defendant determinate sentence does not include prs,see correction law and mckinney,so that the court may take steps with respect to a resentencing.section provides that when a court has received such a notice,if the court determines,after reviewing the record,that a prs term was not announced at sentencing,the court shall,inter alia,appoint counsel for the defendant,give notice to the parties,and commence a proceeding to consider whether to resentence.id.and.
smith sentencing judge commenced the required review of the sentence in early and found that no prs term had been imposed.smith opposed any resentencing to impose prs,pointing out that he had already been in prison for more than the years imposed in the original sentence.he stated that he thus had an expectation that his punishment for his original crimes had become final and argued that the imposition of the additional penalty of prs in therefore violated his right to be free from double jeopardy.
in response,the state argued that under,smith and convictions while he was serving his sentence resulted in a single aggregate sentence,which had not yet been completed.although smith would have had a legitimate expectation of finality if he had been released from prison prior to the imposition of prs,he in fact was still serving his aggregate sentence,and thus no legitimate expectation of finality had attached.
the sentencing judge rejected smith double jeopardy challenge the court resentenced him on the counts on which he received a determinate sentence,by reimposing the prison term and adding a term of supervision.see people smith,supreme court,richmond,hearing transcript,march,at.
smith appealed to the appellate division,arguing that the resentencing violated both his right to be free from double jeopardy and his right to due process.that court affirmed the resentence,and the new york court of appeals denied leave to appeal.see people smith,dep t smith,lv.denied,and.the appellate division,in rejecting smith double jeopardy contention,noted,inter alia,that smith was charged with knowledge both that a determinate prison sentence without a term of prs is illegal and,thus,may be corrected by the sentencing court at some point in the future,smith,at,at quoting people williams,at,at,and that,by virtue of penal law,the new york state department of corrections and community supervision aggregates his sentences into a single sentence,smith,at,at citing,inter alia,people brinson,dep t,lv.granted,aff.
the appellate division noted that a legitimate expectation in the finality of a sentence arises and the double jeopardy clause prevents reformation to attach a prs component to the original completed sentence after release from prison,smith,at,at quoting people williams,at,at.it concluded that smith had no legitimate expectation of finality because he had not been released 
p ursuant to penal law d,the defendant determinate sentence was combined with his subsequently imposed consecutive indeterminate sentences,to form a single sentence since the defendant was still serving this single,combined sentence at the time of the resentencing,and had not yet been released from prison,he did not have a legitimate expectation of finality in the portion of his sentence attributable to his convictions of robbery in the second degree 
smith,at,at citing,inter alia,people brinson,at,at emphases added.
the new york court of appeals denied smith motion for leave to appeal that decision,but denied it without prejudice to a renewed motion after the court of appeals resolution of appeals in people brinson,and another case.see people smith.
the court of appeals thereafter affirmed the appellate decision in people brinson on which the appellate division had relied in affirming the resentencing of smith.see people brinson,brinson.the court of appeals reasoning paralleled that of the appellate division in smith.
the brinson court dealt with two cases in which the prisoners original sentences had included determinate sentences but no term of prs.each defendant was resentenced to impose prs at a time when he had been in prison for more than the number of years imposed in his determinate sentence and was still in prison because of his indeterminate sentences.both prisoners claimed that they had completed their determinate sentences and that the imposition of prs violated the fifth amendment double jeopardy clause prohibition against multiple punishments.brinson,at,at.the court of appeals conclude d that the respective resentences do not constitute violations of the double jeopardy clause because defendants do not have a legitimate expectation of finality until they have completed their aggregated sentences under penal law.id.
the fifth amendment double jeopardy clause prohibits multiple punishments for the same crime see united states v difrancesco,us.this prohibition prevents a sentence from being increased once the defendant has a legitimate expectation in the finality of the sentence people v williams,citing difrancesco,us at.however,defendants are presumed to be aware that a determinate prison sentence without a term of prs is illegal and courts have an inherent authority to correct illegal sentences 
brinson,at,at other internal quotation marks omitted emphases ours.under new york law a court no longer has authority to correct an illegal sentence if the time to appeal has expired or the appeal has been completed and the prisoner has been released.see people williams,at,at.the brinson court held that 
a legitimate expectation of finality turns on the completion of a sentence.where multiple sentences are properly aggregated into a single sentence,that expectation arises upon completion of that sentence.
brinson,at,at emphases added see also id.at,at the defendant expectation of finality arises for purposes of double jeopardy when a defendant completes the lawful portion of an illegal sentence and exhausts any appeal taken quoting people lingle,emphasis in lingle.the court concluded that the defendants in the cases before it 
will have a legitimate expectation of finality upon completion of their respective aggregated sentences.until such time,resentencing for purposes of correcting their illegal determinate sentences does not run afoul of the double jeopardy clause and the prohibition against multiple punishments.
brinson,at,at emphasis added.
upon smith motion for leave to appeal the appellate division affirmance of his resentencing,the court of appeals denied leave to appeal.
c.the present habeas proceeding 
smith commenced the present habeas proceeding in,asserting principally that the appellate division affirmance of his resentencing was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,the supreme court decisions in both wampler,which held it impermissible for a sentence imposed by a court to be enlarged by an administrative entity,see also earley murray,cir.earley interpreting wampler holding as rooted in due process,reh g denied,cir,cert.denied,and difrancesco,which smith described as meaning that an individual serving a single determinate sentence could not be resentenced after he had been incarcerated for years petition for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in state custody habeas petition at see id.at.
with respect to federal law as established in wampler,smith asserted principally that 
t he appellate division decision in this case violated the basic principle that the supreme court recognized in wampler,at,that courts must pronounce sentence upon conviction in the defendant presence,and that even a term required by statute is not a part of the sentence unless and until a sentencing judge imposes it.
habeas petition at see also id.at the appellate division entire analysis depended upon a finding that smith was serving a single aggregate sentence calculated by doccs rather than the separate consecutive sentences imposed by three different sentencing courts in,and,a finding precluded by wampler and earley id.at since the sentencing court imposed one discrete sentence,not a sentence that was merged with subsequent convictions,smith is serving separate consecutive sentences,not a single aggregate one.id.at u nder clearly established united states supreme court precedent,for federal double jeopardy purposes,smith sentences were exactly what the three sentencing judges imposed in court,not the product of release date calculations made by doccs under.wampler,at.
with respect to his contention that the new york court affirmance of his resentencing was contrary to or an unreasonable application of the united states supreme court decision in difrancesco,smith asserted that 
e ven if the sentences the court imposed could possibly be construed as having been somehow converted into a single aggregate sentence,the fifth amendment double jeopardy clause prohibited resentencing because smith had,nonetheless,developed a legitimate expectation of finality in the original sentence.
habeas petition at quoting difrancesco,at emphases ours.perhaps recognizing the fallacy of this argument,the argument that he could have a legitimate expectation that a sentence that ha d been converted to a different configuration nonetheless retained its original configuration smith reverted to his invocation of wampler for the proposition that his sentences could not properly be aggregate d except by order of a court 
in wampler,the united states supreme court held that t he only sentence known to the law is the sentence or judgment entered upon the records of the court.at.since smith supposed aggregate sentence was not entered upon the records of the court,the appellate division holding that he was serving such a sentence,and therefore that resentencing did not violate double jeopardy,see united states difrancesco,was contrary to clearly established federal law as decided by the united states supreme court.
habeas petition at emphasis in original.he also concluded that since he 
could only be lawfully serving the sentences the court had imposed,wampler,at,and he had finished serving the determinate sentence to which supervision applied,the state court holdings that he had no expectation of finality that barred resentencing were unreasonable applications of supreme court precedent.
habeas petition at.
the district court,in a memorandum and order dated september,district court order,denied smith petition,ruling as follows 
the appellate division holding that smith service of his illegal determinate sentence did not establish a legitimate expectation of finality that barred correction of that sentence because at the time of the resentencing he was still serving a single,combined sentence that included his two subsequent prison contraband sentences was not contrary to the holding of any court,let alone of the supreme court of the united states.
nor was the appellate division decision objectively unreasonable.indeed,in the supreme court decision united states difrancesco,on which smith relies heavily,the court found that there is no legitimate expectation of finality where the petitioner is charged with knowledge of a statute that would allow for some future alteration in his or her sentence.the appellate division charged smith with knowledge of the new york laws allowing for the aggregation of his sentences into a single sentence and for the correction of sentences from which a mandatory prs term was unlawfully omitted.the state court holding mirrors the language in difrancesco almost exactly.
district court order at.the district court also rejected smith arguments under wampler 
there is no specter here that the defendant punishment was s
