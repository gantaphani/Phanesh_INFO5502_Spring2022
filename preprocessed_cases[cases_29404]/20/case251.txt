kelly saint fort,a haitian and a legal permanent resident of the united states,committed an aggravated felony and so the immigration and naturalization service initiated removal proceedings to deport him.saint fort claimed protection from deportation,deferral of removal,under the united nations convention against torture cat,arguing he would be jailed and tortured if returned to haiti.an immigration judge ij agreed the board of immigration appeals bia,on review,did not.saint fort seeks to have judicial review of his case as a matter of statutory law,he may not petition for review in the court of appeals,given the nature of his claims.this left only habeas corpus jurisdiction,which he invoked in the district court.the district court dismissed the habeas petition for lack of jurisdiction,accepting the government argument.the case is before us on appeal from that dismissal.
the respondent attorney general argues that no court has jurisdiction,even under habeas,to review any aspect of the bia determination.the issue is one of first impression for this court.we reject that argument and hold that habeas jurisdiction remains available here.reviewing saint fort claims about the bia determination under the cat,we reject his claim of denial of due process and so affirm,on that ground,the dismissal of his habeas petition.
saint fort,now years old,entered the united states in,at the age of,and settled in the dorchester area of boston as a lawful permanent resident.in,saint fort was convicted in new hampshire of assault and receiving stolen property,and was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of two to four years.saint fort ashcroft,d.subsequently,removal proceedings were instituted against him as an aggravated felon.see immigration and nationality act ina a a iii,a a iii any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.ina a g,a g aggravated felonies include a theft offense including receipt of stolen property or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.
saint fort responded by requesting asylum,withholding of deportation,and under the cat.because of his status as an aggravated felon,he was ineligible for asylum and withholding of deportation.in a november,hearing before an ij on his cat claim,saint fort presented little evidence to substantiate his fear of torture.he informed the ij that he had no family in haiti,and that if he returned his life would be over.he asserted that deportees were routinely tortured in haiti.when as to the basis for his belief,he said that at least a year earlier he had read an article in a newspaper he thought was called today which said that deportees were being killed in haiti.saint fort did not have a copy of this article at the hearing.saint fort also said that he had friends from the dominican republic who advised him to pray that he not be deported because,if he were,he would certainly be tortured.saint fort did not offer any testimony relating to himself or his family to explain why he might be targeted for mistreatment 
in addition to his testimony,saint fort also submitted supporting documentation,including country reports on haiti and a bia decision on conditions in haiti.that unpublished decision,in re perez,was issued on october,in perez,the bia relied on the state department country report on haiti,which noted in pertinent part that deportees are now being held indefinitely in haitian prisons.conditions in those prisons,the bia stated,were extremely poor,to the point that the health of detainees is severely compromised by lack of adequate food and medical attention.moreover,police forces beat,torture,and otherwise mistreat detainees.as a direct result of these conditions,multiple detainees have died while in custody.the bia concluded that it was more likely than not that the petitioner in perez would be subjected to torture by or with the acquiescence of a public official in haiti.as a result,perez was found to have met his burden of proof under the cat,and he was granted deferral of removal to haiti.
the ij issued an oral decision in saint fort case on the same day as the hearing.he found that,as an aggravated felon,saint fort was statutorily ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal,but eligible for deferred removal under the cat.the ij reviewed country reports on haiti,the bia decision in perez,and saint fort hearing testimony.he noted saint fort testimony that he has no family in haiti,and that he will be tortured if he returns to haiti and is put in jail.the ij concluded that it was more likely than not that saint fort would be imprisoned and tortured if returned to haiti.the ij reasoned,
the reports concerning the conditions of haitian jails lead only to one conclusion,that the respondent return to haiti and being detained and placed in jail in haiti,would subject him to torture,based on the conditions of jails in haiti as stated in the documentation submitted and what is contained in perez.
the ij granted saint fort application for deferred removal under the cat.
the ins appealed the ij decision to the bia.the bia reversed the ij decision,in reliance on an intervening published bia decision and the absence of other evidence from saint fort.that published decision,in re,bia,available at wl,reversed course and found that conditions in haiti jails did not constitute torture under the cat.in,the bia reviewed a case,similar to perez,in which the petitioner on country condition reports,newspaper articles,and a letter from an official at the state prison conditions in haiti amounted to torture.id.at.in a reversal from without citing bia concluded in that the indefinite detention of criminal deportees by haitian authorities did not constitute torture within the meaning of the relevant regulations,a,because there was no evidence that the authorities intentionally and deliberately detain deportees in order to inflict torture.at.citing the decision in,the bia dismissed saint fort appeal and ordered him removed to haiti.
saint fort did not timely apply for reconsideration by the bia he filed a petition for review of the bia decision in the court of appeals under b.this court questioned whether it had jurisdiction in the case because saint fort had been convicted of an aggravated felony,and there was no question as to that fact or the fact that he was not a citizen.see ina a c,a c n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense.saint fort then voluntarily dismissed the petition for review in the court of appeals and turned to the district court.
on june,saint fort filed a petition for habeas corpus with the district court.he alleged that the bia decision violated his statutory and regulatory rights under the ina and the administrative procedure act,and his constitutional rights under the due process and equal protection clauses,because it denied him the opportunity to present evidence of the possibility he will be tortured in haiti,it upset settled expectations established by in re perez,the was arbitrary and inconsistent,and the application of in re was impermissibly retroactive.the government responded that the district court lacked jurisdiction because saint fort had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.saint fort,d at.
the district court expressed skepticism about saint fort petition,noting that a motion to reopen on the basis of new evidence would be futile because saint fort had conceded that he had no new evidence,and also commenting that the debate over retroactivity was somewhat besides the point given that in re did not announce a new rule.id.at.still,on september,the district court remanded the case to the bia for clarification of the grounds of its denial and continued saint fort stay of removal during that period.id.at.the district court said it was troubled by the bia holding that saint fort had offered no evidence to the ij that he would be tortured when,in fact,the ij had both saint fort documentary evidence and his testimony,and when the ij had found saint fort credible.id.at.
the government then filed a motion to reconsider,arguing that the district court had erred in its reading of the bia decision,and that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear saint fort claim because the cat is not.it raised the lack of jurisdiction argument for the first time.specifically,the government argued that congress had authorized the attorney general to promulgate regulations for implementing the cat when it passed the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act farra,div,b,stat.congress also explicitly limited federal court jurisdiction to review any decision on a claim for protection under the cat,by limiting jurisdiction except as part of the review of a final order of removal pursuant to section of the ina.id.d,stat.at.here,there was no review of a final order of removal because of saint fort uncontested status as an aggravated felon as a result,the government contended,there could be no jurisdiction over his claim under the cat.the government attempted to distinguish ins cyr,d,by arguing that,because the cat is not a treaty,congress never affirmatively granted such jurisdiction in the first place.on october,the district court allowed the motion to reconsider and dismissed saint fort habeas petition.saint fort now appeals this ruling.
ii.background 
convention against torture 
the united nations convention against torture and other,cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,res,annex,gaor supp,at,doc,provides that n o state party shall expel,return refouler or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.id.
the cat was ratified by the united states senate in and entered into force for the united states in november.see regulations concerning the convention against torture,background.in october,congress passed farra,which states 
it shall be the policy of the united states not to expel,extradite,or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture 
farra a,stat.at.farra also delegates the responsibility for prescrib ing regulations to implement the obligations of the united states under the cat to heads of the appropriate agencies.id.b.
farra also,under the title review and construction,contains a provision and a zipper clause.
n o court shall have jurisdiction to review the regulations adopted to implement this section,and nothing in this section shall be construed as providing any court jurisdiction to consider or review claims raised under the convention or this section,or any other determination made with respect to the application of the policy set forth in subsection a,except as part of the review of a final order of removal pursuant to section of the immigration and nationality act.
id.d.the provision denies jurisdiction over review of the regulations,and the zipper clause purports to confine review of claims to the specific context of a review of a final order of deportation.thus,for aliens like saint fort who have been convicted of aggravated felonies,the court of appeals jurisdiction to engage in direct review is foreclosed because review is unavailable to such aliens.see ins,d.
the justice department has promulgated a set of regulations implementing farra,in accordance with congressional direction.see,codified at scattered sections of specifically,these regulations define torture as any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.a.the burden of proof is on the applicant to show that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured if removed.id.c see id.a application of standard to deferral of removal.the regulations instruct immigration officials to consider inter alia evidence of past torture inflicted on the applicant and evidence of gross,flagrant or mass violations of human rights within the country of removal.id.c see id.a application to deferral of removal.
habeas corpus jurisdiction in immigration cases 
the writ of habeas corpus has been employed by for centuries in both the united states and britain.see hafetz,note,the untold story of noncriminal habeas corpus and the immigration acts,yale,citing cases and noting that aliens in the united states have been able to challenge their confinement through habeas corpus since the nation founding.even before the federal government took on the task of regulating immigration,federal courts employed the writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the lawfulness of the return of foreign sailors who had allegedly deserted their ships,extradition of aliens accused of crime,and detention of enemy aliens during the war of.neuman,jurisdiction and the rule of law after the immigration act,harv.
before,aliens had a broad right to judicial review in the courts of appeal.aliens facing deportation possessed a general right of appeal from final orders of the bia to the court of appeals under the old ina a repealed.aliens also had two routes to challenge a final order of deportation through employing the writ of habeas corpus.first,old ina itself provided for specific habeas corpus review.a repealed.second,aliens could challenge a deportation order under the general habeas corpus statute,which provides habeas review for individuals in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.id.c.
in,congress passed two laws that dramatically changed judicial review of immigration decisions.see generally goncalves reno,cir,cert.denied,d.the first of these was the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,enacted on april,stat.aedpa repealed old ina habeas provision.id.e,stat.at.in its stead,aedpa added a new provision reading,any final order of deportation against an alien who is deportable by reason of having committed an enumerated crime shall not be subject to review by any court.id.a,stat.at now codified at a c.as in the present case,aliens who had been convicted of a wide range of crimes were thereby barred from petitioning courts of appeal for direct judicial review of their final orders of deportation.
then,on september,congress enacted the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,div.c,stat.under iirira,deportation proceedings were restyled removal proceedings.iirira provided for two sets of rules transitional rules applicable to aliens whose deportation proceedings had commenced prior to april,but who had not received a final order until after october,and permanent rules applying to aliens whose deportation or removal proceeding commenced on or after april.id.c,stat.at id,stat.at.we have discussed iirira transitional rules elsewhere.see goncalves,at.the permanent rules govern this case.
under the permanent rules,iirira perpetuated aedpa jurisdictional ban prohibiting review by any court of an order of removal against an alien aggravated felon.iirira a,stat.at relocating aedpa language to.it provides,in a,that judicial review of a final order of removal is governed only by the procedures for review of agency orders in the court of appeals under.a section entitled consolidation of questions for judicial review provides that j udicial review of all questions of law and fact arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the united states under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section.b.
iirira also added a new subsection,entitled exclusive jurisdiction,which removed jurisdiction from all courts to hear claims arising from the attorney general decision or action to commence proceedings,adjudicate cases,or execute removal orders.iirira a,stat.at,codified at g.this provision had the effect of shielding certain of the attorney general exercises of discretion from judicial scrutiny.the supreme court has since been explicit that this limit on judicial scrutiny applies only to the three discrete actions described in g.see reno,d.
in the wake of aedpa and iirira,federal courts have recognized the redrawn contours of their jurisdiction.because the principles developed in these cases control our interpretation of farra provision and zipper clause,we review them briefly.in goncalves,as here,there was no direct appeal to appellate courts for individuals like goncalves who had been convicted of crimes of moral turpitude.at.we then turned to the question of habeas jurisdiction in the district courts.relying on felker turpin,d,we found it clear that if congress intends to repeal or restrict habeas jurisdiction under,it must say so explicitly.thus,we will not find a repeal of merely by implication,but only by express congressional command.goncalves,at.we concluded that there had been no express repeal of under either aedpa or iirira,id.at,and that there was no implicit repeal in conjunction with aedpa repeal of habeas corpus jurisdiction under old ina,id.at.this holding avoided questions about the outer limits of congress power under article iii to control the jurisdiction of the federal courts.it also obviated the need to address possible suspension clause issues raised by congress actions.id.at.
in mahadeo reno,cir,this court extended goncalves to the permanent rules under iirira,and held that the provisions of iirira precluded direct review in the court of appeals but did not divest district courts of their habeas corpus jurisdiction without an express reference to,we held,there could be no repeal,id.at,particularly because congress had been placed on notice by the decision in felker,three months before iirira was enacted,id.at.congress has shown in enacting iirira that it knows how to use explicit language when it intends to place limitations on judicial review under particular statutes.id.at.mahadeo also rejected the argument that a zipper clause was meant to repeal habeas jurisdiction.id.at.
most importantly,the supreme court decided two cases in addressing the question of habeas corpus review after the legislation.in cyr,d,the court considered the impact of aedpa provision,aedpa e,as well as three provisions under the permanent rules in iirira,including a zipper clause,a,a c,b.the court began with the strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action and the longstanding rule requiring a clear statement of congressional intent to repeal habeas jurisdiction,at,and canons obligating avoidance of serious constitutional questions by an alternative construction,id.at.it concluded that a construction of the amendments at issue that would entirely preclude review of a pure question of law by any court would give rise to substantial constitutional questions.id.at.
noting that at the absolute minimum,the suspension clause protects the writ as it existed in,the cyr court then turned to historical evidence.id.at.quoting felker,at.it found that the historical core of the writ of habeas corpus has been review of the legality of executive detention,and it is in that context that its protections have been strongest.id.it also noted that to conclude that the writ is no longer available in this context would represent a departure from historical practice in immigration law.id.at.
examining the statutory provisions,the court drew a distinction between judicial review and habeas corpus.the term judicial review is the focus of each of the three iirira provisions.in the immigration context,the court reasoned,judicial review and habeas corpus have historically distinct meanings.id.at.citing heikkila barber.in heikkila,the court noted,preclusion of judicial review did not entail cessation of habeas review.id.at.as to the zipper clause,the court held that it was an attempt to consolidate judicial review of immigration proceedings into one action,and did not bar habeas jurisdiction of orders not subject to judicial review.id.at.the absence of an alternative judicial forum also troubled the court 
if it were clear that the question of law could be answered in another judicial forum,it might be permissible to accept the ins reading of.but the absence of such a forum,coupled with the lack of a clear,unambiguous,and express statement of congressional intent to preclude judicial consideration on habeas of such an important question of law,strongly counsels against adopting a construction that would raise serious constitutional questions.accordingly,we conclude that habeas jurisdiction under was not repealed by aedpa and iirira.
id.at.citation omitted.
in a companion case issued the same day,the court affirmed that criminal aliens were precluded from seeking direct review on questions of law in the court of appeals,and must therefore be able to proceed with their habeas petitions 
we agree with petitioners that leaving aliens without a forum for adjudicating claims such as those raised in this case would raise serious constitutional questions.we also agree that these concerns can best be alleviated by construing the provision of iirira not to preclude aliens such as the petitioners from pursuing habeas relief pursuant to.
at.see also zadvydas davis,d habeas corpus jurisdiction not repealed by provisions of aedpa and iirira.
more recently,in demore kim,d,the court rejected the argument that provisions of e deprived federal courts of jurisdiction to entertain a habeas petition from a legal permanent resident detained without bail pending his removal proceeding.the court examined the language of e,which provides 
e judicial review 
the attorney general discretionary judgment regarding the application of this section shall not be subject to review.no court may set aside any action or decision by the attorney general under this section regarding the detention or release of any alien or the grant,revocation,or denial of bond or parole.
it then found that the respondent challenge to the statutory scheme was not an attack on a discretionary judgment by the attorney general or on a decision made by the attorney general regarding detention,and that habeas review was not barred under e.the court made three rulings significant for our purposes it emphasized that,where review of constitutional issues is said to be precluded,congress must be clear in its intent,see webster doe,d it reiterated its requirement in cyr that any repeal of habeas review requires a particularly clear statement that such is congress intent and it read the provision in e as applying only to review of the attorney general discretionary judgment.demore,d,wl,at rehnquist.
iii.existence of habeas jurisdiction 
the initial question presented is whether federal courts possess habeas jurisdiction over claims that arise under the implementing legislation and regulations of the cat,and that are asserted by aliens who are statutorily ineligible for judicial review of their final orders of removal because they have been convicted of aggravated felonies.this is a question of first impression for this circuit.the supreme court decisions in cyr and demore mandate the conclusion that habeas jurisdiction has not been repealed in such cases,as do the controlling precedents in this circuit goncalves and mahadeo.here,there is no statement of congressional intent to preclude review of constitutional claims.there is the absence of explicit language by congress repealing jurisdiction.there is also implied congressional knowledge of judicial precedents interpreting similar provisions the distinction between judicial review and habeas corpus in the immigration context the weight of historical precedent supporting continued habeas review in immigration cases the problem of lack of an alternative forum and the importance of avoiding a construction of farra that would give rise to grave constitutional concerns.the second circuit has also concluded that habeas jurisdiction exists in these circumstances.wang ashcroft,cir.
farra provision refers only to review of regulations its zipper clause provides only that nothing in this section shall be construed as providing any court jurisdiction to consider or review claims raised under the convention or this section,or any other determination made with
