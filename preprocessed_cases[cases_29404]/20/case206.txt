edward was convicted of murder in massachusetts state court and sentenced to life in prison.after affirmance by the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc,commonwealth,i,petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus,which was denied,marshall,d,ii.now appeals the district court denial of his habeas petition.
we recite the background facts as determined by the state court.e.on the evening of july,janet downing was stabbed to death in her home in somerville,massachusetts,who was years old at the time,lived across the street from downing and was close friends with her son,ryan downing.during the year preceding downing death,had developed a preoccupation with her.
at about on the day of the murder,three boys went to the downing house to look for ryan.after they knocked at the front door and received no answer,one of the boys heard a loud noise coming from the backyard,which sounded as if someone was falling through tree branches.was discovered crouching in bushes nearby,and,ignoring calls from two of the boys,and with fists clenched and eyes away.
ryan downing,returning home at around,found his mother lying on the dining room floor it was later established that she had been killed by stabbing,there being stab wounds and slashes on her body.at about the same hour,entered a store near union square in somerville where he worked on a basis he was bleeding from cuts on his hand and had other cuts and scrapes on his leg,and he claimed to have been robbed and stabbed in union square.
the police were called and later took his the scene of the alleged robbery in union square.it proved to be a busy and area with no signs of struggle or blood.later,fingerprints were found in blood on the inside of the front door of the downing house and on a wooden post in the cellar.a knife hilt found in the downing house matched that of a knife owned by that police found in his trash and he was known to have owned two such knives.
blood consistent with,with a profile shared by six percent of the caucasian population,was found in the front hallway of the downing home.dna tests indicated that blood from the front door,dining room door,and a dress in the cellar matched blood sample.blood taken from right shin matched downing blood type.police also saw a trail of blood on the street that corresponded to the route had followed when his friends witnessed his departure from the downing house.
on august,was indicted by a middlesex county grand jury for murder.in order to try as an adult,the commonwealth had to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he was a significant danger to the public and not amenable to rehabilitation within the juvenile justice system.laws ch,if tried as an adult,faced a mandatory life sentence,id.ch,if treated as a juvenile,the maximum sentence was years,id.ch.
after an initial transfer hearing,the district judge ordered to be tried as a juvenile,but this decision was reversed by the sjc,commonwealth,a new judge held a second transfer hearing and ordered to be tried as an adult.after a trial in the fall of,a jury found guilty of murder,based on extreme atrocity and cruelty,and he was sentenced to life in prison.he appealed to the sjc,which affirmed.i,at.
in january,filed his federal habeas petition,raising both fifth amendment and due process issues.the district court denied the petition.we review the district court legal conclusions de novo,almanzar maloney,cir,cert.denied,d,but must respect the sjc conclusions on federal constitutional issues adjudicated by the sjc unless they resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
both sides assume that the sjc did resolve at least in some aspects both the fifth amendment and due process claims.this is clear enough as to one claim,less clear as to the other but it does not matter,because the result would be the same whether we deferred to the sjc or reviewed constitutional claims de novo,as we would do with a claim properly presented to the sjc but not in fact decided by it.goodrich hall,cir.
fifth amendment claim is that in the transfer proceeding that led to his subsequent trial as an adult,the state court judge relied upon silence in deciding that was not amenable to rehabilitation within the juvenile justice system.laws ch.the reliance,according to,is shown by several of the findings on which the state judge relied in concluding that was not so amenable in particular,that 
he has consistently not voiced any need or desire for treatment 
he had neither voiced nor exhibited apparent motivation to change and 
he lacked any overt signs of,recognition of,anxiety about,or other emotional distress occasioned by,any problem or inadequacy he may perceive in himself.
the state judge relied on other findings as example,that tended to associate with inmates who were suspicious,antagonistic and contemptuous of clinical services and that he had a lack of apparent motivation for treatment.but we will assume that the refusal to transfer was in part based on inferences about his drawn from his failure to say or do things suggesting a desire for rehabilitation.
in affirming,the sjc said that the judge findings were not based on the defendant exercise of his right to remain silent,but on the defendant failure to see any value in any treatment programs.i,at.the district court agreed,saying that the transfer judge based his decision on behavior,not his silence,and thus was not drawing negative inferences from the petitioner refusal to talk.ii,d at.
true enough,the transfer court did not infer guilt from silence but it did in some measure rely on refusal to express a need for treatment in concluding that he was not likely to be rehabilitated.true,too,those assessing him were not supposed to inquire about the crime but,argues,an inference could perhaps be drawn,if he confessed to a need for treatment,that the confession rested on his commission of the crime.
if the transfer hearing were treated as a criminal trial,the sequence would raise problems that would need careful consideration.what happened does not conflict with the bare language of the fifth amendment,which provides that n o person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,const.amend.v but neither the literal language nor the history of the amendment is a safe guide to its full modern reach 
however,in estelle smith,d,the supreme court said that the fifth amendment did not apply in a state court hearing to determine whether the defendant was competent to stand long as the evidence information obtained by a psychiatrist without a miranda warning was used only for the competency hearing.id.at.although dicta,the statement was explicit and undermines premise that the hearing should be equated to a criminal trial.
juvenile court transfer hearings closely parallel competency hearings.neither resolves questions of substantive guilt or innocence each addresses whether a defendant should be exempted from criminal prosecution because he falls within a category of persons who,in the eyes of the law,are not viewed as fully responsible for their acts.united states,cir.the third circuit and the ninth circuit have applied estelle to juvenile transfer hearings,at united states mitchell,cir,and we agree with our sister circuits.
although it is sometimes said that a defendant silence or refusal to cooperate can not be used to his disadvantage,this is a misstatement of the privilege just as too literal a reading understates the protection now afforded,such a loose colloquial description overstates it.given estelle,we hold that the fifth amendment did not preclude the state court judge from taking account of attitude,whether or not characterized as silence,in determining that he was not likely to be rehabilitated and should instead be tried as an adult.
the sjc has elsewhere taken the view that the privilege applies in transfer hearings.wayne,at.just what wayne meant may be uncertain confusion readily arises in privilege cases where evidence or silence occurs in one,the transfer its contested use may relate either to the sa
