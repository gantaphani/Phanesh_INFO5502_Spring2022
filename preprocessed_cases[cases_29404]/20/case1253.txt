marcus bridger cotton was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for murdering assistant district attorney gil epstein during a robbery in november.after he exhausted state remedies,cotton filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court raising twelve issues.the district court granted the state motion for summary judgment on all twelve issues.the district court granted summary judgment and denied cotton petition.the district court also refused to grant a certificate of appealability coa on any of the issues raised by cotton.
cotton now seeks a coa from this court on four issues whether the prosecutor improperly commented on the defendant failure to testify,whether his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to call two witnesses to testify at trial,whether he was denied due process by comments made by the trial judge during jury selection about the history of the texas capital sentencing scheme,and whether his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to object to the trial judge comments regarding the texas capital sentencing scheme.we grant a coa on the first issue but deny the application for coa on the other issues.with respect to the issue regarding the prosecutor closing argument,however,we affirm the district court denial of habeas relief.

discussion 
cotton habeas petition is subject to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.see penry johnson,d.under aedpa,cotton must obtain a coa before he can appeal the district court denial of habeas relief.c slack mcdaniel,d.u ntil a coa has been issued federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to rule on the merits of appeals from habeas petitioners.cockrell,d.
to obtain a coa,cotton must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c.at slack,at.to make such a showing,he must demonstrate that reasonable jurists could debate whether or,for that matter,agree that the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.at quoting slack,at.
in,the supreme court instructed,as it had previously held in slack,that we should limit our examination to a threshold inquiry into the underlying merit of the petitioner claims.at.the court observed that a coa ruling is not the occasion for a ruling on the merit of petitioner claim id.at.instead,our determination must be based on an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.id.at.this threshold inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.id.we do not have jurisdiction to justify our denial of a coa based on an adjudication of the actual merits of the claims.id.accordingly,we can not deny an application for a coa merely because we believe the applicant will not demonstrate an entitlement to relief.id.a claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree,after the coa has been granted and the case has received full consideration,that petitioner will not prevail.id.
even if we grant cotton application for coa,cotton is not necessarily entitled to habeas relief.to prevail on a petition for writ of habeas corpus,a petitioner must demonstrate that the state court proceeding resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.robertson cockrell,cir en banc quoting d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.
in making the unreasonable application inquiry,this court must determine whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.neal puckett,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.we have no authority to grant habeas corpus relief simply because we conclude,in our independent judgment,that a state supreme court application of federal law is erroneous or incorrect.catalan cockrell,cir quoting neal,at.the federal habeas scheme leaves primary responsibility with the state courts for these judgments,and authorizes intervention only when a state court decision is objectively unreasonable.woodford visciotti,d.
finally,for cotton to be entitled to habeas relief based on a constitutional trial error,he must demonstrate not only that the state court decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,but also that it was harmful under the standard set forth in brecht abrahamson,d.robertson cain,cir.under brecht,a federal court may grant habeas relief on account of constitutional error only if it determines that the constitutional error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.id.quoting brecht,at.quoting kotteakos united states.
