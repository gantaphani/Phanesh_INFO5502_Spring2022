petitioner convictions arise from a traffic stop in the city of troy,michigan.after stopping petitioner for speeding,the police officers conducted a lein check,which showed that petitioner driver license was suspended.petitioner was placed under arrest for driving with a suspended license.the police then searched petitioner car and found a loaded shotgun and a loaded handgun in the trunk.

the district court analyzed the double jeopardy issue as follows 
b multiple punishments for an offense 
the doctrine regarding the double jeopardy clause draws a crucial distinction between multiple punishments for the same conduct permissible and multiple punishments for the same offense impermissible.while the issue can be confusing,it is clear to this court that a conviction under both the felon in possession statute and the felony firearm statute constitutes multiple punishment for the same offense,and is therefore in violation of the double jeopardy clause.
it is well established that the double jeopardy clause does not prohibit a state from defining conduct to constitute two separate criminal offenses.missouri hunter,d finding that when a legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishments under two statutes,a court task of statutory construction is at an end and the prosecutor may seek and the trial court or jury may impose cumulative punishments under such statutes in a single trial 
in the case at hand,the michigan supreme court,applying the expressio unis est exclusio alterius sic canon of construction to the language of the statute,has concluded that the legislature intent in drafting the statute was to provide for an additional felony charge and sentence whenever a person possessing a firearm committed a felony other than those four explicitly enumerated in the statute.people mitchell,however,a focus on legislative intent is misguided,as this case does not involve multiple convictions arising out of the same conduct,hunter,at,but instead involves multiple punishments on a single offense.
the felon in possession statute states,in pertinent part,that 
except as provided in subsection,a person convicted of a felony shall not possess,use,transport,sell,purchase,carry,ship,receive,or distribute a firearm in this state unless certain circumstances are met.comp.laws 
the statute states,in pertinent part,that 
a person who carries or has in his or her possession a firearm when he or she commits or attempts to commit a felony,except a violation of section unlawful sale of a firearm,section carrying a concealed weapon,unlawful possession by licensee or alteration of identifying marks on a weapon,is guilty of a felony.comp.laws b.
under f,petitioner was found guilty because he was a felon in possession of a firearm.under b,petitioner was found guilty because he was a person in possession of a firearm while committing a felony the felony being the same f.after substituting the elements of f,we find that petitioner was convicted under b for being a person in possession of a firearm while he was a felon in possession of a firearm.considering that is redundant,this is exactly the same charge as therefore,anyone convicted of felon in possession is always guilty of.this is double punishment at its most basic,as it constitutes multiple punishments for the same offense.pearce,at.ohio johnson,d holding that the double jeopardy clause protects against cumulative punishments for convictions on the same offense.
federal court rulings upholding multiple convictions have involved convictions for felony predicate crimes such as felony murder and their underlying felonies.see hunter,finding that double jeopardy does not prohibit a conviction of missouri felony with a deadly weapon statute and the underlying felony of armed robbery brimmage sumner,cir finding that double jeopardy does not prohibit a conviction of both felony murder and the underlying felony or robbery the case at hand,however,does not involve multiple crimes arising out of a single act,but rather a double prosecution of the same offense.that is,the conviction of felon in possession and felony firearm is not the logical equivalent of a conviction of robbery and felony is the logical equivalent of a conviction of murder and felony murder.such a conviction would be entirely circular and would constitute convicting the defendant of the same crime twice in violation of the double jeopardy clause.see united states wilson,d holding that the underlying premise of double jeopardy was that a defendant should not be twice tried or punished for the same offense.the facts in the case at hand are distinguishable from the line of cases,as this case involves multiple punishment of the same offense,rather than the same conduct.
the issue is clearly drawn.the district court acknowledged the supreme court holding in missouri hunter,d,that where a legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment under two statutes,a court task of statutory construction is at an end and the prosecutor may seek and the trial court or jury may impose cumulative punishments under such statutes in a single trial.the hunter court further stated 
with respect to cumulative sentences imposed in a single trial,the double jeopardy clause does no more than prevent the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.
simply because two criminal statutes may be construed to proscribe the same conduct under the blockburger test does not mean that the double jeopardy clause precludes the imposition,in a single trial,of cumulative punishments pursuant to those statutes 
hunter,at.the district court also accurately observed that the michigan supreme court decision in people mitchell,is a clear determination by that court that the michigan legislature intended to include as a predicate felony for purposes of the statute the district court further recognized that the michigan supreme court determination in mitchell is binding on a federal habeas court.see banner davis,noting that once a state court has determined that the state legislature intended cumulative punishments,a federal habeas court must defer to that determination.
the district court continued its inquiry beyond this point,concluding that because the two statutes do not simply punish the same conduct,but the same exact offense,a focus on legislative intent is misguided,and the michigan court denial of relief constituted an unreasonable application of federal law.in support of the district court conclusion,white argues that this court must reconcile two different lines of supreme court line of cases that recognize that a person may not receive multiple punishments for the same offense,and the whalen line of cases that appear on the surface to limit blockburger and pearce by transmogrifying the blockburger test into a rule of mere statutory construction.appellee br.white argues that the supreme court decisional language in whalen and hunter is in applicable in a situation in which two separate statutes,with separate penalties,each define the same criminal offense.appellee br.
the question then is whether the michigan legislature can constitutionally provide that a felon who possesses a firearm shall be convicted of and punished for violating two criminal statutes felon in possession of a firearm,and possession of a firearm while being a felon in possession of a firearm.we have no quarrel with the district court determination that this case presents a rather unusual circumstance in that the two offenses are really the same offense one can not commit felon in possession of a firearm without simultaneously violating the statute,but the highest state court has found a legislative intent to punish under both statutes nevertheless,white has cited no cases,and we have found none where a state legislature was found to have violated the double jeopardy bar against multiple punishment by imposing multiple punishment for the same offense 
in banner,at,this court addressed the question whether the tennessee offenses of aggravated assault,in violation of,and shooting into an occupied dwelling,in violation of,are the same offense for double jeopardy purposes.like the district court in the instant case,we recognized that 
whether punishments are multiple under the double jeopardy clause is essentially a question of legislative intent.id.ohio johnson,at.at,d missouri hunter,d.
when assessing the intent of a state legislature,a federal court is bound by a state court construction of that state own statutes.see missouri hunter,at.at skinner,d.under the double jeopardy clause,when evaluating whether a state legislature intended to prescribe cumulative punishments for a single criminal incident,a federal court is bound by a state court determination of the legislature intent.see ohio johnson,at.at.
thus,for purposes of double jeopardy analysis,once a state court has determined that the state legislature intended cumulative punishments,a federal habeas court must defer to that determination.see smith sowders,cir,kentucky court of appeals determination binding hall wainwright,cir.
banner,at.banner had urged this court to apply the blockburger test to determine whether the two offenses are one for double jeopardy purposes.the court declined to do so,noting the supreme court statement in ohio johnson,at.
it should be evident from our decision in missouri hunter,however,the blockburger test does not necessarily control the inquiry into the intent of a state legislature.even if the crimes are the same under blockburger,if it is evident that a state legislature intended to authorize cumulative punishments,a court inquiry is at an end.
banner,at.nevertheless,the banner panel continued its inquiry in light of this court en banc decision in pryor rose,cir,explaining 
in pryor,a habeas case involving the question of multiple punishments,our en banc court independently interpreted the scope of tennessee criminal statutes for purposes of double jeopardy analysis.while indicating that the views of the tennessee supreme court on the double jeopardy issue were entitled to consideration,id.at,relying upon whalen united states,d,and its application of blockburger,we held that multiple punishment was forbidden under the double jeopardy clause.in evaluating pryor claim and holding that the tennessee legislature did not intend cumulative punishments,we stated we therefore hold that the tennessee legislature has not clearly indicated that consecutive sentences are proper in the situation presented by this case.at emphasis supplied.analysis in prior tennessee cases,we held,was wholly unacceptable under whalen,which requires that the legislature clearly indicate that consecutive sentences are permissible for offenses which are the same under the blockburger test.id.
thus,in evaluating banner claim in light of blockburger,there is a tension between adherence to the multiple punishment determination made by the tennessee court of criminal appeals and tennessee supreme court and application of the blockburger test which is used as a gauge for determining legislative intent as it was interpreted in whalen and applied in pryor.this ambiguity is underlined by the supreme court statement in ohio johnson that the blockburger test does not necessarily control the inquiry into the intent of a state legislature.at.at emphasis supplied.to resolve this tension,we must determine whether a state court judgment must establish that the state legislature clearly intended cumulative punishment before a federal court is bound by that determination for purposes of double jeopardy analysis,as is apparently indicated by pryor.
banner,at.the banner panel discussed its uncertainty over the scope of blockburger,id.at,distinguished pryor as limited to a narrow situation in which the state courts below had failed to give a clear expression on the issue of cumulative punishment,and ultimately concluded that because the tennessee courts had already held that the tennessee legislature intended cumulative punishments,further analysis under blockburger would be improper 
in the instant case,although we agree with the district court that the two statutes at issue here punish the same offense under blockburger,we can find no basis upon which to make the distinction drawn by the court in granting the habeas petition.while this may be the case that prompts the supreme court to refine its analysis,the court has never held or intimated that the constitutional bar against double jeopardy circumscribes the legislative prerogative to define crimes and prescribe punishment in the context of a single prosecution.while no case is directly on point in upholding multiple punishments under two statutes that define the same offense as these do here,the supreme court has repeatedly described the third aspect of the double jeopardy protection against multiple punishments for the same offense imposed in a single protecting only against the imposition of punishment in excess of that authorized by the legislature 
indeed,in the face of repeated assertions of this principle in majority opinions of the supreme court,only justice marshall joined by justice stevens,in missouri hunter,at,and justice stewart joined by justices marshall and stevens,in albernaz,at,have expressed the view that the aspect o
