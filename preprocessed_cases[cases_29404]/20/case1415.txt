respondent richard gansheimer,warden,appeals the order of the district court granting petitioner anthony braxton,an ohio state prisoner,a conditional writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,on the basis of braxton claim that the prosecution exercise of a peremptory challenge during jury selection at his state court trial was racially discriminatory in violation of the equal protection clause and batson kentucky,d.in granting the writ,the district court held that the ohio courts decisions denying braxton batson challenge was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law and was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,entitling braxton to relief under d and.for the reasons stated below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case with instructions to dismiss braxton habeas petition.
on november,anthony braxton was convicted by a jury in the court of common pleas,cuyahoga county,ohio,on one count of felonious assault upon a police officer in violation of ohio ann.one count of failure to comply with an order or signal of a police officer,contrary to ohio ann.and one count of receiving stolen property in violation of ohio ann.braxton and the victim,a police officer whom he allegedly assaulted,are both males.
during voir dire,defense counsel objected unsuccessfully to the prosecution use of two of its four peremptory challenges to remove two jurors from the panel.three of the prospective panel were african americans.the prosecutor used his first peremptory challenge to excuse juror,a retired female who had worked for the public defender office for fifteen years.the prosecutor also excused juror,an male,after questioning him about his seeming inattentiveness and demeanor 
prosecutor are you off this week are you able to take the week off is that a hardship for you especially 
juror no,it not.
prosecutor when you got your subpoena for jury service,what was going through your mind 
juror why me 
prosecutor why me did anybody in this room when they got their jury service think all right you were excited 
prosecutor and one of the reasons i ask you,juror,because you are a very laid back person or you are kind of exuding the fact you might not want to be here.just to be honest.by body language.now,i do know.it could be you laid back and you are kind of paying attention.and so i just have to ask,would you rather not be here on this case 
juror you know,i have no problem.i served before.
prosecutor and believe me,nobody wants to be here.i not trying to pick on you.
juror i understand.
prosecutor we have to pick a jury that fair for the state and fair for the defendant and so,if i see someone i not just picking on you,hey,maybe he does want to be here.you know i want to ask,okay so you are saying you will be all right 
juror no problem.
prosecutor okay.do you have anything else for me,sir 
when the prosecutor exercised his peremptory challenges to excuse juror and juror,defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial,maintaining that the prosecutor challenges regarding these two jurors violated the equal protection clause and batson,which preclude peremptory challenges on the basis of race.at the ensuing bench conference,defense counsel asserted that the prosecution had shown a pattern by challenging both jurors and remov ing percent of potential black jury panel members.defense counsel argued that,as a result,only one other juror remain ed at the end of the line and we are not likely to even reach her.
the trial court then asked the prosecutor to elaborate on his reasons for excusing the two jurors.the prosecutor explained that he excused juror because she worked for the public defender office for fifteen years and her employment there worried the state thus,the prosecutor believed she would be better suited for a jury panel.the prosecutor perceived juror as being disinterested in serving on the jury 
with regards to juror,he sat there the entire time with his arms crossed and his head bent over,and his showed no interest in being in here.i specifically questioned him about his body language,and he even said he did want to be here.so,i am not going to have someone sit on a jury that for the last two hours did listen to anything,had no intention of actually paying attention and then even when i asked him,he said he did want to be here.it got nothing to do with race.
with regards to the third prospective juror,who is juror number,there is a potential if she gets on this panel and i can tell you right now we have no problem with her as well,the lone black juror.
we also want to note our objection for the record because we know that why we objected before.we knew he defense counsel was planning on getting rid of four white people as well.there is a reverse batson.there case law on that,and that why we noted our continuing objection as well.and i suspect that why he actually put it on initially because he knew both african american jurors were not suitable for this jury regardless of the race.one was a public defender.one had paid attention at all.he knew we were kicking them off,and i specifically asked the guy about it.
defense counsel objected to the prosecutor explanation,and the following colloquy occurred between counsel and the court 
defense counsel judge,as it relates to juror,she was retired i think she said nine years ago from the public defender office.and she had also worked for legal aid.now,working for legal aide sic or the public defender office for nine years after you terminate your employment,then that is most extraordinary.
i also point out as it relates to smoot juror,right now as we sit here,juror number is seated in the jury,he turned around,his arms are folded,right at the moment his head is down.your honor,that does not disqualify him.
prosecutor what is he talking about 
the court defense counsel,i agree with you,that does not disqualify a person from serving as a juror,but the prosecutor is attempting to present a nondiscriminatory reason for the reason he exercised his peremptory.
defense counsel your honor,in terms of what he just indicated,neither one of them are sufficient bases to satisfy our batson objection.we again move for a mistrial.
the court i disagree with your reasoning.i think they are sufficient bases to satisfy the standard of batson.i will overrule your objection and overrule your request for a mistrial.
the trial proceeded with a jury panel composed of all white jurors.the remaining seated as an alternate.the jury found braxton guilty as charged on all counts,and the court later imposed a sentence of six years of imprisonment.
in his direct appeal,braxton raised six claims,including his assertion that the prosecution peremptory challenges of jurors and violated batson.see state braxton,wl ohio.the ohio court of appeals affirmed braxton convictions,finding all of his assignments of error to be without merit.id.with regard to the batson claim,the court,after accurately reciting the governing legal principles,found no purposeful discrimination under the circumstances 
in the instant case,the defense sought a mistrial based on the fact that the state removed two black jurors.when pressed for an explanation as to the grounds for the peremptory challenge,the state explained that one of the jurors worked at the public defender office for years.according to the state,the second juror indicated by his body language during voir dire arms crossed and head bent over that he did not desire to sit on the case.the prosecutor concluded that such an individual would not be attentive.
in the case at bar,the trial court,after appropriate inquiry,rejected the notion that the prosecutor challenge rested on perceived stereotypical assumptions or the intention of excluding jurors.nothing in the prosecutor explanation showed that he chose to exclude jurors on the basis of race.
id.at.affording substantial deference to the trial judge assessment of credibility and demeanor,the court of appeals concluded that braxton failed to make a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination,the prosecutor provided a bona fide explanation for the challenge,and the court determination was not clearly erroneous.id.
upon further appeal and reiteration of his batson claim,the supreme court of ohio issued an order denying leave to appeal and dismissing the appeal as not involving any substantial constitutional question.state braxton,ohio,unpublished table decision.
braxton thereafter filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in federal district court,averring,inter alia,batson error with regard to juror ultimately,on march,after referral of the matter to a magistrate judge,the district court issued an opinion and order granting braxton a conditional writ of habeas corpus on his equal protection claim reviewing the case under the applicable standards of the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d,the district court held that 
the evidence is clear and convincing that the prosecutor stated justifications for excusing juror were a pretext for discrimination.the trial court failed to address the blatant inconsistency between the juror actual response and the prosecutor claims in batson inquiry,and the appellate court unreasonably determined that the trial court did not err.additionally,the appellate court made an unreasonable application of batson in finding that braxton did not satisfy his prima facie case when such matter had become moot.
the district court therefore ordered braxton state court convictions and sentences to be vacated,unless the state of ohio commenced a new trial against him within days of entry of the judgment.this timely appeal by respondent gansheimer followed.
we review the district court legal conclusions in habeas proceedings de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.harris haeberlin,cir.aedpa supplies the narrow parameters of federal habeas review of state court proceedings,providing that an application for a writ of habeas corpus shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d harris,at.
under the unreasonable application clause of d,habeas relief is available if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case,or if a state court decision either unreasonably extends or unreasonably refuses to extend a legal principle from the supreme court precedent to a new context.harris,at citations omitted.t he central inquiry is whether the state court decision was objectively unreasonable and not simply erroneous or incorrect.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,a reviewing court must be careful not to substitute its own judgment for that of the state court by equating the more stringent standard of objectively unreasonable with the more lax standard of clear error.id.
with respect to d,f actual determinations by state courts are presumed correct absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary,e,and a decision adjudicated on the merits in a state court and based on a factual determination will not be overturned on factual grounds unless objectively unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the proceeding.cockrell,d.
braxton batson claim presents a mixed question of law and fact and necessarily focuses on the reasonableness of the decisions of the state is,whether those decisions constituted an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.lancaster adams,cir.see also railey webb,cir mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed under the unreasonable application prong of the aedpa.however,the question of whether a prosecutor intended to discriminate on the basis of race in challenging potential jurors is,as batson recognized,a question of historical fact.lancaster,at quoting hernandez new york,d.under aedpa,primary or historical facts found by state courts are presumed correct and are rebuttable only by clear and convincing evidence.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,while a district court ruling on a batson claim presented on direct appeal is entitled to great deference and should not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous,the standard must be modified in the context of a petition to give credence to e requirement that facts found by a state court be presumed correct unless the petitioner rebuts this presumption by clear and convincing evidence.id.at.
the equal protection clause precludes a party from using a peremptory challenge to exclude members of the jury venire on account of their race.batson,at.batson involves a tripartite inquiry.hernandez,at.first,the party opposing the peremptory challenge must make a prima facie showing of racial discrimination.id.if such a case is established,the burden shifts to the defending party to articulate a explanation for striking the juror in question.id.at.the party reason for its decision to dismiss a juror is neutral if it is based on something other than the race of the juror and,absent discriminatory intent inherent in the explanation,the reason should be deemed.united states jackson,cir.this explanation need not be particularly persuasive,or even plausible,so long as it is neutral.mccurdy montgomery county,cir,overruled in part on other grounds by barnes wright,cir quoting united states harris,cir.b ody language and demeanor are permissible justifications for the exercise of a peremptory challenge.mccurdy,at citing united states changco,cir see also united states forrest,cir holding that the prosecution articulated reason for exercising a peremptory juror extreme negative reaction to being called for jury a permissible justification in the absence of proof that this reason was pretextual.indeed,t he fact that a prosecutor reasons may be founded on nothing more than a trial lawyer instincts about a prospective juror does not diminish the scope of acceptable invocation of peremptory challenges,so long as they are the actual reasons for the prosecutor actions.united states power,cir citation omitted.
once the defending party proffers a reason,the challenging party,who always bears the ultimate burden of persuasion,must show that the explanation is merely a pretext for a racial motivation.mccurdy,at.based on the parties submissions,the trial court must ascertain whether the claimant has demonstrated purposeful discrimination.hernandez,at.in making this determination,the court presumes that the facially valid reasons proffered by the party exercising the peremptory are true.lancaster,at.t he critical question in determining whether a defendant has proved purposeful discrimination is the persuasiveness of the prosecutor justification for his peremptory strike,at.in other words,the issue comes down to whether the trial court finds the prosecutor explanations to be credible.id.at.credibility can be measured by,among other factors,the prosecutor demeanor by how reasonable,or how improbable,the explanations are and by whether the proffered rationale has some basis in accepted trial strategy.id.great deference to a trial court findings on the issue of discriminatory intent makes particular sense because 
t here will seldom be much evidence bearing on that issue,and the best evidence often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge.as with the state of mind of a juror,evaluation of the prosecutor state of mind based on demeanor and credibility lies peculiarly within a trial judge province.
hernandez,at.quoting wainwright witt,d.thus,in the absence of exceptional circumstances,we would defer to factual findings id.at.emphasis added.
in the present case,the district court faulted the state courts application of batson to the circumstances and concluded that braxton was entitled to habeas relief under both the legal and factual standards of d.the district court determined that the state trial court skipped the first step of the batson prima facie immediately looked to the prosecution to articulate a nondiscriminatory explanation for its peremptory challenges.accordingly,the district court concluded that the state appellate court erred when it concluded that braxton failed to make such a prima facie showing.
next,the district court determined that,instead of analyzing the persuasiveness of the prosecution nondiscriminatory justification,both the state trial and appellate courts glossed over the third step of the batson inquiry.the district court found that the trial court offered no explanation for its ruling other than its conclusion that it disagreed with braxton position,and the state appellate court,in turn,conclusively presumed that there was no discriminatory intent because a explanation was tendered.the district court concluded that by failing to address this third step,neither the trial court nor the appellate court made a reasonable application of federal law as set forth in batson.
finally,from a factual standpoint,the district court found that the evidence is clear and convincing that the prosecutor stated justifications for excusing juror were a pretext for discrimination.the court explained 
the prosecutor relied on juror body language and,more importantly,on what he described as juror statements that he did want to be here.both the state trial and appellate courts ignored the fact that juror never made these statements.a review of the prosecution voir dire examination of juror reveals that the prosecutor went to great length to entice this juror into conceding that he had no interest in serving on this jury.yet,despite this prodding,juror stood firm in his responses that he had no problems with jury service.the prosecutor tried,unsuccessfully,to put words in juror mouth.given this blatant inconsistency between the prosecutor stated justification and juror actual statements as recorded,the state courts rulings were based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
t he prosecutor did not justify his peremptory challenges solely on juror body language,which he could have,but instead emphasized to the court incorrectly that juror voiced opposition to jury service.the court finds as the tipping point in this close analysis the fact that the prosecutor misquoted juror twice as having said he did not want to be there when in fact juror said exactly the opposite.this blatant inconsistency between what the prosecutor argued and what the record demonstrates undermines the prosecutor stated reasons for excusing juror and therefore exposes his pretext for racial discrimination.
in this appeal,respondent first argues that the district court erred in holding that the state courts unreasonably applied clearly established supreme court precedent to the facts of the case.respondent points out that once braxton raised the batson challenge,the state trial court held a bench conference during which,in conformity with batson,defense counsel was permitted to state his prima facie case,the prosecutor was then allowed to set forth reasons for striking juror,and the trial court weighed the parties arguments before making its determination that braxton did not prove purposeful discrimination.respondent contends that thereafter,the state appellate court properly applied the batson test in affirming the trial court.thus,according to respondent,the record illustrates that the trial court adjudication of the batson issue was both correct and reasonable.we agree,reiterating the important principle that a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.williams taylor,d.
as the district court correctly noted,the state trial court did not rule expressly on whether braxton established a prima facie case of discrimination and looked immediately to the prosecution to articulate a neutral reason for its peremptory challenges.in such circumstances,o nce a prosecutor has offered a explanation for the peremptory challenges and the trial court has ruled on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination,the preliminary issue of whether the defendant had made a prima facie showing becomes moot.hernandez,at.consequently,the district court determined that the ohio court of appeals erred when it addressed this moot issue on appeal and concluded that braxton failed to make a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination.braxton,wl at.
however,we conclude that the ohio court of appeals application of batson and hernandez was neither erroneous nor unreasonable because the appellate court did not rely solely upon the moot issue in rejecting braxton batson claim.lancaster,at b ecause the trial court here had ruled on the ultimate question under petitioner had established intentional it concluded that petitioner had not demonstrated that the reasons for the strike of a juror proffered by the prosecution were pretextual,the michigan court of appeals acted unreasonably under supreme court precedent set out in hernandez when it rested its holding on an issue that had become moot and found that the petitioner had not made out a prima facie showing of discrimination emphasis added.rather,the ohio court of appeals appropriately analyzed the batson issue by addressing its second and third components and concluding that the prosecutor provided a bona fide explanation for the challenge,and the court determination was not clearly erroneous.braxton,wl at.by means of this alternative holding,the appellate court resolved the dispositive issue of purposeful discrimination.in doing so,it properly and reasonably applied batson and hernandez.
the question remains whether the state courts properly evaluated the prosecution explanation for the peremptory strike of juror under the third prong of batson,or whether,as the district court determined,the courts gave this critical step short shrift.
in the typical peremptory challenge inquiry,the decisive question will be whether counsel explanation for a peremptory challenge should be believed.hernandez,at.at this stage,a trial court has the duty to determine if the defendant has established purposeful discrimination.batson,at.in giving effect to this duty,we have opined that when the purported justification is predicated on subjective explanations like body language or demeanor,an analysis of each of the elements of a batson challenge is especially important.mccurdy,at.in mccurdy,we held that because the district court did not merely credit the explanation of the defendant,but itself found that the juror was passive and disinterested,the plaintiff has not demonstrated that the district court clearly erred in dismissing his batson challenge.id.smulls roper,cir noting that the supreme court has eschewed a formalistic approach to fact finding under batson in holding that the state court failure to make detailed fact findings following a batson challenge was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law under d.
in the present case,when the totality of the circumstances are considered,the record reflects that the trial court,albeit in abbreviated fashion,adequately and reasonably conveyed its decision that the prosecution,justification for the peremptory strike of juror was credible and that braxton failed to carry his burden on the ultimate issue of purposeful discrimination.in doing so,the trial court adhered to the batson inquiry and neither conflated the steps,see,united states kimbrel,cir,nor restricted counsel in their respective arguments likewise,the state court of appeals,after articulating the requisite tripartite batson framework,obviously reviewed the trial transcript,acknowledged the prosecution assertion that juror body language arms crossed and head bent over indicated disinterest,noted that the trial court,after appropriate inquiry,rejected the notion that the prosecutor challenge was pretextual,and finally,concluded independently th
