opinion of the court 
this is an appeal from a district court order denying curtis brinson petition for a writ of habeas corpus.brinson was convicted in state court in pennsylvania on one count of murder in the first degree and a lesser offense and was sentenced to imprisonment for life.the district court we his federal habeas petition was timely because it was proper to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling to the period of time following the district court erroneous dismissal of brinson prior habeas petition.contrary to the district court,however,we hold that brinson made out a prima facie case of a violation of batson kentucky,d,and we therefore reverse the order of the district court and remand for an evidentiary hearing.
in april,arthur johnson was shot and killed in the bathroom of a philadelphia nightclub.brinson,an african american,was arrested for the crime,and the selection of the jury for his trial began on april,two days before the supreme court of the united states announced its decision in batson.
in batson,the supreme court set out a procedure for determining whether a prosecution violated the equal protection clause by peremptorily striking potential jurors based on race first,the party asserting the claim must make out a prima facie case.see at.in order to do this,the party must point to facts that raise an inference that a challenged strike was based on an impermissible ground.id.second,if a prima facie case is established,the party who exercised the challenge must come forward with a neutral explanation.id.third,if a neutral explanation is offered,the trial judge must make a finding as to whether the contested peremptory was based on an impermissible ground.id.at.
on may,brinson jury had been selected but before the trial attorney objected that the prosecutor had violated batson by striking prospective african american jurors based on race brinson attorney stated that the prosecutor,jack mcmahon,had exercised fourteen peremptory challenges,thirteen for blacks.he also asserted that mcmahon seldom,if ever,questioned blacks prior to exercising his peremptory challenges.in response,mcmahon did not deny using peremptories against blacks,but he stated that he did not remember the race of each juror whom he had peremptorily challenged,that he recalled striking both african americans and whites,that he had not used all of his allotted strikes,and that three african americans had been selected for the jury.at this point,neither the trial judge nor the attorneys had actually read batson,and the trial judge announced that he would not rule on the defense objection prior to trial but that the issue could be raised in a motion.the case was then tried,and brinson was found guilty of murder in the first degree and possession of an instrument of crime.he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
brinson again raised the batson issue in a motion.at the hearing on the motion,brinson attorney repeated his previous assertions about mcmahon use of peremptory challenges,and mcmahon again disclaimed any memory of how many strikes he had used against african americans,stating that defense counsel says i used thirteen strikes on blacks and one on a white.i see nothing in the record to indicate that.i do not have any recollection of that whatsoever.i am sure the court does.to this,the trial judge responded yes,i do.mcmahon then stated be that as it may,i know i accepted the black that the defense struck.
the trial judge orally rejected brinson batson argument on the ground that batson had not yet been accepted by this commonwealth.the trial judge appears to have believed that he was still bound by pennsylvania court decisions rejecting arguments similar to the one that the supreme court of the united states accepted in batson.
the trial judge died before he could write an opinion addressing brinson motions,and the matter was reassigned to another judge.in his opinion on these motions,the new judge wrote the following with respect to brinson batson argument 
in the instant case the record indicates there were at least three black persons on the jury and the selection of the jury was completed with the prosecutor still having six peremptory strikes thus,the record does not show any deliberate,purposeful exclusion of black persons from the jury in this case.unfortunately,the trial judge died before writing his opinion,and,therefore,we are without the benefit of his personal observations as he conducted the voir dire.however,we have,as was stated in batson,confidence,based upon the experience,character and reputation of the trial judge,that he would not allow such a purposeful rejection of black persons solely by peremptory challenges as to deny this defendant a fair jury trial.
on direct appeal,brinson again raised the batson issue,but the superior court affirmed brinson conviction.invoking commonwealth mckendrick,the superior court rejected the batson claim on the ground that where the victim,the perpetrator and witnesses are black,a prima facie case of racial discrimination is not present under batson the superior court continued 
in addition,the record establishes that three of the jurors in this case were black,the defense struck blacks,and the commonwealth had six peremptory challenges left following the close of jury selection accordingly,appellant has failed to establish that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to remove black venire members,as required by batson.an evidentiary hearing on this issue is not required.
brinson raised his batson claim in a petition for allocatur to the pennsylvania supreme court,but the petition was denied.
in september,brinson filed a petition in state court under the pennsylvania relief act pcra.that petition claimed that trial counsel had been ineffective because,among other things,he had allegedly failed to object to the prosecution systematic exclusion of african americans from the jury brinson petition was denied without a hearing in january.a timely appeal was taken,but the superior court affirmed the dismissal for two reasons first,that the batson claim had been litigated on direct appeal and therefore could not be raised under the pcra,see.con.stat.ann.a,and,second,that all of brinson claims were waived because brinson allegedly failed to include a trial transcript as part of the official record.the pennsylvania supreme court again denied allocatur.
following the dismissal of his first pcra petition,brinson turned to the federal courts and filed a timely pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he presented eight grounds for relief,including his batson claim while this petition was pending,a videotape entitled jury selection with jack mcmahon was released to the public.this tape depicted a training session in which mcmahon advocated the use of peremptory challenges against african americans.after the tape was released,brinson filed a motion requesting that the district court take judicial notice of the new evidence.
the magistrate judge to whom the federal habeas petition was assigned for a report recommended that the petition be dismissed without prejudice on the ground that the batson claim,as bolstered by the mcmahon tape,was unexhausted and that the petition therefore contained both exhausted and unexhausted claims.the magistrate judge noted that the batson issue had been litigated in state court on direct appeal and that the pcra generally precludes of claims,but the magistrate judge observed that the pcra filing deadline contains an exception for claims predicated on facts that were previously unknown to the petitioner and that could not have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.see.ann.b ii.the district court adopted this recommendation and dismissed the petition without prejudice on september.
unfortunately,the district court did not note that,by the time of its decision,the pcra time limit for filing a claim based on newly discovered days from the discovery of the evidence see.ann.b had already passed.moreover,in order to proceed with a new pcra petition raising his batson claim,brinson felt that he was required to comply with the spence rule,see commonwealth spence,and thus to identify the race of the veniremen who had been removed by the prosecution,the race of all the jurors who served,and the race of jurors acceptable to the commonwealth who had been stricken by the defense.id.at with the assistance of a law professor,brinson spent months attempting to compile these statistics.brinson eventually filed his second pcra action on july,but the pcra court dismissed the petition as untimely,and the superior court affirmed.
on december,brinson returned to federal court and filed a second habeas petition in which he raised the same claims presented in his first petition.the magistrate judge recommended that the petition be dismissed as untimely,but the district court did not adopt this recommendation,ruling that the running of the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled for the time period following the dismissal of the timely,first petition in september of.the district court reached this conclusion for two reasons.first,the court stated that it had erred in dismissing brinson first,timely petition.the court explained 
the batson issue had actually been presented to the state courts on direct appeal and in the first pcra application.my conclusion that considerations of comity would best be served by permitting the state courts an opportunity to reconsider the issue in light of the recent disclosure of the mcmahon tapes turned out to be unduly generous to the commonwealth petitioner right to seek federal habeas relief should not be lost entirely,merely because of this court excessive deference to the state tribunals.
second,the district court stated that,even if brinson had not exhausted his batson claim on direct appeal,it would have been preferable to stay,rather than dismiss,the first federal petition.
the district court returned the case to the magistrate judge for a recommendation on the merits of the batson claim,and the magistrate judge concluded,in an opinion adopted by the district court,that brinson had failed to establish a prima facie case under batson.the magistrate judge opined that the record did not support a finding that mcmahon had in fact used of his peremptory strikes against african americans and that the mcmahon tape,though troubling,did not establish that mcmahon had used impermissible tactics during brinson trial.
brinson then took this appeal,claiming that the district court erred in denying his batson claim and in dismissing his additional claims sub silentio.the respondents hereinafter the commonwealth counter that the district court should not have equitably tolled the statute of limitations but that,in any event,brinson batson claim was properly rejected on the merits.
we first consider the question whether,as the district court held,it was proper to toll the statute of limitations for the period from the dismissal of brinson first federal habeas petition until the filing of his current petition.it is settled that the statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas claim under is subject to equitable tolling,see miller new jersey state of,cir,but that the doctrine should be invoked sparingly.irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d.we have said that equitable tolling is proper when the party in question has in some extraordinary way been prevented from asserting his or her rights.brown shannon,cir.one such potentially extraordinary situation is where a court has misled a party regarding the steps that the party needs to take to preserve a claim.see,baldwin county welcome center brown,d referring to situation in which the court has led the plaintiff to believe that she has done everything required of her hallgren of energy,cir lambert united states,cir rys postal,cir.in this case,the district court held that equitable tolling was justified on this ground.
we have never decided what standard of appellate review should govern when a district court applies the doctrine of equitable tolling in a habeas case,and the circuits are divided on the issue,with some applying de novo review,some using an standard,and some employing different standards in different circumstances.see neverson farquharson,cir rouse lee,cir collecting cases.on balance,we are inclined to believe that where,as here,the relevant facts are not disputed,a district court decision on the question whether a case is sufficiently extraordinary to justify equitable tolling should be reviewed de novo.
three factors point in this direction.first,a district court does not have any comparative advantage in deciding whether particular circumstances are extraordinary enough to warrant the application of the doctrine.second,reversal of a district court ruling on this issue will not lead to a retrial or any other comparably burdensome proceedings.third,de novo review leads to greater uniformity in the application of the doctrine and better serves the goal of ensuring that the doctrine is indeed used sparingly and is not employed to upset the strong concern for finality embodied in.
in the present case,however,it is not necessary for us to resolve this question,because we would sustain the district court decision on the issue of equitable tolling under any of the standards used by other courts of appeals.we conclude that the district court mistaken dismissal of brinson first petition prevented brinson in a sufficiently extraordinary way from asserting his rights under the federal habeas statute.as the district court ultimately recognized,brinson had fully exhausted his batson claim on direct appeal.it was therefore error for the district court to dismiss his first federal habeas petition on the ground that this claim was not exhausted.in dismissing that petition,the district court reasoned that brinson request for judicial notice of the mcmahon tape transformed his batson claim into one that differed from the claim raised on direct appeal,but this reasoning was flawed.
first,it is questionable whether brinson reliance on the mcmahon tape fundamentally altered the previously exhausted claim because the tape merely confirmed the factual predicate of brinson batson claim without changing its legal basis.see vasquez hillery,d stevens.corr,cir landano rafferty,cir.second,as we explain in part iii of this opinion,without the tape,brinson had a meritorious claim that his trial attorney established a prima facie case under batson and that the state courts violated batson by failing to move on to the second and third steps of the batson inquiry.under these circumstances,the district court,at a minimum,should have given brinson the option of going forward with the precise claim that was advanced on direct appeal see rose lundy,d when petition is mixed,petitioner must be given choice of returning to state court to exhaust his claims or of amending or resubmitting the habeas petition to present only exhausted claims to the district court.instead,the district court relegated brinson to another round of state court litigation that was bound to fail because the period for raising a claim founded on newly discovered evidence had already passed.
the commonwealth contends that brinson did not act with the requisite reasonable diligence because he was allegedly dilatory in filing his second pcra petition.the commonwealth first faults brinson because,when the mcmahon tape was released,he did not file his second pcra petition within days thereafter but instead elected to proceed with his first federal habeas petition.the commonwealth also argues that brinson did not exhibit reasonable diligence because he did not file his second pcra petition within or days after the district court dismissal of the first federal petition.the commonwealth takes the figure of days from our decision in crews horn,cir,in which we held that,where a district court stays a mixed petition so that the petitioner can exhaust unexhausted claims,the petitioner must file in the state court within days after the entry of the stay.the commonwealth takes the figure of days from commonwealth lark,in which the pennsylvania supreme court held that,when a ground for filing a second pcra petition such as the discovery of new evidence arises while a previous pcra action i
