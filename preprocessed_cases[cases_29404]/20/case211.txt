petitioner wayne healy was tried in for the murder of richard chalue,who had been found stabbed to death in his home.at trial,the prosecution suggested,in response to certain defense arguments,that healy killed chalue during a homosexual encounter gone awry.healy was convicted and is now serving a life sentence.
more than fifteen years later,in response to a discovery request connected to healy third motion for a new trial,prosecutors for the first time turned over to healy a pathologist report from the examination of chalue.healy had had access all along to a shorter,final autopsy report.this preliminary report said an examination of chalue genitals and rectum had revealed no marks suggestive of sexual activity.based on this information,healy subpoenaed the hospital where the exam was conducted in response,the hospital turned over a handwritten note stating that smears from chalue mouth and rectum had tested negative for sperm.
relying on these documents,healy in filed an amended motion for a new trial in state court on the ground that the prosecution had suppressed exculpatory evidence in violation of his due process rights.see brady maryland,d.he argued,inter alia,that the newly portion of the report on the exam tended to prove that the killing did not occur in connection with a sexual encounter,and that this would have made a crucial difference at trial.the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc rejected his claim.see commonwealth healy healy ii.healy then petitioned the federal court for habeas corpus.
the district court granted habeas corpus relief.the court said the sjc had erred by failing to recognize the centrality of the sexual encounter theory and by not explicitly factoring into its analysis how extremely close a case the murder trial had been.healy spencer healy iii,d.
we reverse.the sjc considered the whole record and reached a,supportable conclusion that healy had not demonstrated brady prejudice.its analysis was not objectively unreasonable,lockyer andrade,d,and the writ should not have issued.
we describe the facts as they were found by the sjc,supplemented with other record facts consistent with the sjc findings.lynch ficco,cir 
police came to chalue apartment in holyoke,massachusetts,early on the morning of august,after receiving a report that chalue had been screaming for help.healy ii,at.the police found chalue dead on his bed,stabbed seventeen times in the chest,neck,and thigh.id.chalue had on a pair of jeans,which were pulled halfway down his legs he was otherwise naked.his hands were bound with socks he also was gagged.id.on top of a dresser in the bedroom,approximately four to five feet from the body,police found a pair of underwear.testing of the underwear revealed the presence of semen consistent with chalue blood group.id.the pathologist who conducted chalue autopsy opined,based on the location and angle of the wounds,that the perpetrator had been kneeling on the bed at the time the wounds were inflicted.id.
a bloodstained knife was found on the dresser in chalue bedroom.id.on the table in chalue kitchen were a partially empty bottle of rum,two bottles of cola,a glass,and an ashtray containing cigarette butts.commonwealth healy healy i.police also found a receipt for rum,cola,and ice,stained with blood,on the landing in chalue apartment building.id.
police contacted healy after finding his telephone number in chalue address book.id.healy at first said he had not seen chalue in months.he later changed his story,telling police that he had purchased the rum,coke,and ice and brought it to chalue that evening,but had not gone inside.id.at.healy also lied about the timing of his movements that night in an interview with police on the evening of august,healy stated that after leaving chalue,he had returned home by,and that police could verify that with healy roommate,george roy when questioned,however,roy admitted that he and healy had agreed to say healy returned home at but that it actually might have been closer to id.healy then admitted to police that he had not gotten home by,but instead had gone out to two gay bars after leaving chalue.id.
at healy trial,the prosecution introduced a variety of circumstantial evidence tying him to the crime.the commonwealth fingerprint expert testified that healy fingerprints were on the rum and cola bottles,and that at least one of the cigarettes in the ashtray on chalue table had been smoked by someone who was both a nonsecretor,who did not secrete blood group substances in his saliva,and who had type b blood.id.at.healy was a nonsecretor with type b blood the commonwealth expert testified that these two characteristics appear together in only of the population.id.
the commonwealth expert serologist testified that the blood on the knife contained antigens consistent with a mixture of blood of types a and b,and that a shirt found in healy apartment also had a small bloodstain with both a and b antigens.chalue blood was type id.finally,type b blood was found on the gear shift and brake lever of healy car,and police officers who questioned healy on the evening of august saw that he had a bandage on the palm of his right hand.the doctor who had sutured healy wound earlier that evening testified that in his opinion the wound had been between four and hours old at the time he treated it,and that healy wound could have been caused by the knife found in chalue bedroom.id.
testifying at trial,healy said he had cut his hand on a broken glass in his kitchen on the morning of the.id.at.he admitted that,contrary to his earlier statements to police,he had gone inside chalue apartment the night of the murder.id.at.as to healy lies about what time he had come home that night,healy and roy both testified that healy had lied because he had not wanted to disclose to the police that he was homosexual.healy ii,at.the prosecution countered that explanation with evidence that healy had led an openly gay lifestyle,suggesting that the lie was not explained by the reason healy gave.
later,during closing arguments,the defense argued that the absence of blood on the clothes healy said he had been wearing that night meant he could not have been the person who stabbed chalue seventeen times.healy i,at.the prosecution responded to this defense claim in its own closing by arguing that the killer might well have been nude,thus explaining why the killer clothes might not have been bloody 
this man was stabbed times.blood was going all over the place now,you seen the photographs,ladies and gentlemen.the one i just showed you,what kind of activity do you think was going on in that bedroom ask yourselves that.do leave your common sense at home.does it necessarily follow,ladies and gentlemen,that that person who was with chalue had any clothes on at all 
the case went to the jury on april.in the course of the deliberations,the commonwealth made two motions for mistrial.the first was based on a juror requested on permissible inference,reasonable doubt,and circumstantial evidence.the second came after a local newspaper published an article on the case which was prejudicial to the prosecution.in considering the second motion,the trial court noted that the trial was delicate and that a small matter could tip the balance.
the trial court ultimately denied the motions for mistrial.the jury returned a conviction on april the next day,healy was sentenced to life in prison.
in preparation for healy trial,prosecutors had turned over to the defense a final autopsy report containing chalue cause of death and a gross anatomical description.healy ii,at.however,prosecutors had not turned over either the earlier report discussing the examination of the victim rectum and genitalia or the handwritten notes reporting the absence of sperm on april,healy brought a third new trial motion and requested additional discovery this request led to production of the earlier report and the notes.healy subsequently filed an amended new trial motion asserting his brady argument.following an evidentiary hearing,a state superior court judge denied the motion.the sjc affirmed in healy ii.on november,the district court granted habeas relief 
standard of review 
our review of a district court grant or denial of habeas is de novo.norton spencer,cir.put differently,the district court opinion,while helpful for its reasoning,is entitled to no deference.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,our standard of review of the sjc decision depends on whether that court adjudicated on the merits healy brady claim.d.if it did,we review only to determine whether its conclusion involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.mccambridge hall,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted quoting d see also lockyer,at.holding that state court analysis must be objectively unreasonable to run afoul of the unreasonable application prong.if it did not,we review de novo.mccambridge,at.here,as healy concedes,the objectively unreasonable standard applies.we explain why.
there are three components to a brady claim the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the state,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued.strickler greene,d see also banks dretke,d.prejudice exists only if there is a reasonable probability of a different result had the evidence been disclosed.banks,at.internal quotation marks omitted quoting kyles whitley,d see also mccambridge,at.reasonable probability denotes a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the verdict.kyles,at.
the sjc assumed that the first two elements of a brady the evidence was favorable to the defendant and that it had been withheld by the been made out.healy ii,at.in analyzing the third element,prejudice,the sjc acknowledged the brady standard.the sjc chose to use what it has characterized as its more state standard for prejudice,applicable in certain cases.id.citing commonwealth tucceri,stating that the sjc prejudice standard is more favorable to defendants than the federal constitutional standard.the sjc stated that the defendant bore the burden of establishing a substantial basis for claim ing prejudice.healy ii,at quoting tucceri,at.it said prejudice is measured by whether the reviewing court,examining the entire record,can be confident that,even if the prosecution had supplied the report to the defendant in timely fashion,the report or available evidence disclosed by it would not have influenced the jury.id.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted quoting commonwealth daye.since the sjc used a standard more favorable to healy than the federal standard,we consider the brady issue to have been adjudicated on the merits within the meaning of d.see mccambridge,at if there is a federal or state case that explicitly says that the state adheres to a standard that is more favorable to defendants than the federal standard and it is correct in its characterization of the law,we will presume the federal law adjudication to be subsumed within the state law adjudication.
as a federal court sitting in habeas,then,we utilize the brady standard of prejudice and ask whether the sjc conclusion that there was no prejudice was objectively unreasonable.lockyer,at.for a conclusion to be objectively unreasonable,it must carry some increment beyond merely being incorrect.see mccambridge,at t he mere fact that there was some error or that the state decision was incorrect is not enough.see also williams taylor,d.on the other hand,a state court analysis is not to be deemed reasonable merely because it is possible that a competent court could have reached the same conclusion.mccambridge,at.the range for what is an unreasonable application must fall somewhere between the two.within that range,if it is a close question whether the state decision is in error,then the state decision can not be an unreasonable application.id.
the premise of healy brady argument,both before the sjc and on federal habeas,is that the report and notes were significant because they did not show signs of recent sexual activity by the victim.healy argues that this absence of evidence of sexual activity,in turn,was significant for two reasons first,it undermined the commonwealth theory that the murder was a result of a homosexual encounter gone wrong.it is this initial theory of prejudice on which the federal habeas claim largely rests.second,it would help the defense theory that the police were biased against homosexuals,and that their investigation was slanted and suspect.this,healy argues,was because the preliminary report shows that the police were considering chalue killing a murder and instructing the pathologist to search for evidence of homosexual activity from the outset.
the sjc reviewed the entire trial transcript,healy ii,at,and recounted the facts at some length,id.at.it rejected healy brady arguments.
as to the second brady argument,the bias claim,the sjc disagreed that mere examination and testing of the victim body for signs of sexual activity somehow suggests police bias.from the condition of the victim at the crime scene it would be reasonable for the police to consider and investigate the possibility that the murder had some connection to sexual activity.id.at.
as to healy initial theory of sexual encounter sjc responded,quite reasonably,that the theory was weak on its own terms for several reasons and could not demonstrate a likelihood of prejudice.first,the fact that the withheld evidence excluded certain forms of sexual activity did not itself mean that no form of sexual encounter took place.id.at.second,the sjc reasoned,the state of the record without the suppressed materials was essentially the same as with those materials the prosecution at trial had introduced no evidence of recent sexual activity by the victim,so healy was not deprived of the ability to argue that there was no sexual activity.id.at.further,healy had chosen not to make this argument of no sexual activity at trial,when it was available,thus undermining the assertion that it was an important argument for the defense to make.id.at.
the methodology used by the sjc is not to be faulted.as its careful opinion demonstrates,the sjc reviewed the entire record,discussed each of the defendant arguments,and provided reasoned rejections for each point the defendant raised.for this reason,the state court decision can not be attacked on the basis that it is devoid of record support for its conclusions or is arbitrary.mccambridge,at.it is a daunting task for a habeas petitioner to show that a considered opinion by the state highest court is objectively unreasonable when that court has made an evaluative judgment,based on the entire record and applying the correct legal standard,that the petitioner has not met the brady standard for prejudice.where petitioners have succeeded in such claims,it has sometimes been because the state court made an error of law as to the standard to apply.see bailey rae,cir finding state court brady decision unreasonable where it used a prejudice standard less favorable to petitioner than the federal standard.no such error is present here indeed,the sjc concluded there was no prejudice on a standard more favorable to healy than that required under federal law.it also bears note that the sjc was affirming,not reversing,the finding of the motion judge,who also applied the correct standard,that no new trial was warranted.
turning to healy arguments on habeas,we quickly dispatch,as did the district court,healy second prejudice the sjc was objectively unreasonable in rejecting the theory of police bias.the victim largely unclothed body,found on a bed,raised an obvious possibility of a sexual encounter which the police were well warranted in investigating.
as to healy principal theory of prejudice the sjc conclusion that the withheld evidence did not come close to disproving a sexual encounter was not unreasonable.as the sjc wrote,t here is a wide range of sexual activity,up to and including many forms of sexual assault,that leaves neither sperm nor signs of injury to sexual organs.healy ii,at.further,the sjc was correct to note that even absent the w
