in,brian thomas was convicted in the court of common pleas of philadelphia of murder in the first degree,burglary,involuntary deviate sexual intercourse,and rape.the jury sentenced him to death.thomas was unsuccessful on direct appeal,see commonwealth thomas,hereinafter thomas i,and in his state court petition for relief,see commonwealth thomas,hereinafter thomas ii.thomas then petitioned the district court for habeas relief pursuant to.thomas beard,d hereinafter thomas iii.the district court granted thomas sentencing relief based on his trial counsel ineffectiveness,but denied his claims.id.at.both thomas and the commonwealth appealed.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the district court determinations,but will vacate the district court order for sentencing relief,and remand for an evidentiary hearing concerning the extent,if any,of trial counsel investigative efforts to obtain mitigation evidence.
on august,one of linda johnson roommates walked into their philadelphia apartment and found johnson dead body lying on a broken in her room.johnson eyes and face were swollen,and her nose and right temple were bleeding.she had a bite mark on her cheek and bruises on her arms and thighs.she was naked from the waist down,and blood was seeping from her vagina and rectum.a crutch was found near her body.it was also determined that a television set and a can containing about dollars in change were missing from the apartment.
an autopsy of johnson revealed that she had three fractured ribs and a inch tear inside her body that reached from her vagina to her chest cavity.a shirt also had been inserted into her rectum,through her intestinal wall,and into her abdominal cavity with a blunt instrument while she was still alive.additionally,sperm was found inside her vagina.
three days after the discovery of johnson body,the commonwealth arrested thomas for her rape and murder,and for burglarizing her apartment.at trial,three witnesses testified that they had seen thomas and johnson together at or near her apartment within hours of the discovery of her body.the commonwealth also introduced medical evidence that the sperm found in johnson vagina was deposited around the time that thomas and johnson were last seen together the sperm was deposited by a one who does not secrete traces of blood in bodily emissions thomas was a blood found on thomas boxer shorts was human blood and the bite mark on johnson cheek matched thomas teeth.finally,the commonwealth introduced evidence that thomas was in possession of both the missing television and the dollars in change.
on february,the jury found thomas guilty of murder in the first degree,rape,involuntary deviate sexual intercourse,and burglary.during the penalty phase,which began later that day,the commonwealth offered evidence of three aggravating circumstances to support its request for the death penalty killing while perpetrating another felony,namely rape killing by means of torture and a significant history of violent felony convictions.see.d.the commonwealth relied on trial evidence already presented to establish the first two aggravating circumstances.to establish the third,the commonwealth offered evidence of thomas conviction for felonious aggravated assault and indecent assault on a old,which caused injuries to the child rectum and intestines,and thomas conviction for criminal trespass where thomas unlawfully entered a neighbor bedroom while she was sleeping.
at the close of the commonwealth evidence,thomas counsel informed the court that thomas would not be presenting any mitigating evidence.the court determined that thomas should be colloquied regarding the decision to present no mitigating evidence.after this colloquy,thomas,through his counsel,declined the commonwealth offer to stipulate to his age and to the fact that he graduated from high school.as a result,thomas presented no evidence of mitigating circumstances during the penalty phase.nonetheless,in its charge to the jury,the court recited all the mitigating circumstances listed in pennsylvania sentencing statute for murder.e,and told the jury that you may consider anything as a mitigating circumstance.
the jury found the three proposed aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances.accordingly,thomas was sentenced to death on the murder conviction and to consecutive terms of imprisonment of up to fifty years for the burglary,rape,and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse convictions.
thomas,represented by new appellate counsel,unsuccessfully challenged his conviction and sentence on direct appeal to the pennsylvania supreme court.thomas i,at.his subsequent petition for relief under pennsylvania relief act.et.hereinafter pcra,was also denied.thomas ii,at.thomas then petitioned the district court for habeas relief pursuant to,raising grounds for relief.thomas iii,d at.the district court denied thomas petition as to his claims.id.at.the district court,however,determined that thomas trial counsel was ineffective at sentencing under strickland washington,d,because counsel failed to investigate and present mitigating evidence of thomas mental health.thomas ii,d at.the district court also determined that thomas did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to present mitigating evidence because the nature of the proceedings were not adequately explained to him,so the purported waiver could not cure the prejudice resulting from counsel deficiencies.id.at accordingly,the district court vacated thomas death sentence.id.at 
thomas filed a timely appeal,and the district court issued a certificate of appealability for three of thomas claims.the commonwealth filed a alleging that the district court decision to vacate thomas sentence was in error.
the district court had jurisdiction under and,and we have jurisdiction under and.since the district court ruled on thomas habeas petition without an evidentiary hearing,our review of its decision is plenary.see marshall hendricks,cir.this means that we review the state courts determinations under the same standard that the district court was required to apply.id.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,federal courts are to review a state court determinations on the merits only to ascertain whether the state court reached a decision that was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court law,or if a decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.fahy horn,cir.but when the state court has not reached the merits of a claim thereafter presented to a federal habeas court,the deferential standards provided by aedpa do not apply.appel horn,cir.in such an instance,the federal habeas court must conduct a de novo review over pure legal questions and mixed questions of law and fact,as a court would have done prior to the enactment of aedpa.id.a state court factual determinations,however,are still presumed to be correct,rebuttable upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence.id.
we will first address the three claims before us on thomas appeal the trial court reasonable doubt instruction to the jury was unconstitutional the commonwealth closing argument at sentencing was unconstitutional,and thomas counsel was ineffective for not objecting to it and thomas counsel was ineffective for failing to the jury.
at the outset,the parties contest whether aedpa deference pursuant to section d applies to thomas claims.section d applies only to claims already adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.appel,at quoting d.here,the pcra court ruled on the merits of two of thomas closing argument and did not address the objection to the reasonable doubt instruction.on appeal,the pennsylvania supreme court dismissed all three claims as waived because they were not raised in thomas amended pcra petition.see thomas ii,at.the commonwealth argues that the pcra court decision on the merits is an adjudicat ion on the merits in state court proceedings,which renders section d applicable to two of thomas claims.thomas,however,contends that the pennsylvania supreme court determination supercedes the pcra court decision for the purposes of determining whether aedpa deference is due.accordingly,we must decide whether a claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings when a lower state court decided the claim on its merits,but the reviewing state court resolved the claim entirely on procedural grounds.
the second circuit has provided a textual analysis of adjudicated on the merits as used in section d 
when congress uses a term of art such as adjudicated on the merits,we presume that it speaks consistently with the commonly understood meaning of this term.see walters metro.educ,d.adjudicated on the merits has a well settled meaning a decision finally resolving the parties claims,with res judicata effect,that is based on the substance of the claim advanced,rather than on a procedural,or other,ground.see,semtek int l,lockheed martin,d noting one definition of an on the merits adjudication as one that actually passes directly on the substance of a particular claim before the court internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.see also,black law dictionary ed adjudication.the legal process of resolving a dispute the process of judicially deciding a case.judgment.adjudicate.to rule upon judicially.adjudge.webster third new int l dictionary adjudicate to settle finally the rights and duties of the parties to a court case on the merits of issues raised enter on the records of a court a final judgment,order,or decree of sentence.
sellan kuhlman,cir.in rompilla horn,cir,rev on other grounds sub nom.rompilla beard,d,we quoted with approval the second circuit interpretation of adjudicated on the merits.id.at quoting sellan,at.other courts of appeals have done so as well.see teti bender,cir lambert blodgett,cir see also muth frank,cir schoenberger russell,cir keith,concurring.
we reiterate today our approval of the second circuit interpretation of adjudicated on the merits.for the purposes of section d,a claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings when a state court has made a decision that finally resolves the claim,and resolves the claim on the basis of its substance,rather than on a procedural,or other,ground.see rompilla,at quoting sellan,at see also lambert,at a state has adjudicated a petitioner constitutional claim on the merits for purposes of d when it has decided the petitioner right to post conviction relief on the basis of the substance of the constitutional claim advanced,rather than denying the claim on the basis of a procedural or other rule precluding state court review of the merits.sellan,at for the purposes of aedpa deference,a state court adjudicate s a state prisoner federal claim on the merits when it disposes of the claim on the merits,and reduces its disposition to judgment.
we agree with the commonwealth that an adjudication on the merits can occur at any level of state court.unlike other statutes that address federal review of state court decisions,the plain language of section d does not specify that the adjudication on the merits be from any particular state court.compare d with a final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had,may be reviewed by the supreme court by writ of certiorari emphasis added.but to qualify as an adjudication on the merits,the state court decision must finally resolve the claim.this means that the state court resolution of the claim must have preclusive effect.see rompilla,at quoting sellan,at.
applying this rule to the state court decisions here,we see no adjudication on the merits.here,the pennsylvania supreme court decided thomas claims on purely procedural,not substantive,grounds.this decision stripped the pcra court substantive determination of thomas claims of preclusive effect.see restatement second of judgments cmt.o if the judgment of the court of first instance was based on a determination of two issues,either of which standing independently would be sufficient to support the result and i f the appellate court upholds one of these determinations as sufficient and refuses to consider whether or not the other is sufficient and accordingly affirms the judgment,the judgment is conclusive as to the first determination.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.if the appellate court terminates the case by final rulings as to some matters only,preclusion is limited to the matters actually resolved by the appellate court see also,sunrise of myrtle beach city of myrtle beach,cir holding that,although the trial court reversed an administrative determination on,inter alia,constitutional grounds,res judicata did not apply to the constitutional claims because the appellate court affirmed the trial court decision without reaching the constitutional issues.the pennsylvania supreme court decision remains as the only resolution of thomas claims with preclusive effect.accordingly,there has been no adjudication on the merits,and aedpa deference is not due.see also liegakos cooke,cir noting that section d did not apply to claims decided on the merits in state trial court,but disposed of on procedural grounds in the state court of appeals because the disposition of the last state court to issue an opinion determines whether the state has invoked a ground of forfeiture citing ylst nunnemaker,d.
the commonwealth argues that the result we reach today is contrary to our decision in nara frank,cir.it is not.in nara,the lower state court decided the merits of the petitioner incompetency claim and the appellate court subsequently reversed this decision on procedural grounds.id.at.nonetheless,we remarked that the lower state court plainly did reach the merits of nara incompetency claim id.at.this statement,however,was not directed at any section d analysis it was made in the context of determining whether the district court correctly accorded a presumption of correctness pursuant to e to the factual determinations of the lower state court.id.at.as we pointed out,the e presumption of correctness applies regardless of whether there has been an adjudication on the merits for purposes of d.id.at.as a result,the nara panel made no ruling on whether the lower court decision on the merits was an adjudication on the merits for the purposes of section d.indeed,we described the lower court as having reach ed,rather than adjudicated,the merits of nara claim.
fahy horn is also consistent with our decision in this case.in fahy,we applied aedpa deference to a lower court decision on the merits even though a state appellate court dismissed the petitioner subsequent appeal as waived.at.the unique facts of that case,however,warranted such a disposition.in fahy,while his appeal of the lower court decision on the merits was pending,the petitioner filed a motion to withdraw his appeal and to waive all collateral proceedings so that his death sentence could be carried out.id.at.the appellate court remanded the appeal to the lower court for a colloquy to determine whether petitioner fully understands the consequences of his request to withdraw his appeal and to waive all collateral proceedings.id.after conducting the colloquy,the lower court determined that the petitioner withdrawal and waiver decisions were made knowingly and voluntarily,and the petitioner appealed.id.at see also commonwealth fahy.the appellate court affirmed the validity of the petitioner withdrawal and waiver,and dismissed the appeal.at.
on federal habeas review,we acknowledged that the state supreme court never reached the merits of petitioner petition because of his waiver,but we believe that deference still applies to the lower state court decision.at.we arrived at that conclusion because after the appellate court affirmed the validity of the petitioner withdrawal and waiver,the lower court decision on the merits was the decision that finally resolved the claims.see angel bullington.if a litigant chooses not to continue to assert his rights after an intermediate tribunal has decided against him,he has concluded his litigation as effectively as though he had proceeded through the highest tribunal available to him.therefore,the lower court decision was an adjudication on the merits that warranted aedpa deference.
in sum,for the purposes of section d,a claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings when a state court has made a decision that finally resolves the claim based on its substance,not on a procedural,or other,ground.here,neither the pennsylvania supreme court nor the pcra court adjudicated on the merits the three claims before us on thomas appeal.accordingly,we will review purely legal questions and mixed questions of law and fact de novo,but presume the correctness of any factual conclusions made by the state courts.see appel,at.
having decided the appropriate standard of review,we will move to the merits of the claims at issue in thomas appeal 
thomas first claim is that the trial court instruction on the definition of reasonable doubt violated due process because it suggested a higher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the reasonable doubt standard.here,the trial court instructed the jury that a reasonable doubt is such a doubt as would cause a reasonable person to restrain from acting in a matter of great importance in his or her own life.thomas argues that the words restrain from acting set the commonwealth burden of proof too low.
the requirement that guilt of a criminal charge be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt dates at least from our early years as a nation.in re winship,d.trial courts are free to provide juries with a definition for reasonable doubt.victor nebraska,d.further,so long as the court instructs the jury on the necessity that the defendant guilt be proved beyond a reasonable doubt,the constitution does not require that any particular form of words be used in advising the jury of the government burden of proof.id.internal citations omitted.our task on review is to determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction based on proof insufficient to meet the reasonable doubt standard.see id.at.citing estelle mcguire,d.
the pennsylvania supreme court has a long history of approving and recommending the restrain from acting formulation that the trial court used here to define reasonable doubt.in,the court included this formulation in its standard and approved form of charge a reasonable doubt must be an honest doubt arising out of the evidence itself,the kind of a doubt that would restrain a reasonable man or woman from acting in a matter of importance to himself or herself.commonwealth donough.since then,the court has affirmed the use of the restrain from acting formulation on many occasions.see,commonwealth marshall,w e have explicitly approved of reasonable doubt instructions containing the word restrain for nearly five decades.citations omitted commonwealth young,w e have repeatedly placed our imprimatur on the charge expressed in commonwealth donough commonwealth burns,defining reasonable doubt as expressed in donough.
the united states supreme court has not addressed whether the restrain from acting formulation is acceptable.instead,it has repeatedly approved of defining reasonable doubt as a doubt that would cause a reasonable person to hesitate to act.victor,at.emphasis added.
comparing the hesitate to act instruction with the restrain from acting formulation,we are inclined to agree with thomas that the latter places a lower burden of proof on the prosecution.hesitate implies a temporary interruption before acting.see webster third new int l dictionary hesitate a to hold back in doubt or indecision avoid facing a decision,encounter,or problem b to hold back from as if from scruple to delay usually momentarily pause stammer.restrain suggests a more prolonged,if not permanent,period of inaction.see id.at restrain a to hold as a person back from some action,procedure,or course prevent from doing something as by physical or moral force or social pressure b to limit or restrict to or in respect to a particular action or course keep within bounds or under control a to moderate or limit the force,effect,development,or full exercise of prevent or rule out excesses or extremes of b to keep from being manifested or performed a to deprive of liberty place under arrest or restraint b to deprive as of liberty by restraint abridge the freedom of obsolete definitions omitted.accordingly,defining reasonable doubt as such a doubt that would restrain one actions decreases,to some extent,the burden of proof that the prosecution would have to meet were the hesitate to act formulation employed instead.
nonetheless,even though we believe that the restrain from acting formulation lessens the prosecution burden of proof,we can not say that its use is unconstitutional.the supreme court has never indicated that a reasonable doubt instruction must demand as much from the prosecution as the hesitate to act formulation does.instead,the court has merely described the hesitate to act formulation as a common sense benchmark for just how substantial such a doubt must be.victor,at.it does not follow that any definition requiring more doubt than this benchmark is unconstitutional.
the court has provided us with a standard for assessing the constitutionality of a reasonable doubt instruction t aken as a whole,the instructions must correctly conve y the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury.id.at.quoting holland united states.applying this standard,the court has approved of reasonable doubt instructions that defined the term as the kind of doubt which you folks in the more serious and important affairs of your own lives might be willing to act upon,holland,at.not a mere possible doubt but that state of the case which,after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence,leaves the minds of the jurors in that condition that they can not say they feel an abiding conviction,to a moral certainty,of the truth of the charge,victor,at.emphasis omitted,and an actual and substantial doubt reasonably arising from the evidence,from the facts or circumstances shown by the evidence,or from the lack of evidence on the part of the state,as distinguished from a doubt arising from mere possibility,from bare imagination,or from fanciful conjecture,id.at.emphasis omitted.
in contrast,the court has held only one reasonable doubt instruction to be constitutionally deficient 
it must be such doubt as would give rise to a grave uncertainty,raised in your mind by reasons of the unsatisfactory character of the evidence or lack thereof.a reasonable doubt is not a mere possible doubt.it is an actual substantial doubt.it is a doubt that a reasonable man can seriously entertain.what is required is not an absolute or mathematical certainty,but a moral certainty.
cage louisiana,d.in cage,the court reasoned that the words substantial and grave,as they are commonly understood,suggest a higher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the reasonable doubt standard.id.at.the court continued w hen those statements are then considered with reference to moral certainty,rather than evidentiary certainty,it becomes clear that a reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction to allow a finding of guilt based on a degree of proof below that required by the due process clause.id.
viewed against this jurisprudential background,we conclude that the reasonable doubt instruction used here was constitutional.although restrain from acting requires more doubt to acquit than hesitate to act,it does not,by itself,so raise the threshold as to suggest a higher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the reasonable doubt standard.see id.at.as a result,the trial court mere use of the word restrain,though perhaps not ideal,is not enough to render its entire instruction unconstitutional 
thomas second claim is that the commonwealth closing argument at sentencing violated his due process and eighth amendment rights by inviting the jury to consider an improper sentencing dangerousness.he contends that the commonwealth conduct was unconstitutional for two reasons it urged the jury to consider future dangerousness when contemplating the death penalty,which a jury can not do under pennsylvania law and it created an unacceptable risk that the jury believed,in error,that thomas could be released on parole if he were not sentenced to death.thomas also claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the commonwealth argument or to seek curative instructions.
in reviewing the constitutionality of the commonwealth conduct at sentencing,t he relevant question is whether the prosecutors comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.darden wainwright,d quoting donnelly dechristoforo,d.here,at sentencing,the commonwealth stated the following as part of its closing argument to the jury 
there sits brian thomas,there sits convicted brian thomas.you have found what he did to linda johnson.you heard what happened to the three year old whom he assaulted you heard what happened to the neighbor whose bedroom he trespassed into.
it is not for me to say,it is not for the judge to say.only you can say enough.only you can say stop.
i submit to you,ladies and gentlemen,that brian thomas has used up his chances.i would submit to you that it time for somebody to say brian thomas,you have forfeited your right to live among civilized people by your conduct,by your behavior,what you did,why you did it and how you did it.you should not be allowed to continue.
there is not a cry here,ladies and gentlemen,for vengeance.there is not a cry here to bring back a person who is dead.b ut there is a cry here,ladies and gentlemen,for the type of person who would brutally beat,rape and sexual ly mutilate another human being i t time for somebody to say in some way brian thomas,enough is enough.the citizens of philadelphia ca tolerate you in their midst,take you out somewhere where your type of conduct will not ever be a threat to the citizens of philadelphia again.
i submit to you that based on your findings and based on the facts of this case,you must say there is no mitigation,the buck stops here,and for what you did,brian thomas,you should die.y ou should die.
the commonwealth closing does not urge the jury to consider thomas future dangerousness as a sentencing factor.taken in isolation,certain statements may seem to border on such an appeal.but when viewed in context,the commonwealth message is clear thomas crimes,both past and present,are so repulsive that they warrant the death penalty.the commonwealth references to johnson murder,thomas assault of the,and his trespass into a neighbor bedroom demonstrate that the commonwealth was framing its argument with the aggravating circumstance that it sought to show at sentencing thomas history of violent felonies.with that in mind,the commonwealth calls for the jury to say enough,say stop,and to tell thomas that y ou should not be allowed to continue,are plain allusions to its claim that brian thomas has used up his chances,and that the buck stops here,and for what you did,brian thomas,you should die.indeed,the commonwealth use of the word tolerate and the phrase your type of conduct indicates that it wanted the jury to impose the death penalty because the citizens of philadelphia had had enough of thomas past criminal conduct,not because thomas could be a threat to society in the future.simmons south carolina,d characterizing an argument that death would be a response of society to someone who is a threat.your verdict will be an act of as an argument to consider future dangerousness as a sentencing factor.
nor does the commonwealth argument create an unacceptable risk that the jury believed that,if it did not impose the death penalty,thomas could be released on parole.plainly,the commonwealth never mentioned parole,and we do not read its argument as suggesting that thomas could be paroled from a life sentence.as a result,the commonwealth conduct at sentencing was constitutional 
thomas third claim is that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to the determine that each juror could vote for a life sentence.strickland sets the relevant test thomas must show that his counsel performance was deficient,and his counsel deficient performance caused him prejudice.at.to be deficient,counsel performance must fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.to demonstrate prejudice,thomas must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.
in morgan illinois,d,the supreme court held that defendants had a right to potential jurors at voir dire.at issue here is not whether thomas trial counsel should have known he had a right to ask questions at the time the jury was years before morgan was decided.it is clear that he knew that he could he asked one juror questions,and she responded that she could vote for a life sentence under certain circumstances.the only question in this case is whether counsel failure to ask the rest of the jurors questions constituted ineffectiveness.we believe that it does not.
first,we note that the supreme court has never imposed an obligation on trial counsel to a jury.see morgan,at.framing the issue as whether on voir dire the court must,on defendant request,inquire into the prospective jurors views on capital punishment emphasis added.
second,thomas has not identified any relevant p revailing norms of practice as reflected in american bar association standards and the like,strickland,at,that suggest that thomas counsel had an obligation to the jury.
third,the record does not indicate that thomas counsel had any reason to any additional jurors.thomas suggests that two jurors showed so much enthusiasm for the death penalty in their responses to the court question that they should have been one juror responded with i believe in the death penalty when asked whether he had any moral,religious or ethical beliefs which could prevent him from voting for the death penalty in a proper case and another juror answered n o before the court finished asking the question.to us,however,neither response is so indicative of a bias in favor of the death penalty that effective counsel would have asked to these two jurors.there are a myriad of reasons why the first juror chose to use the words that he did,and the second juror chose to answer as quickly as he did.without more,we will not speculate that they did so because of any enthusiasm for the death penalty.
fourth,even if thomas counsel were deficient for failing to every juror,thomas has not shown prejudice.since pennsylvania death sentence can only be imposed by a unanimous jury,see.c iv,thomas has demonstrated prejudice if there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors one juror would have voted to impose a sentence of life imprisonment rather than the death penalty.bond beard,cir quoting strickland,at.thomas has provided not a shred of evidence suggesting any probability that,had his trial counsel every juror,at least one juror would have voted to sentence thomas to life imprisonment.he simply invites our speculation.accordingly,thomas claim for habeas relief on this ground was properly denied.
we turn next to the issues that the commonwealth raises on.the district court granted thomas sentencing relief because it determined that two of his claims had merit thomas trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence,and thomas waiver of his right to present mitigating evidence was not made knowingly and intelligently.thomas iii,d at.on,the commonwealth argues that the district court erred in vacating thomas sentence because the district court applied the wrong standard of review,there is insufficient evidence that thomas counsel failed to investigate mitigating evidence,and any deficiency by counsel did not prejudice thomas.
the commonwealth claims that the district court erred in reviewing thomas ineffective assistance and waiver claims de novo because they were adjudicated on the merits by the pennsylvania supreme court,and aedpa deference pursuant to section d is warranted.we disagree.
it is clear that thomas raised both the ineffective assistance and waiver claims in state court.on direct appeal,thomas asserted that he did not waive his right to present mitigating evidence knowingly and intelligently.indeed,he submitted an affidavit that set out the factual basis for this claim 
i did not then understand that i could present evidence concerning my character as a mitigating circumstance during the penalty phase.i was under the belief that i could only present evidence relating to the circumstances of the offense.this is the reason why i declined to present any testimony at the penalty hearing at no time did my attorney explain to me that evidence concerning my character could or should be presented for the jury consideration at the penalty hearing.
in his pcra petition,thomas repeated this claim,and added an allegation that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence that was available at the time of his sentencing.
even though thomas raised these claims during the course of the state court proceedings,no state court actually adjudicated them on their merits.the pcra court and the reviewing pennsylvania supreme court declined to reach the merits of each.instead,both courts determined that the claims have previously been decided by the pennsylvania supreme court on direct appeal.thomas ii,at.in reaching that conclusion,both courts were mistaken.first,the pennsylvania supreme court could not have addressed thomas ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal because he raised it for the first time in his pcra petition.second,on direct appeal,the pennsylvania supreme court never determined whether thomas knowingly and intelligently waived his right to present mitigating evidence.on direct appeal,the pennsylvania supreme court addressed only one mitigating evidence issue whether thomas understood that he could present mitigating evidence.thomas i,at finally,appellant complains that his trial counsel did not advise him that he could put on evidence of mitigating circumstances and that this omission was prejudicial ineffectiveness.emphasis added.but thomas waiver claim raised a completely different issue he asserted that his waiver was not knowing and intelligent because he did not understand the nature and purpose of mitigating evidence.therefore,no state court actually decided the claims that formed the basis of the district court decision to grant thomas habeas relief.
the commonwealth points out that the pennsylvania supreme court,in reviewing thomas pcra petition,stated that t he issue of the presentation of mitigating evidence,in all its possible manifestations,was determined by this court previous decision.thomas ii,at.the commonwealth urges us to accept the pennsylvania supreme court statement at face value and view thomas claims as adjudicated on the merits.this we can not do.for the purposes of determining whether there was an adjudication on the merits in state court,what matters most is what the state court actually did,not what it said it did.we can not blindly accept a court ex post characterization of its prior action when that characterization is at odds with what we conclude the court prior action plainly was.
i f an examination of the opinions of the state courts shows that they misunderstood the nature of a properly exhausted claim and thus failed to adjudicate that claim on the merits,the deferential standards of review in aedpa do not apply.chadwick janecka,cir.here,the record plainly shows that while thomas raised the claims at issue in state court,the state courts did not reach their merits.accordingly,there was no adjudication on the merits,and the district court was correct in reviewing the claims de novo.see appel,at.
the district court addressed thomas ineffective assistance and waiver claims together,thomas iii,d at,but thomas ineffective assistance claim was the focal point of its analysis.first,the district court concluded that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence.id.at.second,the district court determined that thomas waiver of his right to present mitigating evidence did not cure the prejudice caused by counsel deficiency because the waiver was not made knowingly and intelligently.id.at.accordingly,in reviewing the district court decision and the merits of the commonwealth,we will concentrate on thomas ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
the commonwealth directs our attention to the evidentiary record that thomas is obligated to produce in support of his ineffective assistance claim.it points out that courts assessing attorney performance must apply a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.strickland,at.here,the commonwealth sees no evidence on the record concerning the extent,if any,of thomas counsel investigation into mitigating evidence.it argues that,based on such a record,thomas can not possibly demonstrate that his counsel was deficient.accordingly,the commonwealth asserts that we must deny thomas request for habeas relief.
we agree with the commonwealth that the record is sparse.the only documentary evidence directly pointing to a failure to investigate is a declaration from thomas aunt,signed nine years after thomas sentencing,that states that no attorney or investigator asked her about thomas life and mental health while he was on trial.but thomas has sought to prove that trial counsel did not investigate,so thomas failure to discover evidence of an investigation is itself a sign that none occurred.therefore,it is entirely appropriate for us to consider what thomas has looked for,but can not find.here,after thomas purportedly waived the presentation of mitigating evidence,there was no proffer from counsel identifying the investigative measures he had undertaken,or what evidence he was prepared to present.additionally,a search of the state court file,where thomas counsel and the court would have lodged certain documents,yielded nothing suggesting an request for a mitigation investigator,no request for funds for a mitigation investigation,no request for a defense mental health expert,and no subpoenas for mental health records.had thomas counsel performed any investigation,we would expect either some mention of it in open court or some paper trail suggesting it in the record of proceedings.the absence of both implies that counsel did no investigating.
nonetheless,from this record,we can not simply jump to the conclusion that thomas counsel was deficient.counsel performance enjoys a presumption of effectiveness,and we must judge the reasonableness of counsel challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case,viewed as of the time of counsel conduct.id.at.a reviewing court can not make such a determination on a clean slate.marshall,at.this means that based on the present record,we can not affirm the district court conclusion that thomas counsel was deficient at sentencing.
we by no means go so far as to deny thomas the possibility of relief.this is not the first time we have been asked to determine counsel effectiveness where the picture is less than complete.id.in marshall,we also had no record before us as to what preparation or investigation,if any,was performed by counsel in anticipation of the penalty phase id.we therefore conclude d that a district court hearing is essential,and remand ed for a new ruling by the district court as to strickland based upon a complete record.id.at.likewise,we believe that any resolution of thomas strickland claims here is premature without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing.accordingly,we will remand the case for a hearing concerning the extent,if any,of thomas counsel investigative efforts to obtain mitigating evidence.
the commonwealth urges that an evidentiary hearing would be inappropriate for two reasons thomas has failed to develop a factual record in state court,so a hearing would be barred by e and even if counsel were deficient,thomas can not prevail because he was not prejudiced.neither of these arguments are persuasive.
first,thomas did not fail to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court in such a way that causes section e to bar an evidentiary hearing under the opening clause of e,a failure to develop the factual basis of a claim is not established unless there is lack of diligence,or some greater fault,attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner counsel.williams taylor,d.diligence depends upon whether the prisoner made a reasonable attempt,in light of the information available at the time,to investigate and pursue claims in state court it does not depend upon whether those efforts could have been successful.id.at.in thomas varner,cir,we concluded that the petitioner request for an evidentiary hearing in the state court,which was denied,showed sufficient diligence to render section e inapplicable.id.at.likewise,here,thomas requested an evidentiary hearing in the pcra court to develop the factual record for his claim that trial counsel failed to investigate mitigating evidence.therefore,section e does not apply.see also williams,at.diligence will require in the usual case that the prisoner,at a minimum,seek an evidentiary hearing in state court in the manner prescribed by state law.
second,without a fully developed record,we can not foreclose the possibility that thomas will be able to show reasonable probability that,but for counsel deficiency,one juror would have voted to impose a sentence of life imprisonment.see bond,at.in pennsylvania,the jury must impose a sentence of life imprisonment unless it unanimously finds that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances.c iv.e xtreme mental or emotional disturbance is specifically listed as a mitigating circumstance that pennsylvania juries may consider when deciding whether to impose the death penalty.e.here,the commonwealth does not dispute that even the most cursory search would have yielded evidence of thomas long history of mental illness.this history includes a court commitment to a psychiatric hospital when thomas was sixteen,and a mental health evaluation when he was eighteen that described him as having responses similar to those in the literature describing paranoid schizophrenia,and serious mental disturbance.additionally,had counsel sought to examine thomas mental health prior to his sentencing,the results likely would have revealed some mental illness according to a psychological evaluation conducted the day of thomas sentencing,
a t the present time,this defendant can be best described as suffering from severe multiple personality disorders,and continues to indicate sociopathic,reactive paranoid,and schizoid traits.there is continued indication,both clinically as well as on psychological testing,of a great deal of underlying psychopathology which is clearly focused in the sexual area,with indication of sexual identity confusion,hostility and ambivalence toward women,and indication of very primitive,brittle,and inadequate controls.
placed in the hands of effective counsel,there is a reasonable probability that this evidence would have persuaded at least one juror to impose life imprisonment rather than the death penalty.
the commonwealth argues that even assuming that effective counsel would have discovered thomas mental health history,no prejudice could have resulted because thomas would not have let his counsel present any mitigating evidence.the commonwealth asserts that schriro landrigan,d,and taylor horn,cir,are indistinguishable from the present case and require us to hold that there is no prejudice here.we disagree.
in landrigan,the supreme court confronted for the first time a situation in which a client interferes with counsel efforts to present mitigating evidence to a sentencing court.at.there,the petitioner counsel informed the trial court that he had advised the petitioner very strongly that the petitioner should present mitigating evidence.id.at.the trial court questioned the petitioner,and the petitioner confirmed that he instructed his counsel not to present mitigating evidence and that he understood the consequences.id.when the petitioner counsel was proffering,at the court request,the mitigating evidence he intended to present,the petitioner interrupted multiple times to explain away the mitigating characteristics of the evidence,and also to reaffirm that he did not want the evidence presented in court.id.at.finally,at the end of the sentencing hearing,the petitioner stated that i think if you want to give me the death penalty,just bring it right on.i ready for it.id.applying aedpa deferential standard of review,the supreme court determined that the state appellate court reasonably concluded that the petitioner had refused to allow the presentation of mitigating evidence,and this refusal prevented any showing of prejudice.id.at.
in taylor,the petitioner wrote a confession letter to the police,which stated that i want the maximum sentence.at.at the petitioner guilty plea hearing,the petitioner agreed with his counsel statement that he had instructed counsel not to contact any witnesses or to call any medical personnel who had spoken to him,and that he understood that the likely result will be imposition of the death penalty.id.at sentencing,the petitioner informed the court that he declined to present any mitigating evidence.id.at.the court then sentenced the petitioner to death.id.in the subsequent state relief proceedings,the state court conducted an evidentiary hearing,denied the petitioner request for relief,and found that the petitioner had discussed the possibility of presenting testimony of mitigating circumstances with his counsel,that the petitioner rejected the idea of doing so,and that the petitioner personally called potential witnesses to tell them not to attend his sentencing.id.at.the state appellate court affirmed these findings and the court holding.see also commonwealth taylor.
applying aedpa deferential standard of review,we determined in taylor that the state court factual and legal conclusions were reasonable.at.comparing the petitioner to the one in landrigan,we agreed with the petitioner that he was not belligerent and obstructive in court like the defendant in landrigan,but the record shows that his determination not to present mitigating evidence was just as strong.id.at.as a result,whatever counsel could have uncovered,the petitioner would not have permitted any witnesses to testify,and was therefore not prejudiced by any inadequacy in counsel investigation or decision not to present mitigation evidence.id.
the commonwealth claims that like the petitioners in landrigan and taylor,thomas would have prevented his counsel from presenting any mitigating evidence,no matter what it was,thus obviating any possibility of prejudice.it points to thomas conduct at his sentencing for factual support.yet based on our review of the record,we believe that both landrigan and taylor differ significantly from the present case.as an initial matter,aedpa deference pursuant to section d constrained federal review in both landrigan and taylor.it does not apply here.see supra part.this means that while the pennsylvania courts determinations of factual issues shall be presumed to be correct,we review de novo the mixed question of law and fact of whether thomas can show prejudice.see appel,at.
moving to the merits of the commonwealth argument,we can not conclude that thomas would have interfered with the presentation of all mitigating evidence.thomas colloquy at sentencing focused narrowly on whether he wanted to take the stand himself 
thomas counsel thomas,you recall during the case in chief that we inquired as to whether or not you wanted to testify on your own behalf.do you recall that 
thomas yeah,i do.why do i answer all these questions before we done be over that already.no,i do want to get on the stand.
the court well,this is a different portion.
thomas i still do want to get on the stand.
the court under no conditions 
the court is this your decision 
thomas yes,it is.
the court did you discuss it with your lawyer,watson 
thomas yes.
the court and you already told him,i would like to repeat,but it your decision not to take the stand at this penalty stage of the hearing or even to present any evidence.is that your independent and voluntary decision 
thomas it is.
