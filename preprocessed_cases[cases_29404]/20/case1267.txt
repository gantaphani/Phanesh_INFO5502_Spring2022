the respondent appeals from the district court grant of habeas corpus in favor of the defendant,michael wayne haley haley.finding no error,we affirm.the only issue before us is whether the district court properly granted habeas relief to haley for his claim.thus,we recite only those facts pertinent to our decision.
factual and procedural background 
haley,an inmate of the texas department of criminal justice,institutional division,proceeding pro se,filed a federal application for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,asserting that his conviction was illegal.
on october,haley was convicted of a state jail felony,which is a felony in the second degree,and was sentenced as a habitual felony offender.see tex penal code ann.and.antecedent to the conviction,haley was indicted for theft,a class a misdemeanor,which was enhanced to a state jail felony by his two prior theft convictions in addition,the indictment alleged two prior felony convictions for delivery of amphetamines and aggravated robbery together,these two prior convictions enhanced his state jail felony to a second degree felony.because the indictment alleged two prior felony convictions,haley was classified as an habitual felony offender resulting in an enhanced sentence at the punishment phase of his trial.
during the punishment phase of haley trial,the state presented one witness who testified that haley had been previously convicted of delivery of amphetamines and aggravated robbery.haley did not the state witness or put on any evidence.after the parties rested,the jury was excused while the trial court prepared the jury instructions.shortly after the jury was excused,the trial judge realized that the enhancement paragraphs provided in the indictment,concerning haley two prior convictions for delivery of a controlled substance and aggravated robbery,had not been read to the jury.before bringing the jury back into the courtroom,the trial judge asked haley if he wanted to enter a plea to the enhancements before the jury.haley chose not to enter a plea and requested that the trial court not inform the jury that he was given such an opportunity.the next day,the trial court reopened the punishment proceedings to allow the state to read the enhancements to the jury.no mention was made of haley decision not to enter a plea,and the state did not reoffer its witness testimony.haley did not object to the reading of the enhancement or to the state failure to reoffer the evidence.the jury found the enhancements alleged in the indictment to be true,and haley was sentenced to a term of sixteen years and six months imprisonment.
haley appealed his conviction,arguing,inter alia,that the trial court erred in failing to ask him to plead to the enhancement paragraphs of the indictment at the beginning of the punishment phase of his trial and that the trial court erred,during the punishment phase,in allowing the state to reopen its case for the purpose of reading the enhancement paragraphs to the jury.the texas appellate court affirmed haley conviction.the court concluded that any error due to the trial court failure in not requiring the state to reintroduce haley prior convictions,or in allowing the jury to consider his prior convictions before the reading of the enhancements,was waived by haley failure to object on those grounds.further,it found that any error by the trial court in failing to elicit a plea from haley to the enhancements after the enhancements were read to the jury was waived under the invited error doctrine.thereafter,the texas court of criminal appeals refused haley petition for discretionary review.
in february,haley filed a state habeas application in the trial court raising several challenges to the enhancement of his punishment.the court determined that his application raised the following grounds of error the theft offense was not properly enhanced in accordance with the texas penal code,the evidence was insufficient to support the enhancements for the prior felony offenses of delivery of amphetamines and aggravated robbery,and ineffective assistance of counsel.the state habeas trial court recommended that the application be denied concluding that the theft offense was enhanced correctly,the sufficiency of the evidence had been raised on direct appeal and thus could not be attacked by a writ of habeas corpus,and haley trial counsel was not ineffective.the texas court of criminal appeals denied haley state habeas application based upon the findings of the trial court.
haley timely filed a application in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas in which he alleged the following points of error there was no evidence to support the chronological order of the enhancements as stated in the indictment there was no evidence presented to support the state claim that he had previously been convicted of aggravated robbery,the state made an improper jury argument,and he received ineffective assistance of counsel.
with regard to the first alleged error,haley argued that the aggravated robbery in cause was committed on october,and the conviction for delivery of amphetamines in cause did not become final until october,thus,he contended that the indictment incorrectly stated that the delivery of amphetamines conviction became final prior to the commission of each of the offenses set out above,and the jury could not have found the enhancement paragraphs factually accurate.in its response to haley application,the state conceded that the chronological order of the convictions alleged in the enhancement paragraphs was erroneous.
in response to haley second allegation,the state argued that haley sentence was properly enhanced because he had a prior felony conviction,aggravated robbery,which included an affirmative finding of a deadly weapon however,haley countered that he was sentenced for attempted robbery which did not contain a finding of a deadly weapon,indicating that this finding was removed by a nunc pro tunc judgment the state later conceded that haley attempted robbery conviction did not include an affirmative finding of a deadly weapon.
nonetheless,the state argued that even though there was no finding of a deadly weapon in his robbery conviction,haley was not entitled to habeas relief because his claim was procedurally barred from federal habeas review.the state emphasized that the state appellate court specifically noted that haley failed to preserve any issue regarding the enhancement for review on appeal because he had failed to raise them in a timely objection or motion.the state noted that,on habeas review the state trial court concluded that his sufficiency claims could not be raised for the first time in a habeas application,and that the texas court of criminal appeals denied his state habeas application on the findings of the trial court.the state therefore reasoned that any issue relating to the enhancement that haley may now be raising would be procedurally barred by his failure to present any contemporaneous objections alternatively,the state argued that the doctrine of invited error barred haley from obtaining federal relief,given his voluntary silence and inaction during trial.
upon order of the district court,a magistrate judge issued a report,recommending that haley federal habeas application be granted on his claim regarding the improper enhancement of his sentence the judge was not persuaded that haley claim was procedurally barred because the state appellate court decision addressed only those claims raised by haley on direct appeal.because haley had not argued that the robbery charge did not include a finding of a deadly weapon,the magistrate judge found that the state appellate court had not expressly applied the procedural bar to this argument notwithstanding the procedural bar,the magistrate judge determined that haley procedural default was excused because haley had shown that he was actually innocent of a predicate violation required for sentencing as a career offender for a second degree felony.the judge concluded that failure to address this claim would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.
after a de novo review,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and granted haley application as to the claim that his sentence was improperly enhanced denying him relief on his other claims.accordingly,the district court ordered the texas courts to haley without the improper enhancement within ninety days and that should the state fail to do so,his conviction shall be reversed.this court subsequently granted the state motion to stay the district court order of during the appeal of this case.this appeal follows.
standard of review 
when reviewing a grant of habeas corpus relief,this court reviews the district court factual findings for clear error and its disposition of pure legal issues and mixed issues of law and fact de novo.valdez cockrell,cir.if a decision rejecting a federal habeas petitioner constitutional claim rests on an adequate and independent state procedural bar,a federal habeas court may not review the merits of the federal claim absent a showing of cause and prejudice for the procedural default,or a showing that failure to review the claim would result in a complete miscarriage of justice.muhleisen ieyoub,cir.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa provides for deference in reviewing claims in a state prisoner habeas corpus application that were adjudicated on the merits in proceedings.d.a federal court must defer to a state court resolution of both pure questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact unless the state court determination was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.d.a applicant may also receive habeas corpus relief regarding a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court if the claim resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.the deferential standards set forth by aedpa,however,do not apply where the state court denied the petitioner claim on procedural grounds.see valdez cockrell,at section d deference operates when the state court has adjudicated the petitioner claim on the merits an adjudication on the merits occurs when the state court resolves the case on substantive grounds,rather than procedural grounds.see also fisher texas,cir concluding that when a state habeas court decides a habeas applicant claim on procedural grounds,there has not been an adjudication on the merits.because the state habeas court dismissed this claim on procedural grounds,the deferential standards under d do not apply.
discussion 
under the doctrine,federal courts are precluded from granting habeas relief where the last state court to consider the claims raised by the petitioner expressly and unambiguously based its denial of relief on an independent and adequate procedural ground.coleman thompson,d hughes johnson,cir.when a state court explicitly relies on a procedural bar,a state prisoner may not obtain federal habeas relief absent a showing of cause for the default and actual prejudice.coleman,at.wainwright sykes,d.a petitioner who fails to satisfy the standard may nonetheless be entitled to habeas relief if he can show that the imposition of the procedural bar would constitute a miscarriage of,that the petitioner is actually innocent of the crime.sawyer whitley,d finley johnson,cir.in order to be actually innocent of a sentence,the petitioner must show that but for the constitutional error he would not have been legally eligible for the sentence he received.sones hargett,cir citing smith collins,cir.
procedural default 
the state asserts that haley claims are procedurally barred because he failed to raise any objection to the enhancement at trial.a state prisoner is generally required to exhaust all available state remedies before applying for federal relief.see nobles johnson,cir.under texas law,sufficiency of the evidence may be raised on direct appeal,but is not cognizable on collateral review.see clark state of,cir.thus,in order to exhaust his claims,haley was required to raise them in a petition for discretionary review.see richardson procunier,cir.he did not.haley is procedurally barred from raising his claims in state court because his time to file a petition for discretionary review has expired.see.
because haley has failed to exhaust his claims,federal review is barred unless he can show cause and actual prejudice from the procedural default,or that failure to review the claim would result in a complete miscarriage of justice due to his actual innocence.see muhleisen,at.haley has not alleged cause or actual prejudice.thus,we must determine whether haley claim can be reviewed under the exception to the procedural bar.an actual innocence claim is a gateway through which a habeas petitioner must pass to have his otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on the merits.dowthitt johnson,cir quoting herrera collins,at.haley has made such a claim.
ii.actual innocence exception 
the state argues that the district court erred in applying the exception to the instant case because it involves a noncapital offense.this court has twice assumed,without holding that the actual innocence exception is available in a noncapital sentencing context.see sones hargett,cir smith collins,cir.until this case,we have left open the issue of whether the exception applies to sentencing in noncapital cases.we now hold that the actual innocence exception applies to noncapital sentencing procedures involving a career or habitual felony offender.
the magistrate judge recognized that the extension of the actual innocence standard to noncapital cases was dicta in smith and sones.nevertheless,the magistrate judge applied the standard and concluded that it is clear from the record that haley was actually innocent of the predicate felony conviction necessary to enhance his conviction from a state jail felony to a felony.by extension,the magistrate judge concluded that because haley is actually innocent of having two prior felony convictions,haley sentence was improperly enhanced as a habitual felony offender.the district court adopted the magistrate judge finding and granted habeas relief as to the claim that haley sentence was improperly enhanced.we agree with the district court that,based on the unquestionable improper enhancement of haley sentence,he has shown that,but for the constitutional error,he would not have been legally eligible for the sentence he received.
the state argues that this issue has not been addressed by the supreme court.although the court has not expressly extended the actual innocence exception to noncapital offenses,it considered whether a petitioner was actually innocent of the aggravating factors necessary for a capital sentence.see sawyer whitley,d.the court did not foreclose the application of the actual innocence exception to noncapital sentencing cases.more importantly,the court has noted that the purpose of the rule is grounded in the equitable discretion of habeas courts to see that federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarceration of innocent persons.herrera collins,d citation omitted.with this fundamental purpose in mind,we agree with the fourth circuit which has held that the actual innocence exception applies to non capital cases only in the context of a habitual offender finding during the punishment phase of the trial.
the state further notes that other circuit courts are split on the issue of whether,in the sentencing context,the actual innocence exception applies to capital cases only or also to noncapital cases.compare spence superintendent,great meadow correctional facility,cir holding that the actual innocence exception applies to noncapital sentencing when a predicate act for enhancement is at issue with embrey hershberger,cir en banc holding that the actual innocence exception applies to the sentencing phase of death cases cert.denied,d.
the eighth,seventh,and tenth circuits have held that in the sentencing context,the actual innocence exception applies only to sentencing in capital cases.see embrey,at hope united states,cir determining that the actual innocence exception to noncapital sentencing proc
