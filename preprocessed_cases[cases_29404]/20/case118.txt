because it is pertinent,we give the mac account of butler conduct as well as of the resulting injuries to his victim 
the victim,a teenager who should have gone to school but decided to sleep in,woke around noontime on february,to find the defendant sitting on her bed,his windbreaker hood pulled down to conceal his face.over a period he raped the victim,holding a sharp silver object a knife or a pair of scissors to her neck and punching her repeatedly in the ribs.he then told her to lie face down so she would not see him,then left.the victim immediately called a friend to report what had happened,and before the day was out she went to brockton hospital,which followed standard protocol rape kit.in telling friends,police,and hospital workers about the incident,the victim stated she did not know the assailant,primarily,she later said,because she feared retribution to her and her family.about five weeks after the rape,the victim admitted,first to a close friend and eventually to the police,that she had in fact recognized the assailant as a cousin of her neighbor.eight days later she picked the defendant from a photo array,and dna testing of the defendant compared to the vaginal swab in the rape kit confirmed the identification.
butler,wl,at.resulting from the rape,the victim suffered a linear abrasion on her neck to which the defendant held the knife,d iffuse tenderness to her left rib cage,and a tear at her vaginal introitus,for which she received medical treatment.id.
on federal habeas review,butler presented four claims,only one of which is the subject of this full opinion that the state aggravated rape statute is void for vagueness as applied to butler because it does not define resulting in serious bodily injury.
butler claim,that the aggravated rape statute was void for vagueness for its failure to define serious bodily injury,was presented late to the state appeals court and was not presented on his first direct or in the state trial court.while noting the procedural default,the appeals court nonetheless addressed the claim on its merits 
applying the deferential standard for federal habeas review under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,the federal district court held that the state court decision was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court law.under d,a federal court may only grant a habeas claim where the state court adjudication of that claim,resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.the district court held that butler failed to meet this high burden of proof.we affirm.
the state aggravated rape statute.laws ch,a,provides,in pertinent part 
whoever has sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse with a person,and compels such person to submit by force and against his will,or compels such person to submit by threat of bodily injury and if either such sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse results in or is committed with acts resulting in serious bodily injury,shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years.
the aggravated rape statute does not provide a separate definition of serious bodily injury.the rape statute omits the requirement of serious bodily injury,and has a lower sentencing range of up to years.id.b.butler was sentenced to life imprisonment,after a jury convicted him of aggravated rape.
clarity is needed as to which issues are before us.the issue before us is not whether the evidence of serious bodily injury was sufficient to support the verdict.that has been resolved against butler and is not the subject of his appeal from denial of his habeas petition.
the issue for a federal court is also not whether the state court rejection of his statutory void for vagueness argument is correct and we do suggest it was incorrect.aedpa limits federal court review to the issue of whether that decision was itself contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.d.this is a highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings,lindh murphy,which demands that decisions be given the benefit of the doubt,woodford visciotti,per curiam,and that the defendant seeking habeas show that the state court ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement,bobby dixon,per curiam quoting harrington richter.
in order to answer this aedpa question,it is also important to be clear as to exactly what butler constitutional argument is.he does not argue,nor could he,that he was not on fair notice that rape was a crime or that his conduct would subject him to criminal liability.it is that both rape and aggravated rape are crimes.his argument is also not that there was uncertainty that he was within the class of persons within the scope of the statute.see,lanzetta new jersey.
rather,his challenge is that the term resulting in serious bodily injury is so vague that he was not put on constitutionally adequate notice of the enhanced sentence he would receive for his conduct.this challenge falls into a special and limited category of void for vagueness arguments as to the uncertainty of the punishment imposed for knowingly criminal conduct.as the supreme court stated in united states batchelder,s o too,vague sentencing provisions may post constitutional questions if they do not state with sufficient clarity the consequences of violating a given criminal statute.id.at citing giaccio pennsylvania,united states evans,united states brown,see also lafave,substantive criminal law ed.undue vagueness in the statute will result in it being held unconstitutional,where the uncertainty goes to the punishment which may be imposed.
the state court correctly paraphrased the basic constitutional standard for void for vagueness challenges set forth in clearly established supreme court law.under the constitution,a criminal statute must give fair warning of the conduct that it makes a crime.bouie city of columbia,see also kolender,at giaccio,at united states buckalew,cir the question is whether,looking at the statute in light of the facts of the case at hand,it provide s a constitutionally adequate warning to those whose activities are governed.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.since bouie,the standard has been restated as a conviction fails to comport with due process if the statute under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited,or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.hill colorado.there is no viable claim that the state court decision was contrary to clearly established federal law.
butler argument to us is that in united states lanier,the supreme court held for purposes of a federal defendant claims of void for vagueness,that there are three manifestations of the fair warning requirement 
first,the vagueness doctrine bars enforcement of a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.second,as a sort of junior version of the vagueness doctrine,the canon of strict construction of criminal statutes,or rule of lenity,ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it only to conduct clearly covered.third,although clarity at the requisite level may be supplied by judicial gloss on an otherwise uncertain statute,due process bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its scope.
id.at internal citations omitted.butler argues the state court decision was unreasonable in its analysis with respect to all three manifestations.
we quickly dispatch the argument that the state court was required by clearly established supreme court case law to apply the rule of lenity or any other particular canon of statutory construction.lanier says no such thing as to federal habeas review of state court decisions.lanier characterizes the second manifestation as a rule of federal statutory construction.the rule of lenity manifestation is thus not applicable to our review of a state court criminal conviction,nor does lanier purport to say this.federal courts have no power to dictate to state courts rules of statutory construction or mandate adoption of the rule of lenity.sabetti dipaolo,cir.in any event,no such rule is clearly established as to state court convictions.finally,it would not be unreasonable to conclude that the rule of lenity on its own terms does not apply here.see united states gerhard,cir.
in addition,this case does not fall under lanier third prong.this is not a case like bouie,in which the court invalidates an unforeseeable judicial enlargement of the scope of a criminal statute.there are no retroactive lawmaking concerns here,see rose locke,and there is no issue of lulling a defendant into a false sense of security that on these facts his admitted rape of his victim must be found to be ordinary and not aggravated rape.id.at.
this leaves us with lanier first manifestation that a statute is void for vagueness where it either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.at quoting connally constr.
this formulation is taken from the court prior vagueness jurisprudence,including its decision in kolender lawson,which butler cites to us.in kolender,the court elaborated on the rule that a person of average intelligence must have constitutionally adequate notice that his conduct was forbidden by the statute.it held that there are two components to this rule such notice must be clear to the offender and sufficiently clear to law enforcement officials so as to avoid arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.at see also uri student senate town of narragansett,cir.
butler relies,in particular,on this second component of kolender analysis,in which the court explained,we have recognized recently that the more important aspect of vagueness doctrine is the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.at quoting smith goguen,internal quotation marks omitted.where the legislature fails to provide such minimal guidelines,a criminal statute may permit a standardless sweep that allows policemen,prosecutors,and juries to pursue their personal predilections.id.alteration in original quoting smith,at.
we first note that kolender analysis arises in the first amendment context,in which there are enhanced concerns about arbitrary enforcement under the void for vagueness doctrine where there is the potential for arbitrarily suppressing first amendment liberties,as was the case in kolender.id.quoting shuttlesworth city of birmingham,internal quotation mark omitted.a more stringent vagueness test is used when the rights of free speech or association are involved.holder humanitarian law project.by contrast,v agueness challenges to statutes not threatening first amendment interests are examined in light of the facts of the case at hand the statute is judged on an basis.united states hussein,cir quoting maynard cartwright,internal quotation marks omitted.there are no first amendment concerns at issue here and it is far from clearly established that kolender more important aspect of arbitrary enforcement applies where there are no first amendment concerns.
even when expressive rights are involved,the supreme court has been clear that perfect clarity and precise guidance have never been required.united states williams,quoting ward rock against racism,internal quotation mark omitted.the mere fact that close cases can be envisioned does not make a statute vague.id.at.
the supreme court recently refined kolender analysis in williams,itself a case that involved first amendment concerns,when it stated,a conviction fails to comport with due process if the statute under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited,or is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.at.
under this test the mac conclusion that the massachusetts aggravated rape statute is not unconstitutionally vague is not unreasonable.the statute does not authorize or encourage seriously discriminatory enforcement.where a statutory crime provides sufficiently clear standards for potential defendants,it also establish es minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement.gonzales carhart,quoting smith,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the mac provided several direct answers as to why the term serious bodily injury in the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as to butler case.first,the court held that persons of average intelligence could understand the term serious bodily injury as a matter of experience.in line with this,it held the use of the term serious bodily injury in the statute was not a technical concept.
second,it referred to judicial interpretations of the statute in three massachusetts sjc cases which apply the aggravated rape statute to comparable injuries,and so,independently give fair notice to butler in addition to the notice given by the common usage of the term.we quote the mac comparison of the facts in these cases to the facts of this case 
the linear abrasion on the victim neck to which the defendant held the knife,the d iffuse tenderness to the victim left rib cage,and the tear at her vaginal introitus are similar in proportion to the injuries held sufficient in commonwealth pontes,abrasions to victim head and lower abdominal pain,commonwealth sumner,bruises,scrapes on throat and back,and commonwealth coleman,swollen eye and face,facial bruises.
butler,wl,at alterations in original.reference to judicial interpretations of a statutory term,of course,are common.
it was reasonable for the mac to conclude the term resulting in serious bodily injury was not a technical term of art in the legal profession,which could not understand.likewise,it was reasonable to conclude that a person of average intelligence had the ability to understand the term resulting in serious bodily injury.a common dictionary definition of serious is not light or superficial.oxford english dictionary ed.the mac decision was reasonable in concluding that there was adequate notice for a jury to find that the injuries this victim suffered fell within those parameters.rose,at.
in addition,the term resulting in serious bodily injury follows after predicates,none of which are challenged by butler as vague.the assailant must have engaged in sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse,compelled the victim to submit by either force against the victim will or by threat of bodily injury,and the intercourse must either result in or be committed with acts which result in serious bodily injury.laws ch,a.the statute makes it clear that the injury must result from the activity described and that it must be serious.
a person of average intelligence would be on fair notice from the statutory language and common experience that it encompasses the injuries suffered by the victim in this case.the victim sought and received medical treatment for a linear abrasion to the neck,tenderness in the ribs where she had been punched several times,and vaginal tearing.butler,wl,at.
finally,the mac was reasonable in rejecting the void for vagueness argument by referring to a decision from the state highest court and two state appeals court decisions in which aggravated rape convictions were upheld.it is black letter law that a federal habeas court must look to the state judicial decisions as to the application and interpretation of particular state statutes.see,lanier,at kolender,at rose,at wainwright stone,per curiam.it was reasonable for the mac,for the reasons given in its opinion,to conclude that those state cases affirming convictions for aggravated rape against sufficiency of the evidence and other claims,provided constitutionally adequate notice and saved the statute from vagueness.
butler responds with three arguments,none of which comes close to establishing that the mac conclusion was unreasonable.first,butler contends the injuries in the cited cases were more serious than here.it was entirely reasonable for the mac to consider the facts in those cases comparable with the injuries suffered by the victim in this case for notice purposes.we agree with the district court that we can not say the injuries involved in those cases were so much more serious as to make it insufficiently clear that the aggravated rape statute applied.butler,wl,at.
second,he argues that the cases are irrelevant because none of them involved void for vagueness challenges,and that the mac decision was thus unreasonable.this argument misses the point.the issue is one of adequate notice,which is provided by these state court opinions which interpret whether the statute applies to the evidence presented in those cases.
the argument that the cases vary too much on the facts is also misplaced,both as a matter of substantive vagueness doctrine and as a matter of federal habeas law under aedpa lanier holds that even where there are notable factual differences between precedent and the case at bar,there is no violation so long as the prior decisions gave reasonable warning that the conduct then at issue violated the law.lanier,at.
third,butler argues that these state cases should be ignored and reference made,instead,to various state criminal and administrative statutes which contain specific definitions of the term serious bodily injury.the state courts have not interpreted the aggravated rape statute in light of those various definitions.on habeas review,we are required to look to the state court interpretation.wainwright,at.
we disagree with the dissent reasoning that the federal constitution requires a state,before it may impose an enhanced sentence for aggravated rape,to adopt similar definitions of serious bodily injury across the state code,regardless of the purpose of the statute,the nature of the offense,or whether a sentence enhancement is involved so as to avoid vagueness concerns.massachusetts has chosen otherwise for its aggravated rape statute.it is also not uncommon for congress to use the term serious bodily injury in federal criminal penalty enhancement provisions in the united states code,but to leave that term undefined.see,a b.
beyond that,the dissent ignores the strict standard on habeas review,which precludes a federal court from granting relief unless the defendant seeking habeas show s that the state court ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.dixon.at quoting harrington.at.
finally,we add that the habeas claim also necessarily fails in light of numerous supreme court cases rejecting due process void for vagueness arguments against federal statutes.for example,the supreme court has held that the residual clause of the armed criminal career act definition of violent felony,which reads,otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,e b ii emphasis added,is not unconstitutionally vague or so indefinite as to prevent an ordinary person from understanding what conduct it prohibits,james united states.we note that james involved a statute which enhanced sentences.the phrases in a manner that reflects the belief,and is intended to cause another to believe in a child pornography statute,a b,are not void for vagueness,williams,at.similarly,the terms training and expert advice in a criminal ban on material support to a criminal terrorist organization are not vague in part because they are common terms which readily and naturally applied to plaintiff conduct.humanitarian law project.at.
for these reasons and because it is not clear that the state c ourt erred at all,much less erred so transparently that no fairminded jurist could agree with that court decision,dixon.at,we affirm the district court denial of butler habeas petition.
so ordered.
no characterization of a rape should trivialize the emotional and physical injuries to which the victim of such conduct is subjected.much to my regret,however,i am forced to dissent because the statute in question violates basic imperatives of our constitutional system that criminal laws define the conduct which they proscribe with sufficient specificity to give notice of the prohibited conduct to those who may be subjected to their application,and that they also delineate boundaries to prevent the arbitrary enforcement of the statute in question.see kolender lawson.the massachusetts aggravated rape statute fails on both grounds.
the massachusetts rape statute provides for a maximum sentence of twenty years.see.laws ch,b.in contrast,the massachusetts aggravated rape statute incorporates several conditions,any of which,if met,exposes the offender to imprisonment for life or for any term of years.laws ch,a.the petitioner in this habeas case was convicted of the latter offense and sentenced to life in prison.
because the statute containing the aggravating factor charged in this case,that the rape offense results in or is committed with acts resulting in serious bodily injury,id.emphasis added does not define the crucial term serious bodily injury,thus failing to provide notice of the proscribed conduct and a clear standard for the enforcement of this crime,i must conclude that the statute is impermissibly vague.
as an initial matter,i do not subscribe to the majority reasoning that the massachusetts appeals court mac was reasonable when it held that the term serious bodily injury,as found in the massachusetts aggravated rape statute,is a concept that the average person can understand as a matter of experience and apply in a criminal case in a uniform manner.the very fact that the massachusetts legislature considered it appropriate to consistently define this same term elsewhere including six times in the same chapter,cuts against this argument.however,it is principally the failure of this statute to satisfy the second condition of the applicable analysis,that the statute is so standardless that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement,united states williams,that requires me to dissent.
it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.food drug admin.brown williamson tobacco,quoting davis.dep t of treasury.examining massachusetts aggravated rape law as it has been applied to butler with this canon in mind,it is plain to me that the statute does,in fact,authorize and encourage seriously discriminatory and standardless enforcement.
as i have stated,to be sure,any rape irrespective of the magnitude of the physical,psychological,or emotional injuries it may cause is an outrageous and deplorable violation of self,warranting punishment.but the gulf that separates the severity of the injuries the victim suffered in the instant case from those that amount to serious bodily injury under other massachusetts statutes is so wide as to emphasize t
