this appeal presents a question of first impression in this circuit.it turns on the correct interpretation of the tolling provision,d,established by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.
the problem is easily explained.the court below held that a motion to reduce an imposed sentence,in the nature of a plea for discretionary leniency,did not fall within the scope of the tolling provision.accordingly,the court dismissed the federal habeas petition as.
although the question presented is one of novel impression in this circuit,four other courts of appeals have answered essentially the same question,with mixed results.three have held that a state motion in the nature of a plea for discretionary leniency does not give rise to tolling the fourth has held the opposite.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the filing of a state motion to reduce an imposed sentence,in the nature of a plea for discretionary leniency,tolls the aedpa limitations period.consequently,we reverse the order of dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
we rehearse the factual and procedural antecedents of this appeal insofar as necessary to place the crucial issue into perspective.
in december of,a rhode island jury convicted khalil kholi on ten counts of sexual assault.see laws.the charges arose out of the alleged molestation of his two.a judge of the state superior court sentenced the petitioner to two terms of life imprisonment,consecutive to one another.the state supreme court affirmed the conviction on february.state kholi.
the petitioner did not move for rehearing,nor did he seek a writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court.instead,he returned to the trial court and,on may,filed a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to rhode island superior court rule of criminal procedure a the trial judge denied that motion on august,and the state supreme court affirmed.state kholi.that ruling was handed down on january.
while the appeal from the denial of the rule a motion was pending,the petitioner,citing ineffective assistance of counsel,applied for relief pcr in the trial court.see laws et.the application was docketed on may,and denied almost six years later on april.the state supreme court affirmed that ruling on december.kholi wall.
on october,before the state supreme court resolved the appeal from the denial of the original pcr petitioner filed a second pcr application.this entreaty,which remains pending,alleged that the state had improperly calculated the date when he would become eligible for parole.
on september,the petitioner,appearing pro se,repaired to the federal district court in search of habeas relief.he named as respondent wall,the director of the rhode island department of corrections.the respondent moved to dismiss the federal habeas petition on timeliness grounds.
the district judge referred the motion to a magistrate judge.see b b.b.in a report and recommendation dated december,the magistrate judge embraced the majority view and concluded that a sentence reduction motion,in the nature of a plea for discretionary leniency,did not toll the aedpa limitations period.absent such tolling,he regarded the habeas petition as untimely and thus recommended that it be dismissed.
on de novo review,the district judge adopted the report and recommendation and entered judgment accordingly.kholi wall,wl,at.the district judge appended the magistrate judge report and recommendation to his summary order the district judge subsequently rejected the petitioner request for a certificate of appealability coa.

ii.analysis 
where,as here,the district court has dismissed a habeas petition on a procedural ground without taking evidence,we afford de novo review.wood spencer,cir.
in this case,the petitioner conviction became final on may,when his time for requesting a writ of certiorari elapsed see jiménez quarterman,d see also.indicating that a party has ninety days from entry of judgment to request a writ of certiorari.thus,the period for seeking federal habeas relief began to run on that date.d a.
there is no dispute that this period was interrupted from may,through december,due to the pendency of the first pcr application.see id.d.unless some other tolling mechanism is in play,however,the period expired on december,than eight months before the petitioner first sought federal habeas relief.
in this venue,the petitioner argues that both his second pcr application and his rule a motion constituted tolling mechanisms.if this argument is even partially correct that is,if either of these filings served to toll the limitations period,the federal habeas petition would be timely accordingly,we inquire as to the effect of each filing.
a.the pcr application.
although the petitioner failed to mention the pcr application in the district court,we may in our discretion afford him some latitude because he was then incarcerated and proceeding pro se.see,raineri united states,cir prou united states,cir.because the outcome is clear,we elect to address the merits of this argument.
our analysis begins and ends with the language of the aedpa tolling provision.by its terms,that provision applies to state filings directed to the pertinent judgment or claim.d.in a typical habeas case,then,the tolling provision applies only to those state filings that seek reexamination of the relevant conviction or sentence.see rodríguez spencer,cir holding that motion addressed to state appellate court supervisory powers did not toll the period for seeking federal habeas relief because,under state law,that motion could not affect the judgment of conviction voravongsa wall,cir holding,for the same reason,that motion for appointment of counsel does not toll the period for filing a federal habeas petition hodge greiner,cir holding,for the same reason,that proceeding has no tolling effect.
the pcr application does not seek to alter or even to reexamine the judgment entered in the underlying criminal case.that application challenges only the proposed date of the petitioner parole eligibility.consequently,it does not bear a sufficient relationship to the pertinent judgment so as to trigger the tolling provision.the upshot,then,is that the pcr application is devoid of any effect on the limitations period within which the petitioner had to seek federal habeas relief.see rodríguez,at.
b.the rule a motion.
the petitioner second tolling argument requires more discussion.the district court determined that his motion under rhode island superior court rule of criminal procedure a did not toll the aedpa limitations period because that motion did not challenge the validity of the pertinent conviction or sentence but,rather,amounted to nothing more than a naked plea for leniency,wl,at.the district court view has impressive support in the case law.see alexander sec y,dep t of,cir hartmann carroll,cir walkowiak haines,cir.but the case law is not uniform one court of appeals has arrived at the opposite conclusion.see robinson golder,cir.it is against this chiaroscuro circuit we approach the question presented by this appeal.
we start by noting our agreement with the district court characterization of the petitioner rule a motion as a plea for leniency,simpliciter.see state mendoza,see also supra note.this court has not yet addressed whether a sentence reduction motion,in the nature of a plea for discretionary leniency,may serve as a tolling mechanism in connection with the aedpa limitations period as said,three courts of appeals have answered this same general question in the negative we use the descriptor general because,in each situation,the state rule or statute that served as the vehicle for the plea for leniency reflected minor variations peculiar to practice in that state.a fourth court,however,has answered the same general question in the affirmative.we must,therefore,weigh these conflicting authorities and decide whether the petitioner rule a motion tolled the period within which he could seek federal habeas relief.
answering this question,like answering any question that hinges on statutory construction,begins with the text of the particular statute.in re hill,cir.here,the statute provides for tolling during the pendency of motions that seek state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.d.we must give these words their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended them to bear some different import.williams taylor,d internal quotation marks omitted.
plain meaning strongly favors the petitioner position.for purposes of this case,the pertinent judgment is the petitioner sentence.see,howard ulibarri,cir giving tolling effect to motion that related only to sentencing as opposed to validity of conviction tillema long,cir same.the rule a motion is obviously a motion that seeks state review of that sentence.after all,a sentence can not be reduced without first being reexamined,reviewed.on its face,then,the language of section d appears roomy enough to accommodate sentence reduction motions.
to be sure,a sentence reduction motion in the nature of a plea for discretionary leniency does not challenge the legality of the sentence.but there is nothing in the language of section d that limits that even hints at limiting motions that challenge the legal basis of the pertinent judgment.in this regard,we deem it significant that,in drafting section d,congress employed the expansive term review instead of a more confining term such as challenge.the latter terminology would have been a natural fit had congress wished to focus the tolling provision more narrowly.
in contrast,review commonly denotes a looking over or examination with a view to amendment or improvement.webster third new international dictionary see also black law dictionary ed defining review as the c onsideration,inspection,or reexamination of a subject or thing.taking into account this quotidian understanding,it seems that a motion for a sentence reduction in the nature of a plea for discretionary leniency is a motion that seeks review of a sentence and,thus,is a motion that falls squarely within the plain meaning of section d.
we are mindful that three of our sister circuits have concluded that pleas for leniency do not trigger the aedpa tolling provision.these courts have relied on two different lines of reasoning to reach that result.
the first line of reasoning embodies a textual approach.this approach,employed by the fourth circuit,holds that the statutory phrase state or other collateral review contemplates only collateral,review.walkowiak,at emphasis in original.based on that understanding,the court concludes that a motion for leniency filed under west virginia rule of criminal procedure b does not qualify as a tolling mechanism because such a motion is not collateral that is,the motion is filed in the original criminal case before the trial judge and does not challenge the validity of the conviction or sentence.id.at.
we do not believe that the walkowiak line of reasoning can withstand close scrutiny.on its face,the court reading of the statute seems linguistically incorrect.conflating the two halves of the phrase state or other collateral review to mean exclusively collateral,review reads the word or completely out of the statute.hence,that conflated construction transgresses the rule against rule that instructs a court,in undertaking the interpretation of a statute,to give meaning whenever possible to every word and phrase in a statute text.see hibbs winn,d duncan walker,d reiter sonotone,d.
this conflation is particularly misleading because the most natural reading of the phrase or other collateral review expands the scope of the tolling provision to cover the entire gamut of state judicial procedures that are available for testing the pertinent conviction or sentence.that remains true regardless of whether such procedures carry a specific label.see duncan,at.
the plain meaning of the statute is not altered by the fact that a motion is not collateral,that is,that the motion is filed in the original criminal case.for example,we have held that a motion for a new trial filed in the original case and heard by the trial judge is an appropriate mechanism for tolling under section d.see neverson bissonnette,cir gaskins duval,cir per curiam.
so,too,the fact that a motion is of a type usually heard by the trial judge does not disqualify it as a vehicle for tolling.thus,a pcr application under rhode island general laws rhode island standard vehicle for relief may act as a tolling mechanism even though that application,by rule,is assigned to the original trial judge.see pezzucco state,per curiam citing.standing order ii d.indeed,the petitioner first pcr application was filed under this statute,and the respondent concedes that this application should be accorded tolling effect.see appellee br.at.we therefore reject the fourth circuit textual analysis 
the other two courts that have refused to give tolling effect to a plea for leniency have reached that result by interpreting section d in light of the aedpa discerned purposes.those courts have noted correctly,we think that the aedpa serves dual purposes encouraging the exhaustion of state remedies and safeguarding the finality of judgments.because neither of these interests is advanced by tolling the aedpa limitations period during the pendency of a plea for leniency,they have refused to give tolling effect to such motions.see alexander,at hartmann,at.we find this reasoning unconvincing.
in determining the meaning of a statutory provision,it is appropriate to consider the structure and purpose of the larger statute.see,mckenna first horizon home loan,cir.the supreme court has indicated that congress enacted the aedpa to further the principles of comity,finality,and federalism.williams,at.seen in this light,it is readily apparent that the aedpa limitations period is aimed at protecting the states interest in the finality of state judgments.see duncan,at see also d.
withal,that interest is not absolute.if it were,the aedpa would not contain any tolling provision.in the last analysis,the interest in safeguarding finality is tempered by principles of comity and federalism embedded not only in the tolling provision itself,but also in the aedpa exhaustion requirement,b.
the exhaustion requirement gives state courts the initial opportunity to correct errors otherwise cognizable in federal habeas proceedings.duncan,at boerckel,d.this requirement works hand in hand with the tolling provision,which encourages state prisoners to avail themselves of state remedies before resorting to a federal forum.see,at indicating that the aedpa will preserv e the availability of federal habeas review when a prisoner diligently pursues state remedies.the tolling provision accomplishes this objective by freezing the limitations period for bringing a federal habeas petition.duncan,at.
if recognizing tolling for a sentence reduction motion in the nature of a plea for discretionary leniency somehow flouted the exhaustion requirement,there might be reason to think that treating such a motion as a tolling device would contradict congressional intent.but that is not the case recognizing tolling for a plea for discretionary leniency does not insult the exhaustion requirement.by definition,a sentence reduction motion in the nature of a plea for discretionary leniency does not present a claim premised on an error of federal law.thus,the filing of such a motion implicates no claim that is susceptible of exhaustion.
to be sure,the supreme court has emphasized the nexus between tolling and exhaustion.see,id.at.the court,however,has said nothing to suggest that tolling is available only for state filings mandated by the exhaustion requirement.to the contrary,the court has stated that the aedpa tolling provision encourages the pursuit of all available state remedies.id.at emphasis supplied.this broad statement would seem to encompass pleas for leniency.
in all events,it can not be a valid objection to tolling that a state motion presents only claims and,thu
