following a bench trial,an illinois judge convicted clifton mcfowler of murder and ordered him to serve a prison term of forty years.the illinois appellate court affirmed mcfowler conviction,judging the testimony of charlene meredith,who placed mcfowler at the scene of crime with a shotgun in his hand,sufficient to convict him beyond a reasonable doubt notwithstanding conflicts in the evidence as to whom meredith had picked out of a lineup shortly after the murder.the district court joan gottschall granted mcfowler petition for a writ of habeas corpus,concluding that the illinois appellate court had unreasonably applied jackson virginia,d,when it sustained mcfowler conviction based on meredith identification testimony.united states ex rel.mcfowler pierson,wl.in view of the irreconcilable inconsistencies in meredith own testimony,we share the district court doubts about the reliability of her identification.the vagaries of eyewitness identification are well known the annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification.united states wade,d.however,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of commands great deference to the decisions of state courts.see d,bell cone,d.because we can not say that the illinois appellate court was objectively unreasonable in holding that meredith testimony provided sufficient support for mcfowler conviction,we are compelled to reverse the grant of mcfowler petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
sammy logan was shot on october,when he answered a knock at the front door of his home.he lapsed into a coma and died three days later.an autopsy would reveal that he had been shot in the forehead and that the bullet had penetrated his brain.
although the illinois appellate court was not explicit on this point,it is undisputed that mcfowler murder conviction is premised not on the notion that mcfowler shot logan himself,but rather on the theory that mcfowler is legally accountable for the acts of the person who did.the trial judge neglected to make this clear when he convicted mcfowler,but his remarks at sentencing eliminate any doubt on this score.indeed,the state defends mcfowler conviction solely on an accountability theory.illinois law provides that a person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when e ither before or during the commission of an offense,and with the intent to promote or facilitate such commission,he solicits,aids,abets,agrees or attempts to aid,such other person in the planning or commission of the offense.comp.stat.ann.c west.as we shall see,there is ample circumstantial evidence from which one reasonably might conclude both that mcfowler was present at the scene of the murder and that he fled from the scene in the immediate aftermath.however,mere presence at the scene of a with knowledge that a crime is being flight from the scene do not suffice to establish accountability for the acts of a principal under illinois law,people williams,cert.denied,d.the state must also prove that the defendant intended to facilitate or promote the principal criminal activity,people stanciel.the critical evidence pointing to mcfowler complicity in the murder came from meredith.
in october of,meredith resided in a apartment at west lexington street in chicago along with logan her boyfriend,glenda roberts meredith sister,percell swinney roberts boyfriend,and seven children.at approximately on october,there was a knock at the front door of the apartment.at that time,logan,meredith,and meredith children were congregated in a bedroom opposite the kitchen.against meredith advice,logan left the bedroom to answer the knock,closing the bedroom door behind him.through the closed door,meredith subsequently heard a shot.meredith son davion opened the bedroom door,and at a distance of approximately sixteen feet,meredith would later testify,she saw a somewhat short man with a shotgun in his hand standing in the kitchen.he was wearing blue jeans and a white.next to him,lying on the floor of the kitchen,was logan.at first,the intruder face was turned away from meredith toward swinney,who was standing in a doorway between the kitchen and the living room.but meredith got a clear look at the intruder face when he subsequently tripped over logan body.meredith also heard a voice from somewhere else in the apartment say if you are going to shoot him,shoot him.tr.meredith grabbed davion by the shirt and pulled him into the bedroom closet along with her other children.they remained in the closet for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes,until meredith sister came to find her.meredith later saw that swinney had been shot in the arm.
police were summoned from a nearby police station by a neighbor who ran into the police station yelling that two men had just been shot.they arrived at the scene within minutes of the shooting.officer delpilar found swinney sitting on the front steps of the building with a gunshot wound to his right arm.when he entered the apartment,delpilar saw logan lying on the floor in a pool of blood,unconscious but still breathing.delpilar spoke with swinney and the other witnesses and subsequently broadcast a description of three suspects an male in his late teens or early twenties,approximately six feet tall,pounds,with brown eyes and black hair,wearing a red and white jogging suit and gym shoes a second male in his twenties,wearing an orange shirt and red jogging pants and a female african american aged eighteen to twenty,wearing white pants and tall black riding boots.
on further inspection of the scene,delpilar found a set of automobile keys near the top of the stairs leading to the apartment where meredith and logan lived.those keys,he discovered,fit the driver side door and ignition of a gray ford escort parked in front of and across the street from the property.officer edward kulbida learned from bystanders that the suspects had attempted to use that car as their getaway vehicle.the keys found in the stairwell explain why the suspects had left the escort behind and fled on foot.because delpilar failed to handle the keys in such a way as to preserve any fingerprints on them,they were not tested for prints.however,prints lifted from the exterior of both the driver and passenger sides of the escort matched mcfowler and byndum,respectively.it could not be said how long those prints had been on the car.
touring around the area to the north of the crime scene,kulbida and other officers soon spotted a the description of the female suspect.flowers was making a call from a pay phone at west flournoy,just two blocks away from the scene of the shooting.flowers volunteered to the officers that the men they were looking for could be found in the apartment at that same address.kulbida,along with detective wayne gulliford and officer robert gomez,entered the flournoy apartment approximately thirty minutes after the shooting was reported.inside,they found mcfowler and trenton byndum,among other individuals.mcfowler was lying in bed,wearing only blue jeans.byndum was in the living room,wearing striped blue jeans,a sleeveless blue top,white socks,and no shoes.gulliford spotted blood on byndum right sock.on the floor next to byndum were a beige trench coat,a pair of nike air flight athletic shoes,and a payless shopping bag containing other items of clothing.among the clothes found in the bag were a pair of red and white jogging pants,a shirt,and a jogging jacket,all stained with what appeared to be blood.byndum and mcfowler were placed under arrest.
during a subsequent search of the apartment,detective gregory baiocchi discovered a black and white converse athletic shoe for a right foot in the apartment oven.the shoe had what appeared to be blood spots on it.baiocchi recovered what appeared to be that shoe mate in the escort parked in front of the crime scene.both shoes were submitted to a laboratory for testing,which confirmed that human blood was present on both shoes.the blood found on the left shoe was type b the right shoe contained an insufficient quantity of blood for typing.at trial,mcfowler was asked to try the shoes on,and the shoes fit him.they also fit his lawyer.logan blood type apparently was type type b blood was recovered from the crime scene.
also discovered at the flournoy apartment secreted behind bricks in the rear stairwell of the basement were a ruger security six revolver with two live caliber rounds and four spent casings of the same caliber,as well as a westernfield gauge shotgun with two live rounds.the record before us does not include any ballistics evidence tying either of these weapons to the shooting.it is undisputed,however,that logan was shot with a revolver rather than a shotgun.
the hands of both mcfowler and byndum were tested for gunshot residue.the results for byndum were positive and thus consistent with byndum having recently handled or been in close proximity with a discharged firearm.the results for mcfowler reflected high levels of each of the heavy metals associated with firearm,barium,and because the control swab used in the test reflected an elevated level of barium suggesting contamination,the trace evidence analyst could not confirm that mcfowler,like byndum,had been in close proximity to a recently discharged firearm.
a bloody footprint was found on the landing at the scene of the shooting.the parties stipulated that an expert in shoe print comparison,if called to testify,would opine that a photograph of the footprint was of the same type,size,and style as the pair of nike air flight athletic shoes observed next to byndum in the flournoy apartment,but the expert could not say with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that those shoes had,in fact,made the footprint.although the shoes bore what appeared to be blood stains,they apparently were never tested to confirm the presence of blood or the blood type.
on the day of his arrest,mcfowler made a number of statements to detective baiocchi,which the detective later recounted at trial.baiocchi testified that mcfowler told him he had gone to the flournoy apartment the previous evening with a friend and that he had remained there until the police arrived and arrested him the following day.he also indicated that byndum was his cousin.he had telephoned byndum earlier that day to let him know where he was,and byndum had subsequently joined him at the flournoy apartment.baiocchi testified that he did not see a telephone in the flournoy apartment.
at approximately on the day of the shooting,meredith viewed a lineup at the police station.that lineup included both mcfowler and byndum.at trial,on direct examination,meredith testified that she told police at the lineup t hat the second person from the end looked like the one who was in my house.tr.the prosecutor then showed meredith a photograph of the lineup and asked her to circle the individual that she had identified as the man she saw in her apartment with the shotgun.meredith circled mcfowler,although as it turned out,he was not the second person from either end of the lineup as displayed in the photograph.she also proceeded to identify mcfowler in court as the man she had seen.tr.additionally,when shown the shotgun that had been found at the flournoy address,meredith indicated t hat the shotgun that i saw in mcfowler hand.tr.on,she confirmed that it looks just like the gun that i saw.tr.
detective foley conducted the lineup that meredith viewed.the parties stipulated that if called to the witness stand,detective foley would testify that meredith had identified byndum,not mcfowler,as the man she had seen with the shotgun.foley also would have testified that when he spoke with meredith after the shooting,she indicated to him that she previously had seen the man with the shotgun in her neighborhood.
on,defense counsel asked meredith whether,at the lineup,she had actually identified a man wearing striped pants and a sleeveless blue byndum.in response,meredith indicated that she had picked out both.tr.meredith acknowledged,however,that in the photograph of the lineup,neither mcfowler nor byndum was the second person from either end of the lineup.meredith recalled having spoken with detective foley after the shooting,but she did not recall telling him that she had seen the man with the shotgun before around the neighborhood.indeed,she testified that she had never seen mcfowler before the date of the incident 
on redirect,the state brought byndum into the courtroom.byndum had pleaded guilty to the murder of logan prior to trial and was ultimately sentenced to a prison term.the state had called byndum as its first witness against mcfowler however,byndum had invoked his fifth amendment right not to incriminate himself and had refused to answer any of the questions put to him about the shooting.the trial court had found him guilty of criminal contempt of court and ordered him to serve a prison term consecutive to the term for murder.with both byndum and mcfowler in the courtroom,the state asked meredith which of the two men she had seen with a shotgun on the day of the shooting.meredith indicated that she had seen mcfowler.tr.she also acknowledged,contrary to her earlier testimony,that the person she had seen in her apartment was not the second person from either end of the lineup as depicted in the photograph she was shown.tr.
on examination,mcfowler attorney asked meredith how long a glimpse she had gotten of the person in her apartment.meredith answered,maybe just a few minutes.tr.
after hearing the evidence,the trial court thomas hett convicted mcfowler of first degree murder.in the course of his ruling,judge hett made the following remarks about meredith identification testimony 
now,if i am not mistaken miss meredith testified that,here in court she testified mcfowler was the one that she saw in the apartment with the gun the shotgun.she also testified that in she had a photo array,and she said that this defendant picture was the,like the picture of the person who was in the apartment and that she also identified the defendant in a lineup.
that portion of her testimony,the latter part is impeached by foley who se stipulated testimony said that she only identifies trenton byndum.
tr.but the judge went on to credit her identification of mcfowler tr,and based on that identification along with the other circumstantial evidence placing mcfowler at the scene of the shooting,concluded that he was guilty 
the defendant is identified by miss meredith.he has his prints on the car outside of the house.there are shoes that fit him partly in the car and partly hidden.he is found with a person whose clothing and shoes apparently are covered with blood.
both he and the person who he is with are identified as having been in that apartment when the shooting took place.
sure looks to me like proof beyond a reasonable doubt,if not of the actual murder then being the accomplice.
miss meredith testified that there were two sets of shootings in the apartment and we do note that the victim was killed and percell swinney was shot so i believe that the state has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt the crime of murder and the defendant is found guilty thereof.
tr.mcfowler subsequently filed a motion for a new trial,which the court denied.at sentencing,the state asked the judge to impose the death penalty,but the judge demurred,concluding that mcfowler was ineligible in the absence of evidence that he had fired the gun used to kill logan.tr.judge hett took the opportunity to reiterate,however,that the evidence was sufficient to hold mcfowler criminally culpable for the murder under an accountability theory 
there is a wealth of circumstantial evidence.there an identification process.so,i convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that mcfowler was present with byn d um in that house,and that as a result of that presence,that man was killed.and there was an obvious intention to kill.it was something that was a happenstance.
i have determined also from that evidence that it is apparent,unless they switched guns,and it was apparent that that the case,that mcfowler did not pull the trigger.nevertheless,he is accountable for what byn d um did.
tr.the judge went on to sentence mcfowler to a prison term of forty years.
the illinois appellate court affirmed mcfowler conviction,concluding in relevant part that a rational trier of fact could find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.people mcfowler,order at,d,unpublished.the court found meredith identification of mcfowler was sufficiently reliable to place mcfowler at the scene of the murder with a shotgun in his hand.meredith testified that she had identified mcfowler in a lineup just six hours after the shooting,and her testimony established that at the time of the shooting,she had seen him at a distance of sixteen feet,although the court greet ed with some skepticism her further testimony that she was able to maintain her view of him for perhaps as long as a few minutes.order at.
the court acknowledged that meredith testimony reflected some confusion as to where mcfowler had been positioned in the lineup and that it conflicted with the stipulation that detective foley would have testified that she had identified byndum and not mcfowler.id.however,any such confusion or apparently conflicting evidence would not necessarily mandate that the circuit court totally disregard her lineup identification.id.meredith,the court noted,ultimately testified that she had identified both byndum and mcfowler in the lineup.moreover,the circuit court itself had acknowledged that detective foley recollection about the lineup tended to impeach meredith testimony on that point.
it was not clear to the appellate court whether the trial court,in view of the conflict,had given meredith testimony about the lineup diminished weight or had disregarded it altogether but the latter possibility would not leave mcfowler conviction without adequate evidentiary support 
even if meredith lineup identification were given no weight whatsoever,there still would have been credible eyewitness testimony in this case.meredith made an unwavering identification of the defendant.the strength of this identification was only reinforced when meredith,during redirect examination,viewed both the defendant and trenton bynd u m together in court and reaffirmed that the defendant was in fact the person she saw trip over the victim on october.
id.at.the court also noted that there was no evidence meredith had ever indicated any uncertainty in identifying mcfowler and that her description of the intruder as a short,male was not challenged and was consistent with mcfowler appearance.id.at.the presentence report for mcfowler indicated that he was african american and five feet,six inches in height.id.
the court also emphasized that in addition to meredith identification testimony,the record reflected substantial corroborative testimonial and physical evidence that linked mcfowler to the crime.id.at.meredith had identified the shotgun that had been recovered along with the revolver from the flournoy building as the one she had seen in mcfowler hand on the day of the shooting.the keys to a ford escort parked directly across the street from the scene of the crime had been found in the lexington building witnesses had told the police that the assailants had attempted to flee the scene in that vehicle and mcfowler prints along with byndum were found on the exterior of that car.the converse shoe found in that car appeared to be the mate of the one found in the oven of the flournoy apartment.both of those shoes were stained with blood,and testing revealed that the blood on the left shoe was type b,which apparently was the same blood type as the victim.the shoes also fit mcfowler.the pair of nike shoes discovered in the flournoy apartment also bore what appeared to be blood stains,and the pattern of those shoes was consistent with a bloody footprint found at the crime scene.
thus the single converse shoe found inside the oven,which apparently matched the converse shoe found in the ford escort,and the nike shoes found inside the apartment,corroborated the inference that bynd u m and the defendant,who were both barefoot at the time of their arrest just thirty minutes after the shooting,were the individuals who wore those shoes at the crime scene.
id.at.the cumulative impact of this evidence was,in the court view,sufficient to support mcfowler conviction notwithstanding the weaknesses in meredith identification testimony.id.the illinois supreme court denied mcfowler petition for leave to appeal.people mcfowler.april,unpublished.
mcfowler subsequently filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.upon review of the parties briefs and the record,the district court granted the petition.mcfowler,wl.the court proceeded from the premise that mcfowler could be liable for logan murder under an accountability theory if,in fact,he was the man with a shotgun that meredith had seen next to and tripping over logan body.id.at.the court separately considered whether mcfowler could have been convicted as a principal,but concluded the facts would at most support mcfowler conviction under an accountability theory.id.at.but in the court view,the evidence was insufficient to establish that mcfowler was the intruder that meredith had seen.
first,n o rational trier of fact could ascribe any weight to meredith testimony concerning her identification of mcfowler from the lineup on the day of the crime.id.at.the illinois appellate court seemed to think that the trier of fact could have given the lineup at least some weight,because when confronted with foley stipulated testimony that she had identified byndum at the lineup,meredith said that she had identified both byndum and mcfowler.but meredith testified that she had only seen one assailant,and byndum and mcfowler did not look alike.so it was nonsensical to suppose that meredith could have identified both of them at the lineup.id.
on the other hand,the lineup could not simply be disregarded in assessing the balance of meredith identification testimony,as the illinois appellate court had supposed.id.rather,the evidence underlying mcfowler conviction must be viewed as a whole.although meredith had identified mcfowler in the courtroom,the fact that she had evidently identified someone else byndum either in addition to or instead of him in the context of a lineup conducted hours after the crime was committed cast doubt on the value of meredith identification.id.the court noted that the circumstances relevant to the reliability of the identifications in this case suggested strongly that the lineup was the more reliable of the two identifications that meredith had made the courtroom identification was made under suggestive circumstances mcfowler had been seated at table with his counsel even when byndum was summoned into the courtroom during meredith redirect examination,she was called upon to make an identification from just two people as opposed to the six she had viewed in the lineup and a good deal of time had passed before meredith made her identification in.id.at.given meredith identification of byndum,the suggestiveness of the identification procedure,and the very long time delay between the two,it was objectively unreasonable for the illinois appellate court to find credible meredith albeit unwavering,identification of mcfowler.id.at.
one could infer from the other record evidence that mcfowler was present at the scene of the murder,the court acknowledged id.at,but that evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.in order to prove mcfowler guilt under an accountability theory,the state had to establish that mcfowler,either before or during the commission of the crime,and with the intent to promote or facilitate that crime,in some way solicited,aided,abetted,agreed or attempted to aid someone else in the planning or commission of the crime.id.at,quoting.comp.stat.ann.c.in this case,there was no evidence that the perpetrators had planned the crime,let alone that mcfowler was aware of that plan.id.beyond mcfowler presence at the scene of the crime and his flight therefrom,the most that the evidence established was his presence in the same apartment as byndum a half hour after the murder and his failure to report the crime.id.at.in the district court view,this was not enough to show that mcfowler took some act to promote or facilitate the commission of the crime or that he intended to do so.id.
the district court therefore granted mcfowler request for a writ of habeas corpus and ordered his release within twenty days.id.at.on the state request,the district court stayed its order pending resolution of the state appeal.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of modified a federal habeas court role in reviewing state prisoner applications in order to prevent federal habeas retrials and to ensure that convictions are given effect to the extent possible under law.bell cone,supra,at.at,citing williams taylor,d.under the aedpa,in order to obtain habeas relief,a petitioner must establish that the proceedings in state court resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.the relevant decision,for purposes of this assessment,is the decision of the last state court to rule on the merits of the petitioner,the order of the illinois appellate court,schultz page,cir,cert.denied,d.
there is no contention that the appellate court decision is contrary to clearly established law.the court acknowledged that due process requires the state to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant committed each element of the charged offense.order at,citing in re winship,d.the court also recognized that,under jackson virginia,supra,at.at,a court examining the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a defendant conviction must construe that evidence in the light most favorable to the state and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.order at.moreover,we note that in evaluating the reliability and sufficiency of meredith identification testimony as the key evidence supporting mcfowler conviction,the court looked to the same factors that the supreme court identified as pertinent in neil biggers,d.see.order at.
the question posed by mcfowler petition is whether the illinois appellate court decision amounts to an unreasonable application of the jackson sufficiency standard.a decision that correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case certainly would qualify as a decision involv ing an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.williams,at.at.unreasonable means something more than mistaken,however.woodford visciotti,d per curiam williams,at.at hardaway young,cir,cert.denied,d.a state court decision is unreasonable for purposes of section d if its application of supreme court precedent l ies well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.id.at,citing williams,at.at see also visciotti.at t he federal habeas scheme authorizes intervention only when a decision is objectively unreasonable.within this framework,the precise legal question that we must answer is the one that the district court itself posed was it objectively unreasonable for the illinois appellate court to conclude that any rational trier of fact,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state,could have found the essential elements of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt.wl,at.
it is undisputed that mcfowler was convicted of logan murder not as a principal but on an accountability theory.as we have noted,neither the trial judge in finding mcfowler guilty nor the illinois appellate court in affirming his conviction stated this expressly.neither court,for that matter,identified the elements that would have to be established in order to find mcfowler guilty under either theory.however,when he sentenced mcfowler,judge hett remarked that mcfowler did not pull the trigger.nevertheless,he is accountable for what byn d um did.tr.judge gottschall considered whether the evidence would have supported mcfowler conviction as a principal and concluded that it would not logan was killed with a revolver meredith testified that she saw mcfowler holding a shotgun,not a revolver there was no evidence that the shotgun had been fired the inconclusive results of the gunshot residue test on mcfowler were consistent with the possibility that he had handled the revolver,but shed no light on whether he had fired the gun or merely handled it after the shooting and there were at least two and possibly three intruders present in the apartment at the time of the murder,rendering it impossible to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that mcfowler was the one who fired the shot that killed logan.wl,at.for its part,the state does not suggest that mcfowler could have been convicted as a principal.on the contrary,it asserts that mcfowler was convicted on an accountability theory,state opening brief at and it defends his conviction on that basis alone.
as we have noted,the illinois accountability statute provides that an individual is criminally liable for an offense committed by another person when e ither before or during the commission of an offense,and with the intent to promote or facilitate such commission,he solicits,aids,abets,agrees or attempts to aid,such other person in the planning or commission of the offense.comp.stat.ann.c.the pertinent statutory terms here are aids and abets,as there is no evidence that mcfowler solicited logan murder,that he agreed to aid anyone in the planning or commission of the crime,or that he participated in the planning of the offense.as judge gottschall recognized,the defendant mere presence at the scene of the crime is insufficient to establish that a defendant aided or abetted the commission of the offense,even when coupled with his knowledge of the crime and his flight from the crime scene.people williams,supra,at people shaw,see also united states johnson,cir applying illinois law.the evidence must additionally establish the defendant intent to facilitate or otherwise promote the commission of the offense,either by showing that the defendant shared the principal criminal intent or that there was a common criminal design.people perez,people stanciel,supra,at.of course,i ntent may be inferred from the character of the defendant acts as well as the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offense.perez,at,citing stanciel,at.
meredith testimony unquestionably was essential to the finding that mcfowler aided or abetted logan murder.although abundant circumstantial evidence placed mcfowler at the scene of the crime,it was meredith testimony and hers alone that placed him next to logan body with a shotgun in his hand.the shotgun was not the murder weapon,of course but we shall assume as judge gottschall did that mcfowler presence at the scene of the crime with a firearm,next to logan body,just after logan was shot,would suffice to establish his complicity in the murder.
the dispositive issue,then,is the reliability of meredith testimony.after describing the man she had seen trip over logan body with a shotgun in his hand,meredith indicated that it was mcfowler whom she had picked out of the lineup on the day of the shooting.twice during her on direct and then again on redirect,when byndum was brought into the courtroom to stand beside identified mcfowler as the person she had seen.however,detective foley stipulated testimony was that meredith had identified byndum in the lineup,not mcfowler.when confronted with foley conflicting testimony on,meredith testified that she had picked both byndum and mcfowler.it is meredith puzzling testimony that she picked two individuals as the single person that she saw at the scene of the crime which calls into doubt the reliability of her identification testimony.
we begin our analysis by noting that,so far as the record reveals,the lineup that meredith viewed on the day of the murder was untainted by any suggestive or otherwise inappropriate circumstance or procedure.this is in contrast to each of the supreme court decisions dealing with the reliability of eyewitness identification testimony.manson brathwaite,d neil biggers,supra,d coleman alabama,d foster california,d simmons united states,d stovall denno,d gilbert california,d united states wade,supra,d.in those cases,the witness identification was preceded by a lineup or other identification made under suggestive conditions.however,the factors on which the court has focused in that context remain relevant even when a witness has made an identification untainted by suggestive identification procedures.see kennaugh miller,cir.collecting cases,cert.denied,d.r eliability is the linchpin in determining the admissibility of identification testimony brathwaite,at.at.and although here we are not concerned with the admissibility of meredith identification of mcfowler mcfowler counsel filed a motion to suppress the results of the lineup but later withdrew the motion,the reliability of her identification both at the lineup and at trial is of prime importance to the sufficiency of the evidence underlying mcfowler conviction.
we therefore must assess the reliability of meredith identification under the totality of the circumstances.biggers,at.at.the factors that bear on the likelihood that the witness has identified the wrong person are the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime,the witness degree of attention,the accuracy of the witness prior description of the criminal,the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation,and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.ibid.
as the illinois appellate court pointed out,one can readily infer from meredith testimony that she had a sufficient opportunity to observe the individual with the shotgun.app.court order at.the man was standing sixteen feet away from her,and although his face was not turned toward her at first,she was able to get a good look at it as he stumbled over logan body.id.meredith suggested that she may have had the intruder in her sight for as long as a few minutes.that seems quite doubtful given her testimony that she slammed the bedroom door shut and hid in the closet with her children upon seeing logan body and the armed man next to it.tr.the illinois appellate court itself viewed this testimony with some skepticism.order at.nonetheless,the record supplies us with no reason to doubt that meredith had an ample opportunity to view the intruder.and although the record is silent as to the degree of attention with which meredith viewed that individual,she certainly was not a casual bystander,and it is fair to assume that she looked at the man with the shotgun with a high degree of attention.the third biggers factor does not apply here.there is no evidence that meredith ever supplied the police with a description of the intruder before viewing the lineup the fourth factor yields conflicting signals the record sheds no light on the degree of certainty with which meredith identified mcfowler as the intruder at the lineup,but her later testimony that she picked both mcfowler and byndum may suggest uncertainty see,infra as for her identification,the record does not affirmatively indicate that meredith identified mcfowler with confidence,but on the other hand there are no indicia of hesitation or doubt,and meredith consistently identified mcfowler as the intruder she saw.the final biggers passage of time between the crime and the differently depending on whether one is addressing the lineup or meredith identification of mcfowler.the fact that the lineup was conducted within six hours of the shooting weighs rather strongly in favor of reliability.see chavis henderson,cir immediacy makes it much more likely that the witness will have a fresh recollection of the appearance of the suspect and hence that the identification will be accurate,quoting united states ex rel.springle follette,cir.by contrast,the passage of months before the trial occurred detracts significantly from the weight to be given that identification.see biggers,at.at lapse of seven months between crime and confrontation would be a seriously negative factor in most cases.
what the illinois appellate court did not consider,and what must be considered given the divergent testimony about whom meredith identified at the lineup,is which of the two identifications is the more reliable and on that point,the circumstances favor the lineup over the identification,as judge gottschall pointed out.the lineup was conducted within hours of the crime,whereas the trial occurred more than two years later.the lineup called for meredith to choose from among six individuals,whereas the suggestive circumstances of the courtroom would have focused her attention on the single defendant.see united states matthews,cir noting that the circumstances at trial may themselves be tantamount to a showup.true,on redirect examination,byndum was brought into the courtroom,and meredith was asked whether he or mcfowler was the intruder that she saw on the day of the murder.by then,of course,she had already identified mcfowler once in court and naturally would have been inclined to reaffirm her identification.that point aside,choosing from between two individuals one of them the defendant in court is necessarily a less reliable identification than choosing from among six individuals in a properly conducted lineup.we hasten to add that this is not a case in which the record discloses some additional fact that would tend to bolster the witness courtroom identification.see id.noting types of measures,seating defendant somewhere other than at counsel table,that can mitigate suggestiveness of identification 
although the lineup is the more reliable of the two identifications,the evidence is hopelessly inconsistent as to whom meredith actually picked out of the lineup.had meredith stood by her initial testimony that she picked mcfowler out of the lineup,then the factfinder would have been presented with a straightforward credibility choice between her testimony and the stipulated testimony of detective foley that she picked byndum.the trial judge would have been free to disbelieve foley,for the testimony of law enforcement officials is entitled to no greater weight than the testimony of any other witness see,united states martin,cir,and the parties stipulation as to what a witness would testify does not obligate the trier of fact to credit the witness testimony,tucker brady,cir.but instead,on redirect examination,meredith indicated that she picked both byndum and mcfowler at the lineup.as the record stands,that answer is nonsensical.
in only one circumstance would meredith answer both make sense and give the trier of fact reason to trust her ability to identify the man with the shotgun,and that is if she saw two intruders rather than one.it is this scenario that the state presses upon us with vigor and it is one,we acknowledge,that is possible in the abstract.the evidence does indicate that there were two if not three people involved in the crime.moreover,byndum guilty plea reveals that he was one of them.thus,if meredith saw two people in her apartment,she could have identified mcfowler as the man with the shotgun and byndum as the second intruder.this would have been entirely consistent with her courtroom identification of mcfowler and her initial testimony about previously having identified mcfowler at the lineup as the man with the shotgun.the state thus urges us to indulge the inference that meredith saw a second intruder in addition to the man with the shotgun 
however,there is not a shred of evidence that meredith did see more than one of the intruders.indeed,the clear import of the testimony is that meredith only saw one person.meredith testimony about the shooting indicated that she saw only one intruder the man with the shotgun and heard a second the voice which said,if you are going to shoot him shoot him tr.her testimony about the lineup likewise indicates that she was identifying one person and one person man with the shotgun foley stipulated testimony too refers to the identification of a single person.the trier of fact thus had no basis from which to conclude that meredith might have seen two people at the scene of the crime,thus enabling her to have identified both mcfowler and byndum.
we can not say it was impossible for meredith to have seen two intruders but the mere possibility that she did is not sufficient to rehabilitate her testimony about the lineup.the state is entitled to every reasonable inference that may be drawn from the record,but to be reasonable the inference must find at least some support in the facts.see united states lewis,cir mere suspicion or speculation can not be the basis for creation of logical inferences,amended in other respects,cir united states brown,cir a conviction based on evidence that requires speculation or mere conjecture by the factfinder is invalid.such support is lacking here.all of the evidence points to meredith having seen one and only one intruder.indeed,had she seen two,surely the state would have elicited that information,particularly after meredith announced on the witness stand that she had picked both byndum and mcfowler from the lineup.as things stand,however,we would have to venture beyond the record and into the realm of speculation in order to suppose that meredith was identifying two different intruders when she identified both byndum and mcfowler.it is equally possible that meredith was confused or flummoxed,or that her memory was faulty.the evidence does not permit us to choose one of these possibilities over another.
meredith own testimony thus rendered it impossible for the factfinder to determine whom it was that she identified at the lineup.the illinois appellate court recognized the inconsistencies in the evidence as to meredith lineup identification.order at,and as the appellate court noted,it is difficult to tell whether the trial court disregarded altogether the possibility that meredith had identified mcfowler at the lineup or simply gave meredith initial testimony that she did decreased weight id.the appellate court suggestion that the trier of fact could have given her purported lineup identification of mcfowler at least some weight id.was objectively unreasonable.once meredith testified that she had identified both mcfowler and byndum at the lineup,the trier of fact could not have found with any degree of confidence that it was mcfowler that meredith actually had identified.whom meredith identified at the lineup is simply an unsolvable mystery.
this leaves meredith identification as the sole evidentiary support for a finding that mcfowler stood next to logan body with a shotgun in hand.the illinois appellate court reasoned that e ven if meredith lineup identification were given no weight whatsoever,the factfinder could still make this finding based on her unwavering identification of the defendant alone.order at.had there never been a lineup,we have little doubt that meredith positive identification would have sufficed as proof of mcfowler culpable involvement in logan murder.but a lineup did take place,and meredith made an identification at that lineup.so what we must consider is whether meredith inconsistent testimony about the lineup casts such doubt on her courtroom identification as to render the latter insufficiently reliable to support mcfowler conviction.
as a threshold matter,we agree with the district court that meredith identification of mcfowler can not be considered in isolation,apart from her testimony about the lineup identification.wl,at.for all of the reasons we have discussed,the evidence as to the lineup precludes any reliable determination as to whom meredith identified in the lineup.that does not mean,however,that the lineup and the testimony about that lineup should be disregarded as if it had never occurred.meredith made two identifications in this case,one at the lineup and one in court.whether her identification of mcfowler was reliable enough for the trier of fact to find that mcfowler was the person she saw in her home armed with a shotgun is a question that can only be answered with reference to the lineup and the reliability of that identification as well.see kennaugh,at witness inability to identify defendant in prior lineup and several photo arrays inevitably heightens the risk that her identification was induced by the suggestiveness of the setting in which it occurred.
as we have already discussed,the factors relevant to the reliability of the two identifications point to the lineup identification as the more reliable of the two.that identification took place within hours of the crime,called upon meredith to choose from six individuals,and,so far as the record reveals,was free of any circumstance that would have made it suggestive.the later identification,on the other hand,took place nearly two and years after the shooting and within the inherently suggestive environs of a courtroom.the fact that meredith reaffirmed her identification of mcfowler after seeing byndum and mcfowler stand side by side adds little weight to the strength of her identification.byndum was not summoned to the courtroom until after meredith already identified mcfowler during her direct testimony,and given the evident differences in their height alone,there would have been no mixing the two up.indeed,the fact that meredith apparently had no difficulty distinguishing between the two men in court years after the crime merely reinforces the mystery as to how she could have chosen both of them from the lineup,when the event was still fresh in her mind.
of course,it is not unheard of for an eyewitness to fail to identify the defendant in a lineup,to pick the wrong person,or to express some ambivalence about her identification,only to later make a positive identification of him in court.often the apparent inconsistency is explained by such things as the witness emotional state,her failure to view the lineup with sufficient care,or an unexpected change in the defendant appearance between the time of the crime and the lineup.see,united states ex rel.kosik napoli,cir defendant had cut his hair and shaved his mustache cole state,witness confused by defendant longer hair commonwealth hurd,witness did not stand close enough to lineup on first occasion taylor state,witness unable to make identification because her vision was poor,but was able to identify him from photo array.so long as the record indicates that the witness had a sufficient basis for identifying the defendant,an adequate opportunity to observe the defendant at the time of the offense,her inability to identify him prior to trial normally will not detract from her identification,united states matthews,at lack of pretrial identification did not undermine witnesses identifications,where their testimony was sufficient to establish that their identifications had an origin independent of their viewing defendant in the courtroom and hence was sufficient to meet the threshold of reliability needed to permit them to attempt identifications of the men they had seen see also united states davies,cir g enerally,the question of the suggestiveness or credibility of the identification is to be resolved ultimately by the jury after the defendant has had an opportunity to test the accuracy of an identification through.by contrast,meredith initial inability to identify mcfowler was not explained by any such circumstance.indeed,meredith did not profess to have had any inability to make an identification,or uncertainty about her ability,in viewing the lineup.only when she was confronted with the possibility that she had picked byndum rather than mcfowler did she say that she had picked both.nothing in the record explains why at the lineup,on the very day of the offense,meredith could have picked two people as the one person she saw holding the shotgun and then two years later picked mcfowler alone.nothing,that is,except the inherently suggestive environs of the courtroom.see kennaugh,at.
indeed,meredith testimony itself calls into doubt the reliability of her identification.in testifying on that she identified both byndum and mcfowler at the lineup,meredith not only contradicted her own initial testimony,but gave an answer that makes no sense on the facts.inconsistencies in a witness testimony are not unusual either,and normally these are left for the factfinder to assess.see,united states gutman,cir trial court not compelled to instruct jury to disregard testimony
