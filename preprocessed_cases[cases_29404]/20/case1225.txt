julius james larry,iii filed a federal petition for habeas corpus challenging his texas state court conviction for theft.the district court dismissed the petition as under the and effective death penalty act aedpa.larry appeals arguing that because his state application was properly filed the statute of limitations was tolled and his federal habeas application was timely filed.larry state application was not properly filed therefore we affirm the district court ruling dismissing his petition.
larry was convicted in texas state court for theft.his conviction was affirmed and his petition for discretionary review denied.larry then petitioned the united states supreme court for a writ of certiorari which was eventually denied.several months prior to the supreme court denial of his petition for certiorari,larry filed a state habeas application in the proper state trial court over a year after he filed his state habeas application the trial court issued findings of fact and denied larry habeas petition on the merits.the file was immediately sent to the texas court of criminal appeals tcca.the tcca promptly dismissed larry habeas application simply stating direct appeal pending.larry filed a second state habeas application which the tcca denied without written order.
larry then filed a federal petition for habeas corpus.the district court granted the respondent motion to dismiss finding that larry filed his application more than one year after his judgment became final.the district court further found that neither one of larry state habeas applications tolled the statute of limitations.it determined that his first application was not properly filed because under texas procedural law the tcca did not have jurisdiction to consider his application until his judgment was final and,it determined that his second application,although properly filed,was filed after the federal statute of limitations had already run.the district court denied larry request for equitable tolling and refused to grant a certificate of appealability coa.
we granted a coa on the issues of whether the district court erred in concluding that larry first application was properly filed and whether a state habeas application filed during the pendency of a writ of certiorari must always be dismissed under texas law.larry now brings this appeal.
we review the district court denial of a habeas application on procedural grounds de novo.emerson johnson,cir.aedpa governs this case because larry filed his federal habeas application after aedpa effective date.see id.aedpa requires that a federal habeas application be filed within of the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.d a.however,it further provides that t he time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.d emphasis added.
the supreme court held in artuz bennett,d,that an application is properly filed when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings.artuz,at.emphasis omitted.it counseled that these rules govern for example,the form of the document,the time limits upon its delivery,the court and office in which it must be lodged,and the requisite filing fee.id.the court emphasized that the question whether an application has been properly filed is quite separate from the question whether the claims contained in the application are meritorious and free of procedural bar.id.at.emphasis omitted.therefore,to determine whether an application is properly filed,we look to procedural rules governing the court jurisdiction to consider the application,not rules governing whether it can consider any particular claim.id.at.we do not look to rules setting forth a condition to obtaining relief.id.at.thus,a habeas petition filed in a court lacking jurisdiction to consider the application is not properly filed,see id.at.if an application is erroneously accepted by the clerk of a court lacking jurisdiction it will be pending,but not properly filed,but a habeas petition filed in a court that must deny relief on the claims in the application is properly filed,see id.at.finding that a procedural bar requiring a court to deny successive claims did not set forth a condition to filing.
in cases since artuz,we have held that if the applicable procedural rule is an absolute bar to filing such that it provides no exceptions and the court need not examine issues related to substance to apply the procedural rule then the application is not properly filed.see emerson,at finding the rule at issue here seemingly provides no exceptions and does not require an examination of the merits of the petitioner claim williams cain,cir finding there is no express provision in louisiana law that would permit a petitioner to avoid the deadline therefore,an application is not properly filed if the state court blindly applies the procedural bar in all cases without ever having to consider any potential exception to its prohibition or examine any issues related to the substance of the application.see emerson,at.that is the case here.
article of the texas rules of criminal procedure establishes the procedures for an application for writ of habeas corpus in which the applicant seeks relief from a felony judgment imposing a penalty other than death.art vernon.it provides first that a fter final conviction in any felony case,the writ must be made returnable to the court of criminal appeals of texas.art a emphasis added.then it provides that a n application for writ of habeas corpus filed after final conviction in a felony case must be filed with the clerk of the court in which the conviction being challenged was obtained.b emphasis added.once the trial court issues findings of fact,and if it so chooses rules on the merits,the application is transferred to the tcca.see.art d.
the tcca does not have jurisdiction to consider an application for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to until the felony judgment from which relief is sought becomes final.ex parte johnson.a direct appeal is final when the mandate from the court of appeals issues.id.the mandate was issued in larry direct appeal three days after the supreme court denied his petition for certiorari and several months after he filed his state habeas application in the convicting court.larry direct appeal was not final at the time he filed his state habeas application,thus the state court did not have jurisdiction to consider his application.see id.in determining that it did not have jurisdiction to consider larry habeas application,the tcca did not have to consider any exceptions to this absolute bar to filing,nor did it have to consider the substance of larry application consequently,larry state habeas application was not properly filed.
larry challenges the conclusion that his state habeas application was not properly filed.he first contends that he properly filed his state habeas application under.larry asserts that only requires that the judgment be final by the time the tcca receives the habeas application,not when the application is filed in the trial court.he then argues that since the trial court did not forward his application to the tcca until after his judgment became final the tcca had jurisdiction to consider his application and it was properly filed.this is a misreading of which requires that the habeas application be filed in the trial court after the conviction becomes final.see.art a.this jurisdictional limitation forbids the filing of a state habeas application before the applicant judgment is final.see johnson,at applicant claim is not ripe,because the application for writ of habeas corpus was filed during the pendency of the direct appeal.emphasis added.larry was barred from filing his habeas application,and the tcca was barred from considering it,as of the time he filed it.consequently,his state habeas application was not properly filed under.
larry next contends that because the state trial court issu
