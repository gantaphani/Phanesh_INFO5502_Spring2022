robert douglas appeals from the order denying his pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.douglas contends that the district court failed to apply the correct standard of review pursuant to the terms of the and effective death penalty act aedpa.he also argues that his sixth amendment rights were violated because he was denied a speedy trial,his counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue his right to a speedy trial,and he was effectively denied his right to counsel because he was unrepresented at a critical stage of the proceedings while he was in custody on capital charges.we will affirm because we conclude that the district court applied the correct standard of review in determining that the appellate division decision was not contrary to,or did not involve an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
on august,estella and charlene moore lived together with charlene infant daughter in apartment in a building in east orange,new jersey.douglas,whose nickname is skeet lived next door to the moore sisters in apartment.georgianna broadway and deborah neal lived together nearby in newark,new jersey.broadway and neal were friends of the moore sisters.broadway was introduced to douglas through the moore sisters.

the next day,on august,eleven police officers went to gaskins apartment in newark,new jersey to locate douglas.sergeant sepe,sergeant alan sierchio and four other police officers from the east orange police department,were assisted by sergeant charles whitner of the newark,new jersey police department tactical unit officer wayne dooley,officer george davey and officer thomas hughes,also of the newark police department.sergeants sepe,sierchio and whitner,along with officers hughes,dooley and davey,walked up to the third floor apartment.sergeant whitner knocked on the door.they were admitted by bonita allen who indicated that douglas was in the living room.
upon entering the apartment,the officers observed douglas sitting on the couch in the living room.sergeant sepe,sergeant whitner,sergeant sierchio,and officer dooley approached douglas in the living room.douglas stood up as the officers approached him.gaskins was seated in the living room on a chair near the couch.sergeant sepe placed douglas under arrest.sergeant whitner handcuffed douglas from behind while sergeant sepe,who was with douglas,performed a protective search.when searching douglas,sergeant sepe came across a hard object and announced that he had found a gun.sergeant sierchio moved in closer and observed sergeant sepe lift douglas shirt and seize a fully loaded six shot spesco taurus caliber revolver from the front portion of his pants in the waistband area.the six rounds in the weapon were bullets.sergeant whitner,officer hughes,and officer davey also observed sergeant sepe remove the weapon from douglas waistband area.sergeant sierchio observed sergeant sepe remove an additional five rounds of ammunition,also bullets,from douglas right front pocket.prior to patting him down,sergeant sepe did not see the weapon or a bulge in douglas pants.the weapon was entirely concealed from view because douglas shirt was hanging down over his waistband.
the gun holster located in apartment bore unique striation marks matching those found on the weapon recovered from douglas at the time of his arrest.captain carl leisinger,a ballistics expert,testified that the bullets recovered from the bodies of the moore sisters and the spent round recovered in apartment were fired from the revolver carried by douglas at the time of his arrest.captain leisinger also testified that the revolver seized from douglas had unique striation marks cut into the flutes of the outside cylinder.this is the only revolver captain leisinger had seen,in examining tens of thousands of revolvers,that had this particular type of fluting.these unique striation marks were plainly imprinted on the black leather holster found in douglas apartment.
ollie douglas,an assistant deputy public defender adpd with the new jersey office of the public defender for essex county opd,was appointed to represent douglas on august,three days after he was arrested.at the time of his appointment to represent douglas,adpd douglas had served as an assistant deputy public defender for fourteen years.he had tried two or three capital cases.after interviewing douglas,adpa douglas requested that a field investigation be conducted,rather than telephone contacts,with several individuals whom douglas disclosed might be witnesses to support his defense.the list of prospective witnesses that douglas suggested should be questioned in person included gaskins,sheila tucker,and michael tucker.
on october,douglas was charged with two counts of murder,aggravated assault,possession of a handgun without a permit,and possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose in violation of new jersey law.adpd douglas represented douglas at his arraignment on november.douglas entered a not guilty plea.pursuant to.c,the state served a notice of aggravating factors which,if proven at the penalty phase,would make douglas eligible for the death penalty.deputy public defender dpd mayer winograd,the head of the essex county opd,was also assigned to represent douglas.adpd douglas and dpd winograd met with douglas several times while he was in jail.
on january,dpd winograd informed douglas that the opd had conducted a financial investigation and determined that he was ineligible for legal representation by the opd in its investigation,the opd discovered that douglas owned a house with a market value of to,depending on its condition.similar houses in the immediate area had recently sold for and.dpd winograd advised douglas that he had a right to appeal to the appellate division which has exclusive jurisdiction over the determination that he was not entitled to the appointment of counsel based on indigency.in his letter to douglas,dpd winograd cited state nilsen,a copy of the letter was sent to judge joseph falcone,on january.
on february,douglas appeared before judge falcone without counsel.judge falcone informed douglas of his right to appeal the opd decision to terminate his representation.judge falcone requested that douglas advise the court in writing of any developments of his attempts to persuade the opd that he was entitled to the appointment of counsel.judge falcone also advised douglas to consider state nilsen,in deciding whether to pursue his claim that he was eligible for the appointment of counsel because he was indigent.
adpd douglas provided douglas with the name and address of james smith,the deputy public defender charged with handling appeals in the opd appellate section,along with a notice of appeal form to facilitate an appeal of the denial of representation.in a letter dated february,douglas wrote to dpd smith declaring that he challenged the opd determination that he was not eligible for representation.
during his next court appearance on february,douglas informed judge falcone that he had corresponded with dpd smith but had received no reply.judge falcone again informed him of his right to appeal from the decision denying his eligibility for the appointment of counsel and scheduled the next appearance on march.he also advised douglas that he should inform the court in writing of any developments in his appeal from the refusal of the opd to represent him.
when the matter came before the court on march,and again on april,douglas appeared without counsel.at the april,hearing,judge falcone provided douglas with a copy of the nilsen opinion which set forth the proper procedure for appealing the opd determination.
on may,douglas wrote to new jersey public defender alfred slocum,seeking review of the opd nonindigency determination.he explained to slocum that judge falcone had informed him at the april,hearing that dpd smith was not authorized to represent him in an appeal from the decision of the opd that he was not an indigent entitled to appointed counsel.he further stated that his inability to receive envelopes and stamps at the county jail,or use their photocopying equipment,had prevented him from contacting slocum until the date of the letter.
at a subsequent court appearance on june,judge falcone informed douglas that he should submit his appeal of the denial of appointed counsel to the appellate division of the superior court.that same day,douglas wrote to elizabeth mclaughlin of the clerk office of the superior court of new jersey,appellate division,seeking review of the determination that he was not an indigent.he stated in his letter that the property he owned was worth very little because it had been damaged by fire and was in need of extensive repairs.douglas also informed mclaughlin that the cost of repairs would be,and that there was a mortgage on the property in the amount of,as well as water and sewage liens in the amount of plus interest.
section was amended,effective on april.as amended,it transferred the determination regarding whether a defendant is indigent from the opd to the court.douglas was informed of this fact by public defender slocum in a letter dated june.referring to the then recent amendment to,slocum wrote that 
effective april,by virtue of newly enacted legislation,the office of the public defender was relieved of the responsibility of determining indigency.this determination is now made by the judiciary.even if you were to successfully appeal winograd determination,the office of the public defender would not be able to decide whether you are indigent or not.
you should immediately write to the essex county criminal case manager requesting that they provide you with an application for representation by the office of the public defender.if they determine that you are eligible for our services,we will again undertake your representation.
on july,jack trubenbach,clerk of the superior court of new jersey,appellate division,wrote to douglas informing him that his appeal of the denial of court appointed counsel was rejected for failure to attach the appropriate documents.on july,douglas wrote to judge falcone to inform the court of his lack of progress in obtaining counsel.he complained that he was misled by adpd douglas as to what was required for a successful appeal,and expressed general concern over the progress of his case.he also explained the difficulties he had experienced obtaining access to the library,to a copy machine,and other resources necessary for his appeal of the opd denial of representation,due to his incarceration and placement in protective custody 
at a hearing on august,judge falcone told douglas that the procedure has changed effective april of this year.it not the office of the public defender that makes the final decision as to whether or not an individual qualifies for representation.that decision is now left in the hands of the court judge falcone told douglas that the most expeditious way for him to renew his request for representation would be to apply directly to the court,rather than continue with the appeal of the opd determination.judge falcone explained that the procedure for obtaining counsel included the filing of forms and an interview by the probation department.judge falcone directed probation officer frank caporale to assist douglas in completing the proper form requesting the assignment of counsel.douglas submitted an application for appointment of counsel with the court.officer caporale then reported to the pd that defendant was conditionally eligible for public defender representation.douglas did not pursue his attempts to appeal the opd initial determination any further.
on august,anthony casale,criminal case manager for the superior court of new jersey,criminal division,visited douglas and informed him that,based on the information in the opd january,letter,douglas was still ineligible for representation by the opd.
in a letter dated august,addressed to judge falcone,douglas described his interview with casale.douglas enclosed photographs of the property he owned and explained that the property was uninhabitable.douglas complained that casale had determined that he was not an indigent based on the information contained in the january,letter from the opd terminating representation.on september,judge falcone ordered casale to proceed with a new investigation of douglas eligibility for the appointment of counsel.
on october,judge falcone received a letter from douglas which was dated september.judge falcone summoned douglas to appear before him on october,and inquired as to why douglas did not mail the letter directly to him instead of sending it first to sheila tucker.this procedure caused a delay in receiving douglas mail.douglas explained that the copy machine at the jail was broken so he had to mail the letter to tucker so she could make a copy and then mail the letter to the judge.judge falcone observed that this was causing lengthy delays in all of douglas correspondence to him.judge falcone stated that the letter dated september,brought quite a bit of additional information to his attention that he was never aware of.specifically,judge falcone stated that he had been unaware of the considerable efforts douglas had made to obtain counsel on his own,including contacting and meeting with several private attorneys in august and september of,all of whom were unable for various reasons to represent him.
casale attended the october,hearing.he informed the court that he had visited douglas house and confirmed that it had been damaged by a fire in and was essentially gutted.casale also confirmed that there were liens against the house for taxes and utility bills.he told the court that he had contacted five private attorneys and asked if they would represent douglas.each declined to do so.casale recommended that douglas be assigned a public defender.judge falcone found that douglas was an indigent entitled to representation by the opd.
on november,dpd winograd met with judge falcone in his chambers and informed him that adpd albert kapin and adpd joseph krakora would represent douglas.adpd kapin and adpd krakora met with douglas that same day.
a pretrial conference was held approximately five months later on april.at the conference,all of douglas pretrial motions were scheduled to be heard on august,and a trial date was set for september.
carmeta albarus,an opd investigator,interviewed gaskins on july.at the time of douglas arrest,gaskins was infirm,suffering from emphysema,asthma,and heart failure.when gaskins was interviewed by albarus,he was hooked up to an oxygen machine and had difficulty talking.gaskins told albarus that he did not see douglas with any weapons at the time of his arrest.he expressed his willingness to testify on douglas behalf.gaskins passed away sometime in september of the precise date does not appear in the record.
the court considered pretrial motions on september,and,and october and,at the close of argument on october,the court indicated that it would render its rulings on october.
on november,the opd received a letter from michael and sheila tucker,two defense witnesses,stating that the tuckers were moving to australia.sheila tucker had testified at the october,hearing on douglas suppression motion.on december,adpd kapin and adpd krakora wrote to judge falcone requesting that the court set a schedule for the remaining hearings on the pretrial motion and a date for the jury selection,so they could schedule bringing the tuckers back from australia to testify.id.at.the court did not respond to the request.
on february,while the pretrial motions were still pending,defense counsel filed a notice of motions to set trial date and reduce bail.the affidavit of counsel accompanying the motion reads in its entirety 
we represent the defendant robert douglas in this case.
this case has been pending since defendant arrest on august.defendant has been held in the essex county jail since that time in lieu of bail.as of february,no dates have been set for the remaining pretrial hearings or for jury selection.by letter dated december,we requested that dates be set,but no response to that letter has been received.
in addition to the prejudice resulting from defendant continued pretrial incarceration,we assert that the ongoing delay in this case has prejudiced him in the following ways 
a two defense and mickey moved to australia.
b one potential defense witness irving in september.
c without knowing the court rulings on the pretrial motions,we have been unable to finalize trial strategy.
d we are unable to give our fact and character witnesses any guidance as to the timing of the trial and we fear that it will be increasingly difficult to enlist their cooperation.
e there is a strong possibility that the trial will be further delayed in the event either side takes interlocutory appeals from the court rulings on the pretrial motions.
f such a long delay between arrest and trial may create the impression to the jury that the defendant guilt is not really at the punishment to which he should be subjected.
we respectfully request that a trial date be set and that defendant bail be reduced.
on march,judge falcone set a trial date of september,and announced that since he had been appointed presiding judge of the criminal division,he had reassigned this matter to the judge alvin weiss.on may,judge weiss ruled on the pretrial motions which had been pending since october.
jury selection began on september.the trial commenced on october,some three years after douglas was indicted and approximately two years after adpd kapin and adpd krakora were appointed to represent him.on november,a jury convicted douglas on all counts.the jury did not vote to impose the death penalty.douglas was sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment.the appellate division of the new jersey superior court affirmed the conviction on june.the new jersey supreme court denied certification on october.
on december,douglas filed a petition for relief in the superior court of new jersey,essex county pcr court.he alleged that he was denied his right to a speedy trial and to the appointment of counsel during a critical stage in the adversary proceedings.douglas also complained of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel.douglas alleged that his counsel was ineffective because they failed to move for dismissal due to the extended pretrial delay.the pcr court granted relief to douglas based upon his claim that his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial had been violated.it denied the remainder of his claims.
the pcr court applied the test enunciated in barker wingo,d in determining that douglas was denied a speedy trial.in barker,the supreme court set forth the factors that must be balanced to evaluate a speedy trial claim as follows length of delay,the reason for the delay,the defendant assertion of his right,and prejudice to the defendant.id.at citing united states simmons,cir.with respect to the length of delay,the pcr court quoted hakeem beyer,cir for the principle that a delay of months,measured from the date of arrest until the commencement of trial is not dispositive in and of itself,but is sufficiently lengthy to warrant an inquiry into the other facts.transcript of pcr proceedings,september,at quoting hakeem,at.the pcr court concluded that a delay of months to the date they fix the trial date and months till you get to trial passes the test of presumptive prejudice and therefore requires an analysis of the other factors in the case.id.
the pcr court attributed the reason for delay to the state failure to provide douglas with counsel,holding that w hen the courts the public defender office drops the ball,that still affects the defendant rights,and the investigation which should have been undertaken promptly by the public defender was not undertaken and a limited investigation was done.id.at.the pcr court noted that this was a capital case,requiring early preparation of counsel,id.at,and emphasized the errors made by the trial court and the opd.id.at.the pcr court concluded that douglas had asserted his rights,stating that it was abundantly clear that the defendant was constantly complaining that he was getting representation,that he was able to establish his innocence and was able to have his day in court.id.at.the pcr court also found prejudice due to the death of gaskins.id.at.
with respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the pcr court concluded,after an evidentiary hearing,that douglas sixth amendment rights had not been violated.as the pcr court expressed it,i do not find that the defendant has established in any way,shape or form that any errors which may have been made by counsel were so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the amendment.id.at.
with respect to the charge that counsel had provided ineffective assistance by failing to file a speedy trial motion,the pcr court credited counsel testimony,finding as follows 
counsel did file the motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial because that would have required him to disclose trial strategy.and i think more importantly,he could imagine the motion being granted considering the nature of the case.
the appellate division of the superior court of new jersey appellate division reversed the pcr court ruling that douglas was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial and affirmed its disposition of the remaining claims.as to the length of the delay,the appellate division held that a delay does not by itself give rise to prejudice or denial of the right to speedy trial.state douglas,citing state long.relying on a study conducted by a new jersey governor commission,the appellate division observed that capital cases in new jersey are generally not tried for two years following indictment,and determined that,because douglas did not appear to be entitled to appointed counsel,the pcr court put too much emphasis on the opd withdrawal of representation,the subsequent difficulties in challenging that decision,and the failure of the trial court to recognize that it was responsible for appointing counsel as of april.id.at.
the appellate division determined that the reason for the delay was the appellate process.i n no event can it be said that advising defendant of his need to pursue an appeal and reliance by the courts and pd on that requirement,as required by law at the time of the pd decision,was a deliberate attempt to hamper the defense.id.regarding the third barker factor,the appellate division did not specifically discuss whether douglas had preserved his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial before the trial court.
the appellate division further held that douglas failed to demonstrate prejudice because gaskins died months before the february,motion was filed.id.at.a ny prejudice concerning gaskins death is merely speculative,and,in light of the weight of other evidence presented at trial,including the testimony of the surviving victim,the testimony of all the officers that defendant had a loaded handgun in his possession at the time of his arrest in the gaskins apartment,and the discovery of the holster in defendant apartment,gaskins testimony would not have impacted the verdict.id.at.
the new jersey supreme court denied douglas petition for certification.
douglas filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to on december,the district court held that petitioner had not made a substantial showing of the deprivation of a constitutional right as required under and denied the petition.douglas has filed a timely appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and.
douglas contends that the district court applied the wrong standard of review.we disagree.as the district court correctly noted 
f ederal habeas corpus relief is denied to any claim which was adjudicated on the merits in a state court proceeding,unless such application resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
douglas,d at citing d.
in williams taylor,d,the supreme court explained that 
u nder the contrary to clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.
id.at.for the writ to issue,the state court application of federal law must be objectively unreasonable.lockyer andrade,d.
the district court correctly quoted the standard of review set forth in d and.it also appropriately applied the supreme court and third circuit authorities that have interpreted that standard.the district court also accurately noted that t he aedpa increased the deference federal courts must give to factual findings and legal determinations of the state courts.douglas,d at.
douglas has correctly pointed out that the district court in one place misquoted the standard of review under d and that the misstatement was quite similar to one of two errors we identified in johnson carroll,cir.however,douglas petition does not turn on the d standard since he is arguing that his detention is the result of an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent to the facts under d.he makes no claim to habeas relief based on any allegedly unreasonable determination of facts under d and so this misstatement is not relevant to the present appeal.
douglas also contends that the district court erred in denying relief on his claim that his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial was violated.the district court legal conclusions regarding douglas speedy trial claim are reviewed de novo.burkett fulcomer,cir citing lesko owens,cir.
the district court correctly concluded that it will not consider how it would have applied the barker test because habeas relief is only available where the state court application is objectively unreasonable.douglas,d at quoting williams,at.the district court stated that is was constrained to deny petitioner relief on this ground because the appellate division decision did not involve an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law id.accordingly,the district court held that the strict standard set forth in d compelled the denial of douglas habeas corpus petition.this court is bound by that same strict standard.
as evidenced by the decision of the appellate division,reasonable jurists may disagree as to the correct disposition of douglas speedy trial claim.however,because the decision by the appellate division was not objectively unreasonable,we must affirm.see williams,at.under d unreasonable application clause,then,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.
the appellate division recognized that the three year period from douglas arrest to the commencement of trial was of sufficient length that it was required to make a full inquiry into and to balance each of the barker factors to determine whether he was denied his right to a speedy trial.the record shows that adpd douglas was appointed to represent douglas on august,three days after his arrest.the opd withdrew from representing douglas on january,because it had concluded that douglas was ineligible for appointed counsel.during that period of representation,adpd douglas met with his client,prepared a witness list,and authorized the interrogation of potential defense witnesses.douglas was not represented by counsel for nine months and twelve days because of the procedural confusion caused by the change in the statute transferring the determination of indigency from the opd to the trial court.
adpd kapin testified during the pcr court proceedings that in his experience,it is not uncommon to spend two to three years preparing for the trial of a capital case.douglas case came to trial three years after he was charged.
with respect to the length of the delay,the appellate division noted that three years was not an extraordinary pretrial period for a capital case,citing data indicating that such cases commonly take at least two years to get to trial.the court explained that this was in part due to the fact that counsel were required to prepare during that period not only a defense to a very serious charge but also the defendant mitigating factor position for the penalty phase.
in barker,the prosecution sought and obtained a series of sixteen continuances to facilitate the prosecution of silas manning,willie barker cohort.at.the prosecutors in barker believed they needed to first obtain manning conviction in order to avoid the assertion by manning of his privilege against and assure his testimony against barker.id.at.here,by contrast,the two principal reasons for the delay were the good faith albeit erroneous conclusion by the opd that douglas was not an indigent and the failure of the trial judge to inform douglas until august,that,due to a change in the law in april,indigency determinations were no longer the responsibility of the opd.while the ultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest with the government rather than with the defendant,at,the record in this case shows that there was no deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense.the trial court scheduled several hearings in order to learn about douglas efforts to retain private counsel and the progress of his efforts to demonstrate that he was an indigent.
with regard to the reason for the pretrial delay in this case,the appellate division concluded that a ll pretrial time was productively used once defense counsel were assigned,and when they asked that a trial date be set,it was fixed in accordance with a schedule satisfactory to the defense.douglas.at.as to the proceeding period,the court found that the judiciary failure to be more aggressive in reviewing defendant claim of indigency was not excusable.at the same time,it concluded that in no event could it be said that advising defendant of his need to pursue an appeal and the reliance of the court and the pd on that requirement was a deliberate attempt to hamper the defense.id.at.
a defendant who fails to demand a speedy trial does not forever waive his right.at.however,failure to assert the right will make it difficult for petitioner to prove that he was denied a speedy trial.id.at.a pro se criminal defendant does not have to make a procedurally perfect assertion of his speedy trial rights,but must make a reasonable assertion of the right so as to put authorities on notice of his sixth amendment claim.gov t of the virgin is.pemberton,cir.
whether or not the february,motion can be construed as one for a speedy trial it is clear from the record that douglas made a reasonable assertion of his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial.as douglas points out in this appeal,his efforts to secure counsel are properly viewed as part and parcel of his efforts to assert his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial.douglas continuous requests for counsel were founded,in large part,on his concern that he be given an opportunity to prove his innocence before evidence was lost.for example,in his correspondence of may,with public defender slocum,douglas expressed concern over the delay in his case 
during the five months i was being represented by the office of the public defender,essex region,to my knowledge,only four statements were obtained.three individuals,donald well address omitted calvin bonds address omitted and gene sutton,address unknown,came to the office of the public defender to make statements,but no statements were taken from these persons.
to prove my innocence,it is imperative that i have a fair trial with proper representation and competent defense presentation.
in his july,letter to judge falcone,douglas wrote conducting an investigation,locating witnesses and relying on memories after a year may be tenuous at best.day by day the chances that i may be able to prove my innocence may,perhaps,become more and more remote.douglas assertion of his right to a speedy trial alone,however,is not sufficient to undermine the overall reasonableness of the appellate division barker analysis.see barker,at.none of the four factors identified is either a necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial.
finally,on the question of prejudice,the barker court held that i f witnesses die or disappear during a delay,the prejudice is obvious.barker,at.the barker court also instructed,however,that 
w e regard none of the four factors identified above as either a necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial.rather,they are related factors and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.in sum,these factors have no talismanic qualities courts must still engage in a difficult and sensitive balancing process.
the appellate division concluded that there is 
nothing in the record to suggest that defendant was unduly prejudiced by the delay which can be attributable to the assignment of counsel at the outset of capital proceedings.such proceedings would have,of necessity by virtue of the needs of the defense team in a capital case,carried beyond the death of irving gaskins or any other event which defendant points to as the basis for his claim of prejudice.
douglas.at.
gaskins died in september,approximately months after douglas arrest.the record shows that the defense team need to prepare for trial and a possible penalty phase in a capital case would have continued beyond the date of gaskins death.adpd kapin testified that in his experience,it is not uncommon to spend two to three years in preparing for trial.here,the record shows that the defense team was not prepared to request a trial date until five months after gaskins died.furthermore,as noted by the appellate division 
any prejudice concerning gaskins death is merely speculative t he nature of gaskins statement regarding what he did not see without a fuller explanation of what he did observe does not warrant the granting of relief on the grounds that defendant was prejudiced by virtue of the pretrial delay.
douglas.at.we conclude that the appellate division balancing of the barker factors was not objectively unreasonable.
