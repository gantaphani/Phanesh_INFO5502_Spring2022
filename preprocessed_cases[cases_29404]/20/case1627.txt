the district court conditionally granted the petition for a writ of habeas corpus under of petitioner michael hicks,a michigan prisoner,on his claim that his sixth amendment right to confrontation was violated at his murder trial when the prosecutor,during his opening statement,advised the jury that petitioner had confessed to the murder to a fellow jail inmate and,yet,subsequently failed,despite a good faith effort,to produce that inmate as a witness the district court found that the procedural default doctrine did not bar the review of petitioner confrontation clause claim.specifically,the court held that petitioner had fairly presented his confrontation clause claim to the state courts on direct review to the extent that the state courts on direct review would have found that petitioner procedurally defaulted his confrontation clause claim as a result of trial counsel failure to object to the underlying violation at trial,the ineffective assistance of trial counsel would have excused any such default and,petitioner had not procedurally defaulted his confrontation clause claim before the state courts on collateral review because the state procedural ground upon which the state courts denied petitioner leave to appeal was inadequate to bar federal habeas review.
in reaching the merits of petitioner confrontation clause claim,the district court found that the prosecutor opening statement comment concerning petitioner alleged confession violated petitioner right to confrontation,and that this violation was not harmless error.the district court further found,pursuant to d,that the prior denial of petitioner confrontation clause claim on the merits was an unreasonable application of the pertinent,supreme court precedent.
respondent dennis straub appeals this grant of the writ of habeas corpus on the following grounds the district court erred in reaching the merits of petitioner claim because petitioner procedurally defaulted his claim by failing to raise it on direct review and because trial counsel failure to object did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel that would excuse this default the district court violated e when it held an evidentiary hearing on petitioner claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel because petitioner had failed to develop the factual basis underlying that claim in the state courts and assuming that the district court had the authority to reach the merits of petitioner confrontation clause claim,it erred in granting relief because the prosecutor remark did not violate petitioner right to confrontation under the relevant,supreme court precedent.
for the reasons explained below,we reverse the district court grant of a writ of habeas corpus to petitioner under.
procedural history 
adjudication of respondent present appeal requires an understanding of the complex procedural history that bears upon that appeal in the state courts.
on july,petitioner was arrested and charged with the murder of shawn stalworth,who had been shot to death earlier that day as he was leaving his house in battle creek,michigan.following his arrest,petitioner was confined in a local jail,where he allegedly confessed to another inmate,lorenzo brand brand,that he had committed the murder.brand testified to this confession at petitioner preliminary hearing.at petitioner jury trial,the prosecutor,during his opening statement,stated,in pertinent part 
defendant was arrested.he was charged.he was arraigned.he was taken to the city of battle creek lockup,not the county jail,but the lockup pending transfer,moving him over here.while he was there,there was another person in the lockup.he goes,hey,my mom just saw you on a videotape he said my mom told me she just saw a person and they accused him of homicide.you kill that man what did he say yep,yep.
at the close of the state case,the prosecutor informed the court that the state would not call brand as a witness because it had been unable to locate him.the prosecutor admitted that he did not believe that the state efforts to locate brand met with the due diligence required under michigan case law for the admission of preliminary examination testimony.the trial court agreed and declined to admit the testimony.despite the prosecutor failure to produce brand,defense counsel neither objected to nor requested a mistrial based upon the prosecutor opening statement relaying that confession.further,defense counsel never mentioned the prosecutor statement regarding petitioner alleged confession in his opening statement,which he had reserved until the close of the prosecution case.neither defense counsel nor the prosecutor mentioned the alleged confession in closing arguments.
the trial court gave the jury the customary instruction that t he lawyers statements and arguments are not evidence,and further instructed 
lorenzo brand is a missing witness whose appearance was the responsibility of the p rosecution.you may infer that the witness testimony would have not been favorable to the p rosecution case.
however,because the prosecutor opening statement never named the jail inmate to whom petitioner allegedly confessed,and because no mention was ever made before the jury that brand was that inmate,the jury had no knowledge with which to tie the trial court brand instruction to the prosecutor opening statement regarding the alleged confession moreover,immediately after this instruction,the district court gave an instruction as to when the jury could properly consider an unrelated statement made by petitioner that had been admitted into evidence.
the jury convicted petitioner of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.the trial court sentenced petitioner to life imprisonment without parole on the murder conviction and to two years imprisonment on the conviction.
direct review 
petitioner filed an appeal as of right in the michigan court of appeals.petitioner presented,among others,the following two claims 
defendant was denied a fair trial by the prosecutor numerous instances of misconduct,including arguing matters not in evidence,such as defendant supposed admission to committing the murder,and by repetitively defendant on the irrelevant matter of his being a marijuana dealer.
ii.because of defense counsel failures,defendant was denied his rights to the effective assistance of counsel,to present an effective defense,and to a fair trial.
petitioner only asserted that these instances of prosecutorial misconduct violated defendant rights to due process and a fair trial he never argued that this misconduct also violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation.during his appeals in the state courts,petitioner argued that no curative instruction could have remedied the prejudice to defendant.during the direct appeal,no one mentioned that the curative instruction that identified brand was referring to the jail inmate in the prosecutor opening statement to whom petitioner allegedly confessed.since trial counsel never objected to this alleged prosecutorial misconduct,petitioner argued that this failure to object resulted in the requisite manifest injustice which rendered any such objection unnecessary,and,alternatively,that the failure amounted to an ineffective assistance of counsel.thus,petitioner independent claim of ineffective assistance of counsel rested,in part,upon this failure by trial counsel 
petitioner filed a motion to remand the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.the michigan court of appeals affirmed petitioner conviction and sentence.people hicks,wl.as to the first claim,the court found that trial counsel,by failing to object to the alleged instances of prosecutorial misconduct at trial,had failed to preserve this claim for review absent a miscarriage of justice.id.noting that only a miscarriage of justice would excuse this failure,the court further found that there was no manifest injustice in the prosecutor comment during his opening statement that defendant allegedly confessed to the crime to a fellow inmate,even though the prosecution later failed to produce that witness.id.the court reasoned that the trial judge instruction to the jury that it could assume that the witness the prosecution was unable to produce would have testified unfavorably to the prosecution,and that it was not to consider defendant alleged admission as evidence of his guilt remedied any potential prejudice that may have resulted from this comment.
after noting that the defendant failed to properly preserve the issue,the court of appeals nonetheless decided to address the merits of his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim,and found that he failed to overcome the presumption that he was afforded effective assistance of counsel.id.specifically,the court held that in each instance,the action that defendant suggests that counsel should have taken would have either been futile,or a matter of strategy that th e c ourt is unwilling to on appeal.the michigan court of appeals denied petitioner motion to remand on the ground that petitioner failed to identify an issue sought to be reviewed on appeal and demonstrate by affidavit or an offer of proof regarding the facts to be established at a hearing,as c a ii requires.people hicks.
petitioner then filed a delayed application for leave to appeal to the michigan supreme court,presenting the same claims that he had presented to the michigan court of appeals.petitioner also filed a motion to remand the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on his claim.on november,the michigan supreme court denied petitioner leave to appeal and denied the motion for remand on the ground that it was not persuaded that it should review the questions presented.people hicks.
state collateral review 
on january,petitioner filed a motion for relief from judgment in the trial court,pursuant to the record indicates that petitioner made the following two claims,among others,in that motion 
petitioner was denied his constitutional right to confront witnesses against him when the prosecutor advised the jury during opening statement that defendant had confessed to the murder,where the prosecutor without even the pretense of due diligence failed thereafter to produce the witness to the alleged confession,where defense counsel never responded to the issue of the confession in any way,and where the trial court instructions failed utterly to remedy the enormous prejudice to the defendant.
ii.petitioner was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel when trial counsel failed to object or move for mistrial based upon an obvious deprivation of the right to confront witnesses following the prosecutor unsupported statement to the jury that the defendant had confessed,and where appellate counsel failed to frame the issue properly as the deprivation of the right to confront witnesses in violation of the sixth amendment.
in support of his claims,petitioner argued,for the first time,that the trial court jury instruction on brand was incapable of curing the prosecutor statement to the jury that petitioner had confessed to a jail inmate because that statement never disclosed the name of that jail inmate while the court instruction only referenced brand by name,not by his role as the jail inmate to whom petitioner allegedly confessed.petitioner further argued that,had brand testified,defense counsel would have had substantial evidence with which to impeach his testimony.
in an order dated march,the state trial court denied petitioner motion for relief from judgment.people hicks,calhoun county circuit court march.the court outlined its reasons for that denial at a hearing on march,during that hearing,petitioner argued that,although his confrontation clause and due process clause claims are grounded on the same factual predicate,they are legally distinct.therefore,he argued the michigan court of appeals decided only the latter,but not the former claim petitioner further argued that the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel had prevented him from presenting his confrontation clause claim to the court of appeals.he asserted that both trial counsel and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to identify and to raise the confrontation clause claim at trial and on direct review,respectively.
the trial court noted that the michigan court of appeals had held that trial counsel was not ineffective.nevertheless,it stated that,b ecause this is a first degree murder conviction and a felony firearm conviction,it was willing to address the underlying substance of the motion.the court stated that,because defendant testified that he had an alibi defense and completely denied having anything to do with the murder,the defense clearly contradicted the p rosecutor opening statement that defendant had confessed.the trial court then noted that it had instructed the jury that the lawyers arguments and statements are not evidence and that the jury decision must be based upon only evidence.the court concluded that,technically,there is no confrontation issue because,absent the prosecutor statement,there was no evidence brought into play against the defendant.while reading onto the record the michigan court of appeals opinion denying petitioner claim,the trial court underscored the following excerpt as the most important in its view 
t he record provides no support for d efense proposition that counsel failure to object to the admission of evidence,his failure to request a pretrial lineup,his failure to extensively an eyewitness,or his presentation of the d efendant defense fell below the objective standard of reasonableness.we find that defendant has failed to overcome the presumption that he was afforded effective assistance of counsel.
based upon this excerpt,the trial court concluded that petitioner had not presented a specific discrete allegation of ineffective assistance.rather,according to the trial court,petitioner allegation was and involved a number of different areas to demonstrate ineffective assistance.as a result,the trial court also agreed with the court of appeals that trial counsel assistance was not ineffective,reasoning that defendant had posited an alibi defense before the jury,and that the court had instructed the jury that lawyers statements are not evidence.the court then denied petitioner motion 
petitioner filed a delayed application for leave to appeal the trial court denial of his motion for relief from judgment in the michigan court of appeals,presenting these claims 
i.the trial court was clearly erroneous in rejecting defendant claim that he was denied his constitutional right to confront witnesses against him when the prosecutor advised the jury during opening statement that defendant had confessed to the murder,where the prosecutor without even the pretense of due diligence failed thereafter to produce the witness to the alleged confession,where defense counsel never responded to the issue of the confession in any way,and where the trial court instructions failed utterly to remedy the enormous prejudice to the defendant.

federal collateral review before the district court 
on march,petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.petitioner presented the following claims as grounds for relief 
petitioner was denied his constitutional right to confront witnesses against him when the prosecutor advised the jury during opening statement that petitioner had confessed to the murder,where the prosecutor without even the pretense of due diligence failed thereafter to produce the witness to the alleged confession,where defense counsel never responded to the issue of the confession in any way,and where the court instruction failed utterly to remedy the enormous prejudice to the petitioner.

on october,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing in which it found trial counsel was ineffective,and conditionally granted petitioner a writ of habeas corpus on petitioner confrontation clause claim 
procedural default consideration on state collateral review 
on state collateral review,the michigan supreme court denied petitioner leave to appeal the trial court denial of his motion for relief from judgment on the ground that petitioner failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under d.people hicks.in so holding,the state court did not specify whether it was relying upon a particular subsection of d.before the district court,petitioner and respondent argued about whether the michigan supreme court denial rested upon an adequate and independent state procedural law and,in particular,about whether it relied upon subsection of d.d provides 
the court may not grant relief to the defendant if the motion alleges grounds for relief,other than jurisdictional defects,which could have been raised on appeal from the conviction and sentence or in a prior motion under this subchapter of relief,unless the defendant demonstrates a good cause for failure to raise such grounds on appeal or in the prior motion,and b actual prejudice from the alleged irregularities that support the claim for relief.
respondent argued that,in denying petitioner relief under d,the michigan supreme court implicitly relied upon subsection.respondent argued that subsection applied because,although petitioner had presented the factual predicate for his confrontation clause claim to the michigan courts on direct review by virtue of his prosecutorial misconduct claim,he had not presented the legal argument for that claim until state collateral review.petitioner concedes that he did not expressly present his confrontation clause claim on direct review.however,petitioner does argue that he fairly presented his confrontation clause claim to the michigan court of appeals on direct review based solely on his presentation of the factual predicate.accordingly,petitioner argues that there was no basis for procedural default under d.alternatively,petitioner argued that appellate counsel failure to raise the confrontation clause claim on direct review constituted ineffective assistance so as to excuse such default.in support,petitioner claimed that appellate counsel buried the confrontation clause issue,the most significant constitutional deprivation in th e case,in a prosecutorial misconduct claim,and that,to the extent that his confrontation clause claim is meritorious,such ineffective assistance sufficiently prejudiced him.respondent countered that petitioner appellate counsel did not render ineffective assistance by framing the underlying factual predicate as a prosecutorial misconduct normal and accepted legal than as a confrontation clause unusual and creative legal theory.petitioner also asserted that the michigan supreme court arbitrary and ambiguous form order denying him leave to appeal his motion for relief from judgment did not constitute an adequate state procedural ground.
the district court held that the michigan supreme court,in denying petitioner leave to appeal his motion for relief from judgment under d,relied upon subsection,not hicks straub,d.d provides 
the court may not grant relief to the defendant if the motion alleges grounds for relief which were decided against the defendant in a prior appeal or proceeding under this subchapter of relief,unless the defendant establishes that a retroactive change in the law has undermined the prior decision 
in so holding,the district court reasoned that,although p etitioner could have presented his confrontation clause claim in a clearer manner,he fairly presented it to the michigan state courts on direct review.id.at.the district court underscored that petitioner,in his brief to the michigan court of appeals,argued that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by relaying in his opening statement petitioner alleged confession to the murder and then subsequently failing,because of a lack of due diligence,to produce that inmate as a witness at trial.id.relying upon mcmeans brigano,cir,the district court concluded that the facts underlying the prosecutorial misconduct claim that petitioner presented in his state court briefs were well within the mainstream of constitutional law on the confrontation clause such that the michigan state courts should have recognized and addressed the confrontation clause issue.id.in further support,the district court posited that petitioner had expressly presented his confrontation clause claim,as such,on state collateral review,and that the michigan trial court,on such review,had agreed with the prosecutor that petitioner motion for relief from judgment only presented claims that he had previously presented to the state courts on direct review id.according to the district court,because petitioner fairly presented his confrontation clause claim to the michigan courts on direct review,the courts,not petitioner,bear the blame for their failure to recognize and to rule upon that claim.id.the district court found that the state courts failure to recognize and to address petitioner confrontation clause claim in denying petitioner relief on direct review constituted a constructive denial of that claim for purposes of d.id.at.after finding that the michigan supreme court denied petitioner leave to appeal under d,the court held that this state procedural law is inadequate to bar federal habeas review because it is simply a rule of res judicata barring a defendant from re litigating claims in a motion for relief from judgment which were decided adversely to him in a prior state court decision.id.thus,the district court found that petitioner had not procedurally defaulted his confrontation clause claim on state collateral review.id.
procedural default consideration on direct review 
before the district court,respondent argued that,to the extent petitioner fairly presented his confrontation clause claim to the state courts on direct review by virtue of presenting the factual basis underlying his prosecutorial misconduct claim,petitioner,nevertheless,procedurally defaulted that claim.as respondent pointed out,the michigan court of appeals,on direct review,found that petitioner had procedurally defaulted his prosecutorial misconduct claim by failing to object at trial to its underlying factual prosecutor opening statement relaying petitioner purported confession.respondent further argued that trial counsel failure to object to this alleged confrontation clause violation did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel so as to excuse any such default.respondent asserted that petitioner trial counsel chose not to object or move for a mistrial when the state failed to produce brand as a matter of trial strategy.specifically,respondent maintained that the failure of brand to appear was a fortunate turn of events because brand testimony would only have strengthened the prosecution case.moreover,according to respondent,had trial counsel objected and received a mistrial,there would have been the risk that the government,at the,would have been able to produce brand as a witness.
the district court held that,in case the michigan court of appeals,on direct review,found petitioner confrontation clause claim procedurally defaulted due to his trial counsel failure to object to that underlying violation at trial that failure constituted ineffective assistance and,thus,excused any such procedural default.after conducting an evidentiary hearing on the matter,the district court agreed with petitioner that trial counsel assistance was objectively unreasonable for the following reasons it should have been obvious to him that the prosecutor failure to produce brand at trial violated petitioner right to confrontation he had no strategic reason not to object to this confrontation clause violation his purported reason for failing to he did not want the prosecution to produce brand as a witness at any unreasonable and wholly unsupported by the record due to the availability of substantial impeachment material against brand and he did not even obtain an adequate curative instruction because the instruction that the trial court gave did not reference brand as the jail inmate to whom petitioner allegedly confessed.id.at.the district court found that,because the prosecutor unsupported opening statement violated petitioner right to confront the witnesses against him,trial counsel deficient representation sufficiently prejudiced petitioner.id.pursuant to d,the district court further found that the court adjudication denying petitioner claim on the merits constituted an unreasonable application of strickland washington,d,the pertinent,supreme court precedent.id.thus,the district court found the procedural default doctrine did not bar its review of petitioner confrontation clause claim on the merits.id.
adjudication on the merits 
relying upon harris stovall,cir,the district court held that,where,as here,the petitioner fairly presented his federal constitutional claim of a violation of the confrontation clause to the state courts on direct review,and those courts,in denying that claim,failed to address it,a federal court must conduct an independent review of that state court decision under d.id.at.the court reasoned that such a denial constituted an adjudication on the without any purposes of triggering d.id.
in reviewing petitioner confrontation clause claim,the district court found that the prosecutor opening statement relaying petitioner purported confession violated petitioner right to confrontation,and that this violation was not harmless error.id.at.the district court further found,pursuant to d,that the prior denial of petitioner confrontation clause claim on the merits was an unreasonable application of the pertinent,supreme court precedent.id.at see generally pointer texas,d,bruton united states,d,and frazier cupp,d.consequently,the district court conditionally granted petitioner application for a writ of habeas corpus under on his confrontation clause claim.id.at.
ii.analysis 
the provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,apply to petitioner habeas petition,which petitioner filed after the effective date of the act.in a habeas corpus proceeding,we review de novo a district court legal conclusions and its factual findings for clear error.lott coyle,cir.we review de novo a district court determinations regarding a habeas petitioner procedural default of any of his claims.id.we review de novo a district court determinations concerning a habeas petitioner claim,a mixed question of law and fact.id.
procedural default 
subject to two exceptions,b a prohibits a federal court from granting a n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a s tate court unless the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the s tate.c provides that an applicant has exhausted the remedies available in state courts only if he no longer has the right to raise the question presented by any available procedure under state law.the procedural default doctrine applies to bar a federal court review of a state prisoner federal claim where that prisoner failed to give the state courts a full and fair opportunity to resolve that the exhaustion doctrine the prisoner can not cure that failure because remedies are no longer available.see boerckel,d holding that the procedural default doctrine preserves the integrity of the exhaustion doctrine,which a prisoner could evade by letting the time run on state remedies coleman thompson,d holding that a habeas petitioner who has defaulted his federal claims in state court meets the technical requirements for exhaustion because there are no state remedies any longer available to him,and,thus,that the procedural default doctrine prevents a habeas petitioner from circumventing the policy underlying the exhaustion doctrine.
in deciding whether a petitioner procedurally defaulted a federal claim in state court,we must determine whether the petitioner failed to comply with an applicable state procedural rule the last state court rendering judgment on the claim at issue,in fact,enforced the applicable state procedural rule so as to bar that claim and the state procedural default is an adequate and independent state ground properly foreclosing federal habeas review of the petitioner federal claim at issue.seymour walker,citing maupin smith,cir simpson jones,cir.if,pursuant to these standards,a petitioner procedurally defaulted his federal claim in state court,the petitioner must demonstrate either cause for his failure to comply with the state procedural rule and actual prejudice flowing from the violation of federal law alleged in his claim,or that a lack of federal habeas review of the claim merits will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman,at.see murray carrier,d specifying that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result where a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.
direct review 
we find that,contrary to the district court conclusion,petitioner procedurally defaulted his confrontation clause claim by failing to fairly present it to the michigan courts on direct review a petitioner must fairly present to the state courts either the substance of or the substantial equivalent of the federal claim that he is presenting to a federal habeas court.a petitioner fairly presents a federal habeas claim to the state courts only if he asserted both the factual and legal basis for his claim.mcmeans,at.see also picard connor,d holding that petitioner challenge to the legality of the indictment was neither the substantial equivalent of nor entailed the same ultimate question for disposition as his equal protection claim even though it relied upon the same factual basis,and,thus,that the state courts had no sua sponte duty to consider whether that factual basis resulted in a equal protection violation.as this court has previously explained,the exhaustion doctrine requires the petitioner to present the same claim under the same theory to the state courts before raising it on federal habeas review.pillette foltz,cir.in determining whether a petitioner fairly presented a federal constitutional claim to the state courts,we consider whether the petitioner phrased the federal claim in terms of the pertinent constitutional law or in terms sufficiently particular to allege a denial of the specific constitutional right in question the petitioner relied upon federal cases employing the constitutional analysis in question the petitioner relied upon state cases employing the federal constitutional analysis in question or the petitioner alleged facts well within the mainstream of the pertinent constitutional law.mcmeans,at holding that g eneral allegations of the denial of rights to a fair trial and due process do not fairly present claims that specific constitutional rights were violated.however,a petitioner need not cite book and verse on the federal constitution.picard,at.quotation marks and citations omitted.
because his prosecutorial misconduct and confrontation clause claims rest upon the same factual predicate,petitioner,by presenting his prosecutorial misconduct claim on direct review,also presented the factual basis underlying his confrontation clause claim.thus,the issue is whether petitioner,on direct review,presented either the substance of or the substantial equivalent of the legal basis for his confrontation clause claim.we find that he did not.
petitioner referenced the underlying factual predicate neither in terms relating to legal precedent on the confrontation clause nor in terms of a specific violation of his right to confrontation.see newton million,cir holding that petitioner fairly presented his federal claim to the state courts where he phrased his claim in terms of the specific denial of a constitutional right to due process of law under the fifth and fourteenth alleged the underlying facts upon which that claim was based even though he cited no cases employing federal constitutional analysis.notably,petitioner never mentioned the terms confrontation or.rather,petitioner argued only that the prosecutor opening statement amounted to the argu ing facts not in evidence,and that this instance of prosecutorial misconduct violated his constitutional right to a fair trial.
in addressing the underlying factual foundation in his state court briefs,petitioner did not rely upon any federal legal precedent analyzing a claim under the confrontation clause,and only one case upon which he relied discussed the confrontation clause petitioner single reference to one case discussing the confrontation that case,unlike here,involved the admission into evidence of transcripts of the former witnesses incriminating insufficient to fairly present a confrontation clause claim based upon the prosecutor opening statement,which is not evidence.see mcmeans,at holding that,even though isolated state cases upon which petitioner relied contained a few brief references to the confrontation clause,petitioner had not fairly presented his confrontation clause claim to the state courts on direct review because,during that review process,petitioner focused entirely on the state rape shield law,failed to cite any federal precedent,and simply argued that the trial judge restriction of his denied him a fair trial and due process.
while the district court found that the factual predicate that petitioner presented on direct review fell well within the mainstream of confrontation clause precedent,we disagree.frazier cupp,d,best illustrates why we arrive at this conclusion.in frazier,the supreme court considered a habeas petitioner claim that the prosecutor conduct violated his right to confrontation.id.at.in that case,the prosecutor,during his opening statement,summarized the anticipated testimony of rawls,a witness who had pleaded guilty to the same offense for which the petitioner was being tried.id.at.the summary took only a few minutes to recite and was sandwiched between a summary of the petitioner own confession and a description of the circumstantial evidence that the s tate would introduce.id.thus,the prosecutor did not emphasize that summary in any particular way.id.although,a t one point,the prosecutor referred to a paper that he was holding in his hands to refresh his memory about something rawls had said,he did not explicitly tell the jury that this paper was rawls confession,nor did he purport to read directly from it.id.at.yet,the state conceded that the jury might fairly have believed that the prosecutor was referring to rawls statement.id.later,the prosecutor called rawls to the stand.id.however,the trial court soon dismissed rawls from the stand after rawls informed the court that he would invoke his privilege against as to every question concerning the events at issue.id.
relying upon bruton united states,d,and douglas alabama,d,in which the supreme court found confrontation clause violations,the petitioner in frazier argued before the supreme court that this series of events placed the substance of rawls statement before the jury in a way that may well have been the equivalent in the jury mind of testimony,and the statement added substantial,perhaps even critical,weight to the g overnment case in a form not subject to.id.internal citations omitted.however,the supreme court distinguished petitioner case from bruton as follows u nlike the situation in bruton,the jury was not being asked to perform the mental gymnastics of considering an incriminating statement against only one of two defendants in a joint trial.id.here,unlike bruton,but like frazier,the jury was not required,via the admission into evidence of a confession inculpating petitioner,to consider that incrimination against only that.
the frazier court also distinguished douglas as follows 
in douglas,the prosecutor called the defendant coconspirator to the stand and read his alleged confession to him the coconspirator was required to assert his privilege against repeatedly as the prosecutor asked him to confirm or deny each statement.the court found that this procedure placed powerfully incriminating evidence before the jury in a manner which effectively denied the right of.here,rawls was on the stand for a very short time and only a paraphrase of the statement was placed before the jury.this was done not during the trial,while the person making the statement was on the stand,but in an opening statement.in addition,the jury was told that the opening statement should not be considered as evidence.certainly the impact of the procedure used here was much less damaging than was the case in douglas.
id.at italics added.here,unlike in both douglas and frazier,the relevant witness,brand,was not a who had inculpated petitioner while confessing to the crime.in addition,unlike in both douglas and frazier,the prosecutor did not call brand to the stand,and,thus,did not,by his questions,read either brand entire preliminary examination testimony nor portions of it into the record.clearly then,unlike in douglas,brand did not give credence to those questions by consistently asserting his fifth amendment privilege.
the frazier court concluded that the limiting instruction that the jury was not to regard counsels statements as evidence was sufficient to protect the petitioner constitutional rights.id.at.noting that,while a more specific limiting instruction might have been desirable,none was requested.the court reasoned that it is not remarkable to assume that the jury will ordinarily be able to limit its consideration to the evidence introduced during trial.id.at.the court also emphasized,however,that,a t least where the anticipated,and unproduced,evidence is not touted to the jury as a crucial part of the prosecution case,it is hard to imagine that the minds of the jurors would be so influenced by such incidental statements during this long trial that they would not appraise the evidence objectively and dispassionately.id.citations omitted.the court held that nothing that occurred during the prosecution opening statement would warrant relief under the confrontation clause.id.at.also finding that the prosecutor good faith in expecting the witness to testify,while not controlling as to a deprivation of the petitioner right of confrontation,precludes any finding of prosecutorial misconduct.
here,as in frazier,the prosecutor neither emphasized his reference to petitioner alleged confession in any way nor touted that confession as a crucial part of its case to the jury.the opening statement reference to petitioner purported confession lasted less than a minute.the reference was sandwiched between summaries of the evidence that the government intended to produce,such as witnesses testimony identifying petitioner and showing that he knew the victim.moreover,unlike in frazier,the prosecutor did not appear to summarize brand preliminary examination testimony in his statement,but,rather,referred to the purported confession generally.while the supreme court cautioned in frazier that i t may be that some remarks included in an opening or closing statement could be so prejudicial that a finding of error,or even constitutional error,would be unavoidable,id.at,a comparison of the facts in this case to those in frazier reveal that this is not such a case.the facts of petitioner case here are even less damaging than those in frazier where the supreme court found no confrontation clause violation.thus,as frazier illustrates,the principle that petitioner claims his factual predicate invokes that a jury may not be told of a defendant confession during the prosecutor opening statement unless the witness to that alleged confession is subject to does not fall well within the mainstream of confrontation clause precedent.
petitioner contends that his prosecutorial misconduct claim necessarily encompassed the more serious confrontation clause violation.however,petitioner prosecutorial misconduct and confrontation clause claim involve distinct legal analyses.see frazier,at.holding that a prosecutor good or bad faith in expecting a witness to testify is not controlling in determining whether a defendant right of confrontation,was violated,but finding that,because of the prosecutor good faith there,no prosecutorial misconduct claim could lie.were we to hold that petitioner fairly presented his confrontation clause claim to the state courts on direct review,state courts would be compelled to consider sua sponte all possible federal legal claims that a petitioner factual allegations might arguably support.the principle of comity underlying the exhaustion doctrine does not permit us to force state courts to do so.
because petitioner did not fairly present his confrontation clause claim to the michigan courts on direct review,the state courts,on such review,could not have actually enforced any applicable state procedural rule against that claim.see seymour,at.we now turn to whether the state courts enforced such a rule against his confrontation clause claim on state collateral review.
state collateral review 
in a motion for relief from judgment under,petitioner submitted to the state trial court on collateral review his confrontation clause claim along with his claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel surrounding their failure to identify and to raise the confrontation clause issue,as such,at trial and on direct review,respectively.as discussed above,the state trial court denied petitioner motion for relief from judgment.people hicks,calhoun county circuit court march.both the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court denied petitioner leave to appeal the trial court denial of his motion for relief from judgment on the ground that petitioner failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under d.people hicks.
the district court held that petitioner failed to comply with only d based upon its previous finding that petitioner had fairly presented his confrontation clause claim to the state courts on direct review and,thus,that the state courts had decided that claim against petitioner.since we have concluded,as discussed above,that petitioner did not fairly present his confrontation clause claim to the state courts on direct review,we conclude that petitioner failed to comply with d when he did not raise his confrontation clause claim on direct review 
in denying petitioner leave to appeal his motion for relief from judgment under d,the michigan supreme court,the last state court rendering judgment on petitioner confrontation clause claim,actually enforced d against petitioner so as to bar its review of that claim.as simpson jones,cir,makes clear,the michigan supreme court general invocation of d in denying such leave constitutes an adequate,implicit invocation of the specific procedural bar of whichever subsection of d applies.see burroughs makowski,cir applying simpson.because d was both firmly established and regularly followed at the time of petitioner right to direct appeal,it constitutes an adequate and independent state procedural ground properly foreclosing federal habeas review of his confrontation clause claim.see friedman smith,cir finding that d,which the michigan legislature promulgated in,has been regularly followed since.we find,therefore,that petitioner procedurally defaulted his confrontation clause claim on state collateral review.
even though petitioner procedurally defaulted his confrontation clause claim in state court,he may,nevertheless,obtain federal habeas review of the claim if he demonstrates either cause for his failure to comply with the state procedural rule and actual prejudice flowing from the violation of federal law alleged in his claim,or that a lack of federal habeas review of the claim merits will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman,at.petitioner,pursuing the former route only,contends that his appellate counsel failure to raise his confrontation clause claim on direct review constituted ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment and,thus,serves as the requisite cause to excuse his procedural default under d.as to the prejudice component,petitioner contends that the confrontation clause violation alleged in his claim was meritorious and would have constituted reversible error.
attorney error that rises to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment may constitute cause for a procedural default.murray,at.to establish that counsel assistance was ineffective,the petitioner must demonstrate that counsel performance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and this deficient performance actually prejudiced him in that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel deficient performance,the proceeding result would have been different.strickland,at.
here,petitioner has failed to establish that his appellate counsel failure to raise a confrontation clause claim on direct review constituted ineffective assistance under strickland so as to serve as cause to excuse his procedural default of that claim.even assuming arguendo that appellate counsel failure to raise a confrontation clause claim on direct review was objectively unreasonable so as to constitute deficient performance petitioner has failed to demonstrate that this failure actually prejudiced him.appellate counsel failure to raise the confrontation clause claim on direct review could only have prejudiced petitioner if there were a reasonable probability that counsel pursuit of that claim would have resulted in a successful appeal.mcfarland yukins,cir see williams taylor,d holding that,where counsel ineffective assistance did not deprive the petitioner of any substantive or procedural right to which the law entitled him,the petitioner can not satisfy strickland prejudice component.
petitioner contends that there is a reasonable probability that,but for appellate counsel failure to raise a confrontation clause claim on direct review,that claim would have prevailed and resulted in a reversal of his conviction.in support,he relies upon frazier cupp,d,bruton united states,d,douglas alabama,d,and pointer texas,d holding that the admission into evidence at the petitioner trial of a witness preliminary examination testimony inculpating the petitioner violated his right of confrontation where that witness did not testify at trial and where the petitioner did not have a complete and adequate opportunity to that witness through counsel at the preliminary examination however,as discussed above,this case materially differs from bruton,douglas,and pointer.petitioner reliance on frazier is misplaced because the prosecutorial conduct in the present case is even less objectionable than in frazier.thus,petitioner has failed to demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that,but for appellate counsel failure to raise a confrontation clause claim on direct review,that claim would have prevailed and resulted in a reversal of his conviction.consequently,appellate counsel failure to raise a confrontation clause claim on direct review can not serve as cause for petitioner procedural default of that claim 
for the preceding reasons,we reverse the district court grant of a writ of habeas corpus to petitioner and remand to the district court with instruction to dismiss the petition for the writ.
