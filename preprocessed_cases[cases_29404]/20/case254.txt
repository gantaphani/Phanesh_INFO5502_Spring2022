in april,quester was indicted for federal crimes stemming from his alleged involvement in an armed car robbery in which one of the guards was killed.one of the charges permits the death penalty.see j.he asked that learned counsel be appointed pursuant to the statute specifies that two counsel,one of whom shall be learned in the law applicable to capital cases,must at the defendant request be appointed promptly.the district court declined the request,ruling that appointment of learned counsel should await a determination by the attorney general as to whether to seek the death penalty.
sought mandamus from this court to compel an immediate appointment of learned counsel.this panel determined that the question of whether such appointments may be deferred presented an issue of continuing importance justifying advisory mandamus.on the merits,we concluded that statutory language supported petitioner reading,noting that learned counsel could be useful in seeking to dissuade the attorney general from seeking the death penalty.accordingly,we granted the writ,ordering that l earned counsel shall be appointed forthwith.in re,cir.
following the grant of the writ,the district court appointed as learned counsel joseph laws,the federal public defender for the district of puerto rico,as well as a second lawyer as.this followed a determination by the district judge that laws personally would qualify as learned counsel because,other qualifications aside,he had recently served as in a death penalty case,albeit one that ended without a trial.throughout,laws has maintained that no one in his office had the necessary qualifications and,in addition,that this appointment would unduly strain the limited resources of his office 
following his appointment,laws filed a motion to enforce mandamus which is now before us.in this document,laws argues that he does not qualify as learned in the law applicable to capital cases under the statute and that his prior experience as in an untried capital case does not meet the requirement of the prior experience as defense counsel in a capital case prescribed by a local rule of the district court.local.laws urges that the district court designation of laws as learned counsel is merely ostensibl e,and that a further order should be issued to enforce the earlier writ.
what is perfectly clear is that the writ of mandamus previously issued by this court was concerned,simply and solely,with when learned counsel had to be appointed under the promptly language of the statute.true,our order said that learned counsel should be appointed forthwith,but an order is properly read in relation to the decision that supports it and t he reach of the mandate is generally limited to matters actually decided.wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure.questions as to who qualifies as learned counsel were not resolved in the proceeding leading up to the writ,and their resolution by the district court can not violate our prior order 
whether laws does qualify as learned counsel may well be open to debate.but unlike the meaning of the promptly requirement,the question as to the qualifications required of learned counsel is less than and the question whether an individual lawyer qualifies as learned counsel may depend on circumstances that vary markedly from case to case.the lack of a clear answer,and the likelihood that no simple rule will dictate answers in other cases,make this a less obvious case for mandamus.in re cargill,cir united states horn,cir.
nothing in this decision prevents the filing of a new mandamus petition to challenge laws designation as learned counsel.but such a petition would have to begin with a showing that this issue meets the ordinary qualifications for resolution by mandamus.certainly death penalty cases are different,but congress has not provided for automatic interlocutory appeals in disputes as to the appointment of counsel.
accordingly,the motion to enforce mandamus is dismissed without prejudice to the filing,if petitioner is so inclined,of a mandamus petition seeking to present the question of whether laws is qualified as learned counsel.
it is so ordered.
today the panel declines to enforce its mandamus ordering district court judge to appoint learned counsel pursuant to in the capital case of quester.the majority concludes that the district court did not violate our mandate,and,that even if the court appointment of joseph laws was erroneous,this case is nevertheless inappropriate for mandamus.i respectfully disagree.the district court is simply not in compliance with our mandate of october.therefore,mandamus is the proper tool to ensure compliance with our mandate.
the majority explains its hesitation to enforce its order in part by stating that the issue raised by the petition,namely,whether joseph laws can qualify as learned counsel,is less than,and concludes that because the instant petition unlike our original mandamus affords no obvious answer,this is a less obvious case for mandamus.op.at.the majority then cites two cases,in re cargill,cir,and united states horn,cir,which set a very high bar for issuance of the writ.id.
it is axiomatic that the remedy of mandamus is a drastic one and should be invoked only under extraordinary circumstances.kerr united states district court,d.that said,we issued our original mandate due to the extraordinary circumstances of a district court refusal to give timely effect to a capital defendant unambiguous statutory right to learned counsel.although i respect the majority desire to avoid issuing the writ lightly,i disagree with the burden the majority places on the instant petition.
the relevant question is not whether the petition presents a clear answer,or whether the issue raised in the instant petition would be better raised in a new mandamus petition rather the sole question is whether the district court is in compliance with our original mandate.
one of the less controversial functions of mandamus is to assure that a lower court complies with the spirit,as well as the letter of the mandate issued to that court by a higher court.in re continental illinois securities litigation,cir see also wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.enforcement of a mandate also may be accomplished by mandamus,and indeed this is one of the most nearly routine uses of this extraordinary writ.indeed,where a district court fails to comply with an order of a federal appellate court,the need for mandamus becomes more urgent and a court reluctance to issue the writ is proportionally diminished.see citibank,fullam,cir courts have uniformly granted such writs in one situation where the district court has failed to adhere to an order of the court of appeals.with respect,we need not consider whether the instant petition satisfies the requirements for mandamus articulated in cases such as cargill and horn,because those cases do not address the issue of mandamus in the context of compelling a lower court to comply with an appellate court mandate.because of the district court failure to adhere to our mandate,the standard for mandamus here is far less onerous if the district court has not heeded our mandate,the writ should issue.
the question then is whether the appointment of joseph attorney who has never actually tried a capital with our mandate that learned counsel be appointed forthwith.
the first time this case came before us,we issued a writ ordering judge to comply with the terms of because of a concern that the judge had adopted a policy of delaying the appointment of learned counsel until the department of justice notifies the court of its intent to seek the death penalty.in re,cir see also united states torres g√≥mez,d,delaying appointment of learned counsel and expressing frustration with expenses related to the appointment of learned counsel.our mandate was simple learned counsel shall be appointed forthwith.in re,at.although the district court actions compelled us to explicitly construe the term promptly,our failure to precisely spell out the meaning of each word of our mandate does not mean that those words did not constitute matters actually decided.op.at.the term learned was not inserted idly,or for rhetorical effect.when this court ordered the appointment of learned counsel,i thought it meant what it said that is,our mandate meant that the defendant had an immediate right of access to second counsel,and that at least one of his two attorneys should be skilled in the law applicable to death penalty cases.
even if our mandate simply ordered the immediate appointment of learned counsel without pausing to define the term learned,by consulting our opinion it should have been evident to the district court that we understood the term learned to mean skilled or practiced in the law applicable to capital cases.the issue was undoubtedly before the court briefs by the petitioner and amicus curiae stressed the level of expertise that learned counsel could be expected to bring to defense,and repeatedly emphasized that because there has never been a capital case tried to completion in this district,learned counsel with actual death penalty experience would need to be imported far more important is the fact that the text of our opinion clearly indicates that we considered the issue of what qualifies as learnedness under section.see united states cote,cir t he opinion delivered by the court at the time of rendering its decree may be consulted to ascertain what was intended by its mandate.quoting in re sanford fork tool.
first,our opinion made several references to our high expectations of learned counsel.we noted that the purpose of was that learned counsel special learning in the law applicable to capital cases is likely to be especially useful in making and supporting arguments about mitigating and aggravating factors made when the jury is determining the sentence.in re,at emphasis added.we noted that capital litigation was in many ways sui generis and listed by name several federal death penalty statutes about which counsel should be learned.specifically,we stated that learned counsel should be familiar with the complex death penalty procedure required by.additionally,we twice noted that learned counsel would provide expertise regarding issues involving mitigating and aggravating factors under,issues which would likely be missed by otherwise competent attorneys who lacked experience in death penalty cases.id.
second,a necessary implication of our opinion is that learned signifies a substantial amount of experience in capital litigation.we stated that the term promptly could not be defined except as it refers to the event which was to promptly occur,namely,appointment of an attorney with experience in capital cases.as we stated the term promptly is not if there were no purpose served by appointing learned counsel one could argue that the appointment should be made promptly when it mattered and not before.id.at emphasis added.that statement is an explicit finding that in order to define the term promptly it was necessary to recognize the statutory purpose for requiring the appointment of learned counsel.since the purpose served by appointing learned counsel is to provide capital defendants in federal court with an attorney experienced in death penalty law,the statute purpose was undeniably a matter actually decided by this court.see eichman fotomat,cir noting that the mandate doctrine encompasses a court explicit decisions as well as those issues decided by necessary implication.
now,the petitioner challenges that the district court actions contradict the purpose of.if the issues of timing and purpose were so intertwined at the time of our opinion that neither in its own right was self defining,i fail to understand the majority present contention that we never considered this issue.in addition to our express acknowledgment that the timing question in was inseparably linked to the statute purpose,the quotations cited above provide ample evidence that the purpose of appointing learned counsel was an issue we actually decided.id.
finally,to construe learned in the law applicable to capital cases in a manner that does not entail actual experience in a capital trial or appeal divests the terms learned and applicable to capital cases of any tangible meaning.such an interpretation could not possibly have been our intent.congress plainly had more than this in mind when it amended to require counsel to be learned in the law applicable to capital cases.its insertion of the phrase applicable to capital cases referenced in our opinion was manifestly intended to require that learned counsel have expertise relevant to capital litigation,and not merely to the practice of criminal law generally.see united states mccullah,cir finding that the amendment to did not merely clarify the law but rather substantively changed it,creating a new requirement which previously had not existed.at a minimum,learned counsel should possess distinguished prior experience in the trial,appeal,or review of federal death penalty cases.united states miranda,d,quotation omitted 
in the instant petition,the appointed learned counsel,joseph laws,argues that because he has no experience trying capital cases,he can not qualify as learned counsel under the statute.further,laws avers that by circumventing the purpose of our mandamus,namely,the timely appointment of counsel with death penalty experience,the district judge has not complied with our order that learned counsel shall be appointed forthwith.in re quester,at.
i agree.although the district court has purported to comply with our order by indeed appointing counsel forthwith,joseph laws is not learned under any sound interpretation of our order,of section,or of any other relevant learned counsel provision.the unique skills identified in our opinion are not the kind one might gain in the ordinary practice of federal criminal defense.as an american bar association study explained,the complex death penalty procedures articulated by,et,require that counsel be knowledgeable about a complex body of constitutional law and unusual procedures that do not apply in other criminal cases.american bar association,toward a more just and effective system of review in state death penalty cases,am.such complexities are often missed by lawyers lacking considerable experience litigating capital cases.as a report from the judicial conference of the united states noted,even seasoned federal criminal lawyers who lacked death penalty experience miss important issues.subcommittee on federal death penalty cases,committee on defender services,judicial conference of the united states,federal death penalty cases recommendations concerning the cost and quality of defense representation,at.may hereinafter spencer report.
in sum,the multiple committees which have looked at this issue have concluded that learned counsel should have distinguished prior experience in the trial,appeal,or post conviction review of federal death penalty cases.guide to judiciary policies and procedures,vol.vii ch.vi,b emphasis added spencer report at ii.because neither laws nor anyone in his office has ever tried a death penalty case to completion,there is no basis for deviating from these recommendations in this case.
laws motion is not a new petition,and it does not raise a new issue we are asked only to enforce our own order regarding actions by the judge to whom the order was directed.we are in a position to decide this matter because we can accept the facts stated in the district court opinion as true,and all that remains is an issue of law,namely,whether joseph laws can qualify as learned counsel.although i believe that laws is a skilled and accomplished federal public defender,his current experience does not permit him to qualify as learned counsel in this or any other capital case.therefore,i conclude that despite his appointment,the district court is not in compliance with our mandate.
it is both appropriate and routine for a court of appeals to issue mandamus where a district court fails to comply with the spirit as well as the letter of the mandate issued by a higher court.continental illinois,at.where our orders are issued to protect the rights of a defendant in a capital trial,we should be especially vigilant in seeing that they are followed.i res
