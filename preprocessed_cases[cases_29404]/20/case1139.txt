kenneth parr appeals from the district court denial of habeas relief and he also requests a certificate of appealability coa from this court.parr was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of linda malek.parr petitioned for federal habeas relief challenging his conviction and sentence.the district court denied parr request for habeas relief,but granted a coa on seventeen issues.parr requests a coa on one issue not raised before the district court.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court denial of habeas relief and deny parr request for a coa.
factual and procedural background 
on january,linda malek died as a result of gunshot wounds to the head.around two that morning,malek mother,charlotte brown,and her stepfather,mike brown,received a call from malek daughter,ashley,informing them that two men had broken into their home and shot malek.the browns drove to malek home and discovered that several items were missing including,inter alia,a television,a vcr,a video game console,jewelry,and malek car keys.malek daughter and son,zachary,were both present when their mother was killed.according to ashley,the two men ordered malek and her children to lie face down on the floor.malek was crying and begged them not to shoot her.the evidence indicated that malek was sexually assaulted.
evidence presented at trial revealed that the morning of the murder parr girlfriend,monica silva,returned to her apartment and found parr and his brother,michael jimenez,there jimenez was holding a jewelry box.parr told silva that he had gone somewhere with a gun and committed burglary.parr then packed up most of his belongings and silva took him to his mother house.parr later informed silva that he had hidden some items in the vent at her apartment.when silva returned home,she found a vcr,a video game console,a gun,and a jewelry box.while silva was taking out her trash,the bag fell open and a purse that contained malek driver license fell out.
a resident of silva apartment complex testified that she heard two gunshots on the night of the murder.twenty minutes later,she heard two men arguing outside her window and when she looked outside her window she saw two young men who appeared to be latino or.both men were carrying a television.another resident of the apartment complex also testified that she saw and heard two young men talking and recognized the men as kenneth parr and michael jimenez.
in may,parr was convicted of one count of capital murder for the murder of linda malek and was sentenced to death.the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence.parr state.march,unpublished opinion.during the pendency of his direct appeal,parr filed an application for habeas relief in state court the texas court of criminal appeals denied his application.ex parte parr.november,unpublished order.parr filed a petition for habeas relief in the federal district court on january.
parr asserted separate grounds for review,which the district court then combined into seventeen claims.the court granted summary judgment to the state on each of the seventeen grounds,but granted parr a coa as to each ground as well.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment in a habeas proceeding de novo.ogan cockrell,cir.we review a district court findings of fact for clear error and issues of law de novo.collier cockrell,cir.parr petition for habeas relief was filed after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa accordingly,his petition is governed by the procedures and standards imposed by aedpa.summers dretke,cir.
under aedpa,a federal court may not issue a writ of habeas corpus for a defendant convicted in state court unless the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d riddle cockrell,cir.a state court decision will be contrary to clearly established federal law when it reaches a legal conclusion in direct opposition to a prior decision of the supreme court or when it reaches a different conclusion than the supreme court on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.kutzner johnson,cir.a state court decision will be based on an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law when it is objectively unreasonable.id.
iii.discussion 
the district court granted parr request for a coa on seventeen issues.due to the large number of issues,we first address those claims that are procedurally barred or abandoned.
parr argues that his conviction was not based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt and that he is actually innocent.the district court concluded that both of these claims are procedurally barred.a fundamental prerequisite to federal habeas relief is the exhaustion of all claims in state court prior to requesting federal collateral relief.smith dretke,cir citing rose lundy,d.the exhaustion requirement is satisfied when the substance of the federal habeas claim has been fairly presented to the highest state court.id.citing picard connor,d.additionally,the supreme court has held that a claim of actual innocence is not itself a constitutional claim,but instead a gateway through which a habeas petitioner must pass to have his otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on the merits.herrera collins,d.accordingly,parr must first raise a substantial doubt about his guilt,which would then cause us to examine any barred constitutional claims.dowthitt johnson,cir.
parr arguments in support of his innocence are that there were no eyewitnesses placing him at the scene,there was no evidence showing when dna evidence was placed on malek body,and the bruises on malek arms and face occurred twelve to eighteen hours before her death all of the facts to which parr points were available for the jury to consider.additionally,the jury could convict parr of capital murder either as a principal,or as an accomplice,based on the commission of murder in the course of either burglary,or aggravated sexual assault.viewing the facts in a light most favorable to the prosecution,we conclude a reasonable juror could have reached the conclusion that parr committed rape burglary,and murder.see neville dretke,cir.therefore,parr has not raised a substantial doubt about his guilt.parr concedes that he did not present these claims to the state court on direct appeal or in state habeas proceedings accordingly,the district court correctly concluded that these claims are procedurally barred.
parr also argues that the admission of hearsay statements made by michael jimenez to maria cervantes violated the confrontation clause.parr did not object to the admission of these statements on confrontation clause grounds during the trial.on direct appeal,parr argued that admission of jimenez statement violated the confrontation clause,but the state court determined that parr failed to preserve any constitutional error.this circuit has held that the texas contemporaneous objection rule is strictly or regularly applied evenhandedly to the vast majority of similar claims,and is therefore an adequate procedural bar.dowthitt,at quoting corwin johnson,cir.we are precluded from granting habeas relief where the last state court to consider the claim expressly and unambiguously based its denial of relief on an independent and adequate procedural ground.cotton cockrell,cir.parr also failed to present his confrontation clause claim to the state habeas court.thus,the district court correctly held that these claims are procedurally barred 
parr asserts that the trial court erred in denying his batson challenge to the state peremptory challenge of venire member monique gadson in admitting a letter allegedly written by parr and sent to monica silva in admitting pictures of a pair of tennis shoes found at parr mother house in denying parr motion to suppress evidence seized from the apartment that he shared with silva in denying parr request for a jury instruction on accomplice witness testimony during the phase of the trial and in admitting hearsay statements made by malek children to their grandmother in violation of the confrontation clause.parr failed to address these arguments in his brief to this court,but instead refers us to the arguments set forth in his petition before the district court.by failing to argue these issues in the body of his brief,parr has abandoned them.fed.a yohey collins,cir.nevertheless,we have considered each of these claims and conclude that the state court rejection of these claims was not unreasonable and the district court correctly denied relief.
we turn now to the eight remaining claims on which the district court granted a coa.
parr argues that his conviction was obtained in violation of the fifth amendment under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.parr was on parole from the texas youth commission tyc at the time of the murder.after the murder,the state attempted to revoke parr parole based on his participation in the theft of malek television however,at the revocation hearing,the examiner concluded there was insufficient evidence to prove that parr was involved.parr argues that the doctrine of collateral estoppel prevented the state from using the burglary as a predicate felony for the capital murder conviction.parr contends that collateral estoppel is a constitutional bar to prosecution independent of the double jeopardy clause.we disagree.we have held that the double jeopardy clause does not extend to parole revocation proceedings.united states whitney.further,we have previously rejected attempts to erect a due process basis,independent of the double jeopardy clause,for the application of collateral estoppel.showery samaniego,cir.accordingly i f parr collateral estoppel claim is simply an effort to state a double jeopardy clause claim,it fails if it is an effort to state an independent violation of the fourteenth amendment due process clause,it also fails.stringer williams,cir.the district court correctly denied relief on this ground.
parr contends that the state failed to disclose information in violation of brady maryland,d.specifically,parr alleges that the prosecution failed to disclose the following a handwritten note of one of the prosecutors,police coercion of a witness for the prosecution,and a close relationship between the prosecution and parr parole officer.
under brady,the prosecution has an affirmative duty to disclose evidence that is favorable to the accused and material to the guilt of the defendant however,the prosecution is not required to disclose evidence that could be discovered by exercising due diligence.rector johnson,cir.to state a brady claim,parr must demonstrate the prosecution suppressed evidence,the evidence was favorable,the evidence was material to either guilt or punishment,and failure to discover the allegedly favorable evidence was not the result of a lack of due diligence.id.at.
parr contends that one of the prosecutor hand written notes regarding a witness testimony contradicts witness trial testimony.caron holt testified for the prosecution regarding parr conduct while at the tyc.parr contends that the prosecution had handwritten notes indicating that holt stated parr was not involved in serious assaults however,at trial,holt testified that the assault was one of the worst he had ever seen.the prosecutor handwritten note reads,movements loosey,goosey defendant did not do serious assaults.during the state habeas proceedings,the prosecutor explained that she made the note during the punishment phase of trial in response to the testimony of floyd jennings,a defense witness.jennings testified,based on his review of the tyc records,that parr was not involved in any serious altercations.
the state habeas court concluded that the notes were intended to remind the prosecutor to elicit testimony from the prosecution witness to rebut the defense witness testimony and that the statement defendant did not do serious assaults was attributable to the defense witness,jennings,not holt.the state habeas court factual determinations are entitled to a presumption of correctness and parr has not attempted to rebut that presumption.e bridgers dretke,cir.the state habeas court also concluded that evidence was immaterial.contrary to parr assertions,the state court conclusion on materiality is a mixed question of law and fact,trevino johnson,cir accordingly,we can not grant relief unless the court conclusion was contrary to or an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent,d moore cockrell,cir.the state court conclusion is not an unreasonable application of brady therefore,the district court did not err in denying relief on this claim.
parr also contends that the police coerced his mother into making a second statement that was more damaging to the defense.according to parr,in her second statement,his mother,mary saldierna,minimized evidence that parr was intoxicated and stated that parr told her that he shot a woman.at trial,saldierna attributed the differences between her statements to her bad memory however,at the state habeas proceedings,saldierna averred that the police threatened her and offered her immunity if she changed her statement.
the state habeas court concluded that saldierna was not coerced and that her affidavit testimony to the contrary was neither credible nor reliable.parr has made no attempt to rebut the presumption of correctness.see summers dretke,cir.we understand parr argument to be that the prosecution was aware of this coercion and failed to inform him or his counsel however,parr had an opportunity to saldierna on the two statements at trial and she denied any accusation that the police had pressured her.the state habeas court conclusion that parr did not establish a brady violation was not unreasonable.consequently,the district court correctly denied relief on this claim.
finally,parr argues that the prosecution provided his parole officer with evidence and exerted influence over the scheduling of his parole revocation proceedings and failed to disclose this relationship.during state habeas proceedings,both parr parole officer and a tyc representative testified that the prosecution did provide them with evidence,but the prosecution never controlled the timing of the revocation proceedings.the state habeas court concluded that the prosecution did not significantly participate in the parole revocation proceedings.parr has not attempted to rebut the presumption of correctness.e.moreover,parr does not explain how this information would have impacted his case as discussed above,collateral estoppel does not apply to parole proceedings.e vidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.rector johnson,cir alteration in original quoting united states bagley,d.accordingly,he has failed to establish a brady violation and the district court correctly denied relief on this ground.
parr makes the following allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel failure to object and argue that the proceedings were barred under the doctrine of collateral estoppel failure to interview jurors after the trial to determine whether there was any misconduct and failure to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence during the punishment phase 
under strickland washington,d,parr must not only demonstrate that his counsel performance was deficient,that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment,but also that the deficient performance prejudiced him,that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.bigby dretke,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting strickland,at.
as explained above,there is no merit to parr argument that his prosecution was barred by collateral estoppel accordingly,counsel was not deficient in failing to present the argument.see united states kimler,cir an attorney failure to raise a meritless argument thus can not form the basis of a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the result of the proceeding would not have been different had the attorney raised the issue.
parr also contends that counsel was deficient for failing to investigate jury misconduct however,as discussed below,the jury discussion of parole did not prevent the jury from being impartial and the evidence upon which parr relies is inadmissible.de la rosa texas,cir under texas law,not every mention of parole during jury deliberations calls for reversal.only jury misconduct that deprives the defendant of a fair and impartial trial warrants granting of a new trial.citation omitted.accordingly,parr counsel was not deficient in failing to investigate this claim.
finally,parr argues that his trial counsel presentation of mitigating evidence was deficient.parr specifically points to trial counsel failure to obtain records from child protective services cps,despite knowing that parr had been removed from his mother custody.these records indicate that parr was removed from his mother custody for approximately two years because he and his siblings were frequently left at home unsupervised.the records also indicate that cps received numerous complaints regarding lack of supervision and physical abuse by his mother boyfriends.a psychologist evaluation described parr as a sad child who was acting out because he did not have consistent rules and who longed to be reunited with his mother and siblings.
parr also submitted affidavits from several witnesses in support of his claim that trial counsel failed to present adequate mitigating evidence.the affidavits indicate that parr had a difficult childhood during which he and his family moved around frequently,his mother was seldom at home,and he and his brothers often stole things.the state habeas court concluded that the affidavits submitted by parr in support of this of saldierna,carol parr,alanta williams,jessie parr,and merian neither credible nor reliable.
following oral argument in this case,we granted parr motion to supplement the record with documents his counsel discovered while preparing for oral argument.parr submitted psychological evaluations from and stating that parr was emotionally disturbed and severely depressed.specifically,he produced the following a psychoeducational evaluation from matagorda county educational services dated march,indicating that parr was eligible for special education services as learning disabled notes from the apple groverton isd wilderness school from october,showing that parr satisfied the criteria for emotionally disturbed and records from the hope wilderness schools county resource education coop dated october,classifying parr emotional disturbance as depressive disorder gos a severe.
it is debatable whether parr counsel was deficient for failing to locate and introduce the records from child protective services as well as the psychological evaluations.nevertheless,parr has not shown a reasonable probability that but for trial counsel performance,the outcome would have been different.ransom johnson,cir wiggins smith,d holding that counsel failure to investigate and present evidence that the petitioner suffered physical torment,sexual molestation,and repeated rape during his subsequent years in foster care was unreasonable and prejudiced the petitioner.parr has not show n that his proposed mitigating evidence of a troubled family life raises more than a mere possibility of a different outcome,and not the required reasonable probability.lamb johnson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
during the punishment phase of trial,floyd jennings,a clinical psychologist,testified that parr did not have stable parenting,that he was exposed to criminal activity and substance abuse by family members,that he was sexually abused,and that he had no opportunity to learn responsibility.parr counsel also called one of parr former teachers who testified that parr did not exhibit behavioral problems in her class.
the defense also called parr mother,saldierna,who testified about her relationship with parr father.she stated that parr father lived with saldierna sporadically,and that the family moved around a lot when parr was young.she also testified that parr has two brothers,in addition to jimenez,that are also incarcerated.she further testified that her husband hit her and that sometimes her children had to protect her.she stated that parr was in foster care while she was incarcerated for two years and that parr had done well while in foster care.she also testified that parr father passed away while she was in prison and that parr became detached after his father death.
additionally,though perhaps not as effectively as it might have been,the jury did hear evidence regarding parr unstable childhood from both jennings and saldierna.further,the state case on punishment was strong.in addition to the facts of the crime,the state presented evidence of parr prior convictions for burglary and assault,maria cervantes testified that jimenez told her that he and parr shot malek in the back of the head twice and planned to kill the children but the gun messed up,and parr parole officer testified that parr was on parole from the texas youth commission when this crime was committed.the district court correctly concluded that parr could not show prejudice and thus,was not entitled to relief on this ground.
parr contends that his sixth and fourteenth amendment rights were violated when the jury considered evidence regarding parole during their deliberations.parr submits evidence that the jury considered whether he might be paroled much earlier and contends that the jury consideration of this information violated his sixth amendment right to a fair trial.parr counsel during state proceedings,gary taylor,hired a private investigator to interview the jurors who heard parr case.according to the private investigator affidavit,the statements of five jurors indicate that the jury was initially split,with the majority in favor of imposing the death penalty.several jurors believed that parr might be paroled after a short period of time and were concerned that parr would be dangerous if he were released on parole.
the state habeas court refused to consider this evidence concluding that texas rule of evidence b prohibited the court from considering juror testimony except to show an improper outside influence.parr contends that the state court failure to consider evidence that the jury considered erroneous information about parole law violated his right to a fair trial.we disagree.
although texas law did not permit the jury to consider the issue of parole,see smith state,the discussion does not require reversal unless it deprived parr of a fair trial,de la rosa,at.the state habeas court concluded that no discussion of parole by the jury prevented it from being impartial.parr has not explained how the discussion affected the jury impartiality except to assert that an instruction that he would be ineligible for parole for forty years might have resulted in a life sentence rather than the death penalty.
no clearly established supreme court authority holds that a defendant is entitled to a new trial when one juror misstates the law of parole to other jurors during deliberations,nor does any supreme court precedent obligate a state court to admit testimony from jurors concerning their internal discussions about parole law during deliberations.in fact,the existing clearly established supreme court case law suggests the opposite.
salazar dretke,cir footnote omitted.accordingly,the decision not to consider the juror interviews was neither objectively unreasonable nor contrary to clearly established federal law.the district court correctly denied relief on this claim.
parr also contends that the trial court failure to instruct the jury that he would have to serve forty years before he would be eligible for parole and its refusal to allow counsel to question the venire members on the meaning of a life sentence under texas law violated his fourteenth amendment rights.in simmons south carolina,d,the supreme court held that where the only alternative sentence to death is life
