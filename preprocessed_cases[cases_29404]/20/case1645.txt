petitioner charmel allen,a michigan state prisoner,appeals from the district court dismissal of her petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court concluded that allen petition was barred by the statute of limitations imposed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.allen contends that the district court erred in dismissing her petition.she first argues that her motion for state postconviction relief,which claimed that her counsel on direct appeal had been constitutionally ineffective,should be considered part of the direct appeals process,thus delaying the start of aedpa statute of limitations.alternatively,allen argues that even if her petition was untimely,the delay should be excused either because she is entitled to equitable tolling or because she is actually innocent of the crime for which she was convicted.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
a jury convicted allen of both felony murder and assault with the intent to commit murder on the basis of an incident that occurred in september of.the michigan court of appeals provided the following summary of the facts underlying allen conviction 
defendant lived in an apartment across the hall from brian carson and larry wallace,who were roommates.at trial,it was revealed that on the date in question,defendant could not account for approximately of her money.testimony revealed that this money was derived from the illegal drug trade.the prosecution theorized that defendant was fearful of the probable consequences of her inability to locate the missing funds and,thus,desperately plotted to recoup them.hence,on the night in question,defendant,accompanied by anastasia allen,the defendant sister and ronald light,forcibly entered carson and wallace apartment and asked for possessed a firearm.a struggle ensued.wallace died as a result of being shot at close range,and carson was severely wounded.
the michigan court of appeals vacated allen conviction for felony murder in may of,but affirmed her conviction for assault with the intent to commit murder.both the prosecution application for leave to appeal and allen application for leave to were subsequently denied by the michigan supreme court.
on remand to the trial court,allen pleaded nolo contendere to a charge of manslaughter.the michigan court of appeals affirmed her manslaughter conviction and sentence on september.allen did not seek leave to appeal this decision to the michigan supreme court.
she later filed a motion for relief from judgment in the trial court on september,seeking resentencing on the assault charge.the trial court denied allen motion.she then filed a delayed application for leave to appeal,which was denied by both the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court.the michigan supreme court denied allen motion for reconsideration on october.
allen filed her petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court almost a year later,on october.the petition challenges the constitutionality of her conviction and sentence on the assault charge.she does not,however,challenge the constitutionality of either the subsequent plea of nolo contendere to the manslaughter charge or the resulting sentence.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
this case is governed by aedpa,codified principally at d,because allen filed her habeas petition in october of,well after aedpa effective date of april.see lindh murphy,d.under aedpa,factual findings made by a state court are presumed correct unless the petitioner rebuts the presumption with clear and convincing evidence.e.we review the district court decision to deny a writ of habeas corpus de novo.gonzales elo,cir.
does a state postconviction motion claiming ineffective assistance of appellate counsel restart aedpa statute of limitations 
aedpa imposes a statute of limitations for habeas petitions that challenge judgments.the relevant section provides as follows 
a statute of limitations shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.the limitation period shall run from the latest of 
a the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of time for seeking such review 
d.aedpa further provides,however,that the statute of limitations is tolled for t he time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending d.
when did direct review of allen assault conviction conclude 
the timeliness of allen petition turns on when the judgment in her state case became final,thereby starting aedpa limitations period.according to the district court,the triggering event occurred when the michigan court of appeals affirmed allen manslaughter conviction and sentence on september.the district court reasoned that allen conviction became final days later,on november,when her time to appeal to the michigan supreme court expired.see michigan court rule c.
although allen brief is not clear on this point,she appears to argue that her conviction was actually final much earlier,on october,when the michigan supreme court denied her application for leave to the court of appeals decision affirming her assault conviction.she argues for this earlier date in the apparent belief that it bolsters her contention that equitable tolling should be applied.see part.below.because allen conviction,under this theory,would have been final prior to the enactment of aedpa,allen time to file her habeas petition would have expired on april.see austin mitchell,cir holding that petitioners whose convictions became final before the enactment of aedpa had a grace period after aedpa effective date to file their federal habeas petitions.allen,however,did not file her habeas petition until october,approximately four years and six months later.
we do not have to decide,however,whether the district court was correct in concluding that allen conviction did not become final until november.even giving allen the benefit of that later date,her petition was still untimely.
if allen conviction became final on november,then aedpa statute of limitations would have begun running the next day,november.see.in computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules,by the local rules of any district court,by order of court,or by any applicable statute,the day of the act,event,or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included.the statutory period would then have been tolled from the date that allen filed her motion for relief from judgment,september.see d.at that time,days would have remained of the limitations period.
the state postconviction review process continued until october,when the michigan supreme court denied allen motion for reconsideration.see carey saffold,d concluding that an application for state postconviction relief is pending,and the federal statute of limitations is therefore tolled,as long as the ordinary state collateral review process is in continuance.after allen motion was denied,the statute of limitations would have continued to be tolled during the days in which allen could have sought a writ of certiorari from the united states supreme court.see abela martin,cir en banc.that period would have expired on january,causing the federal statute of limitations to resume running the next day,on january.with days remaining in the statutory period,allen would have had until march,to file her habeas petition in the district court.but allen did not file her habeas petition until october,approximately seven months later.
thus,whether the process concluded when the michigan court of appeals affirmed allen assault conviction,or when that court subsequently affirmed her manslaughter conviction,the result is the same allen petition was untimely.we therefore will assume without deciding that the district court analysis was correct,and that allen conviction became final on november.
does a state postconviction motion claiming ineffective assistance of appellate counsel restart the limitations period 
in an attempt to demonstrate that her petition was in fact timely,allen argues that a state postconviction motion claiming ineffective assistance of appellate counsel should be considered part of the state process.under this theory,allen habeas petition would have been timely because the state courts did not finally dispose of her postconviction motion,which claimed ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,until october,less than one year before allen filed her habeas petition in federal court.allen relies on this court decision in payton brigano,cir,in which this court observed in a footnote that,under ohio law,a state postconviction motion claiming ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is considered part of the state process.id.at.
the argument she raises,however,was rejected in mcclendon sherman,cir,where the petitioner was a michigan state prisoner,as is allen.in mcclendon,this court stated we reject mcclendon contention that whenever a prisoner raises an allegation in his state proceedings that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel on direct appeal,his conviction does not become final until those state proceedings have ended.id.at.the mcclendon court emphasized that,even in the unique context of ohio law,upon the filing of an ineffective assistance claim in state court,the statute of limitations is not restarted,but merely tolled.id.at.
mcclendon clearly holds that a state petition for postconviction review claiming ineffective assistance of appellate counsel tolls,but does not restart,aedpa statute of limitations.allen therefore filed her habeas petition seven months late,unless she is entitled to the equitable tolling of aedpa statutory period.
is allen entitled to the equitable tolling of aedpa statute of limitations 
because aedpa statute of limitations is not jurisdictional,a petitioner who misses the deadline may still maintain a viable habeas action if the court decides that equitable tolling is appropriate.dunlap united states,cir,cert.denied,d.the petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that he or she is entitled to equitable tolling.mcclendon,at.in a case like the present one,where the facts are undisputed and the district court decides as a matter of law that equitable tolling does not apply,this court reviews the district court decision de novo.dunlap,at.
a court must consider the following factors in deciding whether equitable tolling should apply 
the petitioner lack of notice of the filing requirement the petitioner lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirement diligence in pursuing one rights absence of prejudice to the respondent and the petitioner reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the legal requirement for filing his claim.
id.at.this list of factors is not necessarily comprehensive,and not all factors are relevant in all cases.vroman brigano,cir.this court has also emphasized that a bsence of prejudice is a factor to be considered only after a factor that might justify tolling is identified.id.
allen lack of actual or constructive knowledge of the filing requirement 
allen first contends that she is entitled to equitable tolling because she lacked actual or constructive knowledge of the filing requirement.this court considered a similar situation in mcclendon,where the petitioner conviction became final in august of,before the enactment of aedpa on april.at.but mcclendon did not file his habeas petition until november of,eleven months after this court decision in austin mitchell,cir.mcclendon,at.the austin court held that petitioners whose convictions became final before the enactment of aedpa had until april,to file their habeas petitions.this court in mcclendon concluded that the decision in austin informed mcclendon that the time for filing his habeas petition had lapsed,and that mcclendon had shown a lack of diligence by waiting eleven months after austin was decided before filing his habeas petition.id.at.mcclendon,in other words,had constructive knowledge of the filing requirement through a published opinion of this court.
as discussed above,allen conviction became final either prior to the enactment of aedpa or,as the district court concluded,on november,more than a year after aedpa effective date.allen had notice of aedpa statute of limitations either way.if her conviction became final prior to the enactment of aedpa,then she was on notice of the limitations period when this court decided austin.but allen contends that austin provided insufficient notice because it was not decided until and therefore did absolutely nothing for inmates such as petitioner,because they could do nothing retroactively to file or toll the running of the statute.to the contrary,a reasonably diligent effort to file within a reasonably quick time after austin was decided might have entitled allen to equitable tolling,despite the fact that the statutory period would already have lapsed.mcclendon,at.
even assuming that allen conviction did not become final until november,as held by the district court,she still had notice of the limitations period.the aedpa statute plainly states that the statute of limitations runs from the conclusion of direct review and that the statutory period is tolled during the time when a motion for state postconviction review is pending.d.these statutory provisions clearly explained to allen how aedpa statute of limitations would apply to her case.notice by means of a statute,moreover,is certainly as adequate as notice through a published court opinion.
allen,however,contends that confusion existed about the application of aedpa statutory period.according to allen,
i n light of the fact that the court sic were having difficulty in interpreting and applying the statute of limitations for inmates whose convictions occurred before the enactment of aedpa,it can hardly be said that inmates themselves should have known how the statute would operate.
but the district court explained the flaw in allen argument as follows 
the law was somewhat unsettled as to petitioners whose convictions became final before the effective date of aedpa.this court is not aware,however,of the law being unsettled regarding when the one year statute of limitations would begin running for petitioners such as allen,whose convictions became final after the effective date of aedpa.
because of this court decision in austin and aedpa clear provisions regarding the statute of limitations,allen can not claim a lack of constructive knowledge regarding the filing deadline.even if allen lacked actual knowledge of the relevant provisions of aedpa,this court has repeatedly held that ignorance of the law alone is not sufficient to warrant equitable tolling.rose dole,cir.we therefore conclude that allen purported lack of actual or constructive knowledge does not make equitable tolling appropriate.
allen lack of diligence in pursuing her rights 
allen next contends that equitable tolling is appropriate because she was diligent in pursuing her rights.using the district court analysis of the date on which allen conviction became final,however,she filed her habeas petition approximately seven months late.under the alternative analysis,her petition would have been filed approximately four years and six months late.even giving allen the benefit of the shorter period,she still has offered no adequate reason for the delay.
allen contends,however,that one reason for her delay is that she received mistaken advice contained in two letters written to her by her attorney.the first is dated september,when the cases of allen codefendants were still pending in the michigan supreme court.allen case had returned to the trial court,where she eventually pled nolo contendere to a charge of manslaughter.in the first letter,the lawyer advised allen to wait and see how the supreme court decided her codefendants cases before she decided whether to appeal a pretrial order in her remanded proceeding.
assuming,once again,that allen conviction was not final until soon after the michigan court of appeals affirmed her manslaughter conviction and sentence,the attorney advice to allen in the first letter is not relevant to allen delay in filing her federal habeas
