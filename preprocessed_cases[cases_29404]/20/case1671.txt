the petitioner in this habeas corpus action,sharon rockwell,was convicted at trial in a state court of conspiring with her sons to murder the boys father,her husband.a federal writ of habeas corpus was subsequently granted on the ground that her sixth amendment right to present a complete defense precluded the state trial court from barring evidence that rockwell had abused his sons sexually.under the legal standard prescribed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,the writ should not have been issued unless exclusion of the evidence in question involved an unreasonable application of,or was contrary to,federal law clearly established by the united states supreme court.concluding that the result reached in the state court passes muster under the statutory test,we shall reverse the grant of habeas relief.
as we noted in an earlier appeal in this case,rockwell yukins,cir,sharon and edward rockwell had three sons.one of the sons,acting with two friends,attempted to kill rockwell by cutting the brake lines on his car.the attempt failed.then,in a second unsuccessful attempt on rockwell life,the two friends hit him on the head with a baseball bat.although rockwell was not present on either occasion,she had engaged in discussions with one or more of her sons about killing rockwell.on the strength of these discussions,the state of michigan charged rockwell with conspiracy to commit murder.
rockwell defense,as her lawyer described it at a pretrial hearing,was that her participation in the talk of killing rockwell was not intended to further an actual murder rather,according to counsel,rockwell purpose had been to let the boys vent the extreme and abiding hatred they harbored against their father for having abused them,sexually and otherwise,when they were younger.rockwell felt in her heart that the only way she could keep the situation under control,defense counsel explained,was to allow the boys to talk and fantasize about killing the hated rockwell.far from agreeing to a murder,the theory went,rockwell hoped to forestall a murder through what her lawyer seems to have viewed as some sort of talk therapy.
in connection with this therapy defense,as we characterized it in our earlier opinion,rockwell wanted to show at trial that rockwell had sexually abused his sons.the prosecution wanted to exclude evidence of the alleged abuse.the state trial court ordered briefing and heard argument on the admissibility of the evidence of abuse,after which it ordered the evidence excluded as not material under.rule of evid.
when the case went to trial,rockwell elected not to take the stand.the jury returned a verdict of guilty,and rockwell was sentenced to imprisonment for life.an appeal to the michigan court of appeals followed.
the court of appeals affirmed the conviction,succinctly explaining its rationale as follows 
we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court exclusion of evidence of the victim alleged prior acts of abuse against defendant and the victim children.people watkins.defendant was merely limited in the method with which to present her defense and not deprived of the opportunity to present the same.although marginally relevant,the evidence was properly excluded under mre.
rockwell applied to the michigan supreme court for leave to appeal the affirmance of her conviction,but further review was denied.
rockwell then filed her habeas action in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.the initial pleading raised two issues,insufficiency of the evidence and improper exclusion of the evidence of sexual abuse,both of which had been exhausted in the state courts.the district court eventually granted rockwell leave to amend her petition to include an unexhausted claim as well.following a hearing at which arguments were presented on the merits,the district court granted the writ on the ground that the state trial court decision to exclude evidence of the alleged sexual abuse clearly violated rockwell constitutional right to present a n o reasonable jurist could conclude otherwise.
the soundness of this proposition was not decided in the initial appeal to our court.the panel that heard the appeal vacated the judgment on the ground that the district court should not have reviewed a mixed petition containing an unexhausted claim in addition to the exhausted claims.the first panel remanded the case with a suggestion that the district court could reenter its original decision after allowing rockwell to dismiss her unexhausted claim.see rockwell yukins,at.
on remand,the district court accepted this suggestion.rockwell moved for dismissal of her unexhausted claim and reentry of the habeas judgment,and the district court granted the motion.
the warden again appealed to our court.reaching the merits of the case,a divided panel reversed the district court judgment.the full court then voted to rehear the case en banc.supplemental briefs having been filed,and the case having been reargued,the appeal is now ready for decision by the full court.
as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,subsection d of provides,in relevant part,as follows 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
this version of the statute applies to habeas applications filed,as rockwell was,after april,the effective date of aedpa.see lindh murphy,d.
the statute means what it says.see williams taylor,d.what the statute says,to repeat,is that habeas relief may not be granted unless the state court decision was either contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or involved an unreasonable application of such law.
rockwell does not contend that the affirmance of her conviction by the state court of appeals was contrary to clear supreme court caselaw.she does contend,however,that it involved an unreasonable application of such law.
for this contention to be accepted,rockwell must do more than persuade us that the michigan judiciary application of federal law was incorrect.as justice said,speaking for the court in williams 
in d,congress specifically used the word unreasonable,and not a term like erroneous or incorrect.under d unreasonable application clause,then,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.williams,at.emphasis supplied.
a n unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect or erroneous application of federal law.id.at emphasis in original.and in making the unreasonable application inquiry,we should ask whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.id.at.
in rockwell case,as we have seen,the michigan court of appeals concluded that the probative value of the evidence of edward rockwell alleged abuse of his sons was substantially outweighed by the danger that unfair prejudice would ensue were the evidence to be admitted.this conclusion may or may not have been erroneous,but we can not say that it represented an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent.
a supreme court decision that the district court found particularly instructive,davis alaska,d,held that the defendant in a burglary case had a constitutional right to a crucial prosecution witness about a juvenile burglary adjudication for which the witness was on probation,notwithstanding a state rule making evidence of juvenile adjudications inadmissible.the court emphasized that c is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested,adding that the juvenile testimony provided a crucial link in the proof of the defendant act.id.at and.citation omitted.in this setting,the court concluded,the sixth amendment right of confrontation is paramount to the state policy of protecting a juvenile offender.id.at.
in the case at bar,by contrast,the evidence of sexual abuse was not being proffered to attack the believability of a crucial witness against rockwell.the rule under which the trial court excluded the evidence,moreover,is not aimed at protecting juvenile offenders.the interests at stake in this case are entirely different than those at stake in davis.because davis is readily distinguishable,and because the gloss rockwell would have us put on the case flies in the face of a line of authority to which we shall turn shortly culminating in united states scheffer,d,we reject the claim that the michigan court decision represented an unreasonable application of davis.
rockwell attempts to extract from davis and other supreme court cases a general rule that a criminal defendant must be permitted to present any evidence that she deems critical to her defense.in this connection she cites crane kentucky,d,which holds that the constitution guarantees criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.id.at.citations omitted.
but the supreme court has made it perfectly clear that the right to present a complete defense is not an unlimited right to ride roughshod over reasonable evidentiary restrictions.a defendant does not have an unfettered right to offer testimony that is incompetent,privileged,or otherwise inadmissible under standard rules of evidence.taylor illinois,d.rather,she must comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.chambers mississippi,d.
as the supreme court explained in scheffer 
state and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials.such rules do not abridge an accused right to present a defense so long as they are not arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve.at.citations omitted.
a defendant right to present a complete defense,in other words,does not automatically trump state evidentiary rules.the competing interests must be balanced,and a defendant interest in presenting evidence may have to bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
it was not objectively unreasonable,in our view,for the michigan court to conclude that other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process outweighed rockwell interest in presenting evidence of her husband prior conduct.the evidence of sexual abuse posed a substantial danger of unfair risk that the jury would be tempted to acquit rockwell not because of any sense that she was innocent of conspiring with her sons to kill rockwell but because of a sense that killing would be too good for such a man.
in addition to the danger of unfair prejudice,the sexual abuse evidence presented a risk of undue delay and confusion of the issues.the facts that rockwell wished to introduce into evidence were disputed.resolution of this tangential dispute would have complicated the trial and could have tended to mislead the jury.
it is true that the chances of the jury accepting rockwell therapy defense may have been diminished by exclusion of the sexual abuse evidence.but it would not be correct to say that rockwell was deprived of her defense.exclusion of the evidence would not have prevented her from testifying that her sons hated their father because of his unspeakable behavior toward them over the years it would not have barred her from telling the jury that she thought such talk had a healthy prophylactic effect that she did not think it would lead to overt action and that she had never been a party to any mutual understanding or agreement to commit murder.the court ruling barred rockwell only from testifying that her husband abuse of her sons was sexual in nature.
explication of the sexual aspect of the abuse,in short,did not go to the essence of the talk therapy defense.rather,it was a important detail,to be sure,but a detail nonetheless.
it is far from certain,moreover,that presentation of this detail to the jury would have increased the likelihood of rockwell acquittal.the more heinous rockwell offenses,the jury could reasonably have concluded,the more likely it was that rockwell understood the talk of murder to be in earnest.if,on the other hand,testimony that the abuse was sexual would have made the jury more likely to acquit rockwell,it might well have done so on the improper basis mentioned sense that the conspiracy was than on any legitimate basis.in these circumstances,we believe it was not unreasonable for the michigan court of appeals to weigh the competing interests as it did 
the decision made by the michigan court was a judgment call of the sort that judges make all the time.some members of this court,had they been on the state bench,would have made a different call.we can not say they would have acted unreasonably in doing so,particularly in view of the fact that the danger of undue prejudice could have been minimized by a cautionary instruction.see lewis wilkinson,cir.what we can say,however,is that the call made by the michigan court was well within that court discretion.the decision to exclude evidence of the sexual nature of the victim mistreatment of his sons did not,in our opinion,involve an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states.
the decision of the district court is reversed,and the case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the petition.
the majority conclusion that the michigan court of appeals did not unreasonably apply supreme court precedent in rejecting petitioner claim that she was denied her fifth amendment right to present a complete defense rests upon an interpretation of d that has no basis in the law.as the term unreasonable is commonly known and applied in the jurisprudence,the state appellate court decision represented an objectively unreasonable application of the court precedent.
petitioner sought to introduce evidence of edward rockwell alleged sexual abuse of his sons for the purpose of establishing that she engaged in talk of killing rockwell with her sons,not for the purpose of forming an agreement to kill,but for the purpose of allowing the boys to vent their anger and hatred of rockwell.thus,evidence of rockwell alleged sexual abuse provided the substantive basis of petitioner defense and,without the evidence,petitioner was prevented from establishing any defense at all.the state appellate court finding that omission of this evidence merely limited petitioner in the method of presenting her defense thereby constitutes an objectively unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.as a result,the state appellate court conclusion that the evidence was properly excluded on evidentiary grounds constitutes an objectively unreasonable application of the court precedent as well.i would therefore affirm the district court order granting the petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by petitioner,sharon may rockwell.
unreasonable application prong of d 
this court review of the michigan court of appeals decision regarding petitioner claim is circumscribed by d of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,meaning that the state court decision will not be disturbed on habeas review unless the decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states in this case,it is the unreasonable application prong of d that guides our review.under this prong,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.lockyer andrade,d quoting williams taylor,d.said differently,a federal court may grant habeas relief under this prong based on an application of a governing legal principle to a set of facts different from those of the case in which the principle was announced.id.citing williams,at.
a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the decision applied a supreme court case incorrectly.price vincent,d alteration in price quoting bell cone,d.rather,i n order for a federal habeas court to find a state court application unreasonable,the state court decision must have been more than incorrect or erroneous,it must have been objectively unreasonable.wiggins smith,d citing lockyer,at.at williams,at.see also woodford visciotti,d per curiam.
we are not without guidance,however,as to when a state court decision rises to the level of being objectively unreasonable for purposes of granting a petitioner habeas relief under d.in wiggins smith,at.at,a death penalty case,the supreme court held that the maryland court of appeals unreasonably applied the governing principles of strickland washington,d in rejecting the petitioner claim that he had been denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.the court found that the state court of appeals conclusion that counsel performance was within professional norms was objectively unreasonable under strickland inasmuch as counsel had failed to make a reasonable investigation into the petitioner social history.id.noting that under strickland,strategic choices made after a less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation citation and internal quotation marks omitted.this,in turn,made the state court deference to counsel strategic decision not to present mitigating evidence of the petitioner social history objectively unreasonable as well.wiggins,at.at c ounsel chose to abandon their investigation at an unreasonable juncture,making a fully informed decision with respect to sentencing strategy impossible.
the wiggins majority rejected the dissent contention that the court hands were tied under d,by the state court factual determinations that the petitioner trial counsel did investigate and were aware of the petitioner background.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted emphasis in original.the court reasoned that the dissent position was unfounded because the state appellate court conclusion that the scope of counsel investigation into petitioner background met the legal standards set in strickland represented an objectively unreasonable application of our precedent.id.emphasis in original.in other words,the state court finding that counsel investigated and knew of the petitioner social history did not tie the court hands because the scope of counsel investigation was objectively unreasonable under the principles of strickland.id.
thus,wiggins instructs us that while we defer to state court decisions under d,the deference is not absolute inasmuch as a petitioner may be afforded habeas relief when the state court decision reaches a result not supported by supreme court precedent.see id.
ii.michigan court of appeals ruling 
the michigan court of appeals issued a divided ruling in this case.while the majority found that petitioner was not entitled to relief on her claim that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of edward rockwell prior acts of alleged sexual abuse against rockwell and petitioner children,a dissenting judge sharply disagreed.see people rockwell.may,unpublished.
specifically,as to petitioner claim on this issue,the majority opined 
we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court exclusion of evidence of the victim alleged prior acts of abuse against defendant and the victim children.people watkins.defendant was merely limited in the method with which to present her defense and not deprived the opportunity to present the same.although marginally relevant,the evidence was properly excluded under mre.
id.in sharp contradistinction,the dissenting judge found petitioner claim on this issue meritorious and would have reversed petitioner conviction and remanded for a new trial.that judge persuasively refutes the majority argument as follows 
the majority opinion agrees that the evidence in question is relevant.if it is relevant it is only so because it relates to a legally recognized defense.that defense is that defendant participation in the conversations was not,from her perspective,part of the conspiracy or agreement to commit murder,but,rather,it was her way of allowing her sons to ventilate their anger at the sexual abuse her husband had been perpetrating on the boys over a period of time.her defense might not be accepted by a jury and her belief,if,indeed,she had such a belief,that the boys should be allowed to express their rage through such conversations may have been misguided.nevertheless,i believe she should have been allowed to tell her version of the events to the jury and to submit evidence it support of it.
i come to this conclusion because i believe her version goes to the very heart of her defense,that there was no conspiracy between her and anyone else.the absence of a conspiracy,an agreement,depends on whether she had a factual basis for allowing the boys to express their anger in this manner and this,in turn,depends on whether the sexual abuse actually occurred.if it did not occur,her defense disappears and if it did occur,she has an explanation,however tenuous it might be,for why she participated in the conversations and for her theory that she was not seriously conspiring to murder her husband.
from this perspective,the need to establish the sexual abuse becomes crucial.i would not want the trial to deteriorate into a criminal sexual conduct case with each allegation of sex abuse being proved and then being disproved by other witnesses but i am satisfied that the trial judge can place adequate controls and limits on the flow of testimony given the purpose of such testimony.it would be sufficient for the trial judge to allow enough evidence to establish that defendant view of the situation was supported by an adequate factual basis.
if all she can show is that her behavior was based on a vague and generalized hatred for her husband by herself and by the boys,she is deprived of the essence of her defense.a defendant must be permitted to offer proofs of each element of a valid defense.see washington texas,d people callington.i wish to emphasize that i do not take the position that defendant would be justified in conspiring to kill her husband if he had perpetrated sexual abuse upon the boys.rather,my position is that she must be permitted to argue and submit proofs that the existence of the sexual abuse formed a basis for her belief that she was not a knowing participant in a conspiracy at all.
i would reverse and remand for a new trial.
id.shepherd,dissenting emphasis added.
iii.analysis 
at the outset,it should be noted that although the state appellate court reason for concluding that the evidence was properly excluded under rule is significant,what is most significant is the court finding that the exclusion of rockwell sexual abuse of his sons merely limited the method by which petitioner could present her defense.this is so because the state appellate court made an objectively unreasonable determination under supreme court precedent that petitioner was only limited in the method and not the substance of her defense through the exclusion of this evidence,which thereby rendered the court conclusion that the evidence was properly excluded under rule objectively unreasonable as well.said differently,although it is true that supreme court precedent indicates that the right to present a defense is at times limited by reasonable evidentiary rules,if in deciding to exclude evidence under an evidentiary rule the court makes an objectively unreasonable determination as to petitioner ability to present her defense in the absence of this evidence,the decision to exclude the evidence under the rule is itself unreasonable.see wiggins,at.at holding that if the court makes an unreasonable determination as to the basis for counsel strategy,the decision to defer to counsel strategic choice is itself unreasonable.
petitioner right to present a defense 
the state appellate court held that petitioner was not denied her constitutional right to present a defense because the exclusion of evidence regarding rockwell sexual abuse merely limited the method by which petitioner could present her defense theory.under clearly established supreme court precedent,the state appellate court holding was objectively unreasonable because evidence of rockwell alleged sexual abuse provided the substantive basis for petitioner defense such that without this evidence petitioner was left with no defense at all.
the court has long held that an accused right to establish a defense is a fundamental element of due process.washington texas,d.in washington,the court was called upon for the first time to decide whether the right of an accused to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor,guaranteed in federal trials by the sixth amendment,is so fundamental and essential to a fair trial that it is incorporated in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.id.at.relying on in re oliver,the court observed that,among other things,an accused right to offer testimony is a basic component of his right to offer a defense.id.at.quoting in re oliver.the court therefore concluded that t he right to offer testimony of witnesses and to compel their attendance is in plain terms the right to present a defense because j ust as an accused has the right to confront the prosecution witnesses for the purpose of challenging their testimony,he has the right to present his own witnesses to establish a defense.id.at.it is then up to the jury to decide where the truth lies.id.
the court spoke again on the constitutional significance of allowing a defendant to present testimony in connection with his defense in crane kentucky,d.specifically,in crane,the court held that the exclusion of testimony surrounding the circumstances of a defendant confession deprived the defendant of his fundamental under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment or under the compulsory process or confrontation clauses of the sixth present a defense.id.at.the court reasoned that the opportunity to be heard would be an empty one if the state were permitted to exclude competent,reliable evidence bearing on the credibility of a confession when such evidence is central to the defendant claim of innocence.id.as a result,the court concluded that the exclusion of this kind of exculpatory evidence deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor case encounter and survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.id.at.quoting united states cronic,d.
in davis alaska,d,the court examined an accused right to present a defense in the context of the of witnesses offered against him.the court recognized that c is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested,and that several means of discrediting a witness are essential to effective.id.at.the petitioner in davis sought to discredit a government witness by showing the existence of possible bias and prejudice.id.specifically,the petitioner sought to question a key witness for the prosecution regarding the witness adjudication as a juvenile delinquent and his probation status in order to demonstrate that the witness identified the petitioner as the perpetrator out of fear of possible probation revocation.id.at.the trial court refused to allow the petitioner to the witness as to his probationary status as a juvenile offender based on a state statute protecting the anonymity of juvenile offenders.id.at.as a result,the petitioner counsel did his best to expose the witness state of mind at the time,but much of the witness testimony went unchallenged.id.at.the petitioner was convicted,and his appeal made its way to the alaska supreme court which affirmed the petitioner conviction,concluding that counsel for the defendant was able adequately to question the youth in considerable detail concerning the possibility of bias or motive.id.
the supreme court granted certiorari limited to the question of whether the petitioner was denied his constitutional right to adequately the witness,which turn ed on the correctness of the alaska court evaluation of the adequacy of the scope of permitted.id.the court reversed,finding that it could not accept the alaska supreme court conclusion that the that was permitted defense counsel was adequate to develop the issue of bias properly to the jury.id.at.the court reasoned 
while counsel was permitted to ask the witness whether he was biased,counsel was unable to make a record from which to argue why the witness might have been biased or otherwise lacked that degree of impartiality expected of a witness at trial.on the basis of the limited that was permitted,the jury might well have thought that defense counsel was engaged in a speculative and baseless line of attack on the credibility of an apparently blameless witness or,as the prosecutor objection put it,a rehash of prior.on these facts,it seems clear to us that to make any such inquiry effective,defense counsel should have been permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors,as the sole triers of fact and credibility,could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.
id.emphasis added.
against this backdrop,it is clear that the michigan court of appeals exclusion of rockwell sexual abuse of the boys merely limited petitioner in the method by which she could present her objectively unreasonable inasmuch as this evidence was at the very substance of petitioner defense.through the exclusion of this evidence,petitioner was deprived of her right to present testimony in connection with and in support of her defense pursuant to washington and crane,and she was denied her right to effectively key witnesses and demonstrate the accuracy and truthfulness of her defense under davis,all of which ultimately denied petitioner her due process right to present a defense.
indeed,at the hearing on the motion in limine before the trial court,petitioner counsel argued the substantive significance of the sexual abuse evidence as it related to petitioner defense 
your honor,in this case,my client,sharon rockwell,is charged with conspiracy to murder edward rockwell,her husband.the facts will show in this case that there were several conversations throughout the period of the conspiracy in which my client and the other conspirators and the other parties discussed death,ways of accomplishing death of father.
the prosecution intends to show that my client engaged in these conversations in an effort to convince the jury that my client is guilty of conspiring to murder.
my client knew of the i hatred her children had for their father.she knew this because she lived with it every day she raised the children.her defense,you honor,is that she knew the situation was a volatile,explosive situation and she felt in her heart that the only way she could keep this situation under control was to allow the boys to talk and fantasize about these things that were apparently in their minds.and,therefore,her attitude was talk will diffuse the situation rather than silence causing an explosion.so her defense is that she did not make an agreement with anyone.she allowed this talk because it was just talk.
now,the sex acts involved in this case and father prior conduct in treating his family so shabbily will show that this hatred was real and will show that why this talk was engaged in.
trial,vol.i at.the following colloquy then occurred between the trial court and petitioner counsel 
the court assuming everything you say is true,assuming that there was hated sic based upon all these activities,what type of a legal defense is it 
petitioner counsel because mother petitioner says there was not an agreement to murder.mother says this was nothing more than talk.
the court then how is your client harmed by not including t
