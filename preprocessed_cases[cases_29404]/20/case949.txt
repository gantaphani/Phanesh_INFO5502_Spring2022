michael lenz was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for fatally stabbing a fellow inmate at a virginia state correctional facility.his guilt is not in dispute.he now appeals the district court denial of his federal habeas petition,seeking review of four alleged constitutional violations arising out of his state trial denial of effective representation based on the location and conditions of his incarceration,ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing,improper exclusion of evidence at sentencing,and juror use of a bible during sentencing deliberations.we have reviewed these claims with care,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
on the evening of january,petitioner michael lenz joined brent parker,jeffrey remington,and three other inmates at the augusta correctional center for a meeting of a group known as the ironwood kindred.petitioner was an adherent of a religion known as asatru,and intended to lead an asatru ceremony at the meeting.petitioner and parker had a history of conflict relating to the practice of asatru.according to petitioner,parker and others had thwarted his efforts to form an official group within the prison devoted to asatru,and parker had threatened his life on two separate occasions.petitioner admitted that he planned to kill parker that evening.
the asatru ceremony began with petitioner performing some ritual incantations,reciting poetry,and calling upon an asatru deity.petitioner then called parker to the altar.after petitioner and parker had a brief conversation,petitioner and remington attacked parker with knives.the ensuing commotion alerted the only correctional officer present,who was stationed outside the meeting room.through a window in the door,the officer observed petitioner and remington repeatedly stabbing parker,while parker lay on the floor between them making a feeble attempt to defend himself with his hands.the officer ordered them to stop,but they ignored him and carried on with their attack.he also called for backup,but did not attempt to intervene by himself because he was unarmed.
while the officer awaited assistance,petitioner and remington continued their assault.the next officer to arrive observed parker in a fetal position,making no attempt to defend himself,while petitioner stabbed him over and over and over.this second officer also ordered petitioner and remington to stop,but to no avail.once sufficient additional personnel arrived,correctional officers entered the room and apprehended petitioner and remington.
a prison nurse called to the scene found parker alive,but in very critical condition.despite her best efforts,parker continued to bleed profusely,and he died at the augusta medical center.an autopsy revealed that he had sustained stab wounds,all inflicted while he was still alive.these included seven stab wounds each to parker left lung and liver,either set of which would have been fatal even without his numerous additional injuries.
petitioner was tried before a jury in virginia state court and convicted of capital murder.see ann.at the penalty phase of the trial,the jury fixed his punishment at death,after finding each of two possible statutory aggravating factors that his future violent acts would constitute a continuing serious threat to society and that his offense conduct was outrageously or wantonly vile,horrible or inhuman.id.on direct appeal,the supreme court of virginia affirmed petitioner conviction and sentence.see lenz commonwealth,cert.denied,d.
petitioner subsequently filed a state habeas petition,asserting several errors in his trial and sentencing.the supreme court of virginia initially concluded that petitioner had received ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing,and thus granted the petition in part,denied it in part,and remanded for resentencing.see lenz warden.however,it granted the commonwealth motion for rehearing and issued a second opinion denying the petition in full.see lenz warden,cert.denied,d.
petitioner thereafter filed a federal habeas petition in the district court for the western district of virginia,pursuant to.the district court denied the petition,and also denied petitioner subsequent motion to alter or amend its judgment.see lenz true,d,original order lenz true,d,denial of motion.we granted a certificate of appealability on petitioner claims.
petitioner now presents four substantive constitutional claims for our review.before we consider these four claims,we set forth the proper standard of habeas review and address petitioner contention that the district court failed to apply it properly.
the federal habeas statute dictates a highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings,which demands that decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.bell cone,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the required deference encompasses both the state court legal conclusions and its factual findings.
where the state court has adjudicated a particular claim on the merits,federal habeas relief is appropriate only in two circumstances.the first occurs if the state court judgment resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a decision is contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases or confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nonetheless arrives at a result different from its precedent.williams taylor,d see also lovitt true,cir.an unreasonable application occurs when a state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of a petitioner case.rompilla beard,d internal quotation marks omitted see also nuth,cir.
the second circumstance where a federal court may grant habeas relief despite a state court decision on the merits is if the state court judgment resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.moreover,in reviewing a habeas petition,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct unless the habeas petitioner rebuts this presumption by clear and convincing evidence.id.e.
the relation between d and e is a source of much dispute between the parties.though he presents only one d to juror use of the bible during our substantive review,petitioner pressed several such claims before the district court.he contends to us that the district court erred procedurally in applying the e presumption of correctness in the course of adjudicating these claims.he points out,for example,that in assessing whether the state court dismissal of his bible claim rested upon an unreasonable determination of the facts,the district court stated that it must presume the state court findings of fact to be correct unless the petitioner makes a clear and convincing showing to the contrary.lenz true,d at.petitioner argues that e has no place in the d inquiry,and that statements such as this compel us to remand the district court decision in its entirety.
petitioner argument is undercut by both supreme court precedent and our own.in dretke,the supreme court indicated that the two provisions interrelate 
petitioner may obtain relief only by showing the state court conclusion to be an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.thus,we presume the state court factual findings to be sound unless petitioner rebuts the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e.
d emphasis added see also cockrell,d stating that the inquiry on the merits is whether the trial court determination was objectively unreasonable and has been rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary emphasis added wilson ozmint,cir applying e in the context of determining whether relief was appropriate under d.we therefore find no error in the district court application of the e presumption of correctness to the state court factual findings.
petitioner also contends that the district court erred by applying this presumption to the state court entire decision,rather than just to the factual findings contained therein.we reject this contention as well.even if certain statements taken in isolation might appear to be mistaken,we are confident that as a whole the opinion was not overly deferential to the state court.contrary to petitioner contention,the district court conducted a thorough and careful examination of the merits of petitioner claims,consistent with the standards set forth in.we thus decline petitioner suggestion that we remand the decision in its entirety on this basis,and turn to his four constitutional claims.
petitioner first substantive claim alleges that he was denied effective assistance of counsel as a result of the circumstances of his detention prior to trial.
for the first three months following parker murder,petitioner was incarcerated at red onion prison,a security facility in wise county,virginia.his two appointed attorneys,however,were located in waynesboro,virginia,approximately a.they visited him in prison only twice between january and april.each visit lasted only two hours,and the two lawyers could only converse with petitioner by means of a single phone.
in april,petitioner lawyers filed a motion with the trial court requesting that petitioner be transferred to a closer,security facility,preferably to the nearby augusta county jail.the trial judge expressed skepticism as to his authority to interfere with prisoner classification or housing decisions made by the virginia department of corrections.the prosecutor,however,had already discussed the issue with doc officials and found that the doc was able to move petitioner to a prison only miles away from his lawyers.petitioner was thus moved to sussex i state prison,though his counsel objected that this still required a drive of over three hours each way.petitioner counsel also requested and were granted a continuance.
even after this transfer,petitioner attorneys continued to find their visits difficult.under prison regulations governing inmates charged with violent crimes,visits were either with petitioner behind glass and one phone for both else required the presence of a guard.mental health and mitigation specialists allegedly had difficulty meeting with and performing certain tests on him due to the strictures of the visits.and on one visit,petitioner counsel were told by a guard to leave after only minutes.upon being informed of this,the prosecutor again called the doc to straighten out the situation the duration of visits thereafter was not limited.
one week prior to the trial,which took place in july,the trial court denied a motion by petitioner counsel to dismiss the case based on counsel difficulty gaining access to petitioner.the trial court took note of the fact that just that morning,petitioner had been transferred to the augusta county jail.petitioner attorney objected that he had desired to have petitioner at that facility from the beginning,but the trial court observed that the jail had still double capacity,and expressed surprise that doc had been able to make room for petitioner at all.
on direct appeal,petitioner argued that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel based on the location of his detention.lenz commonwealth,at quoting petitioner alterations omitted.the supreme court of virginia construed this as an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,and declined to reach its merits on direct appeal because under virginia law such claims are cognizable only on collateral review.id.citing johnson commonwealth.
in his state habeas petition,petitioner again raised a claim based on his detention,this time alleging that the conditions had denied him his right to counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings.lenz warden,at quoting petitioner claim.the supreme court of virginia construed this denial of counsel claim as substantively different from the ineffective assistance claim petitioner had raised on direct appeal.see id.this difference proved fatal because a denial of counsel claim could have been brought on direct appeal,the court found the habeas claim to be procedurally defaulted.see id.
on federal habeas,petitioner raised precisely the same claim as he had on state habeas.see lenz true,d at.the district court declined to grant relief,finding that petitioner claim had been barred under an adequate and independent state procedural rule,and that petitioner had not even attempted a showing of cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default.see id.at lenz true,d at denial of motion for reconsideration.
the question of procedural default is a close one,and is complicated by the fact that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and a denial of counsel claim are related.see united states cronic,d i t has long been recognized that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.internal quotation marks omitted.in order not to allow any semantic confusion to bar all federal review of petitioner constitutional claims,we shall honor his request to treat his current claim as alleging that the limitations on attorney access denied him effective assistance of counsel.because there is no state court judgment on the merits,we review de novo.see,hudson hunt,cir.
even so,petitioner claim fails to allege circumstances that would constitute ineffective assistance of counsel under the standard test set forth in strickland washington,d.to prevail under strickland,a claimant must show both that counsel performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense by depriv ing the claimant of a trial whose result is reliable.id.establishing the prejudice prong of the strickland test requires a claimant to show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.wiggins smith,d quoting strickland,at.this burden remains the same regardless of whether the alleged deficiency is counsel own fault or arises due to external constraints.cronic,at.
even if his attorneys infrequent visits somehow rendered their performance deficient,petitioner has not properly alleged that he was prejudiced by this deficiency.to be sure,he has raised general allegations that counsel and mental health and mitigation specialists were impeded from adequately investigating his case and preparing for trial.but he has provided no explanation how additional meetings with his counsel,or longer meetings with his counsel,would have led to new or better theories of advocacy or otherwise would have created a reasonable probability of a different outcome.hill mitchell,cir.t he mere fact that counsel spent little time with petitioner is not enough under strickland,without evidence of prejudice or other defects.bowling parker,cir.neither in his arguments here nor in the corresponding claim of his state habeas petition has petitioner identified a single fact that counsel or an expert failed to discover,let alone one capable of convincing the jury that he did not repeatedly stab a defenseless victim or that doing so was not heinous and indicative of future dangerousness.thus,he can not establish an essential prerequisite for relief under strickland.hill,at.
petitioner attempts to avoid this conclusion by invoking a narrow exception to the second strickland prong,whereby in certain limited contexts,prejudice is presumed.glover miro,cir quoting strickland,at.the caselaw has identified three such contexts,see,and petitioner has failed to state a claim that would qualify for prejudice under any of them.first,he does not contend that there was simply no lawyer present at a critical stage of the proceedings,id.at emphasis added citing roe,d,nor would the record support this.
second,he does not present the rare claim of ineffective assistance that is tantamount to a constructive denial of counsel,id.at.such a situation arises only when a lawyer entirely fails to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing,id.at quoting cronic,at,and thus might as well be absent from the proceedings,id.at.counsel performance here came nowhere close to this sort of deficiency.since counsel undeniably served as an advocate for petitioner and tested the commonwealth case through the adversarial system,petitioner can not show that he was constructively denied his right to counsel.id.
third,this case is not one where although counsel is available to assist the accused during trial,the likelihood that any lawyer,even a fully competent one,could provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of the trial,id.at quoting cronic,at.at most,petitioner alleges circumstances that may have made it somewhat more difficult for counsel to prepare for trial.but n ot every restriction on counsel time or opportunity to investigate or to consult with his client or otherwise to prepare for trial violates a defendant sixth amendment right to counsel.morris slappy,d.consequently,a claim alleging such a restriction can not succeed without an accompanying allegation of prejudice.see,cronic,at.no presumption of prejudice when counsel had less than a month to prepare to defend complex mail fraud charges chambers maroney,d no presumption of prejudice when counsel appeared only a few minutes prior to trial glover,at,no presumption of prejudice when counsel received defendant file only two days before trial.
since his circumstances do not give rise to prejudice per se,petitioner failure to allege how the conditions of his detention actually affected his right is fatal to his ineffective assistance claim.nor is he entitled to an evidentiary hearing to explore how he may have been prejudiced.an evidentiary hearing is not a fishing expedition for facts as yet unsuspected,but is instead an instrument to test the truth of facts already alleged in the habeas petition.jones polk,cir emphasis added.where,as here,a petitioner has not allege d additional facts that,if true,would entitle him to relief,a hearing is unwarranted.mccarver lee,cir internal quotation marks omitted denying an evidentiary hearing on an ineffective assistance claim see also fullwood lee,cir noting that a petitioner must also satisfy one of the six factors set forth in townsend sain,d.
were we to find petitioner sixth amendment claim cognizable,we would risk countenancing significant and untimely intrusion by federal courts into the most routine matters of state prison administration.federal habeas review is not the best context in which to determine the propriety of housing arrangements for state prisoners awaiting trial.
first,concerns of federalism and comparative expertise militate against federal court supervision of administrative decisions made by state departments of corrections.c ourts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform,and w here a state penal system is involved,federal courts have additional reason to accord deference to the appropriate prison authorities.turner safley,d internal quotation marks omitted.a state assigns prisoners to particular locations based on many criteria,including,but not limited to,prisoner dangerousness and the maximum capacity of each facility.the state moreover decides the geographic placement of prison facilities on the basis of public safety,feasible cost,and other practical security facilities are not always located in population centers where trials are most likely to be held.consequently,it may in some cases be difficult or dangerous for the state to alter the location or visitation conditions of a defendant detention,and federal courts should not lightly issue rulings that would require such changes.this case presents a particularly poor candidate for such a ruling deference to state prisoner classifications is surely warranted where the prisoner in question stands accused of murdering a fellow inmate in a brutal and premeditated attack.
second,collateral review is not a timely vehicle for addressing the type of problem of which petitioner complains.as the record here amply demonstrates,the appropriate time to address these concerns is before the trial.commendably,petitioner trial counsel did raise objections at that time.equally commendably,the prosecutor was helpful in arranging for petitioner to be housed in closer facilities and in assuring that the length of visitations would not be unduly restricted.indeed,during the final week of trial preparations,petitioner was placed in the nearby augusta county jail,just as his counsel had requested.with a close perspective on the proceedings,the trial court was in the best position to ensure a fair trial.compare jones plaster,cir noting that deference to the trial court can be appropriate when it has observed with its own eyes the very act in dispute.our ex post review,by contrast,can offer only the remedy of an entirely new trial.
for these reasons,it is proper that we decline to expand cronic,and limit our review of claims such as this to the objective criteria set forth in strickland.where counsel difficulty gaining access to a defendant actually results in deficient performance that affects the reliability of trial,the strickland test will be satisfied.but where,as here,no such effect has even been alleged,we can not and should not grant relief.
petitioner second claim also presents an ineffective assistance of counsel issue,alleging that his lawyers were constitutionally inadequate for failing to raise a objection to the verdict forms given to the jury following the sentencing phase of his trial.
after the evidence had been submitted,the jury was provided with both oral instructions and written verdict forms explaining the different sentencing options available under virginia law.while the oral instructions set forth the full range of possibilities,there is no dispute that the written verdict forms contained two material omissions.first,there was no option that would expressly allow the jury to find one or both aggravating factors and nevertheless impose a life sentence by determining them to be outweighed by mitigating evidence.second,there was no option that would allow the jury to impose the statutorily authorized sentence of a fine up to in addition to life imprisonment.
petitioner attorneys did not object to these omissions,nor did they raise the issue on direct appeal.however,the supreme court of virginia sua sponte directed the parties on appeal to address whether the verdict forms violated its decision in atkins commonwealth,a prior case in which it had vacated a death sentence based on a omission.see lenz commonwealth,at.but after the parties had briefed and argued the issue,the court ultimately declined to decide it on the merits.instead,it found any possible claim procedurally defaulted because petitioner had not raised the issue in the trial court or on appeal.see id.
subsequent to its resolution of petitioner appeal,the supreme court of virginia decided powell commonwealth.the sentencing jury in powell had received verdict forms materially identical to those used in petitioner case,and the supreme court of virginia found that these forms violated virginia statutory law.id.at.
on state habeas,petitioner claimed that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the verdict forms in his case and in neglecting to raise the issue on appeal.the supreme court of virginia initially agreed with petitioner and ordered a new sentencing hearing.lenz warden,at.but it subsequently granted the commonwealth motion for rehearing and found that the claim did not in fact merit relief.see lenz warden,at.
the court emphasized that powell was decided after petitioner trial had ended,and concluded that counsel was not constitutionally ineffective for failing to object.id.whereas the deficiency in atkins had been the absence of an option allowing a life sentence if neither of the aggravating factors was proven,the deficiency in petitioner case was the absence of an option allowing a life sentence if one or both aggravating factors was proven.id.first emphasis added.the court noted that it had addressed the issue in petitioner case for the first time in powell.id.citing our decision in kornahrens evatt,cir,the court concluded that trial counsel could not have been ineffective for failing to anticipate this court subsequent decision in powell.lenz warden,at.
petitioner renewed his ineffective assistance claim in his federal habeas petition.see lenz true,d at.the district court denied the claim,concluding that it did not merit habeas relief under d.id.at.
as a threshold matter,we must determine the standard of review applicable to our consideration of petitioner ineffective assistance claim.petitioner emphasizes that his claim has two components failure to object to the absence of an option allowing the jury to impose a life sentence notwithstanding having found the existence of one or both aggravating factors,and failure to object to the absence of a option.petitioner notes that in denying him habeas relief,the supreme court of virginia expressly mentioned only the first of these.he thus urges that there was no adjudication on the merits of the issue,and that we must therefore review it de novo.see,hudson,at.
we can not accept petitioner suggestion.the standard of review set forth in d applies to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings emphasis added.petitioner in his state habeas petition presented only one claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based upon the verdict forms.the single claim did note two separate omissions from the verdict forms,but petitioner argument relied largely on a single case,powell,for the proposition that both omissions constituted error.the supreme court of virginia addressed his claim and squarely held that counsel failure to anticipate powell did not amount to ineffective assistance.see lenz warden,at.under these circumstances,we find no warrant to excise a particular aspect of petitioner argument and isolate it for de novo review.see also quinn haynes,cir finding state court had adjudicated both of two issues when both arguments were squarely before it,the cases it cited applied to both,and it denied relief.we thus review the state court judgment under the standards of d,and will overturn it only if it is contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.
we conclude that it is not.petitioner presents two arguments why we should find otherwise,one relating to the supreme court of virginia reasoning and the other to the result it reached.we find them both to be without merit.
first,petitioner contends that we must grant relief because the supreme court of virginia opinion failed to identify strickland washington as the controlling legal authority and failed to apply strickland test in resolving his claim.but satisfying the d standard does not require citation of supreme court,it does not even require awareness of these cases,so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the decision contradicts them.early packer,d per curiam.the state court reasoning here hardly relied on an ipse dixit approach,but instead cited to our decision in kornahrens.see lenz warden,at.there,we examined numerous cases,including strickland,and concluded that the case law is clear that an attorney assistance is not rendered ineffective because he failed to anticipate a new rule of law.kornahrens,at.citation of kornahrens was an entirely proper way to identify the governing principles of law and apply them to petitioner case.
second,petitioner contends in the alternative that the state court result was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of strickland.according to him,atkins and existing statutory law were enough to put a constitutionally effective lawyer on notice to object to the verdict forms in his case,and the supreme court of virginia was wrong to find otherwise.thus,petitioner essentially asks this court to reverse the supreme court of virginia on the question of whether it was objectively unreasonable for an attorney in virginia to fail to make an objection based purely on virginia law t his is an issue on which our deference to the state court should be at its zenith.barnabei angelone,cir,abrogated on other grounds by bell jarvis,cir en banc.
we find nothing unreasonable in the state court conclusion that it was only after powell that counsel would have been on notice of the errors in petitioner verdict forms.petitioner has conceded that his verdict forms were materially indistinguishable from those in powell.the forms in both cases copied their language essentially verbatim from a virginia statute purporting to set forth the proper wording for verdict forms.see powell,at.it was not until powell that the supreme court of virginia found that this statute was in fact trumped by another,more specific,statute prescribing the possible punishments for capital murder.id.the court expressly noted that this result was not controlled by atkins,which had not presented the same issue.id.at.
petitioner nevertheless argues that atkins stood for a broader proposition that should have led counsel to object in his case.according to him,t he seemingly obvious rule that verdict forms must be consistent with the law and the jury instructions had existed at least since atkins.but even if this were now a proper statement of virginia law,it was only in powell that the supreme court of virginia resolved exactly how verdict forms could be consistent with the law in light of the statutory conflict.and it was only in powell that the court extended its reasoning from atkins to conclude that verdict forms should contain sentencing options that accurately and expressly correspond to the trial court sentencing instruction.at.
we consequently find that it was reasonable for the supreme court of virginia to view powell as a new rule of law,and to find that petitioner counsel was not ineffective for failing to anticipate it.kornahrens,at.
petitioner third claim is that the trial court violated his eighth and fourteenth amendment rights by excluding from the sentencing phase of his trial evidence that parker,his victim,had been convicted of murder.
prior to trial,the commonwealth filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence regarding parker criminal record,which the trial court granted.the issue arose again during petitioner testimony at the penalty phase of his trial.toward the beginning of direct examination,petitioner counsel asked him,what was parker in the penitentiary for the prosecutor objected,and a discussion took place outside the presence of the jury.petitioner counsel argued that the fact of parker murder conviction should be allowed into evidence,because it has something to do with why petitioner stabbed him a nd how many times he stabbed him.the trial court,however,adhered to its earlier ruling on the motion in limine that the conviction was irrelevant.
the trial court expressly stated to petitioner counsel that it was excluding only the conviction itself,and not petitioner testimony regarding what he knew about parker at the time of the attack emphasis added.according to the trial court,if petitioner counsel were to put something in there first that gon na bring in even a hint of self defense in this case,or something like that,it might then be possible to get into the evidence of parker reputation for a turbulent disposition.thus far,however,there was nothing in the record that might call into question the relevance of parker disposition.
the jury returned and questioning resumed.petitioner went on to testify that parker had threatened to kill him on two separate occasions prior to his attack,and that the reason i attacked him the way i did was because i was trying to do damage to him,without him doing damage to me.he further testified that he thought parker was reaching for a weapon during the attack.but neither at this time nor at any other time following the colloquy with the trial court did petitioner counsel attempt to introduce evidence regarding parker criminal record or petitioner knowledge of it.
on direct appeal,petitioner argued that the exclusion of parker murder conviction from his sentencing hearing violated
