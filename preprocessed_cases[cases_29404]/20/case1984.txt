alphonso hubanks brought this habeas corpus claim under,challenging his wisconsin state conviction for four counts of sexual assault,one count of armed robbery,and one count of abduction.the district court denied the petition and discovery.hubanks appeals,and we affirm.
background 
on the evening of august,two men abducted a girl while she awaited her parents in their car idling outside of a store.as the abductors drove off with the victim in her parent car,one of the men put a baseball cap over her face.the victim testified that the men took her jewelry and,upon threat of death,demanded she remove her clothing.both men then forced her to engage in acts of sexual conduct.during the assault,one of the men asked,do you want to feel good or die and threatened,do let me have to kill you.although the victim could not clearly see her assailants,through a hole in the back of the cap she observed one of them holding what she thought to be a gun.after the assault,the men released the victim and drove off with her jewelry.
the incident was reported,and within hours police had the stolen car under surveillance.soon thereafter,the defendant,alphonso hubanks,and a companion emerged from a bar and approached the stolen vehicle.the engine would not start,so the two men got out and opened the car hood.as the police approached,hubanks tossed several objects under a nearby car.the items included the victim jewelry,coins,the keys to the stolen car,and a glass smoking pipe,which the victim later identified as the object she thought was a gun.
the following morning,hubanks appeared in a police lineup,in which he spoke the words used by the assailant.although the victim could only describe her assailants as two black men,she positively identified hubanks by his deep,voice.
at trial,the state moved for an voice identification of hubanks,requesting that he repeat the same words he had spoken at the police lineup.hubanks objected on the grounds that it violated his privilege against and was prejudicial.as an alternative,hubanks proposed that the court conduct another lineup at trial,rather than require hubanks alone to speak.the court denied the proposal and ordered hubanks to provide the voice sample.hubanks refused.as part of the closing instructions to the jury,the court included the following 
now,a defendant in a criminal case has the absolute constitutional right not to testify.the defendant decision not to testify must not be considered by you in any way and must not influence you in your verdict however,the defendant was requested to give a voice sample by stating the words that the victim testified were said on the night in question for purposes of testing her capacity to identify the voice as the same one she heard that night.the defendant has declined to give that voice sample by stating those words and you may,therefore,give that declination the weight you think it deserves in considering the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
the jury found hubanks guilty.
following trial,the district attorney took possession of the trial included the victim turned them over to the milwaukee police department for storage.fifteen months later,while the case was on appeal,the police destroyed the exhibits.soon thereafter,the wisconsin court of appeals affirmed the conviction.hubanks postconviction motions and petition for writ of habeas corpus were denied on state collateral appeal,as were his petition for habeas relief under and motion for discovery before the district court.
the following issues have been certified for appeal to this court whether hubanks due process rights were violated by the destruction of evidence whether hubanks right to remain silent was violated by the order to provide an voice sample whether hubanks right to remain silent was violated by the court jury instructions and whether hubanks was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial or on appeal.
ii.discussion 
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of controls this habeas case.this statute provides that habeas relief shall not be granted unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d and.hubanks argues both that the wisconsin court of appeals made unreasonable applications of federal law and that the state court decision was based upon unreasonable determinations of the facts.we therefore discuss both parts of the statute.
habeas relief is appropriate pursuant to d if the state court identified the right legal principle as determined by the supreme court but unreasonably applied that principle to the facts of the case.the standard for proving an unreasonable application of federal law,however,is more demanding than for proving an erroneous application of that law.schaff snyder,cir.we review legal questions and mixed questions of law and fact de novo,but uphold decisions that are either minimally consistent with the facts and circumstances of the case or one of several equally plausible outcomes.id.at.a state court findings of fact are presumed correct.sanchez gilmore,cir.the reasonableness of these findings can be overcome only by clear and convincing evidence.e.
due process 
hubanks argues that his due process rights were violated when the milwaukee police department,having accepted possession of the trial exhibits from the milwaukee district attorney office,destroyed the exhibits while his appeal was pending.according to hubanks,destruction of the exhibits prevented him from performing dna analysis on what he claims was potentially exculpatory evidence,thereby denying him a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.
determinations of fact 
hubanks challenges the reasonableness of the wisconsin court of appeals findings of fact.the appeals court found that the exhibits were not destroyed in bad faith,but rather were disposed of pursuant to a policy of the police department.the appeals court found further support for lack of bad faith in both the timing of the evidence destruction and the fact that no tests were pending when the exhibits were destroyed.in addition,the court of appeals found that the destroyed evidence lacked true exculpatory value because it could not have eliminated hubanks as one of the two assailants.
hubanks first argues that it was unreasonable for the court of appeals to find that the exhibits were destroyed pursuant to departmental policy when the policy was unwritten,the police gave somewhat inconsistent explanations for why the exhibits were destroyed,and the exhibits at one point bore notations that they were to be preserved.the record,however,supports the court of appeals finding.it contains evidence that the exhibits bore a notation by police,albeit an incorrect one,that hubanks had pleaded guilty and that therefore the exhibits could be destroyed in one year,pursuant to departmental policy.the exhibits were destroyed months later.hubanks fails to rebut the presumptive reasonableness of these findings.that the police department policy for retention of exhibits was unwritten is not proof that the policy did not exist or that the practice was not routinely observed.similarly,the inconsistencies to which hubanks refers may be indicative of confusion within the department,but they are far from clear and convincing evidence of bad faith.finally,while evidence that the exhibits bore two contradictory to preserve the exhibits pending a possible appeal,and the other erroneously referencing a guilty reflect careless police work,it is not clear and convincing proof that the police acted in bad faith.see montgomery greer,cir holding,mere negligence,without more,does not amount to a constitutional violation.
hubanks also argues that it was unreasonable for the court of appeals to find that the police department had a policy that violated state law.hubanks refers here to a wisconsin statute,which provides
