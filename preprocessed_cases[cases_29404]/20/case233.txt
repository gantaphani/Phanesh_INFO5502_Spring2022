on december,in hillsborough county superior court in manchester,new hampshire,a jury convicted robert haines of one count of felonious reckless conduct.ann,ii,and one count of felonious use of body armor,id.haines was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of three to six years imprisonment on the former count,and a suspended sentence on the latter.thereafter,the new hampshire supreme court affirmed.state haines.
after unsuccessful collateral attacks in state court,haines sought habeas relief in the federal district court,which granted summary judgment in favor of the state.we granted a certificate of appealability to consider haines ineffective assistance claims and now affirm.
the crux of the main charge in state that early on the morning of february,haines had taken a loaded rifle out of his truck and pointed it at an individual named christian busch the prior evening,haines had driven to manchester in a truck with his wife to campaign for himself in the presidential primaries.while he was campaigning in a local bar named the salty dog,dressed in western garb and a cowboy hat,another patron taunted him,tearing up one of his campaign pamphlets and throwing his american flag on the floor thereafter,outside the bar,the patron pushed haines who then sought out the police.it was now nearly one on the morning of the.
police officer robert oxley spoke to haines and the bar bouncer and concluded that haines had not been harmed.haines became agitated,threatened to report oxley for dereliction of duty,and was told to leave the area.haines eventually retreated to his truck,which was parked down the block oxley,concerned about haines,returned to his cruiser but stayed in the area.a little later,two other bar meyer and christian the premises and started down the block toward haines and his truck.
seeing haines,busch mistook him for a friend for whom he had been waiting,started toward him at a jog or trot,and shouted an obscenity.haines extracted a rifle from the truck and meyer later testified that haines had pointed it at busch.oxley,who was then driving back through the area,later testified that he had seen haines retrieve the rifle and pump it to chamber a round,but had not seen busch or the pointing of the rifle at busch.busch,who had fled the scene when confronted with the rifle,did not testify.
haines was arrested,charged as described above,and tried.the indictment,tracking the language of the new hampshire reckless endangerment statute,charged as to main offense that haines had recklessly engage d in conduct which placed or may have placed another in danger of serious bodily injury by the use of a deadly weapon in that he brandished a loaded remington caliber rifle and pointed it at christian busch.initially,the prosecution main theory was that busch was the endangered person.
as his main defense at trial,haines maintained that he had brandished the gun to ward off a perceived threat from busch,but had not chambered a bullet until after busch had fled and thus could not in fact have endangered busch.haines wife testified that haines had been beaten in a prior incident while campaigning and that busch had been approaching quickly in a threatening manner.she also said that haines had not pointed the gun at busch but was somewhat shaky on this point.haines did not testify.
during the trial,the state did adduce some evidence that there were other individuals outside the bar when haines had his nearby confrontation with busch,but when the prosecution began to explore the risk of harm to others at the start of trial the court expressed concern and admonished counsel to stay within the format of opening statements.nevertheless,before the case went to the jury,the trial judge refused a request by haines that the jury be instructed that only the danger to busch could be considered.
after retiring,the jury inquired can we consider that reckless conduct was directed only at busch or at other people the court responded that the state needed to prove that haines had brandished a loaded remington caliber rifle and pointed it at busch and that such conduct placed or might have placed another but not limited to danger of serious bodily injury.haines attorney again objected without effect.the conviction followed.
on direct appeal,haines counsel did not challenge the conviction but focused instead on whether the statutory minimum sentence applied and whether a pair of firearm enhancement provisions in the endangerment statute violated the state constitution double jeopardy clause.haines then began his travel through state and federal habeas proceedings.in this court,haines argues exclusively that his representation both at trial and in the state appeal were constitutionally inadequate.
an ineffective assistance claim requires haines to show that counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and that counsel failures were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.strickland washington,d.it will simplify matters to assume,overmuch in haines favor,that his present claims were all properly preserved in state court and that our review is de novo 
haines critique of his counsel performance at trial is not persuasive.in the first of two lines of criticism,haines says that he told his counsel that he did not point his rifle at busch but counsel did not press this contention at trial and instead effectively conceded the point in closing argument by stating that haines had stuck the gun basically in busch face.this,says haines,amounted to ignoring a promising line of defense and giving the case away to the prosecution.
however,counsel words fell short of conceding that haines had actually pointed the gun at busch pointing was not mentioned and counsel description fit within the picture presented by haines busch had come within six feet of her husband before turning away and that,pointing or not,haines was at least then holding the weapon in a threatening manner defensively,for the purpose of warding off a perceived attack.moreover,meyer gave positive and emphatic direct testimony that he had seen haines point the gun directly at busch,and it was not disputed that busch had rapidly left the scene.haines wife testified at first that the rifle had not been pointed at busch but her later testimony was less clear on this issue and as the defendant spouse she was especially vulnerable to impeachment although we recognize that meyer was a longtime friend of busch.haines previously argued that his attorney had improperly prevented him from testifying,but the state and district courts rejected that claim and we did not think that it warranted a certificate of appealability.
of course,if counsel had no other defense,failing to press even a marginal argument would take some explaining.but defense counsel did offer a fairly impressive argument based upon two interlocking claims first,that haines had reasonably felt threatened based on busch extraordinary conduct in suddenly running at him as well as other recent and prior events,the bar scuffle,the prior beating and second,that haines had warded off busch without endangering him by displaying the rifle with no bullet in the chamber.
this line of attack on the prosecution case may almost have worked the jury question suggests that it was in some doubt whether busch had been endangered.perhaps haines eccentricities,and the fact that when he was arrested his weapon did have a bullet in the chamber,counterbalanced the jury doubt.but at least there was no testimony as to whether the round had been chambered when busch was present as to whether the weapon had been pointed at busch,there was direct and unequivocal testimony from meyer against haines.
one might ask why,if it cost nothing,counsel did not also argue in the alternative haines current theory that he did not point the gun at busch.there is more than one answer that counsel could reasonably give but two are obvious to couple a weak argument with a stronger one may detract from the latter,and to contradict the direct and clear testimony of an eyewitness who was best positioned to observe a confrontation might weaken counsel own credibility in
