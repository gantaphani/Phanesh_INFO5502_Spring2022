kevin white appeals the district court denial of his petition challenging his cocaine conspiracy sentence.we affirm.
white argues that his attorney failed to challenge the quantity of drugs used in sentencing him and allowed him to be sentenced under a different statute than the one named in the indictment,thus constituting ineffective assistance of counsel.he further argues that this ineffective assistance justifies resentencing despite the otherwise valid waiver of appeal contained in his plea agreement.because ineffective assistance of counsel claims only survive a waiver of appeal if they directly relate to the voluntariness of the waiver,and because white does not challenge the validity of his plea,we affirm.
background 
from late through,kevin white and twelve associates bought cocaine and cocaine base in houston,concealed it in a spare tire,and then drove it to wichita falls where they converted most of the cocaine to cocaine base.the group would then sell the cocaine and cocaine base in wichita falls.this scheme came to an end when a grand jury returned a indictment against them on november.count one charged white et with conspiracy to distribute cocaine base in excess of one kilogram,to possess cocaine base in excess of one kilogram with intent to distribute,and to possess cocaine with intent to distribute,all in violation of.count one also parenthetically mentions a to indicate the predicate crime of the conspiracy charge.the indictment did not expressly indicate the appropriate punishment range under b,but count one includes quantities of cocaine base over one kilogram as part of the charged offense.moreover,the overt acts alleged in count one include nearly grams of cocaine base and over three kilograms of cocaine as well as other actions involving unnamed amounts of cocaine base.in addition to the count one conspiracy charge,white was also charged in counts four and five with possession of grams and grams of cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of a and b b iii.white was arrested the day after the indictment was returned.
on january,white signed a plea agreement under which he pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge in return for the dismissal of the two possession with intent to distribute charges.the plea agreement described the referenced conspiracy charge as a violation of based on conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base without citing the predicate statute or the quantity of drugs.the agreement stated the penalty range was ten years to life sentencing range applicable to offenses charged under b a.the plea agreement also contained a waiver of the right to appeal,expressly including a waiver of white right to challenge his sentence under.only three potential arguments were excepted from the waiver white could challenge a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum,an upward departure from the applicable guideline range,and the disparate treatment of cocaine and cocaine base in the statute.at the same time he signed the agreement,white signed the factual resume,which described the charged offense and alleged that white joined in transporting and selling cocaine base but makes no reference to any particular quantity of drugs.
the plea agreement was accepted by the district court at a hearing held on february.at the hearing,white agreed that he had read count one of the indictment,that he understood he was pleading guilty to that count,and that the applicable sentencing range was ten years to life.when the prosecution summarized the indictment and the factual resume,however,the prosecutor said that white had been charged with conspiracy in violation of title,united states code,sections a and b b iii.this was apparently the first and only time that b b was mentioned in this case in connection with the conspiracy charge.white agreed with the facts as read aloud and pleaded guilty.
at the sentencing hearing on april,white attorney challenged the presentence report because it connected more than kilograms of cocaine base to white,thus raising the base offense level used in the sentencing guideline calculations.white first argued that the government had entrapped him to sell a higher quantity of drugs than he would have sold of his own volition,but the court thought otherwise and overruled this objection.white attorney then argued that the drug quantity information came from coconspirators and rendered the report unreliable.when questioned by the court,white conceded that he may have sold to one kilogram of cocaine base but denied that the quantity was in excess of one and a half kilograms.the district court overruled the objection and found that the facts supported a reasonable finding that the quantity of drugs would be far in excess of one and a half kilograms.this relevant conduct along with the deduction for acceptance of responsibility led to a total offense level of,or a range of months of incarceration.the court imposed the minimum sentence of months,which fell within each of the statutory sentence ranges in b.
on direct appeal,white challenged both the disparity between the statutory sentences for cocaine and cocaine base and the court decision to overrule his sentencing entrapment argument.this court,in an unpublished opinion,affirmed the first point based on circuit precedent and refused to address the second claim because of his waiver of appeal.see united states white,cir.april,unpublished.white petition for certiorari in the supreme court was denied on october.
on september,white filed pro se the instant section motion to vacate,set aside,or reduce his sentence based on the government failure to provide dea lab reports establishing the quantity of drugs.he claimed that this absence of proof constituted new evidence compelling a new sentencing hearing and also alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to point out this shortcoming.white only response to the waiver of appeal was to claim that enforcement of the waiver would be a manifest miscarriage of justice.in an opinion issued october,the district court found that the waiver language in the plea agreement was clear and unambiguous and that white had knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights.because waivers of appeal are enforceable under those conditions,the district court denied white section motion.
white then filed a notice of appeal and petition for certificate of appealability coa.in his coa petition,white asserted for the first time that his attorney was deficient for allowing the government to convict him under b a while both the plea agreement and factual resume allegedly required that he be sentenced under section b b.he added that his waiver could not be knowing and voluntary under those circumstances.the district court denied the coa on december,citing the prior findings of fact and holding that white had not made a substantial showing of the denial of a federal constitutional right.
white appealed the petition for coa to this court.in his brief in support of that appeal,white inexplicably connected the statute cited in counts four and five of the indictment a and b b iii with the conspiracy charged in count one and,parenthetically,a and argued that he was charged under section b b but sentenced under section b a.for this reason,white argued,his sentence was illegal and his attorney was incompetent for allowing the error.he also possibly argued that the same problem rendered his waiver of appeal involuntary and unknowing,although the argument was couched in terms of the ineffective assistance of counsel.in an order dated may,this court liberally construed white brief as challenging whether his waiver of appeal was valid and granted him a coa on that issue.
i.the nature of white claim 
having granted a certificate of appealability on the validity of his waiver of appeal we must first make sense of white ineffective assistance of counsel arguments.to begin,we note that a defendant can waive his right to file a section motion,although such a waiver might not apply to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.united states wilkes,cir.we also note that a defendant may always avoid a waiver on the limited grounds that the waiver of appeal itself was tainted by the ineffective assistance of counsel.united states henderson,cir.white ineffective assistance of counsel argument therefore might proceed down either of two avenues.on the one hand,he may argue that the ineffective assistance of his counsel rendered his waiver involuntary.on the other hand,he may argue that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his sentencing and that all ineffective assistance of counsel arguments are immune from waiver.
having sifted through the petitioner pro se briefs,we are satisfied that white does not argue that ineffective assistance of counsel rendered his waiver involuntary.he spends the majority of his briefs arguing the ineffective assistance of his counsel based on his attorney actions at the sentencing hearing.in fact,white makes it clear at the conclusion of his reply brief that he does not challenge the validity of his plea but merely the propriety of his sentencing.nevertheless,white does argue at one point that because he was allegedly charged under section b b but sentenced under section b a,his waiver could not be knowingly or intelligently made.he also argues that his attorney induced him to sign the plea agreement based on this misrepresentation.
two factors indicate that white never meant to challenge the validity of his plea,however.first,white made these assertions as part of his larger argument.white follows the above assertions not with a claim that the above alleged error was reason enough to overturn his sentence on its own,but rather with an argument that ties those alleged factors to his counsel ineffectual performance at the sentencing hearing.the clearest reading of white argument is therefore that he is only challenging his sentencing and not his plea.this reading is supported by white unequivocal statement at the end of the reply brief.
second,white argument can not be connected to his plea without degenerating into nonsense.neither count one of the indictment nor the factual resume charges white with a violation of section b b white has again relied upon the statute cited in counts four and five instead of the text of count one.white stated under oath that count one of the indictment was correct,which connects him to the more than one kilogram of cocaine alleged in that count.this admission not only casts doubt on his later assertion that he should be held accountable to a lesser quantity of drugs,but it also prevents the application of any sentencing statute other than section b a.see b a iii providing penalties for fifty grams or more of cocaine base.white then acknowledged,both in writing in the plea agreement and orally at the plea hearing,that he was agreeing to be sentenced within a range of ten years to life.that sentence is imposed for a violation of section b a.while the prosecutor later incorrectly orally stated at the plea hearing that white was charged under section b b iii,white had already made these sworn admissions.white does even mention the prosecutor error or include it in his record excerpts,indicating that this can not be the source of his claim of error.instead,white openly refers to the text of counts four and five.finally,we note that the sentence actually imposed was well within the statutory limits for even the smallest quantity of cocaine base,and the district court was within its power when it looked at relevant conduct to assign the quantity of drugs within those statutory ranges.see united states doggett,cir.thus,even if white were arguing that this statutory confusion was somehow connected to the plea and rendered his waiver involuntary,that argument would be facially meritless and unsupported by the record.
we therefore understand white appeal as asserting that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his sentencing hearing.his explicit waiver of appeal bars this claim unless ineffective assistance of counsel claims can not be waived.accordingly,we turn to that question.
ii.waiver of ineffective assistance of counsel claims 
this circuit has not yet decided whether all ineffective assistance of counsel claims survive a valid waiver of appeal,although we have outlined the boundaries of the question.in united states wilkes,cir,this court held that an informed and voluntary waiver of the right to file a motion will be enforced.at the same time,we joined the ninth circuit in musing in dictum that ineffective assistance of counsel claims may be an exception to that rule.id.citing united states abarca,cir.the following year,in united states henderson,cir,we held that a waiver of appeal may not be enforced against a section petitioner who claims that ineffective assistance of counsel rendered that waiver unknowing or involuntary thus,wilkes and henderson provide answers to the questions that lie to either side of the present case.
this circuit has not yet decided,however,whether the henderson rule extends to the full reach of the wilkes dictum.that is,we have not yet decided whether a waiver of appeal remains valid if the section movant argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at stages of the proceedings other than the plea or waiver itself.while we affirmed without opinion the district court decision to enforce such a waiver in united states flunker,no.crim,wl,that decision lacks precedential force.we do not venture into unexplored territory,however.our sister circuits have addressed the instant question and all have concluded that waivers of appeal remain valid unless the ineffective assistance directly related to the knowing,voluntary nature of the waiver.we turn first to those cases,and then to our own decision on the matter.
a.other circuit decisions 
the first court to address the question was the ninth circuit.in united states pruitt,cir,the court reiterated that a plea agreement could not waive a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel erroneously unprofessional inducement of the defendant to plead guilty or accept a particular plea bargain,but distinguished the defendant case because he was only claiming ineffective assistance of counsel at the sentencing proceedings.id.at.the court did not develop this distinction,however,because the waiver of appeal did not expressly include section motions and thus could not be enforced anyway.id.nevertheless,this dictum suggested that the exception to waivers of appeal would be limited to those cases directly implicating the waiver.
the first case to actually enforce a waiver in circumstances similar to the instant case was united states djelevic,cir.in that case,before the court on direct appeal,the defendant argued that his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing could not have been waived.the second circuit emphatically reject ed this contention.id.at.because the defendant did not claim that his waiver was unknowing or involuntary,the court characterized his appeal as nothing more than an attempt to challenge the correctness of his sentence under the sentencing guidelines despite his explicit waiver of such challenges.id.the court feared that allowing this argument to prevail would permit all challenges to the sentence to be reconstituted as ineffective assistance challenges based on the attorney failure to obtain the desired result.the ensuing litigation would render the waiver meaningless.id.the djelevic court accordingly enforced the waiver.
later that year,the seventh circuit issued the first opinion to reach the same result in the context of section.in jones united states,cir,the court allowed a defendant to overcome a waiver and argue ineffective assistance of counsel in a section motion because the defendant alleged he received ineffective assistance in the negotiation of the agreement itself.id.at.the court compared that situation to cases where a waiver was procured through coercion or intimidation,in which it is intuitive that the waiver should not be enforced.id.the jones court was careful to limit its holding,however.mindful of the limited reach of this holding,we reiterate that waivers are enforceable as a general rule the right to mou
