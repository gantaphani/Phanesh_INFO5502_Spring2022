edward knight appeals from the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to d in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.knight argues that the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc erred in holding,first,that knight sixth amendment right to confrontation was not violated when the state trial court refused to allow him to pursue a particular area of inquiry during of a prosecution witness,and,second,that knight counsel was not constitutionally ineffective.
background 
on december,knight was indicted in massachusetts by the suffolk county grand jury for the murder and armed robbery of pasquale candelino.a jury trial was held in suffolk superior court,and on june,knight was found guilty of armed robbery and first degree murder.he received a life sentence on the murder conviction,and the armed robbery conviction was placed on file.on june,knight appealed.
on july,knight filed and later supplemented a motion for a new trial.on may,the superior court denied the motion.on may,knight appealed from the denial of his motion for a new trial,and that appeal was consolidated with the direct appeal from his conviction.both appeals were rejected by the sjc.commonwealth knight.
on july,knight petitioned the federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus.after a hearing and following issuance of a comprehensive memorandum,the district court denied the petition.knight thereupon filed a notice of appeal and an application for a certificate of appealability.the district court granted a certificate of appealability for the petitioner confrontation clause and ineffective assistance of counsel claims.
ii.supreme judicial court decision 
a state court factual findings are presumed to be correct under e.see gunter maloney,cir coombs state of maine,cir.the sjc found the following facts in knight case 
pasquale candelino was a year old man who resided in the north end section of boston.in the afternoon of saturday,june,his body was found by his landlord in the bedroom of his apartment.the apartment had been ransacked,drawers were open,doors,cabinet doors were open,and there was blood on the floor and the walls of the bedroom and bloody fingerprints inside an open drawer.these were not identifiable.
the medical examiner conducted an autopsy and determined that the victim died of multiple stab wounds to the neck.the victim had been stabbed ten times in the neck.the body was in an early state of decomposition with discoloration of the right side of the head and chest,and marbling of the skin and skin slippage and wrinkling of the forearms.
knight and his girlfriend,betsy kelley,were drug addicts who supported their habits principally by shoplifting.they had sold stolen goods to the victim in the past,and had also purchased pills from him.on wednesday evening,june,sometime after,they were in the north end looking for money to buy drugs.their normal hunting grounds,the malls,were closed.they saw the victim on the street,and knight suggested they rob him.kelley agreed.she approached the victim and asked if she could use the bathroom in his apartment.while kelley was in the victim apartment and the victim was in his bedroom,knight rang the door bell and kelley let him in.
knight hid behind the refrigerator in the kitchen.when the victim came out of his bedroom knight attacked him,pushing him back into the bedroom where a struggle ensued.kelley remained in the kitchen searching for drugs and money.kelley heard the victim saying,eddie are you doing what are you doing,and eddie,no.she also heard knight tell the victim to shut the fuck up.after the struggle ended,it was just quiet,and kelley heard drawers opening.when knight came out of the bedroom,he had blood on his sneakers.kelley and knight put drugs and stuff from the victim apartment in a black bag,then wiped the door knobs with their shirts as they were leaving.they went to a friend apartment,where knight told kelley he had killed the victim.
late in the evening of the next day,thursday,june,knight,kelley,and two friends left for florida on a bus that arrived in orlando on saturday morning,june.knight and kelley returned separately to the boston area the following week.after their return,they went to the boston public library and looked for newspaper accounts of the murder.the articles they found reported that the police believed the murder to have occurred on saturday,june,the day on which knight and kelley arrived in florida.knight told kelley not to worry,because they have the dates wrong.
in september,three detectives came looking for kelley at her father home where she was staying.her father was not at home,and she did not answer the door.after the detectives left,kelley telephoned her father and told him that she was in trouble and had been present when knight had killed someone.her father began arranging for a lawyer to represent her.kelley father drove her to a friend house,and she told the friend what had happened in the victim apartment on the night of the murder.
knight was arrested on december,and was indicted on december,for murder in the first degree and armed robbery.the indictment stated that the victim died on or about june.kelley was also indicted and,as arranged by her lawyer,surrendered to the police on january.after being held in jail pending trial for more than one year,kelley agreed to be interviewed by detectives and,in january,negotiated a plea agreement with the commonwealth.the agreement required that she testify at knight trial and plead guilty to manslaughter.the commonwealth agreed to recommend an sentence,guaranteeing kelley release from prison shortly after knight trial.
when kelley was interviewed,she told the detectives that the victim had been robbed and killed on june,before she and knight went to florida.thereafter,the commonwealth moved to amend the indictment to change the date of the murder to on or about june.after a hearing,the motion judge allowed the amendment over knight objection.
at trial,the commonwealth relied primarily on kelley testimony to establish knight guilt.the commonwealth also introduced evidence of a knife that police seized from knight when he was arrested on unrelated charges on june,five days after the victim body was found.the medical examiner testimony indicated that the knife was not inconsistent with the victim wounds.the defense relied primarily on the testimony of six witnesses from the victim neighborhood who testified that they had seen the victim at various locations on thursday,june,and friday,june,when the undisputed evidence demonstrated that kelley and knight were on a bus bound for florida.the commonwealth contended that these witnesses saw the victim often,and were simply mistaken with regard to when they last saw him.the defense contended that kelley testimony was a fabrication induced by the commonwealth offer of an sentence and by her fear of remaining in prison for life if she were convicted.the commonwealth attempted to rebut this contention by calling the friend to whom kelley had confided the details of the murder in september,long before her indictment,arrest,and incarceration.
in its opinion,the sjc considered knight claims of trial error,including those now included in knight habeas petition.
among the latter was knight challenge to the ruling by the trial judge that defense counsel could not,when betsey kelley,inquire about the effect upon her of the guilty verdict in the contemporaneous state trial of louise woodward,a british au pair,found guilty of murder in the death of an infant in her care.the judge in woodward case had subsequently reduced the jury verdict to involuntary manslaughter,vacated her life sentence,and sentenced her to time served.knight,at.the sjc held that the trial judge ruling excluding reference to woodward case had not violated knight constitutional right to confrontation under the sixth amendment to the united states constitution and article of the declaration of rights of the massachusetts constitution.id.the sjc said,inter alia,
t he judge did not improperly limit the defense of kelley because the jury were presented with sufficient evidence with which to assess her bias and credibility.she was extensively about her drug use,prior convictions of forgery,larceny,and fraud,her plea agreement with the commonwealth,and her fears about being convicted of murder and incarcerated for life.in this context,we conclude that the judge ruling excluding the minimally relevant but highly inflammatory line of questions about the woodward verdict was not error.
the sjc also reviewed certain of knight claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,applying the substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard applicable in appeals of first degree murder convictions in massachusetts.see.laws ch.this statutory standard is more favorable to the defendant than the federal constitutional standard articulated by the supreme court in strickland washington,d,or the massachusetts constitutional standard outlined in commonwealth saferian.see commonwealth wright.see also mello dipaulo,cir.the sjc held that knight counsel was not ineffective but rather had made a tactical decision in choosing not to call a seventh alibi witness that his failure to attempt to impeach kelley on her testimony regarding her use of the phone in the victim apartment was not ineffective and that defense counsel was not ineffective in putting forward the defense theory that the victim had died on friday,june rather than on wednesday,june.
iii.district court conclusions 
in its april,unpublished memorandum and order,the district court made the following conclusions about the issues in knight habeas petition.regarding the confrontation clause violation alleged to have resulted from denying about the case of louise woodward,the court held 
the sjc decision on the confrontation clause was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of the principles articulated in van arsdall delaware van arsdall,d.the woodward line of questioning did not involve a prototypical form of bias like a plea agreement or a sentence reduction,but rather was aimed at demonstrating that a verdict against another teenager in an unrelated case caused kelley to confess to a crime of which she was innocent.moreover,the topic of the woodward verdict was not necessarily otherwise appropriate,given its highly prejudicial nature and the weak showing of relevance made by the defense.
on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the district court concluded that knight counsel had not been ineffective,holding,among other rulings,that knight has not shown that the decision not to call danieli an alibi witness rendered his counsel or deprived him of a fair trial.regarding the decision not to kelley regarding her testimony about using the telephone in the victim apartment,the district court concluded that it was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law for the sjc to conclude that defense counsel was not deficient in declining to question kelley about her use of the telephone.defense counsel failure to object to kelley prior consistent statements was not so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have taken this approach.finally,the trial strategy not to emphasize the victim time of death in the closing was within the bounds of reasonableness.
iv.discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing a judgment on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,this court examines the legal conclusions of the district court,including the proper standard of review,de novo.norton spencer,cir.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa prevents a federal court from granting an application for writ of habeas corpus with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless that adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.id.the contrary to category embraces cases in which a state court decision directly contravenes supreme court precedent.mastracchio vose,cir citation omitted.the unreasonable application category includes cases in which the state court decisions,while not contrary to relevant supreme court precedent,nonetheless constitute an unreasonable application of that precedent.id.
the supreme court has said that u nder the contrary to clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially undistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.the unreasonable application analysis,however,affords relief only if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the petitioner case.id.at.
a state court need not cite or be aware of supreme court precedents so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the decision contradicts them.early packer,d.as noted above,determinations of fact issues shall be presumed correct,and the petitioner must rebut the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e.
confrontation clause 
knight argues in his petition for habeas corpus that it was a violation of the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the united states constitution for the state trial judge to have denied him the opportunity on to inquire of betsy kelley,the chief prosecution witness,whether the guilty verdict returned by the jury in a much publicized but unrelated massachusetts criminal case,commonwealth woodward,may have led her into supporting the government position.see knight,at,commonwealth woodward.the defense wished to argue that the subsequently reduced murder verdict in some to believe the british nanny was wrongly convicted of murdering the infant in her kelley that it was safer for her,even if knight and she were innocent,to lie in the prosecution favor,to testify untruthfully that knight had killed the victim on wednesday,june,while kelley was present in the apartment,rather than to join in knight alibi,supported by witnesses,that the victim was seen still alive on thursday and on friday afternoon,by which times knight and kelley had taken a bus to florida.knight attorney hoped the jury would analogize kelley to woodward,both of them being nineteen years old and unfamiliar with the legal system.he would argue that,upon hearing of woodward allegedly unjust conviction,kelley abandoned hope of prevailing on a truthful defense and opted to go along with the prosecution in exchange for a highly favorable plea bargain that ensured her own release soon after knight trial 
the trial judge,however,refused to allow defense counsel to refer to the woodward case,ruling it was very controversial,emotionally loaded,and insufficiently relevant.in upholding the ruling,the sjc characterized the proposed line of questioning as minimally relevant but highly inflammatory,knight,at.the trial court ruled that defense counsel could,however,inquire at length as to kelley concerns and fears about conviction,about incarceration,and anything of that sort.
the supreme court has recognized that the exposure of a witness motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of.delaware van arsdall,d citation omitted.but the court also noted that 
i t does not follow,of course,that the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment prevents a trial judge from imposing any limits on defense counsel inquiry into the potential bias of a prosecution witness.on the contrary,trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the confrontation clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such based on concerns about,among other things,harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues,the witness safety,or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.
in van arsdall,the supreme court held that a state court offends the confrontation clause when it prevents the defense from engaging in 
otherwise appropriate designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness,and thereby to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.
at.quoting davis alaska,d.regarding this approach,the first circuit has stated 
the first question to be asked under the van arsdall test is whether the limitation prejudiced the examination of that particular witness.in other words,absent the limitation,would the jury have received a significantly different impression of the witness credibility the second element of the van arsdall test is whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if so,reversal is not warranted.
dibenedetto hall,cir citations omitted.knight argues that the sjc and the federal district court erred in upholding the trial court ruling because knight was precluded from pursuing an entire line of questioning related to kelley views on the woodward verdict and as a result was prevented from addressing the crucial question of why she would testify against the petitioner if she and he were both innocent of any wrongdoing.knight further observes that the prosecution took unfair advantage of the fact that the defense had not explained kelley reason for testifying against knight when it argued at closing that kelley testimony was incredible because an innocent person with a good alibi would not falsely claim to have been involved in a murder.
the district court was plainly correct that the possible effect on kelley of the woodward verdict could not be said to involve a prototypical form of bias,the expression used by the court in van arsdall.as the district court found,knight sought merely to persuade the jury that a verdict against another teenager in an unrelated case caused kelley to confess to a crime of which she was innocent.in the present circumstances,this was scarcely a prototypical form of bias,such as a plea agreement or sentence reduction,as in van arsdall,where the defense counsel was wrongly prevented from asking a witness about his agreement to cooperate with the prosecution in exchange for dismissal of a drunk driving charge.at.
the claimed relevance of woodward was that its publicized jury verdict of second degree murder may have so enhanced kelley fear that she would be convicted of murder and sent away for life that,notwithstanding her actual innocence,she lied in order to secure the favorable plea bargain that promised her almost immediate release.we are not persuaded,however,that the introduction of woodward into the case would have given the jury a significantly different impression of kelley credibility.dibenedetto,at.without woodward,knight counsel was still able to point out the extremely attractive nature of the plea agreement to one in kelley shoes,with its assurance of nearly instant release,coupled with kelley natural worry that if she depended upon knight alibi defense she might still be convicted of matters on which was expressly allowed.thus,wholly apart from any impact of woodward,the basic components of knight challenge to kelley credibility were available.and while woodward was initially convicted of murder,that verdict was almost immediately vacated,and woodward herself released,making it less plausible that that case alone would have explained why an innocent kelley would have invented the story she told.to be sure,reference to woodward might have offered the defense some added color,but it also raised the danger of being used as a red herring.the trial judge found the woodward case to be very controversial and emotionally loaded in many different ways,hence,in effect,a potential detour to confusion of the issues.van arsdall,at.trial judges retain wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on based on concerns about,among other things,confusion of the issues or interrogation that is only marginally relevant.given the tenuous materiality of the woodward case and its potential for jury confusion,we think the trial judge ruling was constitutionally within his discretion.
knight compares his situation to that in davis,but the analogy is unpersuasive.in davis,the supreme court ruled that a state court had erred when it refused to admit evidence of potential bias of a prosecution witness in the form of the fact that the witness was on probation.at.here,however,knight was permitted to introduce evidence of kelley prior drug dealing and of her plea agreement.the information about her alleged reaction to the woodward verdict was not relevant in the same way,if at all.the woodward verdict had no role in the case and had nothing to do with kelley past history as a drug dealer and user.
we think knight has not demonstrated that the trial court ruling constituted an unreasonable application of supreme court law and so violated the sixth amendment.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
knight also argues that the sjc unreasonably applied clearly established federal law by failing to accept his claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.specifically,he complains about four alleged errors made by his attorney counsel decision not to object to the introduction of prior consistent statements made by kelley counsel decision not to call a seventh alibi witness,phyllis danieli counsel failure to kelley about using the victim telephone and counsel argument to the jury concerning the time of the victim death.
a criminal defendant claiming a sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel violation must establish that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.smiley maloney,cir quoting strickland,at.under the first prong of strickland,there is a strong presumption that counsel strategy and tactics fall within the range of reasonable professional assistance,and courts should avoid counsel performance with the use of hindsight.strickland,at.
it is all too tempting for a defendant to counsel assistance after conviction,and it is all too easy for a court,examining counsel defense after it has proved unsuccessful,to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.
id.it is only where,given the facts known at the time,counsel choice was so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have made it,that the ineffective assistance prong is satisfied.under the prejudice prong,not all errors by counsel are sufficient to meet the standard of a reasonable probability that,but for the counsel errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.rather,a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.smiley,at quoting strickland,at.this is a highly demanding and heavy burden.williams,at.a defendant failure to satisfy one prong of the strickland analysis obviates the need for a court to consider the remaining prong.strickland,at.
this circuit has held that where the sjc applies its more favorable substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard,its decision will not be deemed to be contrary to the strickland criterion 
t he sjc rejected the petitioner ineffective assistance of counsel claims under a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice standard that the sjc says is more favorable to a defendant than the saferian standard,which we have said is the functional equivalent of the strickland standard.we therefore conclude that the sjc applied a standard of ineffective assistance of counsel that is at least as favorable to the petitioner as the federal standard.
mello dipaulo,cir.
to warrant habeas relief under the unreasonable application standard,knight must show that the counsel work fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that but for the ineffective assistance,the outcome of the case would have been different.knight has not made a showing regarding the first prong with respect to any of his four ineffective assistance claims,so we do not reach the second prong of the analysis.
failure to object to prior consistent statements 
knight argues that his counsel should have objected to the admission of testimony by kelley stating that she had told her father and another person,two months afte
