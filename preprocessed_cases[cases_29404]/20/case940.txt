petitioner jack lavelton nicholson,a federal inmate serving a sentence imposed in the eastern district of virginia,has been awarded a certificate of appealability the coa on the district court denial of his motion for a writ of habeas corpus.see nicholson united states,the opinion the coa,issued by this court on november,relates to whether nicholson lawyer had an actual conflict of interest during nicholson sentencing proceedings and presents the question of whether his sentence should be vacated due to the denial of his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.as explained below,nicholson lawyer had an actual conflict of interest when nicholson was sentenced,and we reverse and remand for a determination of whether that conflict adversely impacted the performance of his lawyer in nicholson sentencing proceedings.
nicholson seeks to vacate his sentence,pursuant to,on the basis that his lawyer had an actual conflict of interest and provided him ineffective assistance of counsel in his sentencing proceedings.under,a petitioner may collaterally attack his sentence and seek habeas corpus relief if the sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states.after a district court has denied a motion,the petitioner is not entitled to pursue an appeal unless he has been granted a coa,see id.c b,which may be issued only if the petitioner has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,id.c.the coa must indicate the specific issue or issues on which it is granted.see id.c.although nicholson pursued several ineffective assistance claims in the district court,he has been granted a coa on only one issue did an actual conflict of interest cause his counsel to render constitutionally ineffective assistance when he failed to move for a downward departure united states nicholson,cir,order granting coa.thus,this appeal is limited to an evaluation of that issue.
in connection with the coa,nicholson asserts that his lawyer was operating under an actual conflict of interest at his august,sentencing hearing because,at that time,nicholson lawyer,jon babineau,was representing nicholson as well as another client,lorenzo butts.butts had previously threatened to kill nicholson and his family,had attempted to kill nicholson brother,and had already killed nicholson.nicholson,who was convicted of a federal offense for his possession of a firearm and ammunition by a felon,asserts that he carried the handgun to protect himself from butts.nicholson maintains that babineau,during the sentencing proceedings,failed to request a downward departure based on nicholson need to carry the handgun because,in so doing,babineau would have accused his other client butts of uncharged criminal conduct.nicholson asserts that an actual conflict of interest thus existed,and that it adversely affected the performance of his lawyer during the sentencing proceedings,in contravention of his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.
nicholson was arrested on january,in portsmouth,virginia,on a state charge of possession of a firearm by a felon,after a police officer found a handgun on his person this charge was eventually dropped and replaced by a single federal charge of possession of a firearm and ammunition by a felon,in violation of g,a,and e.nicholson was indicted by the federal grand jury on march,and he was taken into federal custody on april.
when the virginia authorities first arrested nicholson,he made statements to the arresting officers that he had obtained the handgun for his personal protection because he feared a man named lorenzo butts and his associates.these statements included the following in early,nicholson brother,rudolph nicholson,had agreed to assist federal officers in their attempts to uncover various criminal activities of butts and his associates.following this arrangement,on march,rudolph was shot seven times by butts son,vito,in portsmouth.although rudolph survived this vicious attack,an assassin dressed as a priest attempted to enter rudolph hospital room in norfolk,virginia,where he was treated for two months while under protective custody and again tried to kill him.around may,nicholson and his mother,sandy nicholson,were informed by federal officers that butts had placed a contract on nicholson life,in an endeavor to have him killed and influence his brother rudolph.on september,charles nicholson,rudolph father and nicholson,was fatally shot multiple times by two men on a street in portsmouth.
after his was murdered,nicholson obtained a handgun from a friend and left portsmouth to stay with a cousin in alexandria,virginia.in early,he returned to portsmouth to meet with his probation officer.nicholson still had the handgun,which did not work,in his possession.he had it repaired in portsmouth on january.the next day nicholson was stopped and searched by portsmouth police officers,who found the handgun and arrested nicholson for the illegal possession of a firearm.
following his january,arrest,nicholson retained attorney jon babineau to represent him on the state charge,and that representation continued over to the subsequent federal charge.according to nicholson affidavit,he explained to babineau on several occasions that he only had the handgun to protect himself from butts.nicholson told babineau that he was afraid of butts because butts had placed a contract on his life and had already killed nicholson,threatened his mother,and attempted to kill his brother.nicholson mother,according to her affidavit,told babineau that the only reason her son carried the firearm was his fear that butts was going to kill him,and she also explained to babineau butts other threatening actions against her family.
babineau,on the other hand,has asserted by affidavit that nicholson never advised him that he was fearful of butts.instead,he asserts that nicholson told him that he needed the handgun for protection due to dangerous situations created by some activities in which he was involved,but he did not say that he feared he would be harmed by butts.babineau also stated that sandy nicholson nicholson mother only spoke with him about his attempts to get her son a downward sentencing departure for his substantial assistance to law mentioning butts or his threats.when babineau arranged for federal agents to debrief nicholson,with a view toward providing substantial assistance,nicholson informed the agents that he did not have any information regarding butts and was not sure what butts looked like.during discovery in the federal prosecution of nicholson,babineau received nicholson statements from the prosecutors.those statements explain that nicholson only carried the handgun for protection against butts and his associates.
on november,butts was arrested by local and federal authorities in the eastern district of virginia on conspiracy,drug distribution,and firearms charges after a trial in federal court,butts was found guilty on april,of multiple offenses.babineau did not represent butts at the trial but,on may,he served as butts counsel during a preliminary hearing conducted in virginia state court on conspiracy,murder,and firearms charges.both prior to and during the time babineau was representing butts in these state proceedings,babineau was representing and advising nicholson on whether he should accept a proposed plea agreement from the government on nichsolson federal indictment babineau never informed nicholson that he was also representing butts on state criminal charges,nor did babineau seek nicholson consent to represent both clients during the same time frame.on may,the government offered a plea agreement to nicholson,and a plea hearing was scheduled for may.on may,babineau informed the prosecutors that nicholson had decided not to plead guilty at the scheduled hearing,but that babineau believed nicholson would eventually plead guilty.
on june,nicholson pleaded guilty to the federal offense of possession of a firearm and ammunition by a felon,in violation of g,a,and e.his guilty plea was tendered without a plea agreement,because nicholson would not agree to waive his right of appeal.during the rule plea colloquy,the government acknowledged that it was reasonable to believe that someone might try to injure or shoot nicholson.after nicholson plea proceedings,butts terminated his initial counsel thomas shuttleworth in his ongoing federal proceedings and,on june,notified the district court that babineau was his lawyer.babineau then received the presentence investigation report on butts the butts psr,which contained information implicating butts in rudolph shooting and the murder of nicholson.it also stated that butts hit list included nicholson.on july,nicholson presentence investigation report the nicholson psr was issued,and it pointed out that nicholson had advised the authorities that he carried the handgun for protection because he feared an individual who was trying to harm him.
on july,babineau served as butts counsel at his sentencing proceedings in the eastern district of virginia.he also served as butts lawyer on his appeal to this court,which was filed on july.as part of that appeal,babineau maintained,inter alia,that the district court had erred by admitting trial evidence of butts prior bad acts,including evidence of the attempted murder of rudolph and the murder of nicholson.see united states butts,cir.
the sentencing hearing for nicholson was conducted in the district court on august.during the hearing,babineau sought a downward departure under section of the sentencing guidelines because of nicholson health,which the district court denied at the hearing,the prosecutors advised the court that certain individuals were trying to kill nicholson at the time of his arrest.nicholson explained to the court that he only carried the handgun to protect himself from the persons who had killed his and had attempted to kill his brother.babineau,however,did not mention any of the circumstances surrounding nicholson arrest,nor did he request a downward departure based on the necessity of nicholson carrying the handgun.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court adopted the nicholson psr,accepting the recommendation of a base offense level of with a criminal history category of vi.this placed nicholson in the guidelines range of months.the statutory minimum for nicholson offense,however,was months,and the court sentenced him to months 
nicholson thereafter appealed the district court denial of a downward departure based on his poor health.his sentence was affirmed by our unpublished opinion of june.see united states nicholson.cir.on june,nicholson filed his motion in the eastern district of virginia,claiming ineffective assistance of counsel.by its opinion of october,the court,without conducting a hearing,denied relief.see opinion.in so ruling,the district court concluded that babineau simultaneous representation of butts and nicholson did not create an actual conflict of interest because babineau was not representing nicholson and butts in cases arising from the same set of circumstances.see id.at.the court further concluded that,even if there was a conflict of interest,any necessity defense interposed by nicholson at trial would have been unsuccessful.see id.at.the court did not address whether it would have been objectively reasonable for babineau to seek a downward sentencing departure based on necessity and 
nicholson applied for a coa on december,and,on november,we granted the coa on whether an actual conflict of interest caused babineau to render constitutionally ineffective assistance when he failed to move for a downward departure in nicholson sentencing.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to and 
in general,in an appeal relating to the denial of a motion,we review a district court legal conclusions de novo.see united states roane,cir.because the district court denied relief without a hearing,it was not able to make findings of fact on disputed factual issues.although the court did not characterize its disposition of this matter as either a dismissal or an award of summary judgment but simply as a denial of relief,it did weigh and consider the affidavits and other materials submitted by the parties.thus,its ruling was in the nature of a summary judgment award to the government in reviewing an award of summary judgment,we review the facts in the light most favorable to the party,which,in this appeal,is nicholson.see seabulk offshore,am.home assur,cir.we review de novo any mixed questions of law and fact addressed by the district court on whether the petitioner has established a valid sixth amendment ineffective assistance claim.see smith angelone,cir whether counsel performance was constitutionally adequate is a mixed question of law and fact which we review de novo.internal quotation marks omitted.
in support of his coa,nicholson contends that the district court erred in concluding that babineau simultaneous representation of butts and nicholson,as spelled out above,did not create any actual conflict of interest,and thus did not result in nicholson being provided with constitutionally ineffective assistance.the sixth amendment guarantees an accused the right to effective assistance of counsel,see strickland washington,d,and an essential aspect of this right is a lawyer unhindered by conflicts of interest.mickens taylor,cir en banc,aff,d see also cuyler sullivan,d.in general,to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim,a petitioner must establish that his lawyer performance was deficient by showing that his performance fell below an objectively reasonable standard,and that his deficient performance prejudiced the petitioner case.see strickland,at.see also mickens,at.
we have recognized that,as a general proposition,t he effective performance of counsel requires meaningful compliance with the duty of loyalty and the duty to avoid conflicts of interest,and a breach of these basic duties can lead to ineffective representation.united states tatum,cir.when a petitioner premises his ineffective assistance claim on the existence of a conflict of interest,the claim is subjected to the specific standard spelled out in cuyler sullivan,d,instead of that articulated in strickland.see strickland,at.to establish that a conflict of interest resulted in ineffective assistance,m ore than a mere possibility of a conflict must be shown.tatum,at emphasis removed.the petitioner must show that his lawyer was under an actual conflict of interest and that this conflict adversely affected his lawyer performance.sullivan,at.if the petitioner can show an actual conflict,and that it adversely affected his lawyer performance,prejudice is presumed and there is no need to demonstrate a reasonable probability that,but for the lawyer conflict of interest,the trial or sentencing outcome would have been different.see sullivan,at.in evaluating and applying these principles,we recognize that an adverse effect is not presumed from the existence of an actual conflict of interest.see mickens,at.that said,we assess each of the two prongs of the sullivan test in turn,that is,whether babineau had an actual conflict of interest,and whether that conflict adversely affected babineau performance in nicholson sentencing proceedings.
nicholson first contends that the district court erred in concluding that there was no actual conflict of interest when babineau simultaneously represented both nicholson and butts.to establish an actual conflict of interest,nicholson must show that his interests diverged with respect to a material factual or legal issue or to a course of action.gilbert moore,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted see also tatum,at concluding that actual conflict of interest exists when lawyer is required to account to two masters or when lawyer fails to take action on behalf of one client because it would adversely affect another.
by its opinion,the district court determined that babineau was not operating under an actual conflict of interest,because he was not representing both defendants or potential defendants in an action arising from the same set of circumstances or transactions.opinion.the court determined that babineau was not required to attack the innocence of one client in order to serve the other,as butts was not facing any charges rel
