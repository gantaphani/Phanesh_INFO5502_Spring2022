standard of review 
our review of the district court denial of habeas relief is de novo.see shuman spencer,cir.
pursuant to aedpa,our standard of review of the sjc decision depends on whether that court adjudicated on the merits lyons due process claim.healy spencer,cir quoting d see also fortini murphy,cir aedpa strict standard of review only applies to a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.if it did,we 
ha ve no power to afford relief unless lyons can show either that the sjc decision affirming the conviction was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as reflected in the holdings of th e united states supreme court cases,or that it was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the state court record

t his is a highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings,which demands that decisions be given the benefit of the doubt,and that the defendant seeking habeas show that the state court ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.

constitutional claim 
before getting into the merits of lyons claim,we must first address a preliminary matter.
the commonwealth asserts that we should affirm the district court denial of habeas relief b ecause the sjc analyzed lyons evidentiary claim pursuant to massachusetts state law and e rrors of state law do not provide a basis for federal habeas corpus relief.to be sure,i t is a fundamental principle of the law of federal habeas corpus in cases that no habeas claim is stated as to state court criminal convictions unless the alleged errors are violations of the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.kater maloney,cir citing estelle mcguire,d.undeniably,if nothing other than questions of compliance with state law were at issue,then we would agree with the commonwealth however,that is not the case.as previously stated,the commonwealth concedes that lyons properly raised the federal nature of his claim in his
