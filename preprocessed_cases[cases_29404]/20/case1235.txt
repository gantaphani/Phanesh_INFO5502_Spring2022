gary salinas petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied as.proceeding pro se,salinas concedes that his petition was untimely when it was originally filed but argues that intervening events have rendered his petition premature,not late.specifically,salinas reasons that the texas court of criminal appeals effectively restored him to the direct review phase of his appeal when it granted him the right to file an petition for discretionary review in that court,and that this action requires federal courts to measure the statute of limitations under the and effective death penalty act aedpa,only from the moment at which the court of criminal appeals subsequently declined to review the merits of his petition.as a result,salinas avers,his petition should have been dismissed without prejudice.concluding that the relief granted by the court of criminal appeals had no effect on aedpa statute of limitations,we affirm.
salinas was charged with capital murder and attempted capital murder.a jury found him guilty and assessed two life sentences.the intermediate court of appeals affirmed in an unpublished opinion on july.
the next logical step in salinas appeal would have been the filing of a petition for discretionary review pdr with the court of criminal appeals.he had thirty days from july in which to do so,or days in which to request an extension of time.see.a,c.this did not happen,however,because he spent the next seven months in jail,unaware that his conviction had been affirmed.his lawyer,edward garza,had prepared a letter notifying him of the result,but neglected to mail it.
it was not until march,response to an inquiry from garza notified him that the appeal had been unsuccessful and that his duty to represent him was now terminated.in response to a second letter,garza told salinas that,time restrictions notwithstanding,he did not think salinas possessed an issue meriting discretionary review and that salinas only remedy was perhaps to file a habeas petition.
playing the cards he was dealt,salinas filed a pdr and a motion for extension of time on april,but the pdr was dismissed as time barred on april.he filed a state application for habeas relief,arguing in part that his appellate counsel had failed to advise him timely of his right to file a pdr pro se.following a remand to determine when garza had informed salinas that his conviction had been affirmed,the court of criminal appeals denied salinas application for habeas relief without written order on march.
salinas filed a federal habeas petition on april.the state asked the district court to dismiss the petition as.aedpa provides that a period of limitations shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.see d.under the present facts,this period runs from the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.see d a 
in texas,a pdr is considered to be part of the direct review process,which ends when the petition is denied or when the time available for filing the petition lapses.roberts cockrell,cir.salinas appeal was affirmed on july,and he had thirty days from that date to file a pdr with the court of criminal appeals.because august,was a saturday,he had until august to file a pdr and until august of the following year to seek federal habeas relief.with eighteen days remaining on the federal clock,he filed a state application for habeas relief,an event that tolls the federal statute of limitations.see d.thus,when his state habeas application was denied by the court of criminal appeals on march,he had eighteen days to file a federal habeas petition.the petition was not filed,however,until april.
a magistrate judge recommended that the district court equitably toll limitations,but the district court disagreed and dismissed salinas petition on november.on the same day,and without knowledge of the district court action,salinas mailed a motion to the district court informing it of the central fact in this appeal acting on its own motion on october,the court of criminal appeals had reconsidered the state habeas petition and decided to award salinas the right to file an pdr.the effect of this was to return salinas to the point at which he can file a petition for discretionary review for purposes of the texas rules of appellate procedure,all time limits shall be calculated as if the court of appeals decision had been rendered on the day the mandate of the court of criminal appeals issues.ex parte salinas,at.
thus,under state law,salinas was restored to the position of a recently convicted felon,eligible to pursue a form of direct review in the court of criminal appeals in light of this development,his letter to the district court asked that it dismiss his federal habeas application,without prejudice,for failure to exhaust state remedies.when the court received that letter several days later,it concluded that it was without jurisdiction to grant the requested relief,because it had already ruled on the state motion to dismiss the petition as.
the question is whether,as a corollary to the revival of salinas right to file a pdr,aedpa statute of limitations has not yet run on his petition.if it has run,we must also consider whether the district court abused its discretion in declining equitably to toll limitations.
the state argues that the issue is before us pursuant to an improvidently granted certificate of appealability coa.the district court dismissed salinas petition as untimely before it knew of the court of criminal appeals decision to grant the pdr,and as a result,the state argues,the district court did not have an opportunity to consider the issue we decide today.citing united states armstrong,cir,the state contends that the issue therefore was not preserved for appeal.
we disagree.salinas letter informing the district court of the action taken by the court of criminal appeals and asking for a dismissal without prejudice was received within ten days of the entry of judgment.it is therefore properly construed as a federal rule of civil procedure e motion to alter or amend the judgment,and the issue was properly before the district court as a result,we have jurisdiction to review salinas claims.
we must consider the effect the court of criminal appeals order has on aedpa statute of limitations,a question of law we review de novo.egerton cockrell,cir.when the court of criminal appeals grants the right to file an pdr,it restores the petitioner to the position he was in when he first possessed the right to petition for discretionary review a defendant who still has the right to file a pdr is considered to be in the midst of the direct review process.roberts,at.
on this basis,salinas urges that the statute of limitations could not have lapsed in april,because the prescription period should have begun only on the conclusion of direct review,see d a,and direct review once again was pending on november,when the district court dismissed his petition.thus,salinas argues,his conviction was,and the statute of legitimately initiated in august be deemed to have begun again with the rejection of the pdr in january.
we disagree.on its face,aedpa provides for only a linear limitations period,one that starts and ends on specific dates,with only the possibility that tolling will expand the period in between.see d.so long as the petitioner is being held pursuant to the same state court judgment,nothing in aedpa allows for a properly initiated limitations period to be terminated altogether by collateral state court action.rather,the statutory framework only provides for the tolling of limitations during the pendency of state collateral review.see d.
thus,the issue is not whether the court of criminal appeals action revitalized salinas limitations period,but rather whether the existence of that potential relief prevents the limitations period from starting to run until after that level of appeal has been denied.that is to say,we need to determine whether,in texas,the mechanism by which salinas obtained the right to file an pdr is part of the direct or collater
