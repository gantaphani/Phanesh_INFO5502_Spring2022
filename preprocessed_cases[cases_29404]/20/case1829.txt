during and after michael cheeks trial for murder and home invasion,he received letters from his former girlfriend,maria brown,who was also a witness at trial.these letters,he argues,demonstrate that the government knew brown testified falsely during his trial about whether he was living at the home where the death occurred,at the time it occurred.cheeks counsel used the letter received during trial that asked why he came home to cross examine brown nonetheless,a judge convicted him on all counts after a bench trial.when cheeks received additional letters after trial,the state court held an additional hearing.brown testified,and the state court concluded her testimony had not been falsified.cheeks maintains that the state court decision to uphold his convictions do not control here because the state court did not rule on his federal claim that the state knowingly presented false testimony at trial.testimony about whether he was living at the home had no effect on his murder conviction,however.the state court transcripts confirm that it rejected cheeks argument not because he had committed a forcible felony,but because he was the initial aggressor.cheeks received concurrent sentences for the murder and home invasion counts,and cheeks points us to no benefit that would come from reviewing only his home invasion conviction.we therefore deny his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
introduction 
michael cheeks,maria brown,and their child moved into a home on hickok street in university park,illinois in november.the home was rented from brown cousin,and only brown name was on the lease.in march,while brown and cheeks were still living together,brown began dating derrick peterson without telling cheeks.on august,brown informed cheeks that he could no longer live in the hickok street home.nonetheless,cheeks was at the home on the morning of september.brown called cheeks mother later that day and asked her to tell cheeks not to come to brown home that night.brown could hear cheeks in the background during the conversation and heard his mother give him the message.
that night,brown went to sleep in the hickok street residence while peterson watched television in her bedroom.peterson,fully clothed,later woke brown,wearing a nightshirt,to say he thought someone was in the house.brown got out of bed and encountered cheeks in the hallway.after cheeks let go of brown,she went to her bedroom to call.cheeks came into her bedroom holding a knife and cut the phone cord.when cheeks saw peterson,cheeks said,you do have a man in my house,do you man,get out of my house before i kill you.peterson tried to run out of the house but fell in the hallway,and brown could hear the two men struggling.she followed the men down the hallway and asked cheeks what he had done.when a motion sensor light came on,she saw a pool of blood.brown suggested that peterson sit down because he was losing blood,and cheeks pushed peterson to the ground.an officer arrived shortly thereafter and found cheeks outside with his hand on the door handle of a car driver side.after the officer told cheeks to lay down,cheeks said,go ahead and shoot me to the officer three or four times.paramedics arrived within a few minutes,but peterson had passed away.the coroner later concluded that peterson died from a single stab wound to the chest.
cheeks was charged with peterson murder and with home invasion in illinois state court.during the ensuing bench trial,cheeks received a letter from brown that said,i must make you pay for what you did when i take the stand i still confused about that night you know i really do know exactly what i said in my statement i held myself responsible for his life so now i have to make sure that you get held responsible for his death instead of me when i done with you believe me you will never see the light of day if i have anything to do with it and i do cause what the jury is gon na think of you when i leave the stand is that you deserve life the letter also said,you know he peterson could have killed you but he did he spared your life maybe you was afraid maybe he intimidated by being so much bigger than you and not showing any fear.the letter also asks,why did you come home cheeks counsel used the letter to cross examine brown at trial.
brown testified at trial and said at one point that cheeks did not have permission to be in her home the evening of peterson death.at another point,she was asked,i s it fair to say that michael cheeks was,in fact,living at the location on hickok after august,she responded,he was there after that but not with my permission,yes.she also testified that she considered him not living at the house after august,though she acknowledged that she had not had him removed when he subsequently came back.in response to the question,and at that time michael cheeks was still living in your house on september,is that correct,brown answered,he was still there.
an investigating officer testified that he found possessions belonging to cheeks at the hickok residence and that cheeks identification cards showed he lived at the hickok address.law enforcement officials also testified that they saw what appeared to be blood on the kitchen window,that cheeks hat was found in the sink below the window,and that a box of kitty litter partially blocked the locked back door when they arrived.one officer testified that after receiving his miranda rights,cheeks said he had entered through the back door but then had no response to the question of how he could have done so without disturbing the box of kitty litter.at the close of the evidence and after hearing arguments from both sides,the judge found cheeks guilty of murder and home invasion.at the sentencing hearing,the judge stated he had decided to impose a sentence above the statutory minimum because cheeks was on parole at the time of the offense,had been in and out of the criminal justice system for the previous eleven years,and had a criminal history including stolen cars,drug dealing,and drug possession.the judge sentenced cheeks to concurrent terms of years imprisonment on the murder charges and twenty years imprisonment for home invasion.
following the trial,brown wrote additional letters to cheeks.in one,she wrote 
i was advised that was the way to go i wanted you to go to j ail for my o w n personal reasons and who knows maybe if i had told the truth about you living their you would have so much time,but i seen a way to get you out of my life and i took it.
in another letter,she wrote 
oh and no hard feelings about you not living their you see i wanted you to go to jail and if i had actually let someone know that you was living their you may have not went at least that is what was advised of me the very first night.
she signed this letter,got ta go ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha your grim reaper.
after receiving these letters,cheeks filed a pro se petition in illinois state court under illinois hearing act.he argued that his counsel was ineffective for failing to reveal perjury by the state key witness and attached copies of the two letters.an illinois circuit court judge denied the request.cheeks then appealed,arguing that the trial court should have considered the petition as a claim under.comp.stat,which provides a statutory means of obtaining relief from certain judgments,including those based on perjured testimony.the illinois appellate court agreed and concluded that cheeks had stated a claim under that provision.illinois cheeks,d.
back in the illinois circuit court,cheeks moved to vacate the judgment pursuant to.comp.stat.and again argued that brown had given false testimony at his trial as evidenced by the letters he had received from her.the parties filed a stipulation that,if called to testify,brown would testify that the statements made by her in the letters were true.the circuit court denied cheeks motion to vacate.after cheeks moved for reconsideration,the court held a hearing.brown testified,saying that on the date of the incident,cheeks lived with her on a part time basis and was free to come and go as he pleased.the circuit court denied the motion for reconsideration,concluding that the position brown took at the hearing as to whether cheeks lived at the residence on the date of peterson death was yes and no,which is pretty much the position she took during the course of the trial.cheeks appealed,and the illinois appellate court affirmed,saying that cheeks had not proved by clear and convincing evidence that brown testimony was perjured.it noted that brown testified at trial both that she did and did not consider cheeks to live at the hickok residence between august,and september.and,said the appellate court,she testified to the same at the section hearing.in addition,the appellate court ruled that the letters contained evidence that was cumulative to that presented at trial since the letter received during trial contained the statement,why did you come home,and cheeks used this statement as a basis for extensive cross examination regarding whether cheeks lived at the residence on the night of peterson death.the court therefore affirmed the circuit court denial of cheeks motion to vacate the judgment.the supreme court of illinois denied leave to appeal.
cheeks then filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,alleging that the state knowingly used perjured testimony to obtain the conviction.the district court denied cheeks habeas request and ruled that cheeks had not demonstrated that the state court holding that brown did not commit perjury was an unreasonable determination of the facts.it concluded that the trial and appellate courts findings that brown did not commit perjury are at least minimally consistent with the evidence.it did not obtain the trial court transcripts before making this determination and it seems to us a difficult determination to make without the transcripts they have been added to the record after argument on appeal.cheeks appeals the denial of his request for a writ of habeas corpus.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
as a person in custody pursuant to a state court judgment,to be eligible for a writ of habeas corpus cheeks must demonstrate that he is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.a see guest mccann,cir.when a habeas petitioner claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings,section d of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa provides that a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus only if the state court adjudication of the claim was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d,or the state court decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.d.
section d does not control here,though,because,as we said,it only applies to a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.see d canaan mcbride,cir.cheeks did not present to the state court his current claim that the government knowingly used false testimony against him,and the state court never ruled on this claim.as a result,this claim was not adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings for purposes of d.therefore,we use here the general standard set forth in,which requires us to dispose of the matter as law and justice require.see guest,at canaan,at braun powell,cir.
procedural default 
that cheeks did not raise his current claim in the state court leads to another issue.the state argues that we should not consider his current claim because it has been procedurally defaulted.in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,cheeks asserted that the state knowingly used false testimony to obtain his conviction.a prosecutor knowing use of false testimony violates the united states constitution due process clause.united states agurs,d pyle kansas.shasteen saver,cir.a witness testimony need not have been knowingly false and hence perjury to succeed on such a claim rather,a prosecutor knowing use of false testimony is enough to infringe upon a defendant right to due process.shasteen,at quoting united states boyd,cir.
the state maintains that cheeks should not be allowed to bring this argument in his habeas proceeding because he did not first raise it in the state court.a state petitioner seeking a writ of habeas corpus in federal court must first exhaust the remedies available to him in state court,b a,thereby giving the state the opportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of its prisoners federal rights.baldwin reese,d citations omitted.to afford the state this opportunity,the prisoner should fairly present his federal claim to each appropriate state court before seeking relief in federal court.perruquet briley,cir.a habeas petitioner who has exhausted his state court remedies without properly asserting his federal claim at each level of state court review has procedurally defaulted that claim.lewis sternes,cir.although cheeks raised a perjury claim to the state court,he agrees that he did not assert a claim in the state proceedings that the state knowingly used false testimony in his trial.as a result,he has procedurally defaulted his current claim.
procedural default,however,does not create an absolute bar to habeas relief in federal court,and it does not implicate the jurisdiction of the federal court.lewis,at perruquet,at.rather,procedural default is an affirmative defense.grigsby cotton,cir lewis,at.t he decision whether to assert an affirmative defense like procedural default lies with the illinois attorney general in the first instance and in the ordinary course of events,her failure to raise the defense in a timely manner will result in a forfeiture.see perruquet,at.when the state forfeits the procedural default defense,the decision whether to allow the state to interpose the defense somewhat belatedly is one committed to the district court sound discretion.lewis,at.
the district court noted in its disposition that it would not allow the state to belatedly assert a procedural default defense.see grigsby,at declining to enforce procedural default when untimeliness should have been clear to the state.we agree with cheeks that at the least,the state forfeited a procedural default defense in this case by not timely asserting it before the district court.in defense of its failure to raise procedural default in its response to cheeks petition,the state explains that it assumed cheeks federal petition raised the same claim he had asserted in state court.but cheeks had argued to the state court that brown testimony had been perjured,and in ruling against that claim,the illinois appellate court specifically wrote that cheeks did not assert that the state knowingly used perjured testimony from brown.in his federal habeas petition,cheeks asserted that the state knowingly used perjured testimony to obtain his conviction,the same language the state court clearly stated cheeks had not asserted to it.moreover,the state answer to cheeks habeas petition in the federal district court set forth the proper federal constitutional standard for the claim cheeks raised in his habeas petition,which is a different standard than for the perjury claim he pressed in the state court.see shasteen,at.we will not disturb the district court determination that the procedural default should not be enforced.see also torzala united states,cir declining to enforce procedural default when claim ultimately had no merit buggs united states,cir same 
no effect on murder conviction 
we have said that a conviction obtained by the knowing use of false testimony should be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the.schaff snyder,cir quoting agurs,at.cheeks contends that the state knowingly used false testimony from brown at trial about whether cheeks was living at the hickok street dwelling on the night of peterson death,and that such testimony affected his murder and home invasion convictions.the state has several responses.it maintains that the statement in one of the letters,if i had actually let someone know that you was living their sic,undercuts any suggestion that the state knew about any false testimony on brown part and that no ev
