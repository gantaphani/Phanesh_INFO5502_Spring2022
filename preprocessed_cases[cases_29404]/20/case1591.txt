a jury imposed a capital sentence on jeffrey hill for the aggravated murder of his mother,and hill now challenges a district court decision denying his petition for habeas corpus relief.among a host of other claims,hill emphasizes that his lawyers failure to hire a mitigation psychologist until the day before the mitigation hearing constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.even assuming that the delay in hiring this psychologist amounted to objectively defective lawyering,we agree with the district court that hill has not shown that the delay prejudiced the penalty phase of his because the mitigation theory that the psychologist did present that hill was suffering from cocaine psychosis at the time of the murder did not differ in material ways from the one that would have been presented with more preparation and,second,because nine psychological and background assessments of hill had already been undertaken by the time the mitigation psychologist had been hired and all of them were submitted to the jury during the sentencing hearing.because we reject this claim and hill other claims as well,we affirm.
early in the morning on march,jeffrey hill,then years old,visited his mother,emma hill,at her apartment.he borrowed from her under the pretext of needing money to buy cigarettes,left the apartment and bought some crack cocaine even though he had consumed nearly worth of crack cocaine the preceding night.
when he returned within the hour,his mother,who was partially paralyzed from a stroke,complained that he did not visit her regularly.an argument between the two ensued and eventually ended when hill stabbed his mother ten times with a kitchen knife.according to hill later confession,his mother said,why why did you do this as she lay dying on the floor next to her bed.ja.hill did not respond and instead searched her belongings for more money that he could use to buy crack.finding another,hill left his mother in the apartment,locked the door behind him and drove away in his mother car.after disposing of the knife,he smoked more crack cocaine and,at some point along the way,met a friend,charlotte jones.
that evening,hill returned to his mother apartment,leaving jones waiting in the car after telling her that he was stopping off to get some money from his he later testified that he returned to see if she his mother was all right.ja.having forgotten to take the key with him when he locked the apartment,he forced the door open,went into her closet and took the he found there.
later that night,a police officer stopped hill for driving without lights.spotting a crack cocaine pipe next to the driver seat and eventually learning that hill lacked a license and had an outstanding arrest warrant,the officer took hill into custody.two days later,the police found emma hill body in her apartment.when homicide detectives questioned hill about his mother death,hill initially denied knowing about her death but,after being confronted with inconsistencies in his statements,confessed to the murder.further investigation corroborated hill confession the police found a bloodstained knife where hill confessed he had abandoned it the wounds proved to be consistent with ones that would be made by the knife and money found in the car carried blood stains consistent with emma hill blood type.
a grand jury indicted hill,charging him with aggravated murder during a robbery count,aggravated robbery count,aggravated burglary count and theft of a motor vehicle count.when hill expressed an interest in raising an insanity defense,the trial court appointed psychologists to evaluate him.after these evaluations,the ohio trial court found hill competent to stand trial,and the three psychologists who evaluated him for insanity each concluded that at the time of the murder he did not lack the ability to know right from wrong or to refrain from the act had he chosen to do so.hill abandoned the insanity defense and argued his innocence at trial.at the end of the guilt phase of the trial,a jury convicted him on all counts.
at the mitigation hearing,hill counsel presented testimony from four witnesses designed to persuade the jury to give him a life sentence rather than a death sentence.his mitigation psychologist,myron fridman,testified that hill cocaine addiction and intoxication affected his actions at the time of the murder.fridman testified that hill was addicted to cocaine at the time of the murder and that crack addicts who consume large amounts of cocaine may enter a mental state called cocaine psychosis in which they become irrational,violent and aggressive.fridman also testified that hill would be a good candidate for rehabilitation because he would not have access to cocaine in prison.and hill counsel submitted into evidence nine reports detailing hill mental health and describing various aspects of his family history,all of which hill supplemented by testifying himself during the sentencing hearing.
when asked at the sentencing hearing if he remembered stabbing his mother,hill answered,not really,ja,but his testimony otherwise corresponded to his earlier confession.after the sentencing hearing,the jury recommended that hill be sentenced to death,concluding that the aggravating murder during an aggravated the mitigating factors presented by hill.the trial court accepted the jury recommendation.
represented by new counsel,hill appealed his conviction and sentence to the hamilton county court of appeals,see state hill,wl ohio,and to the ohio supreme court,see state hill,ohio,but each court affirmed the jury verdict and the death sentence.after the united states supreme court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari,hill ohio,d,hill sought relief in the state courts.the court of common pleas rejected each of hill claims,and the hamilton county court of appeals affirmed.state hill,wl ohio.june.
after the ohio supreme court declined to exercise discretionary review,ohio hill,ohio,hill filed a habeas corpus petition in federal district court,asserting grounds for relief ranging from ineffective assistance of counsel to prosecutorial misconduct to assorted errors by the state trial court.in two separate opinions,the district court denied the writ of habeas corpus,concluding that all of hill claims either failed on the merits or were procedurally defaulted.hill now brings this appeal.
hill argues,first and foremost,that his attorneys failure to hire a mitigation psychologist until the day before the mitigation hearing violated his right to counsel under the sixth and fourteenth amendment.we disagree.
when a constitutional claim reaches us on a petition for habeas corpus,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat,ordinarily limits our review of the relevant rulings.w ith respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings,aedpa permits federal courts to grant habeas relief in only two instances if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or if it was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d emphasis added.but when a claim has not been adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings,and has not been procedurally defaulted,we look at the claim de novo rather than through the deferential lens of aedpa.maples stegall,cir where,as here,the state court did not assess the merits of a claim properly raised in a habeas petition,the deference due under aedpa does not apply.
the ohio court of appeals spoke to the claim in this way 
hill claims in his fourth assignment of error that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because counsel only contacted fridman,the addiction specialist who testified during the mitigation phase of hill trial,a day before he testified.hill proffered fridman affidavit in the court below it stated that he had been contacted after the guilt phase of hill trial,that he did not meet hill until the morning he testified,and that had he evaluated hill earlier,he could have done an evaluation of hill and testified specifically about hill and his addiction as opposed to addiction in general.hill also referred to the affidavit of hawgood as an example of the type of testimony which could have been presented to the jury had fridman been contacted earlier.the record demonstrates that fridman was contacted one day before he testified.while we are puzzled by counsel seeming inattention,hill claim is res judicata because it could have been raised on direct appeal.
state hill,wl,at.thus,while hill presented this claim to the state courts on collateral review,they declined to reach the merits,reasoning that because he could have raised the issue on direct appeal but had not,res judicata barred consideration of the claim.
the district court concluded that this procedural ruling did not bar habeas review of the underlying constitutional claim.reasoning that claims are not barred by res judicata under ohio law when evidence outside the record is presented,the district court harmony with greer mitchell,cir concluding that when the record reveals that the state court reliance upon its own rule of procedural default is misplaced,we are reluctant to conclude categorically that federal habeas review of the purportedly defaulted claim is precluded that hill was not required to raise this claim on direct appeal and that this claim is properly before the court for a merits review.op,at.the district court,accordingly,gave de novo review to this claim on its merits,and so do we.
in giving de novo review to the merits of hill constitutional claim,we apply the familiar framework for analyzing claims set forth in strickland washington,d.to show ineffective assistance of counsel,a petitioner must show that counsel performance was deficient,and that the deficiency prejudiced the defense.wiggins smith,d citing strickland,at.to establish deficient performance,a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.quoting strickland,at.and to establish prejudice,a petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.quoting strickland,at.in the context of a death sentence,the question of prejudice turns on whether there is a reasonable probability that,absent the errors,the an appellate court,to the extent it independently reweighs the have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.strickland,at.
in this case,the state has not argued that hill lawyers performed effectively,and the district court assumed that his lawyers had not performed adequately in hiring fridman one day before the mitigation hearing.the question under these circumstances is whether hill has demonstrated that his attorneys deficient performance prejudiced him.like the district court,we do not believe that their tardiness in hiring a mitigation psychologist prejudiced hill.
first,this is not a case in which expert psychologists did not have an opportunity to examine hill until the eleventh hour.before hill mitigation psychologist,fridman,testified at the mitigation hearing,numerous other psychologists had already evaluated hill at various times to determine his competency to stand trial and to determine his appreciation of what he was doing at the time of the assault.in determining that hill was competent to stand trial,the trial judge heard the testimony of five mental health experts who had assessed hill competence,at least three of whom were psychologists who had each interviewed hill twice.during these evaluations,hill claimed to hear voices speaking to him,but the psychologists concluded that he was malingering,contriving these hallucinations to avoid having to stand trial.in addition to these competency took place between july and september in addition to a concurrent period of treatment for hill at the dayton mental hospital forensic unit,the trial court also ordered additional evaluations concerning hill mental status at the time of the offense.in response to this order,the same three psychologists who had already interviewed hill twice regarding his competency each interviewed him a third time in february to reassess him in light of his plea.following these evaluations by mental health experts,hill attorneys moved in march for funds for a mitigation specialist,presented the opportunity to suggest an actual specialist during a did not follow up on hiring the mitigation specialist until the jury found hill guilty on june.
as this chronology illustrates,when hill attorneys finally retained fridman on june,the day before the mitigation hearing,they were not suddenly asking a psychologist to examine hill for the first time.extensive examinations of him had already been done.and during the penalty phase and mitigation hearing,hill attorneys introduced into evidence nine reports examining his mental health.see smith mitchell,cir finding no prejudice where,after a number of psychologists examined defendant for competency and sanity,one of those psychologists was later appointed as a mitigation specialist and prepared her mitigation report the same day she testified,relying primarily on records she had received from her earlier examinations id.at we find no cause or prejudice under strickland because all of this evidence was presented at mitigation.as exhaustively detailed above,virtually all of the mitigating elements that the defendant complains of were presented via the expert testimony and her mitigation report.williams coyle,cir finding no prejudice where the evidence the defendant claims should have been introduced goes to a theory of mitigation that the jury found did not outweigh the aggravating circumstances.
second,despite the hiring delay,fridman testified at the mitigation hearing that he conducted his evaluation of hill in much the same way that he normally would have evaluated a patient he considered available historical documentation and events he reviewed seven prior reports put together by the other psychologists who had examined and interacted with hill and he interviewed hill.in addition to his extensive knowledge of the impact of a addiction on behavior,in other words,fridman considered all of the same sources for applying the mitigation theory to this case that he would have considered had he been given more time.see smith mitchell,at,finding no prejudice where mitigation expert relied on earlier reports addressing competency and considered the same types of sources fridman considered here.
third,fridman testimony at the hearing fairly presented a theory of mitigation,and hill has not shown how that testimony was materially different from the testimony he would have presented had he been given more time to prepare for the hearing.fridman testified that crack use can cause a very,very intense addiction with a compulsive behavioral need to continue to use the drug.ja.users who consume high doses of crack cocaine over a period of time,fridman continued,may enter a mental state that has been called cocaine psychosis,which is characterized by mental confusion,irrational behavior and paranoia.ja.when a crack addict comes off a period of heavy use,fridman told the jury,he can enter abstinence syndrome,a condition in which a crack addict is often capable of behaving and doing anything to get his drug,including behaving in very irrational ways.they can certainly be violent,aggressive.ja.
after laying this foundation,fridman gave his opinion,formed to a reasonable degree of professional certainty,that hill was addicted to cocaine at the time of the murder and had been so addicted for some time before that.after characterizing hill as a addict,fridman repeated that an addict who has just binged on a lot of crack and who has abstinence syndrome can be directed by his need,his overwhelming intense need for more of the drug.ja.
this testimony presented the mitigation theory that hill cocaine addiction and cocaine use played a pivotal role in his behavior at the time of the murder.at the same time,fridman testified,to a reasonable degree of professional certainty,that hill would be a proper candidate for rehabilitation if he were placed in jail for the rest of his life.all of these factors considered,fridman late hiring did not undermine hill efforts to present this mitigation theory to the jury.see hicks collins,cir finding no prejudice where counsel relied on a psychologist who testified only about cocaine intoxication and not about cocaine psychosis,instead of retaining a separate expert to do so,and where evidence of guilt was so overwhelming that even if the jury had heard about cocaine psychosis,the result would not have changed williams coyle,at finding no prejudice in counsel failure to present additional evidence on a mitigation theory that the jury heard a version of and found did not outweigh the aggravating factors.
attempting to rebut this conclusion,hill argues that affidavits by a psychiatrist,gary sales,and by a psychologist,julia hawgood,demonstrate how a properly prepared expert could have and should have testified.but the two affidavits offer testimony that does not differ in substance from fridman testimony,that at best differs from fridman testimony at the margins and that does not suffice to create a reasonable probability that the jury would have been swayed to see the issue differently.
sales affidavit,for example,indicates that hill was addicted to and intoxicated by cocaine at the time of the murder.but fridman testimony covered that ground when he testified that hill was a cocaine addict and that an addict who had just binged on the drug would have an overwhelming intense need for more crack.ja.as hill admitted he had consumed worth of crack the previous night and had consumed more crack shortly before stabbing his,in short,he had just binged on is difficult to see how fridman presented a conclusion that differed in any material way from sales proposed conclusion.sales affidavit also describes the physiological and chemical effects of cocaine in an effort to explain how cocaine use influences behavior.but,again,fridman testimony did the same,albeit in a more abbreviated fashion,when he explained how cocaine use changes behavior,leading to violent,aggressive,paranoid and irrational tendencies.and while sales describes hill mother as emotionally distant and authoritarian,a fact that fridman did not address,the jury learned this information through the earlier psychological reports admitted into evidence.moreover,sales conclusion that hill relationship with his mother was good and had improved since his father death would not necessarily have advanced hill cause.emphasizing that hill had developed an increasingly healthy relationship with his mother just before killing her risked doing more harm than good for his position.
also unavailing is the argument that hawgood affidavit provided information materially different from fridman expert testimony.while the hawgood affidavit provides more information about hill and his mother background than fridman did,hill fails to explain why this additional information would have been likely to persuade a jury to give him a life rather than a capital sentence and why at any rate its absence from fridman testimony affected the jury deliberations given that much of this background information was in the nine psychological reports presented to the jury during the penalty and mitigation phases of the case.the information about the difficulties hill mother experienced during her her parents divorced when she was young,forcing her to act as a parent to her younger creating more sympathy for the victim than for hill.and most of the information in the hawgood affidavit describing hill mother as controlling and hill and his brother to harsh physical punishment and verbal humiliation,including beating them with electrical cords and a belt,locking the refrigerator door during certain hours of the day and removing locks from the boys doors to make it easier for her to inspect their included in the nine psychological reports submitted in the penalty and mitigation phases.ja describing discipline with belts and extension cords,concluding hill was the product of a very troubled,dysfunctional family,reporting that hill mother was at times abusive and demeaning to hill.hawgood also described the profound impact that the death of hill father had on hill,but this too was presented through the nine psychological reports.indeed,hill himself testified during the mitigation hearing that the death of his father led him to turn to crack.ja recounting that hill said his father remained his best friend and that it was emotionally very distressing to him when his father died of cancer in,hill testifying that he started smoking crack when his father died,that he felt lost and hurt by his father death and that he turned to crack because he thought it would solve his problems.in the end,the hawgood affidavit either echoed points about hill and his family background that were already covered in other mitigation evidence or related to hill cocaine addiction and concerned hill psychological state at the time of the effectively presented by fridman actual testimony.compare wickline mitchell,cir finding no prejudice where counsel did not present any evidence of defendant allegedly troubled upbringing,including devastat ing death of one parent and troubled relationship with other parent.
doubtless,fridman testimony would have benefitted had he been hired earlier and had he been given more time to review hill record and background.but,to establish prejudice,hill needs to do more.in contrast to cases involving a complete failure to investigate or a complete failure to put on any mitigation specialist,the question here is whether the late hiring of a mitigation specialist had a reasonable likelihood of altering the jury verdict,particularly when all of the affidavits already relate in one way or another to the mitigation evidence that hill attorneys did present.see smith mitchell,at finding no prejudice where,other than inconclusive evidence of a brain disorder,defendant failed to point to any mitigating evidence that was not actually presented.when examined in the context of cases finding prejudice and declining to find prejudice,we do not think that showing has been made.compare johnson bell,cir finding no prejudice in failure to present testimony by defendant family members,even though it would have humanized him by showing he had been a good son,brother and parent,because the evidence fell short of the quantum of evidence needed to establish a reasonable likelihood of a different verdict,wickline,at finding no prejudice where counsel did not present any evidence of defendant allegedly troubled upbringing,including devastat ing death of one parent and troubled relationship with other parent,williams coyle,at finding no prejudice where the evidence the defendant claims should have been introduced goes to a theory of mitigation that the jury found did not outweigh the aggravating circumstances,allen woodford,cir finding no prejudice where counsel did not introduce mitigation evidence showing the defendant could be pleasant because that evidence would not have outweighed the aggravating circumstances,williams cain,cir finding no prejudice where counsel did not present evidence of defendant troubled family history,including verbal and physical abuse,because it was unlikely to have a mitigating effect against the aggravating evidence,which included the brutality of the murder,his prior criminal history,the fact he hid evidence and the fact he initially lied to police,and frey fulcomer,cir finding no prejudice where counsel did not mention every available mitigating factor the tragic death of defendant son,defendant impotence,his deteriorating marriage,his somewhat low iq and his psychological weakness because these facts presented no reasonable probability the jury would have balanced the mitigating and aggravating factors differently,with wiggins,at.finding prejudice in a case involving new testimony about repeated physical and sexual abuse,williams taylor,d finding prejudice in a case where counsel failed to uncover extensive records graphically describing williams nightmarish childhood,coleman mitchell,cir finding prejudice where counsel presented no evidence of defendant personal background,psychological history or potential organic brain dysfunction,carter bell,cir finding prejudice where counsel performed no investigation and presented no evidence of defendant illegitimacy,family history,limited education,low and declining iq,mental condition and positive relationships with children,skaggs parker,cir finding prejudice when the only mitigation evidence presented came from a fraudulent psychologist,resulting in the presentation of essentially no mitigating evidence at all,especially concerning defendant mild mental retardation and diminished mental capacity,hardwick crosby,cir finding prejudice where counsel presented no mitigating evidence of defendant alcohol and drug intoxication at the time of offense or of his abusive family life,silva woodford,cir finding prejudice where counsel failed to investigate defendant childhood,mental illnesses,organic brain disorders and substance abuse,battenfield gibson,cir finding prejudice where counsel failed to present any evidence during mitigation phase,including facts surrounding prior felony conviction that suggested the crime was an act of self defense,antwine delo,cir finding prejudice where counsel failed to investigate fully defendant mental condition and did not present evidence of defendant bipolar disorder and the corresponding possibility that he was in the throes of a manic episode during the offense,and lewis lane,cir finding prejudice where counsel stipulated at mitigation hearing to the existence of two prior felony convictions that did not,in fact,exist.
as these cases illustrate,in order to establish prejudice,the new evidence that a habeas petitioner presents must differ in a substantial strength and subject the evidence actually presented at sentencing.here,by contrast,hill description of the evidence that a prepared mitigation specialist would have presented resembles the evidence the jury did have before it in weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors.nothing in this new testimony suggests that it would have stood out to the jury in such a way as to change the calculation the jury previously made when weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the murder.
hill also argues that a psychologist would have testified that cocaine addiction qualifies as a mental disease or defect under ohio law.but sales and hawgood that hill presents as examples of not make that point.neither one concludes that hill lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law,as ohio revised code b defines mental disease or defect.to say that hill would not have killed his mother but for his intoxication,as sales does,ja,is not to say that hill could not understand that his actions were wrong or that his intoxication prevented him from refraining from murder.that the experts he holds out as model witnesses fail to make this point undermines his claim that fridman would have made the point had he been given more time to prepare for the hearing.
hill also contends that if his lawyers had timely hired the mitigation specialist,hill mental health issues could have been addressed earlier in the process,which would have helped hill communicate more productively with his lawyers.hill br.at.but hill mental health issues were identified early on,as evidenced by the competency hearings long before trial,and hill did receive treatment as a result.see ja ordering hill to the dayton forensic unit for further evaluation and treatment.
hill,lastly,argues that fridman limited preparation time hindered his ability to testify about hill significant depression while he was in jail awaiting the trial.sales affidavit,hill points out,shows that hill hallucinations in jail demonstrated not malingering,as many of the psychological reports concluded and as the prosecution tried to demonstrate through its of fridman,but rather major depression.as the district court pointed out,however,testimony about hill behavior after the offense did not diminish the mitigating effect of the central thrust of fridman cocaine played a large part in hill behavior at the time of the murder.op.july,at.
pointing out that his attorneys failed to provide civilian clothing,as opposed to prison garb,for him to wear at the trial,hill next argues that this failure amounted to both ineffective assistance of counsel and a violation of due process.we disagree.
the ohio court of appeals,on collateral review,addressed the ineffectiveness component of this claim in this way 
in his second assignment,hill claims he was denied effective assistance of counsel because he appeared in jail garb during his trial.to support his claim below,he provided an affidavit stating that his attorneys failed to honor their promise to provide him with street clothes for trial,and that he attended trial in jail garb.he also provided the affidavit of the mother of his child,who confirmed that he attended trial in jail garb.hill claims this evidence was sufficient to warrant a hearing on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.we believe hill claim could and should have been raised at trial or on direct appeal and,thus,is res judicata.
state hill,wl,at.
as with his claim,hill relies on evidence outside the record affidavits asserting that he was in jail garb during the trial and testimony that his attorneys promised to provide him with civilian clothing to present this claim.and as with the claim,the ohio court of appeals improper application of its res judicata rule does not bar our review,see greer,at does the state contend otherwise.because the state court did not reach the merits of this federal claim,we review the claim de novo.maples,at.
even if hill attorneys erred in failing to provide him with civilian clothing,a point we need not decide,hill has not shown how the error prejudiced him.in his appellate briefs,hill does not even address the prejudice prong of strickland,which by itself suffices to reject this claim.see wiggins,at.nor do we see how he could show prejudice.as the district court explained,the jury learned from the outset of hill trial that he had confessed to killing his mother.in the aftermath of hill confession,it tests the limits of credulity to suggest that appearing before the jury in jail garb somehow cloaked petitioner with a veil of guilt sufficient to present a reasonable probability that hill would not have been convicted or sentenced to death had he appeared in civilian clothes.op.july,at.
for somewhat similar reasons,hill claim arising from the same appearance during the trial in jail up short.the ohio court of common pleas,the last court to address this claim,rejected the claim on procedural grounds 
petitioner second claim for relief alleges that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel and due process because he was forced to go to trial in his jail garb.as to this claim,the court makes the following findings of fact 
the record reflects that petitioner did no t object to being tried in his jail garb.
this claim could have been raised on direct appeal as petitioner was represented by new counsel.
no demonstration has been made that,had petitioner counsel secured for hill alternative clothing,the outcome of his trial would have been different.
based upon the above findings of fact,this court makes the following conclusions of law for this claim for relief 
no constitutional violation is established on this record as defendant did not object to being tried in his jail garb.estelle williams,d.
this claim is barred by res judicata.state perry,ohio.
no prejudice is demonstrated.
without a properly documented allegation of prejudice sufficient to show a reasonable probability that the verdict at trial would have been different,a claim of ineffectiveness must be summarily rejected.state bradley,ohio,state kapper,ohio.
ja parallel citations omitted.
in attempting to overcome this procedural bar,hill has not shown how any error,even if it occurred,prejudiced him,which is one of the requirements for circumventing the adequate and independent ground of the state court ruling.see maupin smith,cir considering whether the inmate failed to comply with a firmly established state procedural rule,whether the state enforced the procedural rule,whether the failure to comply with the state rule constitutes an adequate and independent ground for the decision and whether the petitioner has demonstrated cause for disregarding the state procedural rule and whether the alleged constitutional error prejudiced the inmate.accordingly,this claim is rejected as well.
hill next raises several challenges to the jury instructions on intoxication and claims ineffective assistance of counsel stemming from his lawyer failure to establish a meaningful relationship.we reject each claim.
the trial court erred,hill first asserts,by failing to instruct the jury about intoxication,which under ohio law may in some circumstances prevent an individual from forming the requisite intent to commit murder.according to hill,the failure to issue the jury instruction during the guilt phase of the trial deprived him of due process.
the ohio supreme court addressed this claim on direct review 
in proposition of law no.x,hill argues plain error because the trial court did not,sua sponte,instruct the jury to consider hill cocaine intoxication in deciding either his guilt or the recommended penalty we reject this proposition.
first,hill failed to request any instruction as to the effect of intoxication.thus,hill waived all but plain error.state underwood,ohio,at syllabus.a,b.the evidence of hill guilt,as well as the evidence supporting the death penalty,negates any claim that but for the error,the trial result clearly would have been otherwise.state underwood,syllabus.
second,we have traditionally recognized a trial judge discretion as to whether to instruct a jury on intoxication as a defense.see state fox,ohio,nichols state,ohio,paragraph two of the syllabus.as nichols stated at,we will not impose a requirement for a trial judge to so instruct a jury,since i ntoxication is easily simulated and often voluntarily induced for the sole purpose of nerving a wicked heart.
moreover,the evidence does not reasonably raise the intoxication issue.i ntoxication is not raised as a defense to the element of purpose in a criminal prosecution merely because the evidence suggests reduced inhibitions,impaired judgment or blurred appreciation by the defendant of the consequences of his conduct.state hicks,ohio,syllabus.
in this case,hill drove away from his mother house,obtained cocaine,and drove back.then he stabbed her ten times,searched for and found money,and drove away again.when he left after killing his mother,he locked her door behind him.then,he took the precaution of discarding the murder weapon.three days later,he recalled and described the events of the murder to police.his careful,calculated steps refute any claim that cocaine use interfered with his capacity to entertain the purposeful intent to kill.see state slagle,ohio,state hicks,supra,at.
state hill,at parallel citations omitted.
applying aedpa deference without objection from the parties,the district court decided that the ohio supreme court decision was not objectively unreasonable.applying the same standard again without objection from the parties,we agree.hill has failed to identify any decision by the supreme court holding that the constitution requires trial courts to give jury instructions on intoxication as a defense to a murder charge,and at least one decision undermines this argument.see montana egelhoff,d plurality rejecting claim to have the jury consider evidence of defendant voluntary intoxication id.at.ginsburg,concurring rejecting same claim on grounds that a state can decide that those who voluntarily intoxicate themselves are as culpable for committing a proscribed act as those who are stone sober.
in response,hill argues that in re winship,d,and martin ohio,d,establish that flawed jury instructions may violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.perhaps so.but nothing in winship or martin requires a jury instruction on intoxication under circumstances like these.winship held only that the due process clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.at.and martin held that no due process violation occurs when a jury instruction requires a defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she acted in,because the state still must prove the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.at.to the extent hill means to suggest that the absence of an intoxication instruction establishes that the state failed to meet its burden of establishing the mens rea element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,that too is wrong.as the ohio supreme court explained,the state did prove the specific intent element hill careful,calculated steps refute any claim that cocaine use interfered with his capacity to entertain the purposeful intent to kill.state hill,at.
nor did hill trial attorneys provide ineffective assistance by failing to request jury instructions on intoxication during the guilt phase.the ohio supreme court rejected this claim on the merits 
we also reject hill proposition of law no.xi,claiming ineffective assistance of counsel.defense counsel need not make fruitless requests for jury instructions,such as those on intoxication.thus,counsel decision not to request such instructions reflected professional judgment not falling below an objective standard of reasonable representation.state bradley,ohio,at paragraph two of the syllabus.hill also failed to demonstrate prejudice.no reasonable probability exists that the result of the trial would have been different if counsel had requested such instructions.state bradley,at paragraph three of the syllabus.
state hill,at.
because the ohio courts addressed this claim on the merits,aedpa deference applies.the ohio supreme court decision is neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of governing law.the state high court applied the correct standard,as the case upon which it relied,state bradley,sets out strickland and prejudice inquiries.see at.and the state court reasonably applied strickland in concluding that the decision not to request an intoxication instruction fell within the range of permissible strategy options available to hill trial counsel.during the guilt phase,hill counsel chose to contest whether the murder qualified as a by arguing that the robbery did not occur at the same time as or in connection with the murder.had the jury agreed with this it agreed in other words that did not would not have been eligible for the death penalty.see ja closing defense arguments during guilt phase.in choosing to emphasize this strategy and in choosing not to challenge intent,hill counsel did not act the risk that the intent argument would have diminished the focus on the contention and given numerous weaknesses in the intent argument.even assuming that hill was intoxicated at the time of the murder,the brutal facts of the case stabbing the victim ten times,searching immediately for money,locking the door,discarding the murder weapon placed substantial obstacles in the way of arguing credibly that hill did not have the requisite intent to kill or the capacity to have such intent.and applicable ohio law further dimmed the prospects of succeeding with this argument.see state dennis,ohio,stating that even severe intoxication can with purpose to kill.because hill counsel performed reasonably in making this strategic decision,the ohio supreme court did not err in rejecting hill claim,much less apply the strickland rule in an objectively unreasonable way.see strickland,at.noting that j udicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential,warning against ing and the distorting effects of hindsight and setting out a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.
hill next argues that his attorneys denied him effective assistance by failing to establish the essentials of an relationship.the ohio court of appeals considered this claim on review and rejected it on res judicata grounds 
in his first assignment of error,hill alleges that jail logs reflecting the number of visits by counsel demonstrate that counsel failed to provide the attention necessary for a capital case and,thus,that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.to further support this claim below,hill provided three affidavits the affidavit of a criminal investigator stating the number of times hill counsel visited him in jail the affidavit of a clinical psychologist who examined hill after the trial,stating that hill counsel failed to develop a strong relationship with hill,based on the alleged infrequency of visits,and the affidavit of hill stating that the more he saw and trusted the persons that provided him treatment while he was incarcerated,the more he spoke with them.to the extent that hill claim challenges counsel conduct at trial,it is res judicata.to the extent hill claim challenges conduct outside the record,the evidentiary material offered to support hill claim fails to demonstrate that the failure to visit hill more often rendered the trial fundamentally unfair.

the ohio court thus rejected this claim on procedural grounds res judicata as well as on the merits based on the affidavits submitted by hill and based on its conclusion that the trial was not fundamentally unfair.whether we consider this a claim in which hill must overcome a procedural default or a claim in which he must overcome the aedpa standard of review for matters handled on the merits by the state court makes no difference to the resolution of this claim.either way,hill would have to establish prejudice arising from the claim,and he has not done so.even granting hill the assumption that his relationship with his lawyers was not what it should have been,he has not shown how that failing affected the advocacy they provided him.see wheat united states,d in evaluating sixth amendment claims,the appropriate inquiry focuses on the adversarial process,not on the accused relationship with his lawyer as such quotation marks omitted.hill has given us no explanation how additional meetings with his counsel,or longer meetings with his counsel,would have led to new or better theories of advocacy or otherwise would have created a reasonable probability of a different outcome.under these circumstances,he can not establish an essential prerequisite for showing of accordingly the claim can not succeed.
we now turn to several claims arising from the mitigation phase of hill trial.
because his attorney failed to request a jury instruction on intoxication as a mitigating factor during the penalty phase of the trial,hill claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.the ohio supreme court rejected this claim on the merits on direct review at the same time that it rejected the comparable claim arising from the guilt phase of the trial that we addressed above.
in proposition of law no.x,hill argues plain error because the trial court did not,sua sponte,instruct the jury to consider hill cocaine intoxication in deciding either his guilt or the recommended penalty we reject this proposition.
first,hill failed to request any instruction as to the effect of intoxication.thus,hill waived all but plain error.state underwood,ohio,at syllabus.a,b.the evidence of hill guilt,as well as the evidence supporting the death penalty,negates any claim that but for the error,the trial result clearly would have been otherwise.state underwood,syllabus.
as to the penalty phase,the trial court fully instructed the jury on sentence deliberations and to consider all of the evidence and arguments presented.the trial court need not instruct the jury to give particular weight to any specific evidence,such as hill cocaine use.the fact that an item of evidence is admissible does not automatically mean that it must be given any weight.state steffen,ohio,at paragraph two of the syllabus.also,hill did not establish that his cocaine addiction qualified as a mental disease or defect under b.see state cooey,ohio,ohio state van hook,ohio.
state hill,at parallel citations omitted.
aedpa deference applies,and the ohio supreme court did not unreasonably apply supreme court precedent in concluding that hill counsel performed adequately.no pertinent holdings of the united states supreme court required such an instruction.and the trial court did instruct the jury that it could consider,in addition to a list of specific mitigating factors,any other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death.ja.because the court instructed the jury that it could consider any including hill because federal courts generally presume that juries follow their instructions,washington hofbauer,cir,counsel could reasonably have expected that his decision not to request a specific instruction regarding intoxication would not have changed the jury deliberations.the ohio supreme court was not objectively unreasonable in rejecting this claim.we accordingly reject it as well.
hill next brings three related claims concerning the burden of proof that applies to the weighing process of an ohio capital case,namely the weighing of the aggravating circumstance of the crime against any mitigating factors that might lead a jury to sentence the defendant to life rather than death.first,he argues that misstatements about ohio law by the prosecutor during the closing arguments deprived him of due process.second,he argues that a misstatement of law on the verdict forms deprived him of due process and subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment.third,he contends that the failure of his lawyers to object to the prosecutor statements and to the incorrect verdict forms denied him effective assistance of counsel.
we will review the first two claims together because the ohio supreme court addressed them together,reasoning as follows 
in propositions of law nos.i through iv,hill raises issues centered around his claim that the jury was fundamentally misled concerning the sentencing standard by which aggravating circumstances are weighed against mitigating factors.yet,hill did not object at trial to the faulty verdict form or the instructions,and thus waived all but plain error.the failure to object to a jury instruction constitutes a waiver of any claim of error relative thereto,unless,but for the error,the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.state underwood,ohio,syllabus.overall,we find the instructions adequate under the facts of this case and reject hill claims of plain error.
as hill correctly points out,the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances are sufficient to outweigh those mitigating factors present in the case before recommending the death penalty.d.unfortunately,at least one life sentence verdict form used in this case,and possibly both,misstated this standard.neither life verdict form is in the record.however,the trial judge told the jury that the life sentence verdict form involved the jury finding that the mitigating factors are sufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstance.thus,in referring to that form,the trial judge asserted,the second form is we,the jury,do find beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigating factors are sufficient to outweigh the aggravating circumstances present in this case.additionally,the court and parties frequently and erroneously referred to aggravating circumstances although only one aggravating circumstance was alleged or proved.
in proposition of law no.ii,hill points out that the prosecutor in argument misstated applicable law by asserting that mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances.the prosecutor also misspoke by referring to any mitigating factor in the singular,and by referring to the jury recommending death in the electric chair.
notwithstanding the prosecutor misstatements and the inaccurate life sentence verdict form,we deem it unnecessary to reverse this sentencing determination under the circumstances of this case.first,hill failed to raise these issues before the court of appeals.we will not ordinarily consider a claim of error that was not raised in any way in the court of appeals and was not considered or decided by that court.state williams,ohio,paragraph two of the syllabus.
second,hill failed to object at trial.as noted before,failure to object to an instruction waives any claim of error unless,but for the error,the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.state underwood,syllabus.this principle applies equally to the faulty life sentence verdict form.notice of plain error under.b is to be taken with the utmost caution,under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.state long,ohio,paragraph three of the syllabus.
no plain error exists in this case.in fact,the record demonstrates the parties,including the judge in the instructions,generally did refer to a correct standard in the sentence proceedings.thus,the jury understood the applicable sentencing standard and its sentencing responsibility.the trial court clearly and correctly instructed the jury more than four separate times in final penalty instructions that the aggravating circumstances had to outweigh mitigating factors before the jury could recommend the death penalty.the court defined the term reasonable doubt,and specifically told the jury the defendant has no burden of proof.the court specifically referred once to the state burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the factors in mitigation.the court repeated the state burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt when reading the death penalty verdict form.the court further told the jury that only if you are firmly convinced that aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating factors has the state proven its right to a death penalty verdict.if the jury was not firmly convinced that aggravation outweighed mitigation,then the state was not entitled to a death penalty recommendation.
in voir dire,the prosecutor repeatedly referred to the correct standard.also,the jury never asked any questions.moreover,the jury form that the jury agreed to and signed reflected the correct standard we,the jury,in the issue joined,do find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances sic present in this case are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors and we therefore recommend that the sentence of death be imposed on the defendant,jeffrey hill.
when the jury instructions including the verdict forms are viewed in their entirety,the trial judge adequately informed the jury of its responsibility under d.state lorraine,ohio.accord state landrum,ohio.
moreover,we find nothing suggesting the aggravating circumstance and mitigating factors are in equipoise in this case.in fact,the aggravating circumstance strongly outweighs the scant mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt,as discussed later.in essence,hill asked the jury and this court to spare his life because he is a cocaine addict and confessed to police.under those circumstances,the faulty form or instructions could not have affected the jury decision so that but for the faulty form,the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.state underwood,syllabus.
further,hill failure to object to the prosecutor argument also waived all but plain error.state mills,ohio.no plain error resulted because the prosecutor did not deny hill a fair trial or cause a miscarriage of justice.state combs,ohio,state landrum,supra,at.
the prosecutor reference to the electric chair was accurate,since the general assembly had not yet authorized death by lethal injection.see,effective october.the prosecutor brief misstatements as to any mitigating factor and the weighing process were inconsequential.at times,the prosecutor correctly noted that the aggravating circumstance must outweigh mitigating factors to justify the death penalty.moreover,the court told the jury it was the court job to instruct the jury on the law,and the jury duty to follow those instructions.as discussed,the court adequately instructed the jury as to its responsibilities.
additionally,our independent reassessment of the sentence could eliminate the effect of these errors.see state combs,supra,at state landrum,supra,at.thus,we reject hill plain error assertions in propositions nos.i and ii.
state hill,at parallel citations omitted.
the district court applied aedpa deference to the ohio supreme court decision on these claims,and hill does not claim that we should do otherwise.prosecutorial misconduct claims turn on whether the prosecutors comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.darden wainwright,d quoting donnelly dechristoforo,d.the ohio supreme court did not unreasonably apply this rule in rejecting hill claim.
in arguing to the contrary,hill points to the following comments by the prosecutor 
the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances.he guilty of aggravated murder,guilty of the aggravating circumstance.therefore beyond any reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstance does outweigh any mitigating factor.you got to follow the law which is you shall recommend death in the electric chair.
ja.while the prosecutor misstated ohio law when he suggested that the mitigating factors had to outweigh the aggravating circumstance and misstated the facts when he referred to aggravating circumstances as there was only one aggravating circumstance,namely that hill committed the murder while engaging in a mistakes did not so infect the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.darden,at.nothing in the record suggests that the misstatements were intentional,and the error plainly was a de minimis one given the many times the prosecutor correctly stated the in the remaining sentences of the above block quotation.
nor did the misstatement in the verdict form deny hill due process.the issue here is not whether the form misstated state law,for the fact that the instruction was allegedly incorrect under state law is not a basis for habeas relief.estelle mcguire,d.the issue is whether the ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.id.at.and i t is well established that the instruction may not be judged in artificial isolation,but must be considered in the context of the instructions as a whole and the trial record.id.quoting cupp naughten,d.
measured by these requirements,the ohio supreme court did not act unreasonably in concluding that the jury properly understood and applied the correct law,especially in view of the trial judge many recitations of the correct standard to the jury.see state hill,at see also ja sentencing jury charge,which states the correct burden six times.because the jury instructions,both in the jury signed verdict form and as explained orally by the judge six times,were correct,any error did not so infect the entire trial as to deny hill due process.
as for hill argument that the errors on the verdict form subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment,congress has not given us authority to address that claim.unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability,an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court.c.and the certificate must indicate which specific issue or issues show the denial of a constitutional right.id.c.because the certificate does not raise an eighth amendment claim on this point,hill may not appeal the issue.
in his third claim relating to the burden of proof applicable to the weighing process,hill asserts that his attorneys failure to object to these misstatements of law amounted to ineffective assistance.the ohio supreme court rejected this claim as well as one other that is not before us 
in propositions of law nos.iii and iv,hill asserts he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial and before the court of appeals.in proposition no.iii,hill complains because his counsel did not object at trial to the verdict form or the prosecutorial misstatements,as discussed in propositions nos.i and ii 
reversal of a conviction or sentence based on ineffective assistance requires meeting the standard of strickland washington,d.strickland requires a deficient performance,errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment and b prejudice,errors so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.strickland at.accord state bradley,ohio.
however,hill fails to demonstrate either deficient performance or prejudice.hill counsel reasonably decided not to object to the prosecutor brief,inaccurate comments.objections tend to disrupt the flow of a trial and are considered technical and bothersome.state campbell,ohio.a decision not to interrupt because of such imprecise statements reflected an objective standard of reasonable representation.see state bradley,at paragraph two of the syllabus.also,counsel could have believed the trial court more than four correct references to the aggravating circumstances outweighing the mitigation factors negated these misstatements.
as to the incorrect life verdict form or forms,all parties to the trial,including the two defense counsel,apparently overlooked that deficiency.such an oversight is not the kind of egregious and unprofessional conduct condemned by strickland.state seiber,ohio.accord state scudder,ohio.overall,counsel conduct fell within the wide range of reasonably professional conduct,and his counsel continued to function as the counsel guaranteed by the sixth amendment.
additionally,hill has not established prejudice,a reasonable probability that,were it not for counsel errors,the result of the trial would have been different.state bradley,at paragraph three of the syllabus.in fact,the aggravating circumstance strongly outweighs the scant mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt,as discussed later.thus,even if counsel had objected and thereby secured a correct verdict form or eliminated the prosecutor misstatements,no reasonable probability exists as to a different result.
state hill,at parallel citations omitted.
because the ohio supreme court rejected this claim on the merits,aedpa deference applies.the ohio supreme court reasonably applied the strickland test in rejecting this claim.given the overall context of the trial and the number of times counsel and the court explained the correct standard to the jury,hill counsel failure to object to the incorrect verdict forms did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.strickland,at.
hill next argues that his lawyers failed to raise in mitigation the fact that he had adjusted well to prison.after hill raised this claim during his state proceedings,the ohio court of appeals rejected it on the merits 
in his seventh assignment of error,hill relies upon a psychologist proffered opinion about his adjustment to jail to support his argument that he was denied effective assistance because there was no evidence presented at trial to demonstrate his adjustment to jail and his amenability to incarceration.this claim has no merit.the record of the murder trial reflects that fridman testified that hill was a proper subject for rehabilitation.
state hill,wl,at.
assessing counsel performance under strickland and through the prism of aedpa,we conclude that no deficient performance or prejudice has been shown.counsel did not,as hill contends,fail to put on any evidence of hill ability to adjust to prison life.fridman,hill mitigation specialist,testified at the mitigation hearing that hill was a proper subject for rehabilitation while in a jail setting for the rest of his life.ja.in support of this conclusion,fridman testified that hill would overcome his crack cocaine addiction while in prison and while necessarily without access to the drug and emphasized that hill committed the murder both while intoxicated by cocaine and for the purpose of supporting his cocaine habit,all of which showed that he would not be a danger to others while in prison.hill counsel,in short,did not fail to present this mitigating factor to the jury.
hill persists that the following section of hawgood affidavit illustrates how fridman testimony could have been more forceful on this point 
it is my opinion that hill would function well in the future in the prison environment because of his unrelenting and.he would most likely never be a threat to himself or to others.he accepts criticism or rejection from others as his just due,as part of the atonement process.he has come to accept lack of contact from various family members,his brother included,as just punishment for the crime he committed.his good behavior has kept him on level a since the beginning of his incarceration on death row.
ja.but to the extent fridman could have highlighted the point more clearly or more forcefully by mentioning past good behavior,our earlier discussion of prejudice arising from fridman lack of preparation time,see smith mitchell,at we find no cause or prejudice under strickland because all of this evidence was presented at mitigation,suffices to reject this claim as well.
nor does skipper south carolina,d,lead to a different conclusion.skipper concluded that a trial court exclusion of testimony regarding good behavior could deprive a defendant of his right to present mitigating factors and arose in a setting in which the prosecutor had made much of the dangers petitioner would pose if sentenced to prison,and went so far as to assert that the defendant could be expected to rape other inmates.id.at.here,in contrast,the trial court did not exclude the evidence,and the jury did hear testimony about hill capacity to adjust to prison and the elimination of the source cocaine addiction of his behavior.
hill next contends that his lawyers failed to provide effective assistance by not presenting the testimony of additional family and friends during the mitigation proceeding.on review,the ohio court of appeals rejected this claim 
in his fifth assignment of error,hill claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when,in the mitigation phase of the proceedings,counsel failed to provide information about hill background through testimony of his relatives and friends.the evidence offered below dehors the record discussed,in part,his mother alleged mistreatment of hill,hill desire to improve his relationship with his mother,and hill brother previous assault on his mother.the mitigation strategy pursued by hill counsel focused on his addiction.the decision of what mitigating evidence to present during the penalty phase of a capital case is generally a matter of trial strategy.the proffered evidence failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.thus,the trial court correctly determined this claim did not warrant a hearing.
state hill,wl,at footnotes omitted.
aedpa deference applies to the ohio court of appeals resolution of this strickland claim on the merits.during the mitigation phase,hill attorneys introduced nine medical and background reports examining hill mental health,two of which included input from hill family members and friends.see ja listing contacts with hill brother,godmother,a cousin named alicia sanders,and a friend of the family ja relying on notes from a social worker contacts with hill brother and sanders.whether learned from these contacts or from hill himself,the reports discussed several mitigating factors arising from hill background and childhood,including his mother practice of disciplining her children with belts and extension cords and his father frequent absences during his childhood.when hill took the stand,he testified that he dropped out of school to help take care of his mother following her stroke and that he cooked for her and helped bathe her.he explained that he worked with handicapped children for a year,and he discussed how the death of his father led him to turn to crack.in addition to hill testimony,fridman testified as a mitigation specialist,based in part on information
