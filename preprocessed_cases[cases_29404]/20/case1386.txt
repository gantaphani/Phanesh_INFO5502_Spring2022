petitioner was convicted in a jury trial of sexual penetration with an uninformed partner by a person infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids,in violation of.comp.laws,and sentenced to months imprisonment.petitioner appeals the district court judgment denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.petitioner contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to challenge the seating of jurors whose voir dire responses showed them to be racially biased.
we conclude the district court correctly found that the state courts decisions reasonably comport with clearly established federal law.for the following reasons,we affirm the decision of the district court and deny the writ.
holder was charged by the state of michigan with sexual penetration without informing his partner that he had the human immunodeficiency virus hiv,and brought to trial in bay county circuit court.holder is.his partner,monica kosecki,is white.
holder counsel prepared a questionnaire that the trial court agreed to administer to prospective jurors,to determine whether they might harbor prejudices that would disqualify them from a trial in which an man was accused of a sexual crime against a white woman.five of the jurors revealed possible biases against or against holder in their responses during voir dire.relevant portions of the voir dire,including the efforts the court and holder counsel made to rehabilitate these jurors,follow 
examination of juror flynn 
the court questions were asked in the jury questionnaire whether or not you or a member of your family was a victim of a crime and,if so,whether or not the other person was of a different race.and you yes,and that sometimes you view other races below your standards because of the acts sic taken place.
when the trial court questioned juror flynn further about the crime,she stated that a hispanic man had stolen something from her father.
the court okay.and you made the comment that you men deal with hate or revenge with violence more so than other races.the fact that holder,the defendant who on trial,is black,is that going to have any effect on how you would judge this case and how would decide on a verdict 
juror flynn no,i do believe so at all.
the court okay.can you see if i read these,why it might appear that you might be prejudiced against a hispanic or a black person 
juror flynn ya,i can see that,yes.
the court okay.but you do feel that you are 
juror flynn no,not at all.
the court would it be safe to kind of say that you kind of view it as a fact that maybe more crimes are committed by a than caucasian,do that the way you feel 
juror flynn i believe so,yes.
the court then asked whether that fact alone was gon na make her decide the case on her feelings instead of the evidence that would come in front of her.juror flynn replied that it would not,and also said that race would not affect her verdict.
holder counsel later examined juror flynn about her answers to other questions,and the examination included the following exchange 
counsel i just want to,in my own mind,clarify an answer that you have written in your questionnaire.and this is question that i think judge bielawski talked to you about great detail.but i want to get a little bit more information from you about your particular answer.and that the question dealing with the fact i just read it so that there nothing i do say exactly like the questionnaire did 
the defendant in this case is a black man who is accused of having sex with a white woman without telling her that he had the hiv virus.based upon this information,have your already formed an opinion about him and,if so,what is your opinion 
and your answer was yes.this is a deadly disease.he took her life into his hands by putting her at risk.he a horny coward.
now,judge bielawski talked to you about the presumption of innocence if you had to make a decision right now based upon what you know,what the verdict would have to be,or what your decision would have to be.
were the word accused,was that the word that did it for you as far as your answer 
juror flynn yes,
counsel okay.
juror flynn definitely.
counsel so,based upon what he gone over previously regarding that,would your answer be any different now than what you wrote 
juror flynn yes,definitely i believe that,yes,everyone is innocent until proven guilty.
examination of juror coppinger 
the court miss coppinger,you questionnaire stated that you thought that a person should stay within their own race and it saves a lot of heartache that you do care for basically interracial relationships.do you think the fact that there case does involve interracial relationships,that that going to affect how your decide the case or influence you on your verdict 
juror coppinger no,i do think it would influence.i more or less saying what my standard is for myself have two my girls.
the court then asked the juror coppinger to consider what her views would be if one of her daughters began dating a black man who was head of the business department at the college a very nice person,never been married,very polite,makes a nice income,and thinks the world of your daughter,while the other daughter was dating a white man with long,greasy hair,earrings in his nose and his tongue and his ears,and tattoos all over his body,who,when asked what he did said well,man,i just takin it cool and doin whatever.the court then asked 
the court and you look at the two guys and what do you think you had to choose 
miss coppinger,would you agree that your values and your choices in life change with the circumstances 
juror coppinger yes.that would be easy 
the court pardon can you 
juror coppinger that would be easy 
the court can you talk into the microphone 
juror coppinger that would be easy 
the court that right.and it just may be that if your daughters married these two individuals which i stated,you could have one of the most wonderful in the world and one of the biggest bums that you ever saw in the world.
juror coppinger that right.
the court and,over a period of time,the issue of race may fade into the background,correct 
juror coppinger that true.
the court okay.do you agree with that 
juror coppinger yes,i do.
the court okay.but i think from your comments there,that you just as soon not try that scenario,right 
juror coppinger yes.
the court okay.but going back to your questions and the issues that are going to come up in this case,is the race of the different people that are gon na testify here,is that gon na be an issue about when you decide the ultimate verdict the defendant guilty or innocent 
juror coppinger no,i do think it affect my judgment.like i said,i pretty.
the court okay.if you remember,i talked to one of the other jurors when she said,i do think.i not asking what you think,i want to 
juror coppinger that how i feel.
the court okay.i need a commitment from you that you can assure the court that you will be fair and impartial and that race is not gon na affect your verdict.can you give me that commitment 
juror coppinger yes,i can.
the court and you feel comfortable doing that 
juror coppinger yes.
holder counsel did not question juror coppinger.
examination of juror moore 
the court regarding the questions regarding interracial relationships,you said basically it up to them,which means it their business 
juror moore that right.
the court but then you went on to say they should not have children.why did you feel that way 
juror moore well,i feel that children would be a mixed breed.it just think that they might suffer for it down the road.their children would t know if they what breed they really are 
the court they wo you gon na say do know whether they caucasian,black,or whatever 
juror moore that right.

juror moore probably

the court okay.and why do you make a distinction between nationality and race 
juror moore the color i believe.

juror moore yes.
the court okay.and the fact that we have a black man on trial as a defendant and claiming to have had intercourse with a white woman,is that something that is going to bother or 
juror moore i do think so.
the court affect your verdict 
juror moore no sir.
the court and you sure of that 
juror moore positive.
the court you think you can be fair and impartial 
juror moore yes,i can.
the court you not gon na think that i gon na find him guilty just because i do think a black man should be having intercourse with a white woman 
juror moore well,like i said,i believe it their business.
holder counsel did not question juror moore.
examination of juror heaslip 
the court miss heaslip,when we asked the question about the fact that defendant is accused of 
juror heaslip yes.
the court certain act,and you put down i would say he guilty.well,first,you thought i think he was guilty,and then you put down would say he is guilty 
juror heaslip i know just readin it,he accused.and i did really think of that right away.but i could accuse him without hearin,you know,
the court okay.
juror heaslip everybody innocent until proven guilty.
the court so,you read the question same as 
juror heaslip yes,
the court miss loveless,right 
juror heaslip yes,i did 
the court told juror heaslip to consider the defendant innocent until proven guilty and juror heaslip said that she would.
examination of juror loveless 
the court miss loveless,you put down what are your feelings regarding interracial relations you put down unacceptable to me,but i do respect the others to pursue one if they choose.
juror loveless yes.
the court the fact that you would not want to be involved in an interracial relationship,would that have anything to do on how you would decide on a verdict in this case 
juror loveless no,your honor,it would not.
the court okay.we asked a question and we stated some of the facts of this case that the defendant,holder,is a black man,and he accused of having sex with a woman,who caucasian.and the people claim that he was hiv positive and did tell her.and they asked if you had an opinion based upon those facts alone.
now,did you understand when i explained to you the presumption of innocence 
juror loveless yes,i did.yes,i did,your honor.sorry.
the court that all right.i sure after a couple of hours,we get it down 
did you notice when the question was asked,it said the defendant was accused of this act,that you were to assume that this was true 
juror loveless as i sat here yesterday,i specifically thought about that question and the wording,and wished that i had the opportunity to that because i think i was remiss in reading into the question 
the court okay.but 
juror loveless in a way that may not be intended by the questions.
the court okay.i think what you probably telling me is kind of read,glanced through it,and you missed the word accused 
juror loveless ya,i think i probably did.
the court okay.the fact that a person is accused of a crime and now taking into consideration the presumption of innocence,if a person is accused of a crime,what is your opinion regarding his guilt or innocence,with information alone 
juror loveless he would be innocent until proven specifically my opinion in the court guilty.
the court instructed juror loveless to presume the defendant innocent until proven guilty and she said she would do so.
each of the jurors stated under oath and on the record that they could set aside their opinions and decide the case on the evidence despite their views on interracial relationships.only juror flynn expressed unfavorable opinions about men relative to the commission of crimes in society in her questionnaire,and ultimately she also stated that she could put those opinions aside in order to assist in rendering a fair decision in the case.defense counsel did not challenge any of these five jurors,and they later deliberated on the verdict.the jury found petitioner guilty as charged.
petitioner appealed his conviction as a matter of right to the michigan court of appeals and raised three issues whether he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to challenge biased jurors for cause and when counsel failed to object to the trial court imposition of sentence because it exceeded the statutory guidelines whether the trial judge erred in failing to recuse himself when he sentenced petitioner on a separate charge in and warned petitioner at that time that if he got out of prison and committed another felony,he could face life imprisonment and whether the trial court erred in departing from the statutory sentencing guidelines when imposing sentence upon petitioner.
on the same day petitioner filed his brief in support of appeal on september,he also filed a motion to remand with the michigan court of appeals relative to the ineffective assistance of counsel and sentencing issues.on october,the motion was denied.on november,the prosecutor filed her own motion to remand with respect to the issue of.the motion was granted and on remand,petitioner was to to years on february.a supplemental brief was filed by petitioner after remand with the court of appeals on april,with regard to another sentencing issue.however,on september,in an unpublished opinion,the michigan court of appeals affirmed petitioner conviction and sentence.people holder,wl.
petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration on september,which was denied on october.appealing the michigan court of appeals decision affirming his conviction,petitioner filed an application for leave to appeal with the michigan supreme court,which raised the same issues as those presented before the court of appeals.petitioner application was denied on april.people holder,table.
on august,petitioner filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.the district court denied his petition for a writ of habeas under.the district court subsequently denied petitioner request for a certificate of appealability coa.this court construed petitioner notice of appeal as an application for a coa,pursuant to.b.on january,this court granted petitioner application for a coa on whether he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to challenge certain jurors for cause on the basis that they were biased.
this court reviews de novo the district court legal conclusions in granting or denying a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.slaughter parker,cir.this court usually reviews findings of fact for clear error,but when the district court decision in a habeas case is based on a transcript from the petitioner state court trial,and the district court thus makes no credibility determination or other apparent findings of fact,the district court factual findings are reviewed de novo.wolfe brigano,cir.and because petitioner filed his habeas petition in,the provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa apply.barker yukins,cir aedpa applies to petitions filed after april.
aedpa prohibits this court from granting a state prisoner habeas petition unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at a different result.slaughter,at.a state court decision unreasonably applies federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts.id.citing williams taylor,d.
a federal habeas court may not issue a writ under the clause simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.bell cone,d quoting williams,at.the question under aedpa is not whether a federal court believes the state court determination was incorrect but whether that determination was substantially higher threshold.owens guida,cir quoting schriro landrigan,d.
under aedpa,the initial inquiry is whether petitioner seeks to apply a rule of law that was clearly established at the time of his conviction in the state court.see williams,at.petitioner seeks to apply the supreme court holding in strickland washington,d,which the supreme court had clearly established at the time of his conviction,to show ineffective assistance of counsel.the court in strickland established a test to evaluate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to the sixth amendment.first,the petitioner must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.judicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential,and a fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.id.at.a court considering a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.id.second,the petitioner must show that counsel performance prejudiced the petitioner.that is,the petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.when a biased juror is impaneled,however,prejudice under strickland is presumed,and a new trial is required.hughes united states,cir.
petitioner argues that it was ineffective assistance of counsel for his trial counsel to fail to challenge the seating of the five jurors whose voir dire responses showed them to be biased against interracial relationships.pursuant to the sixth and fourteenth amendments,a criminal defendant is guaranteed the right to an impartial and unbiased jury.morgan illinois,d.among the most essential responsibilities of defense counsel is to protect his client constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury by using voir dire to identify and ferret out jurors who are biased against the defense.miller francis,cir see also united states blount,cir the primary purpose of the voir dire of jurors is to make possible the empaneling of an impartial jury through questions that permit the intelligent exercise of challenges by counsel.
counsel,however,is granted deference when conducting voir dire.hughes,at.an attorney actions during voir dire are considered to be matters of trial strategy a strategic decision can not be the basis for a claim of ineffective assistance unless counsel decision is shown to be so that it permeates the entire trial with obvious unfairness.id.despite this strong presumption that counsel decisions are based on sound trial strategy,it is insufficient for counsel to simply articulate a reason for an omission or act alleged to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.the trial strategy itself must be objectively reasonable.miller,at citing strickland,at.
a trial court management of voir dire is granted similar deference.the supreme court has acknowledged the traditionally broad discretion accorded to the trial judge in conducting voir dire.virginia,d.a trial court management of voir dire,however,is subject to essential demands of fairness.hughes,at.because a petitioner sixth amendment right to an impartial jury is at stake,a defendant may obtain a new trial if an impaneled juror honest responses to questions on voir dire would have given rise to a valid challenge for cause.id.challenges for cause are subject to approval by the court and must be based on a finding of actual or implied bias.id.
pursuant to the sixth amendment,for a finding of juror impartiality when a juror is challenged for cause,the relevant question is did the juror swear that he could set aside any opinion he might hold and decide the case on the evidence,and should the juror protestation of impartiality have been believed.patton yount,d.in patton,the supreme court found that the trial court did not commit manifest error when finding jury members to be impartial.eight of the fourteen jurors in question,due to pretrial publicity,admitted that at some time prior to trial they had formed an opinion as to defendant guilt.id.at.one of the impaneled jurors stated at voir dire that he would have required evidence to change his mind about defendant guilt.id.at.
a qualified juror need not be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.murphy florida,d.rather,it is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.id.in murphy,the supreme court found that defendant had failed to show that the process of which he complains permits an inference of actual prejudice.id.at.one juror agreed,on voir dire,with the characterization that m y experience of defendant is such that right now i would find him guilty.id.at.another juror responded during voir dire that defendant prior convictions would probably influence her verdict.a third juror conceded that it would be difficult,during deliberations,to put out of the juror mind that defendant was a convicted criminal.id.at.because juror impartiality is a factual determination,the state court findings are entitled to a presumption of correctness.see wainwright witt,d.a trial judge finding of juror impartiality may only be overturned where manifest error is shown.patton,at.
because petitioner claim for ineffective assistance of counsel is based on his trial counsel failure to strike the allegedly biased jurors,petitioner must show that the jurors were actually biased against him.hughes,at.holder must show through a review of voir dire testimony that a fair trial was impossible.ritchie rogers,cir.a juror express doubt as to her own impartiality on voir dire does not necessarily entail a finding of actual bias.the supreme court has upheld the impaneling of jurors who had doubted,or disclaimed outright,their own impartiality on voir dire.hughes,at see also patton,at.bias in this context is actual bias,or bias in fact the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference that the person will not act with impartiality.hughes,at.
in hughes,the petitioner similarly claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to remove a biased juror.during voir dire,the judge asked the potential jurors whether they thought they could be fair.one of the jurors responded that she had a nephew and a couple of friends on the police force with whom she was quite close.id.at.when the court asked the juror if those relationships would prevent her from being fair in the case,she responded,i do think i could be fair.id.we held that,while a juror express doubt as to her ability to be impartial on voir dire does not necessarily result in a finding of actual bias,actual bias was present in that case because neither counsel nor the trial court responded to the juror express statement that she could not be fair.id.at.neither counsel nor the trial court asked questions directed toward rehabilitating the juror or obtaining assurances of impartiality.because the only evidence relevant to the issue of bias was the juror statement that she did not think she could be fair,we had no choice but to find actual bias.id.at.we further concluded that counsel failure to respond to the juror express admission of bias on voir dire was objectively unreasonable under strickland.id.at.
this case presents facts far different from hughes.here,the trial court,as well as defense counsel,questioned the jurors regarding whether they could be both fair and impartial.each of them stated under oath and on the record that they could set aside their opinions and decide the case on the evidence despite their views on interracial relationships.unlike the juror in hughes,the jurors here never stated that they could not be fair and impartial.what enabled this court in hughes to presume blatant statement of partiality and absolutely no contrary statement from the juror that she could be absent here.each of the five jurors consistently answered that they could set their opinions aside and decide the case upon the evidence presented,presuming the defendant innocent.
in another case decided by this court,wolfe brigano,cir,the petitioner claimed that the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to an impartial jury when it refused to remove four biased jurors for cause.one juror did not think he could be a fair and impartial juror.id.the second juror stated it was hard to say whether her relationship with the victim parents would impact her ability to deliberate fairly.id.the third juror expressed doubt as to whether she could put aside news reports and decide the case solely on the evidence presented at trial.id.finally,the fourth juror doubted he would require the prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.we found that the trial court erred in failing to excuse these four jurors for cause.id.at.however,each of these jurors expressly doubted his or her ability to decide the case fairly.
here,holder provides no reason to doubt the validity of the jurors assurances.nor is there any reason to believe that the jurors opinions about interracial relationships were so strong as to undermine the reliability of their assurances that they could put their opinions aside and evaluate the case fairly and impartially.in assessing whether a juror was actually biased against a defendant,this court considers the totality of the juror statements.see miller,at considering all the statements made by the juror during voir dire.here,the totality of the jurors statements during voir dire demonstrate that the jurors unequivocally stated that they would consider holder innocent until proven guilty,that they would set aside any personal opinions,and decide the case only on the evidence submitted.to hold that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused,without more,is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror impartiality would be to establish an impossible standard.it is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.irvin dowd,d.the question of juror impartiality is largely one of credibility,and thus,the trial court determination is entitled to special deference.patton,at.the ultimate question is whether the juror swore that he could set aside any opinion he might hold and decide the case on the evidence.that is what occurred here.although the five jurors at issue initially expressed bias against interracial relationships,upon further questioning,each one unequivocally stated that he or she could set aside any previously formed opinion and decide the question of holder guilt based on the evidence presented in court.in light of the special deference given to a trial judge determination of juror impartiality as well as the deferential standard for reviewing factual findings under,we can not say that the michigan court ruling on this issue was unreasonable.
the dissent emphasizes that the michigan court of appeals,when analyzing this claim,cited a michigan case for the contention that defense counsel failure to challenge a juror may not form the basis of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.as the dissent notes,this contention is not consistent with the strickland standard.but this mistaken analysis of strickland performance prong does not move the state court decision out from under aedpa,as the dissent claims.the fact remains that the state court applied the strickland standard to holder claim and addressed that claim on the merits.by doing so,that court decision is entitled to deference under aedpa.see d explaining that any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings is subject to aedpa deference.
the law requires such deference to be given even in cases,such as this one,where the state court reasoning is flawed or abbreviated.see neal puckett,cir en banc o ur focus on the unreasonable application test under section d should be on the ultimate legal conclusion that the state court reached and not whether the state court considered and discussed every angle of the evidence.hurtado tucker,cir the ultimate question is not how well reasoned the state court decision is,but whether the outcome is reasonable e ven a poorly reasoned state opinion does not mean that the outcome represents an unreasonable application.hennon cooper,cir it does follow that the criterion of a reasonable determination is whether it is well reasoned.it is not.it is whether the determination is at least minimally consistent with the facts and circumstances of the case.see also harris stovall,cir giving aedpa deference to a michigan court of appeals summary denial of a claim despite the lack of any reasoning.
both the supreme court and this court,moreover,have found no actual bias where the evidence of bias was much stronger than the five jurors expressed disapproval of interracial relationships.see patton,at.holding that the trial court did not commit manifest error by finding the jurors to be impartial,even though eight jurors admitted that,due to pretrial publicity,at some time prior to trial,they had formed an opinion as to defendant guilt see also united states pennell,cir holding that there was inadequate evidence of actual bias where five jurors received threatening,phone calls telling them to find the defendant guilty,and one juror stated that the phone calls might influence her judgment in the case.if the evidence in patton and pennell was not adequate to establish actual bias,then the five jurors comments about interracial relationships were certainly not sufficient to establish bias in the instant case.
holder has presented no evidence that the five jurors were actually biased,nor that they were untruthful when each juror stated that he or she could be impartial and decide the case on the facts.therefore,the court finds that holder has failed to demonstrate either that his trial counsel failure to challenge the five jurors permeated the entire trial with obvious unfairness,hughes,at,or that the trial court committed plain error by allowing the five jurors to serve on the jury.no actual bias or bias in fact has been shown on the record in accordance with applicable united states supreme court and federal law.although defense counsel decision to leave the five jurors on the panel might have been,criminal defense lawyers should be given broad discretion in making decisions during voir dire.few decisions at trial are as subjective or prone to individual attorney strategy as juror voir dire,where decisions are often made on the basis of intangible factors.miller,at.holder challenge to the state court decision under the strickland test does not reach the high threshold established by aedpa for the granting of habeas relief.therefore,the michigan court of appeals decision to affirm holder conviction was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of federal law.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court judgment and deny the writ.
because i believe that at least three of the impaneled jurors showed actual bias and that their assurances of impartiality should not have been believed,i would hold that holder trial counsel failure to challenge the seating of these jurors constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and that holder is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus.in my view,the michigan court of appeals applied a decisional rule that was contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent as set forth i
