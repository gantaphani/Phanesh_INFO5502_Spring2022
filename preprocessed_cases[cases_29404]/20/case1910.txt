although this case comes to us on an appeal from a denial of collateral relief,at base it is a.christopher raygoza was convicted in state court for murder and attempted murder,but he had an alibi.more than that,he had ten available alibi witnesses,most of whom were not related to him,but his attorney made little effort to investigate his alibi,called only one of those witnesses at trial,and failed to offer telephone records that would have corroborated raygoza defense.the state courts rejected raygoza claim that he had received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel,and the district court concluded that federal habeas corpus relief was unavailable.we conclude that counsel failed to meet minimum performance standards and that his actions or lack thereof prejudiced raygoza.we therefore reverse.
on june,at approximately in the evening,two teenagers were shot at dearco pizzeria,on the southwest side of chicago.one of them,miguel macias,was killed,and the other,hugo munoz,was badly injured.according to eyewitnesses,a person flashing gang signs and indicating that he was a united latino killer entered the pizzeria.macias and munoz were members of a gang called the united latino organization ulo.after that person left the restaurant,another young man returned with a gun and opened fire.three members of the ulo who were present at the time identified raygoza as the gunman and leslie matos as the person who first walked into the pizzeria.in addition,raul quezada,a young member of the rival latin soul street gang,to which raygoza and matos belonged,testified that he was at the pizzeria that evening serving as a lookout.quezada testified that raygoza,whom he knew as froggy,was the shooter.
other witnesses also supported the state case.according to the facts as the illinois appellate court recounted them,matos stood in the doorway of the pizzeria as the violence was unfolding and shouted kill him,kill him,shoot him.three witnesses identified the shooter as having a blond description that matched raygoza at the time.other people also testified that someone who looked like raygoza was on the scene.jennifer calatayud testified that she saw matos and raygoza outside a party at street and sacramento avenue around pm.matos told her that he had something to do and would meet her in about minutes.she waited,and he showed up about an hour later,out of breath.he told her that the boys had shot someone at the pizza place on california dearco.later,raygoza and matos were identified in photographic arrays and lineups as the guilty parties,and they were arrested and charged with murder and attempted murder,among other things.
raygoza account of his actions that evening is completely different if true,then the police arrested the wrong person for macias murder.that evening,raygoza mother,maria raygoza,celebrated her birthday with friends and family at their home in the suburb of highland park,illinois.according to mapquest a popular internet site,highland park is approximately miles away from the scene of the shooting,see.mapquest.com the website estimates that it would take minutes to drive from the center of highland park to west street and south california avenue.a total of nine people,including christopher,were in the raygoza home that evening.the next morning,on june,maria took christopher along with her to an errand at the daley center in downtown chicago later,he went to the southwest side,where his family had lived until december,to see his girlfriend desiree moyet.in the early evening,raygoza called his mother at her office and told her that there had been a shooting in the area and that he was afraid that he might be pinpointed for it.
his fears were realized two days later,on june,after detectives received a tip that froggy was involved in the shooting.on june,a detective had a telephone conversation with attorney wendy morgan,who was maria raygoza boss attorney morgan identified herself as christopher attorney.on his behalf,she agreed to an interview between christopher and the police at her office the meeting was to take place on june.events overtook these plans when the police arrested raygoza on the evening of june at his home in highland park,without notifying morgan.
after his arrest,raygoza was subjected to a marathon interrogation by the detectives,who refused his requests to consult with his mother or with counsel.notes from the state attorney indicate that raygoza initially said that he was at home on the evening of june with family and friends,but that later he admitted that he had been present at the shooting and that lucky had done it.his story changed again,twice first he asked if he could say that shadow was the shooter,and eventually,at the next morning some hours into the interrogation,he signed a statement written out by the state attorney confessing that he was the guilty party.the state trial court suppressed this confession on the ground that the detectives had violated raygoza sixth amendment right to counsel.the trial proceeded nevertheless.raygoza,represented by attorney thomas brandstrader,waived his right to a jury.
at the trial,the state called several witnesses who identified raygoza as the shooter,although they had not known him before the incident.quezada testified that he was acting as a lookout,and that froggy raygoza had told him to watch for police.quezada did not witness the shooting itself when he heard shots from inside the pizzeria,he ran away.although calatayud testified that she had seen raygoza at a party near the pizzeria that evening,police reports indicate that she initially told the police that he had not been there.she changed her story two years fact brandstrader knew.
brandstrader conducted almost no of the state witnesses,including calatayud.he did not call any of the other people who had been at the party,even though their names were in the police report.although,when it came time for the defense case,brandstrader raised the defense of alibi,he said only that raygoza was at home in highland park at the time with his mother,maria raygoza,desiree moyet,and noemi cordova.he never mentioned any of the other guests,nor did he mention the fact that morgan had called maria house during the evening to talk to her and christopher had answered the telephone.brandstrader called only one defense witness,moyet.in his closing argument,the prosecutor hammered on the skimpiness of the evidence supporting raygoza alibi w here is alexis where is mom where is his brother where is the blond lady where is the sister the trial court found raygoza guilty.in doing so,the judge too commented on the fact that raygoza had only one alibi witness,and a biased one at that his girlfriend.
after the verdict but before sentencing,raygoza hired a new lawyer.this attorney filed a motion for new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel,and attached affidavits of seven alibi witnesses who had been available to testify at trial but had not been called.new counsel also submitted other corroborating evidence,including telephone records and train tickets.the trial judge held a hearing on the motion,but even before the hearing began he expressed skepticism about the value of the proceeding.seven witnesses testified,all supporting raygoza alibi.they were maria raygoza,vincent raygoza,christopher brother,crystal raygoza,his sister,noemi cordova,a friend of maria who had spoken to christopher several times before arriving at the home and then had seen him there,luisi paredes,cordova son,wendy morgan,and rodney adams,morgan husband,who confirmed that morgan had spoken on the telephone at pm on june to christopher a fact he knew because he recognized christopher voice when he answered the telephone.other witnesses to the murder testified that eduardo lerma lucky was the one who shot macias and munoz,to retaliate for an earlier shooting of lerma,a latin souls member,by a ulo member.lerma and raygoza bore a strong physical resemblance to one another.
the state responded with evidence about a woman named chloe gavin,who was a former friend and landlord of maria raygoza,who turned out to be a con artist.gavin was also at the birthday
