after a jury trial,matthew carlson was convicted of sexual assault of a child and sentenced to years in a wisconsin state prison.he now seeks a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,arguing that the state trial court denial of his motion to substitute counsel and for a continuance violated his sixth amendment right to counsel of choice and his fourteenth amendment right to due process.he also maintains that the state court of appeals decision affirming the trial court judgment was unreasonable.the district court judge lynn adelman agreed with carlson and granted his petition in a comprehensive opinion.carlson jess,d.the state now appeals.
back in,carlson was convicted of one count of sexual assault of a boy under the age of.at that time,the complainant here,we call him gino,was years old and a friend of carlson stepson.upon hearing of the conviction,gino grandparents asked him whether carlson had ever assaulted him.gino denied any improper behavior on the part of carlson.
six years later,in when gino was years old,he alleged that carlson sexually assaulted him in and.gino initially complained to the staff of rawhide boys ranch where he then resided.soon thereafter,the ozaukee county district attorney charged carlson with several counts of sexually assaulting gino.carlson hired attorney randall kaiser to represent him.at carlson may,arraignment,the trial court set a trial date of august.the parties agreed that the trial would take,at most,two days to complete.carlson remained in jail from the time of his arrest until his eventual trial.
in the weeks leading up to the trial,carlson requested two brief continuances,one for additional preparation time and one to permit kaiser to assist him at trial.the trial judge denied both requests,citing his calendar and the fact that the complainant was a juvenile.in the meantime,carlson lost confidence in kaiser ability to represent him.on august,ten days before the scheduled start of the trial,carlson notified kaiser that he had hired another attorney,robin shellow,to replace him.two days later,kaiser moved to withdraw as counsel.on august,carlson,with shellow help,moved to substitute shellow for kaiser as his counsel,conditioned upon an adjournment so that shellow could prepare for trial.in support of the motion,shellow submitted a detailed explanation of the additional investigation she wanted to conduct before trial.
the trial judge,however,did not sit during the week of august and thus did not promptly address kaiser motion to withdraw or carlson motion for substitution and a continuance.on august,the day before the trial was scheduled to begin,the judge returned to the bench and held a hearing on the motions.there,kaiser stated 
i am in a very tough position i think if i am not allowed to withdraw.as i said,our communication has completely broken down.we have differences of opinions,and i know they do feel confident,he and his family.i think it better for everyone if i withdraw.
i do feel that the state is prejudiced by allowing me to withdraw.it my understanding that they really only have one citizen witness.this is a case that allegedly occurred approximately six years ago and was not charged until april of this year.so i do think attorney shellow or do want to speak for her,but i do think we are requesting a long adjournment.this is the first request that carlson has made for a new attorney.
kaiser also explained that carlson was not seeking to delay the proceedings unnecessarily and reminded the court that carlson was and would remain in custody during a continuance.the prosecutor opposed kaiser request because shellow ha d already indicated in papers that she would be able to proceed tomorrow and because the complainant was a child.
the trial judge conceded that the defendant has a right to counsel,but stated 
i think here there are paramount issues.and the first issue is the orderly administration of this court.i said last week or on the that it would be months before this case got back on the trial calendar.and these late motions to withdraw,i am not inclined to grant fact,i am not going to grant the motion to withdraw.this case is going to trial tomorrow.i do see any reason why it ca go.this court is prepared to try it.
i also am concerned that you have a young victim in this.not as young as some the court sees,but young.and i do see anything in the motion papers that were filed by attorney shellow that is of a magnitude that causes the court to hesitate and say this court ca go to trial tomorrow.i am ordering it to go ahead.
shellow then asked to be heard and stated that the case involved factual issues that kaiser had not explored and constitutional issues that he had not researched.she explained that she wished to explore gino motives for making the allegation and to engage an expert regarding a number of questions,including questions raised by gino reporting of the assaults to rawhide staff years after they allegedly occurred.shellow stated that she also wished to examine possible improper police coaching and a miranda issue.she also noted that kaiser failure to explore any of these matters raised issues of ineffective assistance of counsel.
the judge only response was to ask shellow if she was prepared to try the case tomorrow.when shellow replied that she was not,the court stated 
then i am not granting the motion.this case is staying on the calendar.i understand the problems,but i find that a case that been set days out,and then to come in the day before and say i want to withdraw and i want it taken off the court calendar,is a serious problem for administration of this court.and i realize there are issues.but i think carlson can get a fair trial.his attorneys have been working on this.they have been in court numerous times.and i think there are other issues that have to be factored into the analysis,and i have done that,and i am denying the request.
the next day,before the trial commenced,carlson himself asked to address the court.he stated 
i have tried on numerous occasions to convey my concerns with kaiser,to no avail.i have been met with argumentative comments,i have been met with the impression to take a plea bargain which i signed several papers stating i would not,and that seems to be our whole matters 
i have not received one piece of paper concerning this case since i have been incarcerated.i have not one sheet of paper about this case to look back on when i am in jail.also,one of kaiser associates,who i will not name,when i met the first time i could swear under oath i have smelled liquor on his breath.i am am not gon na mention any names,i did want to risk a lawsuit.and also i have talked to kaiser several times about different witnesses that obviously he does feel i need,and i have mentioned to him and so have my parents and my wife about possibly different people we could bring,prior to may or whatever that was,and i still have not heard nothing about that either.
the judge acknowledged that there are situations where release of counsel is warranted,when there an ethical dilemma,when there is a situation where the relationship has broken down to the point where there no communication,but he said carlson and kaiser relationship was only suffering because of differing views of how the case is approached,and strategic decision s.the judge continued 
against carlson request to substitute counsel and for a continuance the court has the responsibility,some countervailing responsibilities.one is to administration of this court i have the victim rights obligations that i have to consider,i have to consider a fair trial for you,and i have to consider the administration of this court calendar i do have another date that could fit a trial like this in until probably after the beginning of the year i also have a young victim,not the youngest as i acknowledged yesterday,who has to have this hanging out over their head.and on balance i denied the request.and i am comfortable with the request,i comfortable that kaiser can represent you in a competent manner.days ago this trial date was set,and the desire to have a different lawyer or these other issues should have been brought up much earlier in the proceedings.
kaiser then addressed the judge one last time,imploring him to allow the substitution 
w e had a breakdown in communication,and that is one of the factors i think to allow withdrawal of an attorney.i understand it sort of the last minute,but he hired new counsel and i still of the opinion that because of the total breakdown in communication that we had,there is no taxpayer expense,this is only a trial,i do,considering the long time it took the alleged victim to report this case,i do think a short adjournment would prejudice anyone but the court.so i renewing my objection and just stating that we had a breakdown in communication.
the court denied the motion and trial proceeded as scheduled.gino testified that carlson sexually assaulted him on several occasions in and when he spent the night with carlson stepson and once when he rode in a car with carlson.a detective testified about gino initial statement accusing carlson of sexual assault.gino mother testified that gino spent the night with carlson stepson on several occasions and rode in a car with him at least once.she also testified that her son had never indicated any animosity toward carlson or concerns about visiting his stepson prior to reporting the sexual assaults in.carlson testified,denying gino charges.carlson wife testified that they lived in a small apartment and that she was home during all of her son sleepovers and thus would have seen or heard any interaction between carlson and gino.the jury convicted carlson of five counts of sexual assault of a child and,as we said,he was sentenced to years in prison.
carlson appealed to the state court of appeals,arguing among other things that the trial judge refusal to grant his motion for substitution of counsel and a continuance deprived him of his right to counsel of choice and his right to due process of law.the court of appeals,in a per curiam decision that noted this opinion will not be published,affirmed,and the state supreme court subsequently declined to review the case.
having exhausted his state court remedies,carlson petitioned the federal district court for habeas relief,arguing that the state court decision was an unreasonable determination of the facts and contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.the district court first determined that the record contained no evidence supporting the state trial judge finding that communication between carlson and kaiser had not totally broken down.accordingly,the district court found that because the finding was unreasonable,the state court of appeals decision to accept and rely on it was also unreasonable.with this determination,the district court then examined the merits of carlson constitutional claim and concluded that the trial court denial of carlson motion for substitution of counsel and a continuance was arbitrary and had an adverse effect on the presentation of his case.the district court then granted carlson petition for relief 
we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions,as well as mixed questions of law and fact,de novo.harding walls,cir.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,a federal court may issue a writ of habeas corpus only if the decision of the last state court to examine the merits of the petitioner claim here,the court of appeals was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
the first issue is whether the district court correctly determined that the state court of appeals affirmed the trial court denial of carlson motion for substitution and a continuance based on an unreasonable factual,that communication between carlson and kaiser had not completely broken down.a state court factual findings are presumptively correct absent rebuttal by clear and convincing evidence.e.nevertheless,a federal court can disagree with a state court credibility determination and,when guided by aedpa,conclude the decision was unreasonable or that the factual premise was incorrect.cockrell,d.
the record reveals absolutely no support for the state trial court determination that carlson motion for substitution was based on differing views of how the case is approached and strategic decision s.rather,the record is littered with statements by kaiser and carlson himself that communications had completely broken down.on august,kaiser stated that communication has completely broken down.on august,he repeated this statement twice,telling the court that we had a breakdown of communication and that there had been a total breakdown in communication.that same day,carlson himself told that court that he had tried on numerous occasions to convey his concerns with kaiser,to no avail and that he still ha d not heard nothing about his requests that kaiser interview certain witnesses.based on these statements,the trial judge should have at least probed the matter further by asking carlson and kaiser some questions.instead,however,the judge simply made a factual finding that the relationship has not broken down to the point where there no communication.the trial court statement that kaiser had discussed witnesses with carlson is belied by carlson statement that he had not yet heard anything from kaiser on that issue.with nothing in the record to back it up,the trial judge finding was clearly unreasonable.
the court of appeals also neglected to consider the evidence supporting carlson motion.in its decision,it merely paraphrased the trial judge findings and stated that it was not convinced that the trial court erred when it concluded that the asserted conflict between counsel and carlson was not so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication.thus,the district court properly found that both the trial court finding and the court of appeals acceptance and reliance on that finding was unreasonable.see d see also taylor maddox,cir in passing section d,congress has reminded us that we may no more uphold an unreasonable factual determination than we may set aside reasonable.
the second issue is whether the district court correctly determined that the trial court denial of his motion for substitution and a continuance violated carlson constitutional rights.because the trial court based its decision on an unreasonable factual determination,the substantive merits of carlson claim are analyzed under the is,de there is no state court analysis to apply aedpa standards to.conner mcbride,cir.the standard directs us to dispose of the matter as law and justice require.
carlson maintains that the trial court decision violated his sixth amendment right to counsel of choice and his fourteenth amendment right to due process.the sixth amendment secures the right to the assistance of counsel.it also includes the right to select,and be represented by,one preferred attorney thus,trial courts must recognize a presumption in favor of a defendant counsel of choice.wheat united states,d.accordingly,the sixth amendment bars a court from denying a defendant the right to retain counsel of his choice arbitrarily or unreasonably.ford israel,cir.the fourteenth amendment due process clause also bars a court from denying a defendant motion for a continuance arbitrarily or unreasonably.ungar sarafite,d.thus,motions for substitution of retained counsel and for a continuance can implicate both the sixth amendment right to counsel of choice and the fourteenth amendment right to due process of law.see morris slappy,d.
the right to counsel of choice,however,is qualified in several respects.one qualification is that an indigent defendant generally has no right to have his counsel of choice appointed.wheat,at.thus,when a trial court refuses to appoint new counsel,the defendant can only show a denial of a constitutional right if he can establish that his counsel was ultimately is,he must show prejudice as required by strickland washington,d.united states harris,cir united states z
