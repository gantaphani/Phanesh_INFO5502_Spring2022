manoutcher amouzadeh appeals the district court denial of his habeas corpus petition,which challenged an order of removal by the board of immigration appeals bia.the issues are whether unlawful procurement of naturalization in violation of a is a crime involving moral turpitude under section a a ii of the immigration and naturalization act,as amended ina and whether amouzadeh was eligible for concurrent relief under former ina c and current ina a because we conclude that the violation of a is a crime involving moral turpitude and that amouzadeh is not entitled to relief under ina a,we deny amouzadeh petition.
amouzadeh,a native of iran,first entered the united states in as a student.after marrying a united states citizen,amouzadeh status was adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident,and on september,he became a citizen of the united states by naturalization.however,on september,just two weeks prior to his final naturalization hearing,amouzadeh was arrested on charges that he was part of a conspiracy to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute.he was convicted on september,of that crime.
at his final naturalization hearing,amouzadeh was asked whether he had,since petitioning for naturalization,knowingly committed any crime or offense,for which he had not been arrested or had been arrested,cited,charged,indicted,convicted,fined or imprisoned for breaking or violating any law or ordinance including traffic violations amouzadeh falsely stated,under oath,that he had only been cited for a traffic violation since petitioning for naturalization.amouzadeh false statement formed the basis of his later section a conviction for knowingly procuring naturalization contrary to law.on march,as a result of his section a conviction,amouzadeh united states citizenship was revoked 
the immigration and naturalization service ins initiated removal proceedings on april,charging that amouzadeh was removable under ina a a iii as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony drug trafficking conviction,and under ina a a ii as an alien convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude drug trafficking conviction and unlawful procurement of naturalization conviction.the immigration judge ij rejected amouzadeh argument that his section a conviction for unlawfully procuring naturalization was not a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude and sustained both charges of removability.the ij also determined that amouzadeh was ineligible for relief from removal under former ina c because of his section a conviction or under current ina a because of his aggravated felony conviction.amouzadeh appealed to the bia,who reached the same conclusions as the ij and dismissed his appeal,ordering him removed to iran in accordance with the ij decision.
amouzadeh later filed a section habeas petition in the district court,challenging his removal on two grounds the bia erred in determining that his section a conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude,and in the alternative,even if his section a conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude,the bia erred in concluding that he could not apply concurrently for relief from removal under current ina a and former ina c.the district court denied amouzadeh habeas petition.amouzadeh appealed.
while amouzadeh habeas petition was pending on appeal,congress passed the real id act of the act,which divested the federal district courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas petitions attacking removal orders,effective may,the act provides that a petition for review filed with the appropriate court of appeals shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal the act also requires district courts to transfer any pending habeas cases challenging an order of removal to the appropriate court of appeals the courts of appeals are to treat the habeas petitions as petitions for review the act does not,however,address how courts of appeals should treat habeas petitions that were pending on appeal on may,when the act became effective.we recently held that such habeas petitions are also properly converted into petitions for review.therefore,because amouzadeh habeas petition was pending on appeal on the act effective date,we convert it into a petition for review of the underlying bia decision.we have jurisdiction over amouzadeh because it involves a question of whether a violation of section a is a crime involving moral turpitude.
the ina provides that an alien is deportable if he has been convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude the ina does not,however,define the term moral turpitude,and legislative history does not reveal congressional intent regarding which crimes are turpitudinous.instead,congress left the interpretation of the term to both the bia and the federal courts.consequently,this court applies a standard of review to the bia conclusion that an alien has committed a crime involving moral turpitude 
first,we accord substantial deference to the bia definition of the term moral turpitude.second,we review de novo whether the elements of the state or federal offense at issue fit the bia definition of a crime involving moral turpitude.importantly,this approach provides both the meaning of moral a proper regard for the bia administrative of federal immigration laws,not state and federal criminal statutes 
the bia,through its administrative decisions,has crafted the following definition of the term moral turpitude 
moral turpitude refers generally to conduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base,vile,or depraved,and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general.moral turpitude has been defined as an act which is per se morally reprehensible and intrinsically wrong,or malum in se,so it is the nature of the act itself and not the statutory prohibition of it which renders a crime one of moral turpitude.among the tests to determine if a crime involves moral turpitude is whether the act is accompanied by a vicious motive or a corrupt mind 
when determining whether a particular law meets the bia definition of moral turpitude,we employ a categorical approach that focuses on the inherent nature of the crime,as defined in the statute,rather than the circumstances surrounding the particular transgression.under the categorical approach,we read the statute at its minimum,taking into account the minimum criminal conduct necessary to sustain a conviction under the statute.an offense is a crime involving moral turpitude if the minimum reading of the statute necessarily reaches only offenses involving moral turpitude however,if the orbit of the statute may include offenses not inherently entailing moral turpitude,then the crime is not a crime involving moral turpitude an exception to this general rule is made if the statute is divisible into discrete subsections of acts that are and those that are not crimes involving moral turpitude.if the statute is divisible,we look at the alien record of conviction to determine whether he has been convicted of a subsection that qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude.
section a provides that w hoever knowingly procures or attempts to procure,contrary to law,the naturalization of any person,or documentary or other evidence of naturalization or citizenship shall be fined or imprisoned,or both amouzadeh pleaded guilty to violating section a by falsely stating under oath,in a notice of final naturalization hearing that he had never been arrested for violating any law.however,because section a is not divisible,amouzadeh actual conduct can not be considered.instead,our crime involving moral turpitude analysis is confined to section a statutory text,and we will only classify amouzadeh section a conviction as a crime involving moral turpitude if every violation of the statute necessarily,under all circumstances,involve s moral turpitude.
amouzadeh contends that section a is broad enough to punish behavior that is not accompanied by a vicious motive or a corrupt mind and therefore does not specify a crime involving moral turpitude.for example,amouzadeh contends that an innocent misstatement durin
