in the context of a petition for habeas corpus,this case considers whether,after the supreme court decision in cleveland united states,d,taxes owed to a government can constitute property in its hands within the meaning of the federal mail and wire fraud statutes.it also evaluates the continued validity of our decision in united states trapilo,cir,that the common law revenue rule does not bar criminal prosecutions under the mail and wire fraud statutes in light of our more recent decision in attorney general of canada reynolds tobacco holdings,cir.
petitioner appeals from a decision and order of the united states district court for the northern district of new york thomas mcavoy,district judge denying his motion for habeas corpus under but granting a certificate of appealability on two issues.we hold that taxes owed to a government can constitute property in its hands within the meaning of the federal mail and wire fraud statutes,and that trapilo remains good law in this court.
background 
after retiring from years of service to the new york state police,petitioner john fountain entered the currency exchange business in hogansburg,new york,adjacent to the regis mohawk reservation.using cashier checks and wire transfers,he began exchanging canadian for currency in conjunction with a scheme to transport cigarettes from canada into the regis mohawk reservation then back to canada to be sold on the black market.the enterprise was designed to circumvent the high canadian taxes on tobacco products.
as a result of these currency exchange activities,fountain was indicted,along with others,in july,the miller indictment,on the charge of conspiracy to launder the proceeds of a wire fraud scheme in violation of the money laundering statute,a a i,h.the illegality of the underlying conduct derived from the wire fraud statute,which provides that 
whoever,having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises,transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire in interstate or foreign commerce,any writings,signs,signals,pictures,or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice,shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
the government claimed that the conspiracy was intended to defraud both the united states and canada,asserting that both countries were deprived of tax revenues.
other individuals involved in the scheme had already been indicted in the indictment,and litigation had progressed in their case.these defendants had successfully moved,in the district court,to dismiss the indictment based upon the first circuit application of the common law revenue rule to bar a similar prosecution in united states boots,cir.see united states trapilo,cr,wl,dist.lexis.as the court in boots explained the revenue rule,this firmly embedded principle of common law holds that courts generally will not enforce foreign tax judgments,just as they will not enforce foreign criminal judgments,although they will enforce foreign civil judgments unless due process,jurisdictional,or fundamental public policy considerations interfere.boots,at.although the criminal prosecution involved in boots did not directly involve enforcement of a foreign tax judgment,the court determined that the revenue rule still operated to nullify the defendants convictions because w here a domestic court is effectively passing on the validity and operation of the revenue laws of a foreign country,the important concerns underlying the revenue rule are implicated.id.at.when the government appealed the district court decision in trapilo,however,we reversed,holding that t he wire fraud statute neither expressly,nor impliedly,precludes the prosecution of a scheme to defraud a foreign government of tax revenue,and the common law revenue rule,inapplicable to the instant case,provides no justification for departing from the plain meaning of the statute.united states trapilo,cir.based on the outcome of trapilo,the district court rejected the miller defendants similar attempt to dismiss the indictment against them.see united states miller,d.because the trapilo decision was directly adverse to his position,fountain opted not to appeal the district court determination and instead entered a plea of guilty in the hopes of receiving a lesser sentence.
although fountain had been charged with the intent to defraud both the united states and canada,he admitted only to a scheme to deprive the canadian government of revenue at his plea allocution.as petitioner stated,i did defraud the government.nor did the prosecutor attempt to force fountain to acknowledge that he was guilty of doing so.as the government responded,fountain does have to enter his plea on the basis of his participation in a conspiracy to defraud the united states of any tax revenue.the court added,yes,as i understand it,there is no technical requirement to fulfill the elements that comprise the crime that you pleading to that there be any defrauding of the united states government of dollars.the court accepts that.as a result of his plea,fountain was sentenced to months imprisonment by a judgment of conviction entered in october.this term was subsequently reduced to months.
following petitioner conviction,two legal developments occurred.first,the supreme court held,in cleveland united states,d,that unissued state video poker licenses did not qualify as property within the compass of the mail fraud in all relevant respects to the wire fraud statute.see carpenter united states,d the mail and wire fraud statutes share the same language in relevant part,and accordingly we apply the same analysis to both sets of offenses here.as justice ginsburg stated,writing for a unanimous court,it does not suffice that the object of the fraud may become property in the recipient hands for purposes of the mail fraud statute,the thing obtained must be property in the hands of the victim.cleveland,at.second,we determined,in attorney general of canada reynolds tobacco holdings,cir,that the revenue rule still applies to bar civil suits aimed at enforcing foreign tax laws.
as a result of these decisions,fountain brought a habeas petition under,alleging that he had not violated the wire fraud statute because 
i the canadian government did not possess property in its hands at the time of the alleged fraud 
ii the wire fraud statute was not intended to protect a foreign government rights against a scheme to defraud and 
iii the alleged act of fraud occurred beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the united states,and therefore failed to meet the essential conduct element giving jurisdiction of a united states court over the crime alleged 
in the alternative,petitioner claimed that his counsel had been ineffective in failing to raise these issues.
the district court ruled against fountain,determining that he had procedurally defaulted,and that he could not surmount the default by showing either cause and prejudice or actual innocence.furthermore,the court held that petitioner counsel had not been ineffective for failing to raise a revenue rule defense.however,the court did certify two issues for review by this court 
whether counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to pursue the revenue rule defense in light of petitioner assertion that he did not defraud the united states and 
whether the conviction was obtained without proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of the crime and therefore whether petitioner is being unconstitutionally held.
these are the questions that we consider below.
ii.analysis 
a court of appeals reviews a district court denial of a petition de novo.coleman united states,cir.the contours of fountain case are largely delineated by the supreme court decisions in bousley united states,d,and massaro united states,d.bousley held that an individual who pled guilty to using a firearm under c would not be procedurally barred from bringing a habeas petition if he could demonstrate actual innocence based upon a subsequent supreme court case that restricted the scope of the meaning of use within the terms of the statute.a habeas action is not intended to substitute for a direct appeal.any petitioner who bousley and fountain pursue such an appeal would ordinarily be procedurally barred from challenging his conviction.united states frady,d w e have long and consistently affirmed that a collateral challenge may not do service for an appeal.as chief justice rehnquist,writing for the majority in bousley,reaffirmed,however,a petitioner may overcome this procedural bar if he can demonstrate cause and prejudice or that he is actually innocent.see bousley,at.murray carrier,d.in massaro,the court added that the procedural default rule delineated by bousley does not apply to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.see massaro.at.we construe the two issues that the district court certified for appeal as asking whether fountain counsel was constitutionally ineffective and whether fountain can overcome the procedural bar applicable to his other claim by demonstrating actual innocence.we conclude that petitioner can not succeed on either basis.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
in order to demonstrate that he suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel,a petitioner must show that the attorney performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that the outcome of his case would have been different had the attorney performed adequately.united states perez,see also strickland washington,d requiring a demonstration that counsel performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.
fountain argues that his trial lawyer should have pursued an appeal on the grounds that the common law revenue rule barred his conviction,and that,had such an appeal occurred,the outcome of his trial would have differed.we need not consider whether petitioner can fulfill the first prong of demonstrating that his attorney performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,because it is clear from our precedents that,even if it did,fountain was not prejudiced.in reynolds,we distinguished between civil suit s brought by a foreign sovereign and criminal actions prosecuted by the united states,determining that the revenue rule applied in the former but not in the latter context.reynolds,at and.in so doing,we did not challenge the validity of our prior decision in trapilo,which held that the revenue rule permitted prosecution under the wire fraud statute for tax fraud against foreign governments because fountain would not be able,under trapilo,to invoke the revenue rule to invalidate his criminal conviction,he was not prejudiced by his attorney failure to raise this defense on appeal.
actual innocence 
we read the second issue that the district court certified whether the conviction was obtained without proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of the crime and therefore whether petitioner is being unconstitutionally held as asking whether fountain is actually innocent of money laundering because taxes,the object of his scheme to defraud,do not constitute property under the wire fraud statute after the supreme court decision in cleveland united states,d.in order to establish actual innocence,petitioner must demonstrate that,in light of all the evidence,it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.bousley,at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.furthermore,in the context of a habeas petition following a guilty plea,because actual innocence means factual innocence,not mere legal insufficiency,bousley,at,the government is not limited to the existing record to rebut any showing that petitioner might make.rather the government should be permitted to present any admissible evidence of petitioner guilt even if that evidence was not presented during petitioner plea colloquy id.at.because we hold that,under cleveland,taxes remain property within the purview of the mail and wire fraud statutes,we need not reach the further question of whether the government can adduce additional evidence to demonstrate fountain factual guilt.
as we have previously summarized,t he essential elements of a mail or wire fraud violation are a scheme to defraud,money or property as the object of the scheme,and use of the mails or wires to further the scheme.united states dinome,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the mail and wire fraud statutes prohibit the use of both means of transmission in furtherance of any scheme or artifice to defraud,or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises.see.until,many circuit courts interpreted scheme or artifice to defraud and obtaining money or property disjunctively,refusing to construe the money or property requirement as a limitation on the kinds of schemes to defraud covered by the statute.in mcnally united states,d,however,the court determined that the mail fraud statute sparse legislative history indicates that the original impetus behind the mail fraud statute was to protect the people from schemes to deprive them of their money or property.id.at.as a result,the court read the statute as limited in scope to the protection of property rights,id.at,and held that it did not protect the intangible right of the citizenry to good government,id.at,stating that,i f congress desires to go further,it must speak more clearly than it has,id.at.taking up the court invitation to action,congress then expanded the law reach to permit prosecutions for any scheme to defraud aimed at the intangible right of honest services.abuse act of,a,but see cleveland,at.observing that,s ignificantly,congress covered only the intangible right of honest services even though federal courts,relying on mcnally,had dismissed,for want of monetary loss to any victim,prosecutions under for diverse forms of public corruption,including licensing fraud.
under this new statutory language,courts construed the property requirement liberally.in particular,the second circuit,following a number of other courts,permitted prosecutions for tax fraud to proceed under the mail and wire fraud statutes.see united states helmsley,cir upholding a mail fraud conviction for tax fraud and determining that t he absence of proof of taxes actually due to new york state is immaterial because success of a scheme to defraud is not required united states porcelli,cir stating that,under mcnally and carpenter united states,d,the fact that new york interest in unpaid sales taxes is intangible is no obstacle to a mail fraud prosecution united states defiore,cir explaining that four circuits before us have squarely applied the federal fraud statutes to state tax law violations.
in deciding cleveland,the supreme court reaffirmed that the scope of the mail and wire fraud statutes is not unbounded.the modest extent to which we understand the cleveland decision to have reconfigured the existing landscape dictates our resolution of petitioner claim that,after cleveland,taxes can no longer be considered property under the mail and wire fraud statutes.in cleveland,justice ginsburg,writing for a unanimous court,held that s tate and municipal licenses in general do not rank as property,for purposes of the mail fraud statute,in the hands of the official licensor,and that i t does not suffice that the object of the fraud may become property in the recipient hands for purposes of the mail fraud statute,the thing obtained must be property in the hands of the victim.cleveland,at.in arriving at the conclusion that licenses are not property in the hands of the state,the court examined a number of factors conducing to a determination of what should be categorized as property.the cleveland court emphasized the regulatory as opposed to nature of louisiana video poker licenses and the fact that the state could not alienate its licensing authority,id.at,while downplaying the significance of the right to exclude,id.at,a right that other cases deemed crucial in defining property.see,carpenter,at.claiming that exclusivity is an important aspect of confidential business information and most private property for that matter.we do not read the court particular selec
