petitioner,horace lee dunlap,appeals from the district court dismissal of his habeas petition,filed pursuant to,as untimely.the district court issued a certificate of appealability specifically on the question of whether equitable tolling applies to the period of limitation in habeas cases,and whether,in any event,equitable tolling would be applicable in petitioner case.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that equitable tolling does apply to the limitation period applicable to habeas petitions,but affirm the district court order dismissing petitioner habeas petition inasmuch as petitioner has failed to demonstrate that equitable tolling is appropriate in his case.
background 
petitioner was indicted on october,in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee.the indictment charged petitioner in counts one and two with violating g,which criminalizes the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in count three of the indictment,petitioner was charged with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number in violation of k,a b.petitioner was tried and convicted of counts one and two of the indictment count three was dismissed on motion of the government.petitioner was thereafter sentenced to concurrent life sentences on counts one and two of the indictment and five years of supervised release on each count,to run concurrently.
on direct appeal,this court affirmed his conviction on january,the court mandate issued on february.united states dunlap,wl cir,per curiam.
prior to this court decision in petitioner direct appeal,petitioner,on march,filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus relief pursuant to.on march,the district court dismissed petitioner action without prejudice because his underlying conviction was not yet final.after the dismissal of the first petition,petitioner filed a second pro se petition on march.again the district court dismissed the action without prejudice because his direct appeal was still pending before this court.
on april,petitioner filed a third habeas petition.on may,the government filed a motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,for an extension of time to respond.in its motion to dismiss,the government argued that petitioner habeas petition was untimely because it was filed more than one year after his conviction became final,which was february.
counsel was appointed to represent petitioner on may.thereafter,petitioner counsel filed a response to the government motion to dismiss.
the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge,the honorable joe brown,who,on september,issued a report and recommendation in which he recommended that the habeas petition be dismissed because it was by the limitation period prescribed by.the district court overruled petitioner objections to the report and recommendation and adopted it in its entirety.on october,the district court dismissed petitioner habeas petition with prejudice.
petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal.the district court granted a certificate of appealability on november,to address the issue of whether equitable tolling is applicable to the limitation period under and whether equitable tolling would be appropriate in the instant case.
discussion 
we review the district court decision to grant or deny a writ of habeas corpus de novo however,the district court factual findings will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous.gonzales elo,cir.questions of statutory construction are also reviewed de novo.jordan.conference of teamsters welfare fund,cir.
the question now before this court is whether the limitation period applicable to,and similarly,habeas petitions is a statute of limitations subject to equitable tolling or a jurisdictional prerequisite which bars review by the federal courts if it is not satisfied.although we have encountered this question before,we have yet to answer it definitively.see,doran birkett,wl cir,sluder united states,wl cir.we now join our sister circuits that have to date addressed this issue and hold that the limitation period is a statute of limitation because there is a rebuttable presumption that equitable tolling applies to statutes of limitation and there is no indication that congress did not intend for equitable tolling to apply to the limitation period in habeas cases,the statute of limitations in is subject to equitable tolling.see,irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d.
federal prisoners may file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to however,the habeas petition is subject to a period of limitation.under,
a one year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section.the limitation period shall run from the latest of 
the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final 
the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by government action in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states is removed,if the movant was prevented from making a motion by such governmental action 
the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court,if that right has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review or 
the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
to determine whether the limitation period in is a statute of limitations or a jurisdictional requirement,we must consider the language of the statute,the legislative history and the statutory purpose.zipes trans world airlines,d miller state dep t of,cir.as most other circuits have concluded,these considerations make clear that congress intended the limitation period to operate as a statute of limitation rather than a jurisdictional requirement.
in zipes,the supreme court held that the requirement of filing a timely charge of discrimination with the eeoc was similar to a statute of limitations and was not a jurisdictional prerequisite.at.in so holding,the court noted that the provision granting the district court jurisdiction to entertain such cases contained no reference to the timeliness of filing an eeoc charge.id.at.instead,the timeliness of the filing requirement was addressed in another provision,which did not speak in jurisdictional terms.id.at.
similarly,the language of supports the conclusion that the limitation period is a statute of limitations.the statute itself provides that the time period is a period of limitation the statute does not use the term jurisdiction or otherwise speak in jurisdictional terms.accord sandvik united states,cir harris hutchinson,cir.moreover,the statutory scheme gives the district court jurisdiction to hear habeas cases in a portion of the statute divorced from the limitations provision.see sandvik,at.as with the language of the statute in zipes,the language of the limitation period in the instant case supports the conclusion that the period operates as a statute of limitations and not a jurisdictional bar.
in addition,the legislative history behind the period of limitation indicates that congress intended the period to operate as a statute of limitations rather than a jurisdictional bar.for instance,the conference report does not indicate that the period of limitation is a jurisdictional requirement.the report simply provides that the section sets a one year limitation on an application for a habeas writ in order to curb the abuse of the statutory writ of habeas corpus,and to address the acute problems of unnecessary delay and abuse in capital cases.conf,at,reprinted in.on the other hand,as the cases addressing this issue have chronicled,the statements of several of the members of congress make clear that the limitation period was intended to function as a statute of limitations and did not bear on the district court jurisdiction to entertain a habeas petition 
many members of aedpa authors in the senate and its sponsors in the,however,describe section as a statute of limitations.see.daily ed,statement of specter aedpa designed to impose a statute of limitations on the filing of habeas corpus petitions.daily ed.june,statement of hatch under current law,there is no statute of limitations on filing habeas petitions.daily ed,statement of hyde now,we have a year statute of limitations in habeas.daily ed.june,statement of cohen i support a statute of limitations for filing habeas petitions.id.at statement of biden i agree with my republican colleagues from utah and pennsylvania that we ought to have a strict statute of limitations and a strict limit on successive petitions.
calderon dist.for the cent.dist.of,cir,overruled on other grounds by cir en banc accord miller,at recognizing the same or similar statements made by members of congress.following the teachings of zipes,where,in determining that time period for filing a claim was like a statute of limitations,the court found it significant that the time period for filing a claim was labeled as a period of limitations,we conclude that the legislative history in this case makes clear congress intent that the limitation period operate as a statute of limitations rather than a jurisdictional requirement.at.
finally,the purpose underlying the limitation period,to curb undue delays and abuses of the writ of habeas corpus,is served by a statute of limitations.because the statute of limitations can only be tolled in certain limited circumstances,equitable tolling would not undermine the statute purpose to curb undue delays and abuses.
in giles united states,d,holding that the period of limitations was a jurisdictional requirement not subject to equitable tolling,the court reasoned that it was required to read the limitation period as a jurisdictional requirement to give effect to the statute and the purpose underlying it.the court further reasoned that 
the language of indicates that congress intended to limit a federal court discretion in tolling the one year limit.section expressly lists four different events,the latest of which determines when the limitations period begins to run.the detail of and its direct and express determination of when the time limit begins indicates that congress did not intend to permit courts to read other unmentioned and equitable exceptions into the statute.
the rationale in giles,however,has been expressly rejected by the circuit courts addressing this issue.the calderon court,the first to decide the issue,rejected the argument advanced in giles,stating,
a statute of limitation will serve this goal quite well not as well as a strict jurisdictional bar to be sure,but will doubtless speed up the habeas process considerably.equitable tolling will not be available in most cases,as extensions of time will only be granted if extraordinary circumstances beyond a prisoner control make it impossible to file a petition on time.we have no doubt that district judges will take seriously congress desire to accelerate the federal habeas process,and will only authorize extensions when this high hurdle is surmounted.
at accord miller,at construing d as a statute of limitation clearly serves the purpose of curbing abuses of the habeas process.it provides a one year limitation period that will considerably speed up the habeas process while retaining judicial discretion to equitably toll in extraordinary circumstances.
similarly,harris rejected the argument advanced in giles that the inclusion of subparts one through four indicates that congress did not intend for there to be equitable tolling of the period of limitation.this argument,the court concluded,reads too much into any negative inference that may reasonably be drawn from the exceptions.harris,at.
the exceptions simply make the writ available to address later arising circumstances without these exceptions,a petitioner could inappropriately be denied the writ altogether,risking injury to an important interest in human liberty.the inclusion of these statutory provisions does not give rise to the inference that the application of the limitation period must otherwise be absolute,as might be the case if the period were jurisdictional.
id.citation omitted.in fact,the court in miller,stated that the inclusion of these exceptions makes it more apparent that the drafters envisioned the limitation period to function as a typical statute of limitations,rather than a jurisdictional limitation.at citation omitted.
because we conclude that the rationale of our sister circuits is more sound than that of the court in giles,we likewise reject the arguments advanced therein,and conclude that the limitation period is a statute of limitation subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling.
although the limitation period in is subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling,we nevertheless find that under the circumstances of the case now before the court,the district court properly declined to invoke the doctrine in petitioner case.
we review de novo the district court decision not to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling inasmuch as the facts in this case are undisputed and the district court determined as a matter of law that there were no grounds that would justify equitable tolling in petitioner case see miles prunty,cir.
both petitioner and respondent urge this court to apply a different,although not necessarily divergent,standard when determining if equitable tolling is appropriate in habeas cases in the lower court,the magistrate judge applied the rare and exceptional circumstances or extraordinary circumstances test that has been used by most other circuits addressing this issue.see,gibson klinger,cir aedpa statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling but only in rare and exceptional circumstances.citation omitted harris,at smith mcginnis,cir same miller,at equitable tolling only applies in extraordinary circumstances calderon,at equitable tolling would only be granted if extraordinary circumstances beyond prisoner control make it impossible to file a petition on time.under this test,the statute of limitations may only be tolled where the circumstances are both beyond the petitioner control and unavoidable even with due diligence.sandvik,at.
petitioner urges us to adopt the test this court has generally followed in determining whether equitable tolling is appropriate.this test was set out in andrews orr,cir.in andrews orr,we specifically identified five factors to consider when determining the appropriateness of equitably tolling a statute of limitations the petitioner lack of notice of the filing requirement the petitioner lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirement diligence in pursuing one rights absence of prejudice to the respondent and the petitioner reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the legal requirement for filing his claim.memphis brooks museum of art,cir.
respondent urges this court to follow the rare and exceptional circumstances or extraordinary circumstances test.respondent argues that if this court were to apply the test in andrews orr,courts would be required to engage in the cumbersome litigation of whether the factors have been satisfied.respondent further argues that,unlike defendants in employment discrimination cases where we have applied the andrews orr test,the government is always prejudiced when the finality of a criminal conviction is attacked.
while we share in respondent concern that equitable tolling be applied sparingly,we do not believe that the test set out in andrews orr undermines the courts ability to so apply it sparingly.we do not find persuasive the government argument that the determination of whether the factors outlined in andrews orr are present will require untold and cumbersome litigation.there is no reason to believe that the test set out in andrews orr will serve the purpose of the limitation period any less aptly than the test applied by other courts inasmuch as the circumstances under which this court has found equitable tolling appropriate are in fact few in number.see,truitt county of wayne,cir wilson grumman ohio,cir fox eaton,cir leake of cincinnati,cir.respondent argument that the government is always prejudiced when there is a collateral attack of a conviction is equally unavailing inasmuch as the andrews orr test does not treat prejudice as an independent factor.prejudice may only be considered if other factors of the test are me
