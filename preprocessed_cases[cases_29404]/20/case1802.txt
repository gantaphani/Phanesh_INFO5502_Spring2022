james collins stayed up late the night of april to may,getting high on crack cocaine in his chicago apartment with his girlfriend,flora lanier.sometime after,collins and lanier began fighting,a fight that ended when lanier went through the window of collins apartment,causing fatal wounds to both her arms.collins,who has an iq in the and organic brain damage from an aneurysm in,spent the next day at a police station before waiving his miranda rights and giving a statement.the statement was admitted over his objection at trial,contributing to his conviction for firstdegree murder.the illinois courts have affirmed on direct appeal and review,and the federal district court has denied collins petition for a writ of habeas corpus.we now consider collins appeal using the deferential standard that applies under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act.because the state courts reasonably applied the correct legal standards and reasonably determined that collins intelligently waived his miranda rights,we affirm the denial of his petition.
background 
procedural history 
following his statement to police,james collins was indicted in the circuit court of cook county,illinois for murder.he filed two motions,a motion to quash his arrest and a motion to suppress his statement.the trial court denied both of these motions.
following a bench trial in late,the state trial court convicted collins of murder.the court found collins not guilty of intentional murder but guilty of knowing acts that created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm,which also constitutes murder under illinois law.see.comp.stat.a.the trial court sentenced collins to years in prison.he appealed his conviction to the illinois appellate court,claiming,among other things,that the trial court had erred in denying his motion to suppress.the appellate court affirmed the conviction on june,and the illinois supreme court denied leave to appeal on november.
on march,collins petitioned for state relief based on other,unrelated issues.the trial court dismissed that petition as frivolous and collins took no appeal.
finally,on april,collins filed his federal habeas petition,which the district court denied on march.the district court granted a certificate of appealability limited to the claim that collins did not knowingly waive his miranda rights.
b.the night of april to may,
on the night flora lanier died,james collins was years old.collins has long suffered from severe mental impairments.a brain aneurysm that he suffered in exacerbated those impairments,leaving him often unable to speak,understand,or think clearly.defense experts calculated his current iq in the low to,well below the average score.a neurologist testifying for the defense estimated that collins aneurysm had reduced his score by to points.
collins began the night of april in the company of his friend,benny price,who was homeless but had accepted collins invitation to spend the night in his apartment.between about and,the two men ate dinner and talked in the apartment.lanier showed up between and price testified that he thought lanier had been using pcp she smelled of ammonia and seemed only periodically aware of her surroundings.price had reason to know what a drug user looks like the government impeached his testimony with a prior conviction for delivery of a controlled substance and two for burglary.
lanier had also brought rocks of crack cocaine for herself and collins to smoke.collins made clear to price that the drugs were not for him,so price went to sleep on the floor.collins and lanier shared a bed in the same room where price was sleeping,with a makeshift barrier to give them some privacy.after going to bed,price overheard collins telling lanier to stop taking people money to buy drugs for them and then keeping the money for herself.at that point collins was calm,speaking in a normal tone and calling lanier baby.
what happened next was the subject of dispute at trial.price testified that he awoke around to the sound of collins and lanier arguing and physically fighting.according to price testimony,the combat was mutual,with both collins and lanier wrestling.price testified that both collins and lanier were yelling he heard lanier yell,i going to die anyway.not wanting to be around for this fight,price immediately left the apartment.on the ground floor,he heard glass break and saw lanier go through the window,then come back inside real suddenly.lanier then got on the kitchen table in front of the big window,and she hit it with her fist and leg,then stepped outside the window.she remained halfway out for a moment before collins snatched her back inside.as collins pulled lanier back in,all the blood went down the window like that.
from her apartment window one floor up,ethel patterson saw a different scene.patterson testified at trial that collins and lanier were tussling,but collins was the aggressor,hitting her in the head with his fist,while lanier was in a purely defensive posture,with her hands up over her head trying to block it.eventually patterson saw lanier coming through the window with both hands forward.patterson denied at trial that lanier ran through the window herself though a police detective testified that this was contrary to what he had taken down from patterson at the scene.after calling the police,patterson saw lanier bleeding profusely in the window and saying,i am dying,before collins jerked her back in.patterson went down to the third floor and found lanier bleeding to death in the hallway according to her testimony,all the doors were closed and no one was helping lanier.
police investigation and collins statement 
chicago police officer christopher dobek and his partner were among the first law enforcement officers to arrive on the scene.dobek testified that they received a dispatch call at about and responded to collins apartment.they found lanier covered in blood but still alive in the hallway outside,and they called for an ambulance.their knocking on collins apartment door pushed the door partly open.the apartment was in total disarray,with broken glass,blood all over the place.collins was inside,approaching the doorway,wearing only a pair of black pants,with blood on his hand and torso.
paramedics took lanier to the hospital,where she was pronounced dead.the medical examiner found evidence of injury to lanier face,neck,chest,back,and extremities.her most serious injuries were two gaping wounds,each three inches long,at the creases of lanier right and left elbows,and another wound on her left inner forearm.the medical examiner opinion was that lanier had died as a result of multiple sharp force trauma due to an assault and the manner of death was homicide.blood testing revealed the presence of a cocaine degradation product,benzoylecgonine,in lanier system.
detective john and his partner,detective joseph laskero,arrived on the scene shortly after lanier was taken away.interviewed several witnesses,including patterson and price.around the same time,two other uniformed officers spoke with collins and asked him to come to the station with them for questioning.collins agreed,and the officers brought him to a police station a few blocks away,arriving between and collins waited there until,when returned to the station.at that point,read collins a standard set of miranda warnings and collins agreed that he understood and wanted to speak.during this brief initial interview,collins told that lanier had tried to jump through the window.testified that,because this was inconsistent with what some of the witnesses had told him,he asked collins to submit to a polygraph examination.collins agreed,but an examiner was not available until left collins in an interview room without collins asking or offering permission to leave.
the police left collins alone during the nine hours that they waited for the examiner.he was allowed to leave the room to go to the bathroom.he was given food.he may have slept testified that he occasionally checked on collins and saw him either on the floor or with his head down and arms folded on the table as if sleeping.
eventually the polygraph examiner,officer robert bartik,became free as scheduled,and officers took collins from the local station to another police facility for the exam.from to approximately,bartik administered the polygraph.he first gave collins fresh miranda warnings and obtained collins consent to submit to the exam.he then hooked collins up and asked him nine questions,including whether collins had pushed lanier through the window and whether collins had purposefully caused her injuries.collins answered no to those questions,but the polygraph indicated that he was lying,and bartik told him so.
collins was then taken back to the local station,where he waited another hour or so until returned.after once again advising collins of his miranda rights,confronted him with the results of the polygraph.at,collins gave an oral statement implicating himself in lanier injury 
the detectives left collins in the interview room and called assistant state attorney art heil,who was on call for the state attorney office that night.heil arrived at the police station around on may and learned the basics of the case from and laskero.the three of them then went back to collins apartment building to view the scene and to speak again with ethel patterson,who was apparently willing to give the investigators an audience even in the middle of the night.they returned to the station around 
heil then introduced himself to collins for the first time,as a lawyer and prosecutor,and not your lawyer.he again explained to collins his miranda rights.heil asked collins to read a written statement of his miranda rights aloud,then sign underneath to signify that he understood.having done so,collins talked with heil for minutes to an hour,after which heil asked the detectives to leave the room.outside their presence,heil asked collins if the police had treated him well and allowed him to eat and use the bathroom.collins said that they had.heil then proposed to memorialize in writing what collins had told him.collins agreed.
heil began the written statement by asking collins basic questions about himself and how he had been treated by the police,and writing down collins answers.he proceeded to ask about the events leading to lanier death.as heil described it,i would ask him a question.he would give me the response.i would write it down as he gave it to me.if i had questions,i would ask him questions back.i would prompt him with questions,asking him what happened next,so forth.
when they were finished,heil showed collins the handwritten statement and had collins read the first paragraph aloud.then heil read the rest of the statement aloud with collins next to him.collins,heil,and one of the detectives signed the bottom of each page as they went along.
this is the substance of the statement that heil took down at on may and that the state court admitted over collins objection,with emphases added 
james collins states that he is years old and that his birthday is june,james lives at west harrison,number.
he has lived there for the past two years.james lives there with his girlfriend,flora lanier,who has lived with him for the past year and about eight months.james states that he can read and write english.james went to crane high school where he attended through his senior year but he did not graduate.
james states that on the early morning of may,he and flora had been up all night partying together.james states that they both smoked some crack cocaine.james states that around six,he and flora got into an argument.james states that the argument began over flora not wanting to go to bed.james states that both he and flora were yelling at each other and that flora was disrespecting him and called him a bitch.
james states that the argument then became physical and he was hitting flora.james states that he began hitting flora because she made him so angry that he went berserk.james states that while they were fighting,he pushed flora into the window and the window broke.james states that he pushed flora because he wanted to hurt her and he was angry.james states that after flora went into the window the first time,he continued to fight with her.james states that he continued to hit flora because of his anger.james states that he then pushed flora back into the window a second time and she broke the center window which is the bigger one.james states that he pushed her the second time because he was still trying to hurt her.james states that flora went into the window and the glass broke.james states that he then saw flora was cut and was bleeding.james states that flora was bleeding a lot and holding her arms.
james states that he still continued to struggle with flora and she got blood on his pajama bottoms.james states that flora broke free from him and ran out of the apartment.
james states that he did not go out after flora and closed the door of the apartment behind her.james states that he did this because he just did care about what happened to flora.
james states that he then washed the blood off his hands and put on some pants over his bloody pajamas.james states that he then heard people outside in the hallway saying that they were going to call the police and an ambulance.james states that he then opened the door and saw flora lying in the hallway bleeding.james states that he saw other people in the hallway but does not remember who was out there or how many.james states that he then said that flora tried to jump out of the window herself but that was not the truth.james states that he said that because he knew what he did was wrong and he did want to get in any trouble.
james states that he stayed inside his apartment until the police arrived a short time later.
evaluations of collins and evidence presented at the suppression hearing 
the state trial court heard testimony from four experts on collins motion to suppress.linda wetzel,a clinical neuropsychologist who holds a from the chicago medical school,evaluated collins on march,at the request of the defense.susan messina,a clinical psychologist who holds a.from the forest institute of professional psychology,evaluated collins in june,july,and september of,on assignment from the state court.linda gruenberg,a psychiatrist whose qualification as an expert was stipulated by the parties,evaluated collins on january and february,at the request of the prosecution.finally,daniel hier,a neurologist on the faculty of the university of illinois,did not evaluate collins personally but reviewed his medical records and expert evaluations and testified for the defense to interpret that medical evidence.
wetzel,the defense neuropsychologist,testified that she ran a standard battery of tests on collins and found that he performed poorly across a wide range of tests of mental ability.collins scored two standard deviations below average on the wechsler adult intelligence scale,a common iq test,and tested at a reading level.when wetzel gave him the trail a and trail b tests,which are designed to assess functioning of the part of the brain regulating behavior,he tested severely impaired on trail a and did so poorly on trail b that wetzel had to end the test without obtaining a result.she also tested for malingering and found no evidence that collins was faking his impairments.
wetzel also tested collins specifically on his understanding of the miranda warnings.she asked,one by one,if he knew what it meant that he had the right to remain silent,that anything he said could be used against him in court,that he had the right to a lawyer,and that a lawyer would be provided if he could not afford one.asked about the first warning meaning,he said,i do even have to say hello to you.on the second,likewise i do even have to say hello to you.on the third and fourth,collins said,you have the right to talk to a lawyer and have a lawyer present during questioning,then,i from the old school,i have morals,they incriminated on me.
wetzel concluded that collins was unable to understand or waive his miranda rights.this conclusion,she testified,was based on his low iq,the severity of his past brain injury,his low reading and spelling scores,and impairment in his and his ability to really behave in an independent manner and to resist other people urgings and requests that he do things.although wetzel conceded that collins understood the words of the warnings,she did feel that he understood miranda in the entire concept of miranda the purpose of miranda or the consequences of waiving miranda.
both the government and the court questioned whether wetzel,as a doctor,was capable of making an assessment of the effect of collins brain injury on his mental ability.she conceded that she was not an,but said that she based her assessment on the severity that is mentioned on cat scans and in the reports.the aneurysm that collins suffered,she testified,was an elephant standing in the room with regard to what caused his mental defects.
messina,the clinical psychologist assigned by the court,testified that she had reviewed collins police reports,statements,rap sheet,and history before meeting with him.like wetzel,she ran a number of tests on collins.he scored on the wechsler iq test.on the cognistat,which screens for limitations,collins showed weakness in memory calculations,reasoning,and information processing.like wetzel,messina found no evidence of malingering.messina testified that collins oftentimes became very tangential and disorganized and used a number of neologisms,meaning that collins often used a strange or incorrect word or combination of words 
messina went on to test collins understanding of the miranda warnings.on the first warning,he said,it means something could be used against me.you do say nothing until your attorney is present.on the second whatever i said,it best to be the right vocabulary coming out of the volume.then in court they can say,you said this,that,woo,woo,woo.it always best to have your lawyer.on the third,he said simply,my lawyer.and on the fourth they gon na give me one,and they did give me one.he shanghaied me.he did give me no miranda,just took me to the lockup.messina conceded that collins understands the meaning of the words in the warnings.she concluded,however,based on her interviews and testing,that collins would not have been capable of understanding or appreciating his miranda rights when he spoke with police.
gruenberg,the psychiatrist for the state,testified that she had reviewed wetzel and messina reports,as well as the other police and medical reports in collins record,before evaluating him.gruenberg evaluated collins mental ability by asking him a series of questions and interpreting the answers that collins gave.gruenberg testified that she review ed very carefully the other experts evaluations and the tests they gave,but would not be in a position to evaluate the manner in which the tests were given or which they were read.although she had no dispute with the results of the tests the other experts had given,gruenberg testified that comprehension of the warnings is a very specific question that i was able to determine he is able to do based upon my interview,regardless of the results of the tests messina and wetzel performed.
in her interview with collins,gruenberg asked what first degree murder was collins responded that that was what he was charged with.pressed further,he said that it meant premeditated.asked what premeditated meant,he answered killing someone and knowing what you are doing.gruenberg asked what the police are supposed to say before questioning him,and collins responded that the police are supposed to say you have a right to remain silent and what you say can be used against,which she read as having some understanding of the warnings.asked again later what the miranda warnings were,collins responded you have the right to remain silent,anything you say may be used against me.gruenberg also testified that collins acknowledged that he could stop speaking to her at any time,and that what he told her would be presented in court.
gruenberg also asked collins about the meaning of each specific warning.to the first warning,collins said,zip it,shut up,do talk,like a mannequin.do talk no matter how bad.do have to say.to the second even like i explained to you about everything that i say can be used against you,like you told me from the state when you first came here.gruenberg interpreted this response to mean that collins was recalling again that he knew i was from the state,and that he had an understanding that state was opposing him.to the third warning,collins said,the consequences of that could be devastating,overwhelming,but that he did not need an attorney to answer the questions,and no,i did need an attorney because i did do anything that i needed an attorney to defend on.to the fourth,collins said,it is clear,and you said it.
another line of questions concerned the consequences of speaking.asked the meaning of consequence,collins answered,regret or semi fortunate or unfortunate,and do nothing or do something,and do do it,but if i do,will suffer the consequence and that is on the unfortunate part that this is happening and might regret it.and might not.elaborating,collins said,there are consequences that depend on present time.and the consequence is whatever happened after i did it.asked specifically about the consequences of giving a statement,collins said,just like i did,look what happened to me.gruenberg believed that this referred to the fact that he had been arrested and incarcerated.
unlike messina and wetzel,gruenberg did not believe collins was overly compliant to the will or instruction of others.in support,she testified that she had asked collins if he would be concerned about her feelings if he wanted to terminate the interview.collins responded that he was not concerned about my feelings and said that he would be able to say to me nicely that i do want to talk on and then leave.
gruenberg concluded from all of her questioning that,at the time she interviewed him in january and february,collins was able to understand his miranda rights and the consequences of waiving those rights.she would not offer an opinion on his ability to understand the rights or consequences of waiver when he gave his statement to police,unless his mental state was similar to the state which he had at the time i evaluated him,a subject on which she offered no opinion.
the last doctor in line was daniel hier,the neurologist who testified for the defense.hier did not evaluate collins personally,but rather testified from a medical doctor perspective about the likely effects of the brain aneurysm that collins suffered in.he reviewed collins medical records from up to may,as well as the reports and testimony of all the experts who had come before him.hier clarified the medical record,corrected a few factual mistakes,and answered questions that the earlier experts had felt unqualified to answer.
hier began by explaining that collins brain had suffered a mycotic aneurysm,which occurs when an artery is weakened by bacterial infection.this aneurysm was not,as the court had surmised and wetzel had believed,the kind of aneurysm that can be treated by clipping and isolating it from circulation.hier went on to explain the procedures that collins underwent to treat the aneurysm and the physical damage that the aneurysm caused.specifically,he testified to two kinds of damage structural damage,namely,a hole in collins brain that was filled with spinal fluid,along with large areas of hemorrhage in both frontal lobes of the brain and neuropsychological damage flowing from that structural damage.
asked how one would measure this neuropsychological damage,hier answered that he would begin by testing for sensory loss or loss of coordination.finding no evidence of that here,he would proceed to do detailed neuropsychological evaluation to determine if there are any neuropsychological problems compatible with this hemorrhage.according to hier,the results of the tests that wetzel and messina performed provided evidence of deficits in neuropsychological functioning in collins which were compatible with the kind of injury that collins had suffered.hier explained further that the frontal lobes play the lead role in what called executive functioning,which he defined as the ability of the person to have insight into their own behavior,to plan for the future,to stay organized,to stay focused on task,among other things.the frontal lobes,which bore the brunt of the aneurysm damage,are also important in memory and language.
hier testified that he believed collins brain injury had caused him to suffer from expressive aphasia,a language disorder consistent with collins odd manner of speech.a more difficult question,hier acknowledged,was whether collins also suffered from receptive aphasia,or a defect in his ability to understand words spoken by others.hier conceded that none of the experts had performed a test specifically designed to diagnose that condition.but collins poor performance on a subtest of the wechsler iq test suggested to hier that collins had at least mild receptive aphasia.this testing,he said,was quite good and i believe quite valid.
hier offered no opinion on whether collins was able to understand the miranda warnings.he did offer,in response to questioning by the trial judge,a few words of disagreement with gruenberg interpretation of collins responses to her questions i found his responses kind of vapid,empty,vacuous and not reflecting a lot of understanding as to what the miranda rights really entailed.she took a different interpretation to it but again these are two different people interpreting the same information.
the state trial court also considered evidence from the written report of a fifth doctor,philip pan.pan,a psychiatrist,was assigned by the court to evaluate collins on october.pan concluded that the available evidence indicates that the defendant has an adequate understanding of his rights under miranda.he added,however i apologize to the court that i am unable to reach an opinion to the requisite degree of certainty whether defendant was able to understand and competently waive his rights under miranda at the time of his arrest and questioning.his documented cognitive deficiencies,the possible effects of drug intoxication or withdrawal with crack cocaine,and an overwhelmed and distraught emotional state leads to a murky reconstruction of the defendant likely mental state at that time.
the court also heard from prosecutor heil,detective,and officer bartik,all of whom testified that they gave collins miranda warnings before each interview and obtained his agreement that he understood.they also testified that collins never seemed confused about what they were telling or asking him.in addition,the court heard evidence that collins had been arrested four previous times,three times in and once in,and each time had been given miranda warnings.
the trial court denied the motion to suppress in a written opinion.the court gave a full summary of the evidence presented at the suppression hearing,including the testimony of the four experts,prosecutor heil,and the police witnesses.after laying out the legal standard for intelligent waiver of miranda rights,the court held that,although the evidence supported the defense argument that collins suffered intellectual deficits,it also showed that collins was able to understand his rights and the warnings he was given to the necessary degree.in reaching this conclusion,the court considered collins responses to the experts questions,the number of times he was given warnings on this occasion and in the past,and his initial denial of responsibility for lanier injuries.
on appeal,the illinois appellate court recapitulated the evidence and held that the trial court had not erred in admitting the statement.the appellate court followed the trial court reasoning,holding that the conflicting evidence in the record,as well as effective impeachment of the defense experts,was sufficient to affirm the trial court decision as reasonably supported by the evidence.
ii.analysis 
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa governs federal judicial review of a petition for writ of habeas corpus from a person in custody pursuant to a state court judgment.see.under the aedpa,a federal court may not issue a writ of habeas corpus unless the state court adjudication of the petitioner claim either resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.collins contends that the illinois state courts adjudication of his claims did both.
contrary to or unreasonable application of federal law 
collins first argument is that his petition should be granted because the illinois courts decisions were contrary to or unreasonable applications of clearly established federal law as determined by the united states supreme court.see d.the supreme court has explained that a decision is contrary to federal law when it contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases,or when the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent.williams taylor.a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of federal law when it correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case,id.at,but not when the state court merely applies federal law erroneously or incorrectly,id.at.in other words,the state court application of federal law must be well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.jackson frank,cir,quoting hardaway young,cir quotation marks omitted.here the state courts decision was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.
collins contends that the illinois courts failed to hold the government to the heavy burden of proving that he validly waived his rights under miranda arizona.it is true that the supreme court used those words and the illinois courts did not.but more than that is required to satisfy the standard of d.the state courts recited and applied the requirement that a defendant waiver must be both voluntary,meaning,and intelligent,meaning with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.see moran burbine,accord,colorado spring,edwards arizona,tague louisiana,courts may not presume that waiver was voluntary and knowing state must meet heavy burden of showing voluntary and knowing waiver.
the state courts also applied the proper standard for intelligent waiver.the trial court wrote that the awareness component does not require knowing and understanding every possible consequence of a waiver but rather simply being cognizant of the state intention to use one statement to secure a conviction and of the fact that one can stand mute and request a lawyer.the trial court properly cited burbine and oregon elstad,the supreme court central cases on this question.for its part,the appellate court cited only illinois cases but used the same correct standard.
collins also argues that the state court decision was contrary to federal law because it failed to require the government to show that police took special care in obtaining a voluntary waiver given his limited mental capacity.we disagree.the supreme court has said that when the police are aware of a suspect mental defect but persist in questioning him,such dogged persistence can contribute to a finding that the waiver was involuntary.see mincey arizona,suspect waiver was involuntary when police officer questioned him while he was confused and unable to think clearly,in critical condition in a hospital bed.the court has also held that a suspect mental capacity is a factor that a court must consider in deciding whether a waiver was voluntary.see fare michael,citing north carolina butler.the court has never held,however,that police can render a waiver of miranda rights involuntary simply by failing to take special care that a suspect with a mental disability understands his rights.
even if the supreme court had clearly established a special care requirement in its precedents,the state courts failure to apply such a requirement here would not have met the standard imposed by d for habeas relief.collins produced no evidence that the police officers who examined him were aware of his mental deficiency.indeed,his trial counsel barely prosecutor heil and detective on this point,and his appellate counsel conceded at oral argument that she was not claiming the police illegally coerced collins into giving a statement.
unreasonable determination of the facts 
the state courts were right on the legal standard and applied that legal standard reasonably to the facts that they had determined.but collins has also challenged whether the state courts were reasonable in finding those facts.the aedpa permits a federal court to grant a petition for writ of habeas corpus if the state court decision is based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d 
under this standard,a state court factual finding is never unreasonable merely because the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance.wood allen.rather,the state court determination of the facts must have been an unreasonable error in light of the evidence presented to that court.ward sternes,cir.because the illinois supreme court denied review,we look to the opinion of the illinois appellate court,as well as to the written opinion of the trial court,whose reasoning and outcome were followed and affirmed on appeal.
for a defendant to have validly waived his rights under miranda,two distinct facts must be true.first,the defendant must have waived his rights voluntarily.miranda arizona.in other words,the waiver must have been the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation,coercion,or deception.moran burbine,accord,colorado spring.second,the defendant must have waived his rights knowingly and intelligently.miranda,at.in other words,the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation must show that the defendant had a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.burbine,at accord,spring,at 
as we have noted,collins does not seriously contend here that his waiver was involuntary.nor could he,because there is no evidence that the police sought to obtain a confession despite his will to remain silent or to have a lawyer present during questioning.collins went voluntarily to the police station.although he remained in an interview room for nine hours waiting for a polygraph examiner to become available,he was given food and drink,was allowed to use the bathroom,and was otherwise left alone.he never invoked his right to remain silent or to see a lawyer.the police gave him miranda warnings each time he was questioned and had him acknowledge his waiver.there is no evidence that they knew about his mental disability and sought to take advantage of it.
but even in the absence of intentional coercion,if collins had insufficient mental capacity to understand what the officers and prosecutor were saying to him,he could not have waived his rights.what level of understanding,then,does miranda require before a defendant can intelligently waive his rights and give an admissible statement 
the supreme court has offered some limited guidance on this question,usually by telling lower courts what the government need not show in order to prove a valid miranda waiver.the constitution does not require that a criminal suspect know and understand every possible consequence of a waiver of the fifth amendment privilege.spring,at,citing burbine,at elstad,at.a waiver is valid if the defendant fully understands the nature of the right and how it would likely apply in general in the though the defendant may not know the specific detailed consequences of invoking it.united states ruiz.for example,a defendant may waive his right to remain silent even if he does not know the specific questions the authorities intend to ask.id.at.
the federal courts of appeals,including this circuit,have followed the supreme court instructions by requiring the government to clear only a relatively low bar in proving an intelligent waiver.generally,the courts will hold that a defendant waiver is knowing if he understands that he can refuse to talk to the people asking him questions or stop the questioning once it begins that the people asking him questions are not his friends but are police or law enforcement personnel who are trying to show he is guilty of a crime that he can ask for and get a lawyer who will help him and that he does not have to pay for that lawyer.see,smith mullin,cir mentally disabled defendant gave intelligent waiver where he understood the role of police officers and the concept of a criminal charge,comprehended the questions the officers presented,and had been arrested and served time in prison before henderson detella,cir waiver was intelligent where defendant had iq but understood the nature of the charges,initially declined to speak,and had been prosecuted as a juvenile united states frank,cir no clear error in admitting statement where a navajo man who knew nothing about the american legal system understood that he could remain silent,that a defense lawyer is someone who helps you,and that a prosecutor does not help you.it is only when the evidence in the case shows that the defendant could not comprehend even the most basic concepts underlying the miranda warnings that the courts have found an unintelligent waiver.one example is a defendant whose command of english is so poor that the police might as well have been speaking gibberish.see,united states alarcon,fed.appx,cir defendant understood only bits and pieces of english and often pretended to understand english out of embarrassment and a desire to cooperate united states garibay,cir no evidence that defendant spoke enough english to understand warnings,and several witnesses testified that he spoke only a few words of english.
the state courts found that collins understood enough of the police and prosecutor warnings to satisfy miranda requirements.we can not say that finding was unreasonable,although this is by no means an easy case.as the state courts acknowledged,collins produced significant evidence of his limited mental capacity at the time he gave his statement.the state courts gave due consideration to that evidence.our deferential evaluation of the record leads us to conclude that the state courts were not unreasonable in determining that collins nevertheless understood to the requisite degree both the miranda warnings and the consequences of waiving his rights.
to begin with,the testimony of the expert witnesses at the suppression hearing does not compel us to find that collins was incapable of giving an intelligent waiver.wetzel and messina both testified to that ultimate legal conclusion,but an expert testimony about an ultimate issue is most valuable when it is amply supported by the rest of her testimony.see,huey united parcel service,cir an ultimate conclusion without analysis is meaningless.these experts supporting testimony does not convince us that the state courts were unreasonable in rejecting their final opinions.wetzel testimony that collins was able to paraphrase each sentence of the warnings and understood that he does have to talk,but was unable to really elaborate on his rights and could not understand the entire concept of miranda or the purpose of miranda,leads us to suspect that wetzel applied a more rigorous standard of understanding than the supreme court requires.likewise,messina testified that collins was able to tell her,in his own words,what each of the warnings meant.though collins manner of speaking sometimes clouded what he was trying to say,he was able to get across that something could be used against me,that you do say nothing until your attorney is present,that if you speak to police,then in court they can say,you said this,that,woo,woo,woo,and that if he could not afford a lawyer,they gon na give me one.this is not the kind of utter incomprehension that would compel a result contrary to
