rolando ruiz was sentenced to death after a jury in bexar county,texas,convicted him of capital murder.texas state courts affirmed his conviction and sentence and refused habeas relief.the federal district court dismissed his federal habeas petition,finding his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and unconstitutional strictures of argument in mitigation procedurally barred and rejecting his contention that the state trial court erred in sustaining the state challenge for cause of a member of the venire.the court refused certificate of appealability except as to the last claim.we refuse ruiz request for certificate of appealability on the first two claims and affirm the district court judgment on the third.
on january,a jury in bexar county,texas,convicted ruiz of capital murder and in the punishment phase gave affirmative answers to the two interrogatories required by texas law.he was then sentenced to death.the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed the conviction and death sentence ruiz filed a state habeas application on september,for which the state trial court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law on december,recommending that the texas court of criminal appeals deny relief.it did 
ruiz then filed his federal petition,claiming ineffective assistance of counsel,unconstitutional strictures of argument in mitigation,and error in the state trial court sustaining the state challenge for cause of a member of the venire,assertedly witherspoon error.the district court denied relief,finding the first two claims procedurally barred because ruiz failed to exhaust them in state court,thus raising an independent state procedural bar to relief,and rejecting the third claim.the court refused certificate of appealability on its procedural rulings but granted coa on the witherspoon claim 
there was sufficient evidence at trial from which the jury could conclude that ruiz was hired by mark and michael rodriguez to murder michael wife,theresa,for two thousand dollars that he did so by shooting her in the head at close range with a revolver.
we turn first to the request for coa.coa will issue only if ruiz makes a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,a showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether or,for that matter,agree that the court below should have resolved the claims in a different manner or that this court should encourage ruiz to further litigate his claims in federal court 
as the lower court denied the first two claims on procedural grounds without reaching the merits of the underlying constitutional claims,coa should issue only if ruiz demonstrates that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of a denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.the determination of either issue requires an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits,but not full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.we find it plain that the soundness of the district court denials of the claims as procedurally barred is not debatable among reasonable jurists and we refuse ruiz request for coa.
the exhaustion doctrine of b codifies principles of comity before a federal court can find merit in alleged errors by state courts,a petitioner must have first provided the state highest court with a fair opportunity to apply the controlling federal constitutional principles to the same factual allegations this requirement is designed to give state courts the initial opportunity to pass upon and,if necessary,correct errors of federal law in a state prisoner conviction or sentence the purpose of exhaustion is not to create a procedural hurdle on the path to federal habeas court,but to channel claims into an appropriate forum,where meritorious claims may be vindicated and unfounded litigation obviated before resort to federal court.
a fair opportunity requires that all the grounds of the claim be first and fairly presented to the state courts in other words,in order for a claim to be exhausted,the state court system must have been presented with the same facts and legal theory upon which the petitioner bases his current assertions i t is not enough that a somewhat similar claim was made.an argument based on a legal theory distinct from that relied upon in the state court does not meet the exhaustion requirement exhaustion requires a state prisoner to present the state courts with the same claim he urges upon the federal courts.aedpa excuses these requirements only if the petitioner shows i there is an absence of available state remedies in the courts of the state,or ii circumstances exist that render such processes ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.
furthermore,where a petitioner has failed to exhaust claims in state court,and that failure would now result in the state procedurally rejecting those claims,the petitioner has procedurally defaulted the claims and we must find them procedurally barred exceptions to procedural default exist where the petitioner shows cause and actual prejudice or that application of the procedural bar will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.
ruiz relevant claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and unconstitutional strictures of argument in mitigation first came in his petition for habeas relief filed in federal district court.the state responded that the court could not hear those claims because ruiz did not present them to the state courts,although he could have done so,at the least in a petition for state habeas relief moreover,texas courts would now dismiss the claims as an abuse of the writ without reaching their merits.the court agreed,finding that ruiz had not established excuse under aedpa for failure to exhaust or an applicable exception to procedural default.it then refused to grant coa,a request now made to this court.
ruiz does not contend that he did not know that state habeas offered an avenue for presenting his claims or that the claims were presented.rather,his present counsel argues,as he did to the district court,that for two reasons there should be no procedural bar here.first,ruiz contends that his state habeas counsel was ineffective.ruiz state habeas counsel filed a petition on behalf of ruiz asserting seventeen claims,eight of which claimed ineffective assistance of trial counsel.ruiz present claim is that his lawyer failed to allege two claims.first,a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel with two specifications that trial counsel failed to perform a social history and background investigation in preparing for the sentencing phase of the trial and failed to offer the report or the testimony of harry munsinger at the sentencing stage.second,a claim that ruiz was denied due process by the state trial court instruction to the jury to disregard a portion of defense counsel closing argument regarding the who hired ruiz to murder,as charged in the indictment.the federal district court agreed that trial counsel was ineffective and suggested that state habeas counsel was ineffective,but it properly rejected ruiz argument for the reason that incompetence of habeas counsel is not an excuse under b b of aedpa for failure to exhaust or cause for an exception to procedural default because ruiz had no constitutional right to counsel in habeas proceedings this is true even where a claim can not be brought,or brought effectively,until state habeas proceedings 
second,ruiz his claim of ineffective habeas counsel by asserting that the state obstructed his efforts to prosecute the claims by appointing incompetent counsel,effectively making his state remedy illusory and,hence,insulating his claims from federal review through the doctrine of procedural default.in ruiz view,he would be better off if there had been no state habeas proceeding available or if he had had no appointed counsel.according to ruiz,this situation resulted from a structural deficiency in the state habeas system,rendering that system absent or ineffective to
