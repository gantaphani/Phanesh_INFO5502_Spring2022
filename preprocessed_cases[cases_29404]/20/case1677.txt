gerald hofbauer,in his official capacity as warden of the marquette correctional facility in marquette,michigan the state,appeals from the district court conditional grant of a writ of habeas corpus under,as amended by the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,in favor of terrance lesean hill.
the district court found that the state trial court denied hill his sixth amendment confrontation clause rights.specifically,the district court found that the michigan court erred by allowing into evidence a statement made by hill.the state claims on appeal that the writ should not have been granted because the state court admission of the statement was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.the state asserts that ohio roberts,d,provides for the admission of hearsay statements where the statements contain significant indicia of reliability.the state argues that the statement is reliable because it was made against the declarant penal interest.
we reject the state arguments and affirm the grant of the writ.we find that the trial court admission of the statement over hill objection was contrary to the precedent clearly established by the supreme court in lee illinois,d bruton united states,d and douglas alabama,d.we also find the error not harmless because the statement indicates that hill possessed the requisite malice to be guilty of murder.
hill petition for a writ of habeas corpus arises from his arrest and conviction following the robbery and murder of jermaine johnson on august.on that date,johnson was shot and killed inside his residence in flint,michigan by assailants.
sometime in,mekia randle informed flint police that her,jabbar priest bulls,had told her he had participated in johnson murder.randle gave recorded statements to the police describing bulls role in the murder.flint police arrested bulls and confronted him with randle statements.bulls gave a statement confessing to the crime,and inculpating hill and another,deonte matthews,as well.hill and matthews were subsequently arrested.
in his statement,bulls gave his account of the events surrounding johnson murder.he stated that on august,johnson approached him on the street and offered him money in exchange for allowing johnson to perform oral sex on him.bulls verbally accepted the offer and accompanied johnson to johnson home.bulls claimed he had no interest in johnson sexual advances,but he accompanied johnson because he thought t hat he could beat him up and take his money.upon arriving at johnson home,bulls quickly excused himself but promised to return.after he left johnson house,bulls went to matthews house to recruit matthews and hill to aid him in robbing johnson.specifically,bulls stated i told matthews about the fag around the corner and i told him we could go and rob him real quick sic and get paid.i told him we could go and stick up the fag and after i told him that,then i told hill.moreover,bulls asked matthews to bring a gun.in response,matthews went upstairs and retrieved a shotgun.bulls stated that hill also agreed to the plan to rob johnson,and the three men left matthews house,walking together.at johnson house,bulls went to the back door,while hill stayed on the side of the house,and matthews was on the other side of the door.and when bulls knocked on the door,johnson opened the door.and as soon as johnson opened the door,matthews rushed and he pointed the shotgun in his face.only bulls and matthews entered johnson house,while hill s tood outside as a lookout.as bulls and matthews were rummaging through the house,johnson attempted to flee,and then bulls heard a blast.matthews had shot johnson,killing him.immediately,bulls asked matthews why he had shot johnson,to which matthews responded he tried to run.bulls then sprinted down the steps,exited the house,and ran to randle house.
after his arrest,hill also gave a statement to police,likewise giving his account of the events.he stated that bulls came to him to solicit his help in robbing johnson.bulls proposed a plan,under which he expected hill to stand outside and w ait for bulls to let him inside the house to take items from the house.hill initially agreed to do so.as hill and bulls were walking toward johnson house,matthews met the two of them and then subsequently left.bulls told hill that matthews was leaving to get a gun because it would be easier for him to rob johnson.matthews returned,but was not visibly carrying a weapon.upon reaching johnson house,hill followed bulls and matthews up the driveway,went behind the house,and listened while bulls and matthews stood at the back door.hill stated that,at this time,he did have his mind made up whether he was going to enter the house.bulls knocked on the door,and had a brief conversation with the resident,presumably johnson.at this time,hill decided to abandon the plot and left.he said he heard a shot as he was walking away.
subsequently,neighbors apparently saw some men running from the house,and described a person who resembled hill.the flint police stopped and questioned hill later that night,but initially determined he was not involved and released him.
in,hill and bulls were tried together in genessee county,michigan,circuit court during the trial,neither defendant testified.however,both hill and bulls statements were entered into evidence.hill was convicted of murder under.comp.laws and assault with intent to rob while armed under.comp.laws.hill received a sentence of life imprisonment for the murder charge,and fifteen to thirty years imprisonment for the assault charge.he appealed to the michigan court of appeals,claiming,inter alia,that this sixth amendment confrontation clause rights were violated by the introduction of bulls statements.on september,the court affirmed hill convictions and sentence.people bulls,wl,per curiam state appeal.the michigan supreme court denied hill application for leave to appeal on june.people bulls.
pursuant to,hill filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the district court.the court conditionally granted the petition on november.hill hofbauer,d hill i.on november,the state filed a notice of appeal with this court.this appeal is timely under fed.app.b b.
bulls was also found guilty at his joint trial with hill.in his case,the michigan court of appeals had ruled that the introduction of hill statement was a violation of bulls sixth amendment rights.state appeal,wl,at.the michigan court found that hill statement did not fit into the hearsay exception for statements against the declarant penal interest because hill,in his statement,had shifted most of the blame to bulls.id.at.however,the court found the error harmless because bulls had admitted that he knew matthews was carrying a shotgun,and the jury could therefore infer bulls malice from his own statement.id.bulls filed a habeas petition and challenged the harmless error ruling in the district court below.the district court found the error not harmless and granted the writ.bulls jones,d.we affirmed,finding the error not harmless because the admission of hill statement tended to show that bulls knew there was a high likelihood that matthews would kill johnson,more so than did bulls own statement.bulls jones,cir.
we review a district court legal conclusions in a habeas proceeding de novo,and its factual findings for clear error.vincent seabold,cir.
because hill filed his petition in november,his case is governed by d,as amended by the aedpa of.see vincent,at see also lindh murphy,d.section d,as amended,provides that a petition for writ of habeas corpus shall fail before the district court unless the state trial court decision 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
in williams taylor,d,the supreme court analyzed the aedpa,and clarified what constitutes a decision contrary to,or an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court law.the contrary to and unreasonable application clauses of the aedpa are independent tests and must be analyzed separately.id.at.a state court decision can be contrary to supreme court case law in two ways.first,the decision is contrary if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law.also,a decision is contrary if the state court considers facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court case and arrives at an opposite result.id.at.a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of supreme court law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rules from the court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case.it is also an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent where a state court invokes a supreme court case and unreasonably extends its legal principle to a new context where it should not apply,or fails to extend it where it should apply.id.at.moreover,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.id.at.
in ohio roberts,d,the supreme court held that a hearsay statement is nonetheless admissible against a defendant if it falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.the court defined a firmly rooted exception as one that assures the court that there are indicia of reliability which have been widely viewed as determinative of whether a statement may be placed before the jury though there is no confrontation of the declarant,and that affords the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement.id.at.quoting mancusi stubbs,d citations omitted.where the hearsay statement does not fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,it is admissible only upon as showing of other particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.roberts,at.
in this case,the michigan court of appeals recognized the existence of hill federal constitutional rights,and acknowledged roberts as the leading case law in the area.see state appeal,wl,at.relying on roberts,the court found that bulls statements were reliable because they fell within the firmly rooted hearsay exception for statements against penal interest specifically,the court stated 
although bulls made his statements concerning hill while in custody,the record is devoid of any indication that bulls was motivated to make the statements by a desire to curry favor from the authorities.further,bulls statements have several indicia of reliability in that they do not minimize his role or responsibility in the crime,they were voluntarily given,and they were not motivated by a desire to lie or distort the truth regarding hill involvement in the crime.accordingly,we conclude that the portions of bulls statements implicating hill fall within the penal interest exception to the hearsay rule and have sufficient indicia of reliability to satisfy confrontation clause concerns.thus,the trial court did not err in admitting the statements against hill.
state appeal,wl,at.
hill petitioned the district court below for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court determined that the michigan court decision was objectively unreasonable and contrary to lilly virginia,d,and lee illinois,d.hill i,d at.the district court found that those cases stand for the proposition that a confession inculpating the accused s inherently unreliable,and convictions supported by such evidence violate the constitutional right of confrontation.id.quoting lee,at.accordingly,the court held that bulls statements were outside any firmly rooted exception under roberts.hill i,d at.the district court continued its analysis,and independently examined bulls statement under the sound prong of the roberts test to determine whether it nonetheless bore guarantees of trustworthiness to justify its admission.id.at.the district court found none and granted the writ.id.at.
the state argues that the district court erred to the extent it relied on lilly.the state contends that we should disregard lilly in its entirety because that case was not decided until,a year after hill conviction was affirmed by the michigan court of appeals.the state asserts that,at the time,the admission of bulls statement against hill can not have been contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,d,because the supreme court had not yet decided the issue in lilly.
the state is correct that any new law in lilly can not be considered under the aedpa,but the state misreads,first,the district court opinion as relying solely on lilly,and,second,lilly as creating a new rule rather than stating one mandated from earlier precedent 
although the decision in lilly drove the district court opinion,the court nonetheless cited the earlier supreme court cases of lee and bruton united states,d,to stand for the same proposition as lilly,and to demonstrate that the principles espoused in lilly were previously established.see hill i,d at see also teague lane,d stating that,in regard to habeas cases,a subsequently decided case does not present new law if it is dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant conviction became final.
in lilly,a plurality unequivocally stated that confessions made by a inculpating not only himself but his are inherently unreliable and not within a firmly rooted hearsay exception for statements against penal interest.lilly,at.accordingly,the court ruled that under the framework discussed in roberts,a custodial confession can not be entered into evidence absent additional guarantees of trustworthiness.the court distinguishe d accomplices confessions that inculpate themselves and the accused as beyond a proper understanding of the against exception because an accomplice often has a considerable interest in confessing and betraying his cocriminals.id.at.citing wigmore,evidence,at,chadbourn.the court further distinguished the confessions of accomplices from the statements of made in furtherance of a conspiracy,which have traditionally been held trustworthy,because in the case of custodial confessions,the government is typically involved in the statements production.therefore such statements do not bear the same indicia of reliability as is present in statements made of the declarant own accord.see id.at.
moreover,the supreme court expressly referenced past supreme court cases in achieving its result in lilly,stating that i t is clear that our cases consistently have viewed an accomplice statements that shift or spread the blame to a criminal defendant as falling outside the realm of those hearsay exception s that are so trustworthy that adversarial testing can be expected to add little to the statements reliability.id.at.quoting white illinois,d emphasis added alterations in original see also lilly,id.at.citing douglas alabama,d.
in our opinion in bulls case,we spoke to whether lilly was mandated by earlier precedent,and addressed substantially the same cases referenced by the lilly court 
the sixth amendment provides that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.that guarantee includes the right to witnesses.see pointer texas,d.the supreme court has repeatedly held that a statements that implicate a defendant are presumptively unreliable and their admission violates the confrontation clause.see douglas alabama,d see also bruton united states,d holding that the admission of confession incriminating defendant,even with jury instructions to consider confession only against the,violates the confrontation clause.the supreme court has noted that since douglas,it has spoken with one voice in declaring presumptively unreliable accomplices confessions that incriminate defendants.lee illinois,d see also lilly,at.cruz new york,d.to overcome this presumption of unreliability and introduce such statements into evidence,the prosecution must show that the statements bear adequate indicia of reliability.roberts,at.united states mccleskey,cir i t is clear that supreme court confrontation clause jurisprudence does not permit the introduction of hearsay declarations uttered by accomplices in law enforcement custody that inculpate a defendant,absent further particularized guarantees of the declaration trustworthiness.
bulls jones,cir.in bulls,the state had conceded it was constitutional error for the trial court to enter hill statement against bulls because hill statement shifted a greater portion of the blame to bulls,and thus was not against hill penal interest.the only issue before us in bulls was whether the error was harmless.accordingly,our discussion in bulls of whether the principles espoused in lilly were previously clearly established was dicta.
today,we squarely face the issue whether lilly was by earlier clearly established supreme court law for the first time therefore,we find it necessary to discuss the facts of the supreme court cases cited in lilly and bulls in further detail.
in douglas alabama,d,the court found that a statement wherein a declarant places any blame at all on his is unreliable and inadmissible hearsay.id.at.in a joint trial,the prosecutor was not permitted to refresh the memory of the uncooperative declarant with his statement because it implicated the defendant as well as himself.the court found that such use would plainly den y the defendant the right of secured by the confrontation clause.id.
in bruton united states,d,a had made a statement inculpating not only himself but the defendant,george bruton,as well.at a joint trial,prosecutors sought to enter the statement,which was admittedly hearsay,under the exception for the admissions of a.the trial court admitted the statement against the declarant and instructed the jury that the statement could not be considered against bruton.the supreme court ruled that the limiting instruction was not sufficient.the court found that the sixth amendment right to is absolute,and admission of the statement therefore violated bruton right to confront the evidence against him.there was no presumption of veracity in the statement because the credibility of such statements is inevitably suspect.at.
in lee illinois,d,the court again held a confession not within a hearsay exception and inadmissible.there,millie lee,edwin thomas,gave a statement inculpating both himself and lee in a plot to kill lee aunt.notwithstanding that thomas statement was voluntary and also incriminated himself,the court held the statement unreliable and stated 
although the confession was found to be voluntary for fifth amendment purposes,such a finding does not bear on the question of whether the confession was also free from any desire,motive,or impulse thomas may have had either to mitigate the appearance of his own culpability by spreading the blame or to overstate lee involvement in retaliation for lee having implicated him in the murders.
id.at.moreover,the court in lee recognized even then that its rule was not new law,stating that there is no occasion to depart from the teaching that a confession inculpating the accused is inherently unreliable,and that convictions supported by such evidence violate the constitutional right of confrontation.id.at.emphasis added.
in cruz new york,d,the defendant,eulogio cruz,sought to suppress his confession under bruton.however,cruz had also made a confession which mirrored his statement in all relevant aspects.the trial court admitted the confession against cruz,finding it reliable because of the two statements interlocking nature.cruz,at.the supreme court reversed,and held that the existence of cruz own corroborating confession did not automatically render the statement reliable,and its admission constituted sixth amendment error.id.at.the court held,however,that the defendant corroborating confession could be used on appeal to determine whether the error was harmless.id.at.
as the foregoing discussion indicates,the supreme court had provided a line of cases holding that a custodial confession is inherently unreliable.however,the state nonetheless contends that the lilly rule can not be said to have been previously clearly established by the supreme court because several federal circuits had held such statements admissible in the face of the supreme court precedent.although only supreme court case law is relevant under the aedpa in examining what federal law is clearly established,the decisions of the united states courts of appeals may be informative to the extent we have already reviewed and interpreted the relevant supreme court case law to determine whether a legal principle or right had been clearly established by the supreme court.see,dubois,cir,overruled on other grounds,mccambridge hall,cir en banc.because we had examined this issue only in dicta,a review of other circuits case law interpreting douglas,bruton,and lee may be informative.
in united states york,cir,the seventh circuit affirmed the admission of a statement against the defendant at his insurance fraud trial.the,gail maher,had made statements to two associates claiming that she and the defendant,tom york,had planned to blow up the lounge york owned in order to collect the insurance proceeds.id.at.maher,having died,did not testify.the court affirmed the admission of maher statement,noting that it tended to subject her to such criminal liability that she would not have made the statement had it not been true.id.
in united states seeley,cir,authored by judge stephen breyer,the first circuit likewise upheld the admission of a statement as against his penal interest.there,the defendant,edward seeley,was charged in connection with two massachusetts bank robberies.a fellow bank robber,robert wayne,made statements to his girlfriend that inculpated himself,seeley,and three other men in the bank heists.id.at.wayne was found dead a month after the robberies,and was therefore not charged in the crimes and unable to testify at seeley trial.the trial court allowed wayne girlfriend to testify to his statements,and the first circuit upheld their admission,finding that the statements bore sufficient indicia of reliability because wayne would not have made such statements to his girlfriend had they not been true.id.at see also united states fields,cir affirming admission of wayne statements against another accomplice for same reasons.
in united states katsougrakis,cir,one of the,kyriakos chrisanthou,was badly burned while setting fire to the defendant restaurant,and subsequently died from his injuries.the trial court allowed chrisanthou wife and his friend,fitos vasilou,to testify at katsougrakis fraud trial about statements that chrisanthou had made to each of them implicating himself,as well as katsougrakis and other,in a scheme to defraud katsougrakis insurers by setting fire to his business.the second circuit affirmed the admissions,finding sufficient indicia of reliability in chrisanthou statements because they were sufficiently against his penal interest.id.at.
however,each of these circuit cases is distinguishable from the case subjudice the defendant in each case made his statement,not to police,but to an acquaintance or a fellow accomplice.therefore,at the time of the statement,none of the defendants was motivated by a desire to curry the favor of law enforcement officials.see,katsougrakis,at stating that chrisanthou statements bore adequate indicia of reliability only because they were made while talking privately with his friend and not to police.douglas,bruton,and lee indicate that the supreme court has held statements made to police to closer scrutiny.although rule b provides a hearsay exception for statements against the declarant interest,this rule has been consistently disregarded by the supreme court in situations where the declarant custodial confession at all implicates somebody else.such statements are never truly against the declarant penal interest because a defendant in custody always has a motivation to implicate and pass the blame to another,even if in the slightest.see lee,at.as the supreme court stated in williamson united states,d,such statements are inherently unreliable because o ne of the most eff
