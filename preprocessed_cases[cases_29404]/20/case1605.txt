respondents appeal from the district court order granting habeas relief to petitioner,chi jing liao,and declaring him eligible to apply for cancellation of removal.while conceding he was removable on other grounds,liao habeas petition challenged the determination of the board of immigration appeals bia that his state conviction for possession of heroin was an aggravated felony as defined by a b,rendering him ineligible to seek discretionary cancellation of removal under a because we agree that liao conviction did not qualify as an aggravated felony under this section,we affirm.
petitioner,chi jing liao,a native and citizen of the people republic of china,entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident in october.in september,liao was convicted on three state charges simple possession of heroin,in violation of ohio theft,in violation of ohio and receiving stolen property,in violation of ohio.these convictions resulted in concurrent terms of imprisonment.possession of heroin,the focus of this appeal,is a fifth degree felony under ohio law,but is punishable by a maximum term of months imprisonment.
the ins now the department of homeland security commenced removal proceedings against liao in september.the initial notice charged two independent grounds for removal that liao had been convicted of a violation of state law relating to a controlled substance,other than a single offense involving possession for one own use of grams or less of marijuana,a b i and that he had been convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude,not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct,a a ii.liao conceded that he was removable on either of these grounds,and requested,among other forms of relief,discretionary cancellation of removal.

liao did not seek direct judicial review of the bia final order of removal,but filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the district court on june.on september,after receiving the parties submissions on the merits,the district court rejected the bia interpretation relied on some of the same cases cited by the dissenting panel member and found liao drug conviction was not a felony under state law,and therefore not an aggravated felony under a b,because it was not punishable by more than one year in prison.the district court accordingly granted the habeas petition and declared that liao was eligible to apply for cancellation of removal.respondents appealed.
background 
the term aggravated felony is a term of art that can include misdemeanors,see united states,cir misdemeanor sexual abuse of a minor is an aggravated felony,and has been increasingly expanded to encompass many kinds of offenses,a a u.see ins cyr,d discussing expansion.this case concerns only a b,which defines aggravated felony to mean illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in section of title,including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title,and specifically provides that this applies to any such offense whether in violation of federal or state law.a b emphasis added.the federal criminal code,in turn,defines drug trafficking crime to be any felony punishable under the controlled substances act et,the controlled substances import and export act et,or the maritime drug law enforcement act.et.c competing interpretations of the phrase any felony punishable under the controlled substances act csa in c for purposes of a b have developed,although this court has not taken a position on the issue.united states,cir.
one interpretation,referred to as the hypothetical felony approach,finds its origin in early bia decisions that held a state drug conviction could qualify as an aggravated felony in one of two ways if the state felony conviction had a trafficking element which is not argued here or if the conviction would be punishable as a felony under one of the enumerated federal drug statutes the hypothetical felony approach.in re davis,i n,bia in re barrett,i n bia.this interpretation reads the phrase any felony punishable under the csa to mean any conviction punishable as a felony under the csa.the bia adhered to this analogous or hypothetical felony approach for a number of years,except in circuits that held to the contrary.in re,i n bia disagreeing with jenkins ins,cir.
the second,third,and,most recently,the ninth circuits have adopted the hypothetical felony approach in immigration cases to determine whether a state drug conviction is a drug trafficking crime and therefore an aggravated felony.aguirre ins,cir gerbier holmes,cir ashcroft,cir.as most fully articulated in,this interpretation rests principally on an overriding presumption favoring the uniform application of immigration laws,absent plain indication that congress intended to incorporate state variation.looking at the legislative history for c,these courts found that congress intended state drug convictions would qualify as aggravated felonies for immigration purposes only if they were punishable as felonies under federal law or involved a trafficking element,at gerbier,at.practically speaking,then,a state felony drug possession conviction not involving any element of drug trafficking that would only be punishable as a federal misdemeanor would not constitute an aggravated felony under a b 
the other interpretation,referred to as the guideline approach,developed independently in federal sentencing cases specifically,in the application of the sentencing guideline manual to aliens convicted of unlawful reentry into the united states after conviction for an aggravated felony as defined in a under this approach,which has been adopted by a clear majority of circuits addressing the issue in the sentencing context,a state drug conviction constitutes a drug trafficking crime and therefore an aggravated felony if it was punishable under the csa or the other statutes not at issue here and it was a felony under federal or state law.see united states wilson,cir,cert.denied,d united states,cir united states,cir united states simon,cir united states,cir united states,cir united states,cir united states,cir.
these cases interpreted c phrase any felony punishable under the csa to plainly mean any felony,state or federal,that would be punishable under the csa.moreover,the courts found the csa own definition of felony supported this construction.the term felony means any federal or state offense classified by applicable federal or state law as a felony.significantly,the issue in all of these cases was whether the state felony drug conviction could ever be a drug trafficking crime and therefore an aggravated felony if it would not be a felony under federal law.none addressed the further question,presented in this case,of how to determine whether a state drug conviction was a felony under state law.
in,the bia reaffirmed its intention to apply the hypothetical felony approach as a default interpretation for circuits that had not specifically decided to the contrary in an immigration context.in re,i n bia.the fifth circuit took issue with this and rejected the proposition that interpretation of the phrase drug trafficking crime for purposes of a b could differ depending on the context in which it arose.united states,cir collateral attack on earlier removal order on appeal from conviction for unlawful reentry.as a result,the court found that the bia application of the hypothetical felony approach in an immigration case was inconsistent with the fifth circuit prior precedent and held the guideline approach would apply in both immigration and sentencing cases.the fifth circuit remains the only circuit to have explicitly taken this position.
the bia revisited the issue in in re,i n bia,and abandoned the hypothetical felony approach as the default interpretation.the bia explained that because the phrase drug traffic
