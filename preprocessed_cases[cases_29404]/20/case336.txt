during a bar brawl,petitioner appellant omar gutierrez fatally stabbed john villaplana in the chest.gutierrez was convicted of depraved indifference murder under new york penal law,and sentenced to years to life in prison.after the appellate division affirmed gutierrez conviction and his application for leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals was denied,gutierrez filed a timely petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.in his petition,gutierrez argued,inter alia,that the evidence introduced at trial was legally insufficient to support his conviction.the district court feuerstein,relying on the state court finding that counsel failed to make a contemporaneous objection at trial to the legal sufficiency of the evidence,dismissed the petition as procedurally barred.
although the claim was barred under state law,we believe that it is nonetheless cognizable on habeas review.because there was a fundamental shift in new york interpretation of its depraved indifference murder statute between the time of gutierrez trial in and the time his conviction became final in,the legal basis for a sufficiency challenge was not reasonably available to counsel at the time of trial.we conclude,therefore,that this doctrinal shift constitutes an appropriate cause for the failure to object,and we therefore reach the merits of petitioner claim.
our review of the merits raises a troubled issue of new york law just how much of what kind of evidence supports depraved indifference convictions in new york.nevertheless,for reasons we will explain in section of this opinion we believe that certification is not appropriate in this case and,based on the limited new york precedents available to us,we hold that a reasonable jury could have found that the evidence at trial did establish the necessary elements of depraved indifference murder.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background and procedural history 
on june,petitioner omar gutierrez was involved in a bar brawl in montauk,long island.gutierrez was at rick crabby cowboy cafe rick when a fight broke out between different groups of patrons.the fight escalated and later continued in rick parking lot where gutierrez produced his knife and threatened a group of men.in his written confession,gutierrez described how he accidentally stabbed someone who ran into his knife.this victim,narcisso luis villaplana,survived his injuries,but he could provide no direct testimony at trial about the stabbing.
gutierrez and three others then pursued john villaplana to a nearby driveway.there,gutierrez fatally stabbed john in the chest,producing two wound tracks.according to trial testimony,gutierrez fled the scene when a car approached,while john villaplana was still standing.though john villaplana also sustained an injury as a result of striking his head on the ground,autopsy results confirmed that a stab wound caused his death.
gutierrez was charged with a murder in the second degree in violation of new york penal law intentional murder and new york penal law depraved indifference murder in connection with john villaplana fatal stabbing,and b assault in the third degree in violation of new york penal law in connection with narcisso luis villaplana stabbing.at trial,gutierrez counsel moved to dismiss the depraved indifference murder charge on the ground that,as a matter of law,there was insufficient evidence to prove a prima facie case.the trial judge denied the motion,and the jury convicted gutierrez of depraved indifference murder and assault in the third degree,but acquitted him of intentional murder.gutierrez was sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of years to life on the depraved indifference conviction and to a concurrent determinate term of imprisonment of one year on the assault conviction.
on direct appeal,petitioner argued,inter alia,that there was insufficient evidence to support a depraved indifference murder conviction and that new york penal law was unconstitutionally vague.on february,the appellate division affirmed gutierrez conviction and sentence,concluding that his legal insufficiency claim was unpreserved for appellate review,that his conviction for depraved indifference murder was not against the weight of the evidence,and that some of gutierrez other contentions were either unpreserved for appellate review or without merit.people gutierrez,dep t.on june,judge smith,of the new york court of appeals,denied gutierrez application for leave to appeal to that court.see people gutierrez.
on september,pursuant to new york criminal procedure law,gutierrez filed a motion to vacate his conviction.after the trial court denied the motion,see people gutierrez,suffolk cnty.unpublished table decision,and the appellate division affirmed,see people gutierrez,dep t,judge smith,of the new york court of appeals,again denied gutierrez application for leave to appeal to that court,see people gutierrez.
on september,gutierrez also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the federal district court of the eastern district of new york pursuant to.the district court initially stayed the proceedings to permit gutierrez to pursue his section motion,after which gutierrez filed an amended petition,arguing that the evidence presented at trial was legally insufficient to support his conviction for depraved indifference murder that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to make a specific objection to the legal insufficiency of the evidence at trial and that new york penal law was unconstitutionally vague.see gutierrez smith,cv,dist.lexis,at.in september,the district court denied gutierrez petition and declined to issue a certificate of appealability.see id.at.on march,we granted gutierrez motion for a certificate of appealability with respect to gutierrez claim that the evidence was legally insufficient to support his conviction for depraved indifference murder in violation of new york penal law.
b.the evolution of depraved indifference law in new york 
depraved indifference murder is a type of second degree murder in new york.specifically,new york penal law provides that a person is guilty of murder in the second degree when u nder circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life,he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person,and thereby causes the death of another person.
at the time of gutierrez trial in,the law on depraved indifference murder was governed by people register.in register,the defendant entered a crowded bar with a loaded gun.id.at.after entering the bar and threatening to kill somebody,id.at,he ultimately killed one man and seriously injured two others,id.at.in upholding the trial court refusal to instruct the jury that the defendant intoxication could negate a showing of depraved indifference,the court noted that the focus of the offense is not upon the subjective intent of the defendant,as it is with intentional murder,but rather upon an objective assessment of the degree of risk presented by defendant reckless conduct.id.at,citations omitted.
in the years after gutierrez trial but before his conviction became final in new york moved away from register holding.during this period,new case law suggested that conviction for depraved indifference murder did require proof of a mental state of recklessness.accordingly,strong proof of the defendant intent to murder the victim would be inconsistent with a conviction for depraved indifference murder.the new york court of appeals,in order to clarify when the facts of a case would tend to evince intentional as opposed to reckless murder,also began to define more narrowly the circumstances in which a depraved indifference charge would be appropriate.see policano herbert.
according to the court of appeals,the law as articulated in register remained static until its decision in people sanchez.policano herbert.critically,sanchez was decided in,after gutierrez trial and conviction,but,as we have noted,before that conviction became final.in sanchez,a decision,the court of appeals rejected the defendant argument that his conduct was consistent only with an intentional killing and therefore could not sustain a conviction for depraved indifference murder.at.the court thus reaffirmed register,reiterating that the requirement of circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life under new york penal law murder focuses not on the subjective intent of the defendant,but rather upon an objective assessment of the degree of risk presented by defendant reckless conduct.id.at,quoting register,at.in time,however,sanchez proved more notable for the three separate dissents in the court of appeals than for its majority opinion.two of the dissents,emphasizing the problems attendant to using a charge of depraved indifference as a proxy for intentional murder,id.at,smith,dissenting,would have overrule d register expressly and restore d depraved indifference as the key mens rea element,id.at,rosenblatt,dissenting.
after sanchez,while gutierrez case was on direct appeal,new york law continued to evolve.three cases in particular people hafeez,people gonzalez,and people payne,all decided before gutierrez conviction became final on september,moved new york law away from the holding in register.
in hafeez,decided on june,which involved yet another incident at a bar,the court of appeals held that a codefendant conduct was consistent with intentional murder as opposed to depraved indifference murder.at.
in gonzales,decided on march,the court again found the evidence legally insufficient to support a conviction for depraved indifference murder,and held that t he only reasonable view of the evidence here was that defendant intentionally killed the victim by aiming a gun directly at him and shooting him times at close range,even after he had fallen to the ground.at.the court reasoned that a person can not act both intentionally and recklessly with respect to the same result,id.at,and that when a defendant conduct is specifically designed to cause the death of the victim,it simply can not be said that the defendant is indifferent to the consequences of his or her conduct,id.at.the court further explained that d epraved indifference murder does not mean an extremely,even heinously,intentional killing,but instead involves a killing in which the defendant does not have a conscious objective to cause death but instead is recklessly indifferent,depravedly so,to whether death occurs.id.at.
in payne,decided on october,the court of appeals began to clarify when a fact pattern could support an inference of depraved indifference murder and when it could not.the payne court held that it was reversible error for the trial court to have submitted the count of depraved indifference murder to the jury because no reasonable view of the evidence could support the theory that the point blank shooting which was directed at a single individual was reckless.at.the archetypal depraved indifference murder,the court explained,would resemble shooting into a crowd,placing a time bomb in a public place,or opening the door of the lions cage in the zoo.at.by contrast,a bsent the type of circumstances in,for example,sanchez where others were endangered,a shooting or knifing or similar killing can almost never qualify as depraved indifference murder.id.in a footnote,the court noted a rare exception the only one in our decisional law to this principle.at.in that exceptional case,people roe,the defendant killed the victim during a game of polish roulette,in which he loaded a gun with both real and dummy rounds of ammunition and then pointed the gun at the victim and pulled the trigger 
after gutierrez conviction became final on september,the court of appeals reviewed its own precedents to provide further guidance on when a killing could count as a depraved indifference murder,and described several broad categories of killings that would qualify.people suarez,decided on december,underscored payne and held that a defendant who intends to injure or kill a particular person can not generally be said to be indifferent depravedly or otherwise to the fate of that person.but the court identified two recurring fact patterns in which a killing would be properly categorized as a depraved indifference murder first,when the defendant intends neither to seriously injure,nor to kill,but nevertheless abandons a helpless and vulnerable victim in circumstances where the victim is highly likely to die and second,when the defendant acting with a conscious objective not to kill but to harm engages in torture or a brutal,prolonged and ultimately fatal course of conduct against a particularly vulnerable victim.id.at.the court also pointed to a third category extraordinary cases involving conduct that endangered only one person,where the evidence showed not just recklessness,but depraved indifference to human life.id.at.as an example,the court pointed to roe,the polish roulette case cited in payne,but left this category otherwise undefined.
finally,the development which began with the dissents in sanchez culminated in people feingold,decided on july.in feingold,by expressly overruling register and sanchez and holding that depraved indifference referred to a mental state,the court of appeals made explicit what its recent opinions had implied.id.at.surveying its case law beginning with hafeez,the court concluded that the law ha d changed to such an extent that register and sanchez should no longer be followed.id.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court ruling on a habeas petition de novo.see thibodeau portuondo,cir.
procedural default 
new york contemporaneous objection rule requires a party to object to what he or believes is a legal error in a trial court ruling or instruction at the time of such ruling or instruction or at any subsequent time when the court had an opportunity of effectively changing the same.proc.law.where a party fails to lodge such a contemporaneous objection,the issue is unpreserved for appeal because of the party procedural default.if a state appellate court refuses to review the merits of a criminal defendant claim of constitutional error because of his failure to comply with such a contemporaneous objection rule,a federal court generally may not consider the merits of the constitutional claim on habeas corpus review.peterson scully,cir citing wainwright sykes,d see also harris reed,d explaining that federal habeas review is barred if the constitutional claim was denied by a state court on a state procedural ground that is both independent of the merits of the federal claim and an adequate basis for the court decision.
the supreme court,however,has carved out two exceptions to this bar on habeas review of procedurally defaulted claims.where a petitioner has procedurally defaulted a claim by failing to raise it on direct review,the claim may be raised in habeas only if the petitioner can first demonstrate either cause and actual prejudice,or that he is actually innocent.disimone phillips,cir brackets omitted quoting bousley united states,d see also murray carrier,d.
gutierrez concedes that his counsel lodged just a general objection to the legal sufficiency of the evidence at trial,gutierrez,dist.lexis,at,which the appellate division deemed insufficient to preserve the issue for appellate review,gutierrez,at.on habeas review,therefore,we can reach the merits of gutierrez legal insufficiency claim only if he can establish either cause and prejudice or actual innocence.in our judgment,gutierrez adequately demonstrates both cause for his trial counsel failure to lodge a specific objection,and prejudice from that failure 
there are two related ways to establish cause.first,the cause requirement is met if some objective factor,external to petitioner defense,interfered with his ability to comply with the state procedural rule.see mccleskey zant,d.an example of such an objective impediment is a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel at the time of trial.strickler greene,d.second,futility may constitute cause where prior state case law has consistently rejected a particular constitutional claim.disimone,at.but futility can not constitute cause if it means simply that a claim was unacceptable to that particular court at that particular time.bousley united states,quoting engle isaac,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the prejudice requirement is met by establishing actual prejudice resulting from the errors of which petitioner complains.united states frady,d internal quotation marks omitted.the error must have resulted in substantial disadvantage,infecting the entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.murray,at quoting frady,at.
on appeal,gutierrez offers two explanations for counsel failure to object specifically to the legal sufficiency of his depraved indifference murder conviction.he argues that any objection by counsel would have been futile because the controlling law,register,would have rendered the objection baseless.he also asserts that the legal basis of his claim was unavailable at the time of trial and that this constituted an objective factor external to his defense.in this case,the same substantive argument underlies both claims.
these cause arguments are both predicated on the claim a that new york law on depraved indifference murder changed drastically after gutierrez trial in,and b that he should not be penalized for his failure to anticipate that change.gutierrez trial was held in,before sanchez was decided,before the appellate courts reversed the convictions in hafeez and gonzalez,and when register was unquestionably still considered the law of new york.given that the register interpretation was firmly ingrained in new york at the time of petitioner trial in,we are persuaded that a legal sufficiency objection by gutierrez would have been futile.
similarly,as register still controlled,the legal basis for a sufficiency claim was not available to counsel at the time of gutierrez trial.when gutierrez was tried,counsel could not be obliged to challenge preemptively the conviction based on what then was an unlikely development in the law.the shift in new york law that occurred after petitioner trial constituted an objective factor external to the defense that impeded counsel efforts to comply with the state procedural rule.strickler,at citation omitted see also id.noting that a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel would constitute cause under this standard citation omitted.
we find equally compelling gutierrez claim that the prejudice requirement is met.the difference between a conviction for murder in the second degree and one for manslaughter is substantial,the former carrying a significantly higher potential term of imprisonment.thus,the submission of a depraved indifference murder charge to the jury,if that charge was in error,worked to petitioner actual and substantial disadvantage.roccisano menifee,cir emphasis omitted.
for these reasons,we believe that on the facts of this case,the matter was preserved we now turn to the merits of the appeal.
merits of gutierrez legal insufficiency claim 
when reviewing appeals challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction,we are not retrying the case,nor are we the state court interpretation of its own law.rather,we review the decision of the state court under the federal sufficiency standard set forth by the supreme court in jackson virginia,d.see epps poole,cir.the relevant question under jackson is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson,at.when considering the sufficiency of the evidence of such a state conviction,a federal court must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and make all inferences in its favor,and,in doing this,must look to state law to determine the elements of the crime.fama comm r of corr,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
a person is guilty of depraved indifference murder when,u nder circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life,he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person,and thereby causes the death of another person.penal law.gutierrez argument that convicting him of depraved indifference murder violates federal due process relies on his interpretation of the three new york court of appeals cases,hafeez,gonzalez,and payne,that began to define and limit the circumstances from which a jury could draw a valid inference that a killer had the mens rea required for depraved indifference.the opinion in payne included the court observation that a shooting or knifing can almost never qualify as depraved indifference murder.payne,at,emphasis added.gutierrez reads this to mean that under new york law,a,fatal assault is categorically intentional,and he contends that when he stabbed a single individual in the chest,he engaged in intentional conduct that is necessarily inconsistent with the mens rea needed for depraved indifference murder.but our reading of new york precedents does not lead to such an unambiguous result.
we believe that the three depraved indifference cases decided before gutierrez conviction became final hafeez,gonzalez,and payne do not compel the conclusion that a stabbing or shooting is always intentional.true,they involved killings at the same time,however,the killings in these three cases were unquestionably intentional.in hafeez,the defendant conviction as an accomplice to a murder depended on proof that his,the actual killer,had the necessary mental state for depraved indifference murder.but on review,the new york court of appeals concluded that this was a quintessentially intentional attack.at.his had plotted his revenge for months in advance and schemed to place the victim in a position where he would be vulnerable to attack.id.on the night of the attack,the killer concealed a weapon on his person and then leapt out at the victim,killing him with a single deliberate wound to the chest that perforated the victim heart.id.based on these facts,the court found,there exist ed no valid line of reasoning that could support a jury conclusion that the defendant possessed the mental culpability required for depraved indifference murder,which was at the time recklessness.id.at.in gonzalez,the defendant saw his victim,a man with whom he had a longstanding dispute,in a barber shop.he briefly left the shop,and then returned to shoot the victim ten times.at.the defendant told the police after his arrest that he that he had recently begun to fear the victim and had been carrying the gun for protection.id.at.in payne,the defendant marched over to the home of a neighbor,with whom he was angry,carrying a gauge shotgun,and shot him just below the chest.at.at trial,the defendant admitted to shooting his neighbor intentionally,but argued that he acted in.id.it is not hard to conclude that the jury,after rejecting the justification defense,was required to find that the killing was intentional,rather than reckless.
taken together,hafeez,gonzalez,and payne establish that an intentional murder could not be done recklessly.and they reflect the new york court of appeals attempt to identify certain limited factual scenarios that would support a jury finding of reckless conduct.but none of the three cases gave the court of appeals an occasion to consider facts like those now before us.to name just one distinguishing fact unlike the defendants in those cases,gutierrez had no prior relationship or personal disagreement with either of his victims.
people suarez,the new york court of appeals opinion issued only months after gutierrez conviction became final,further reinforces our judgment that the jury verdict in the instant case must survive federal review.see.suarez surveyed new york precedents to identify types of murder that might qualify as depraved indifference murders.the first two recurring fact patterns the court of appeals identified depraved indifference murders that are the result of torture,and the abandonment of a helpless victim,see id.at,are not relevant in this case.but the court also discussed a third,less well defined category,typified by people roe
