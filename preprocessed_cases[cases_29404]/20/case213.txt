in this habeas case,petitioner christopher ellen claims that his trial for assault in the massachusetts superior court violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment because it was tainted by testimony that he remained silent after receiving miranda warnings.the testimony by the arresting officer was followed by an immediate objection,lengthy discussion between counsel and the court,and,ultimately,a directive from the court that the officer testimony about ellen silence be stricken from the record.the court also gave emphatic instructions to the jury about the importance of the defendant right against and the state burden of proof.ellen claims that,nonetheless,the officer comment and the court response violated his due process rights.the massachusetts appeals court rejected ellen claim.we conclude that its decision was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.see d.therefore,we affirm the decision of the district court denying habeas relief.
factual background 
adair rowland lived alone in a house adjacent to ellen in amesbury,massachusetts.on the evening of sunday,july,rowland returned home after attending a dinner party to discover signs of a recent intruder in her bedroom.she phoned a friend,turned on a light,and opened her back door.while waiting for her friend in the kitchen,rowland heard a loud noise and saw a man approaching her.this man,later identified as ellen,was wearing only a pair of shorts,and he had tube socks over his hands.ellen hit rowland in the face,threw her against the counter and then onto the floor.he also shut and locked the back door she had just opened.ellen then attempted to strangle her,using a sash from her high school prom dress that he had taken from a storage box in the attic.
suddenly,ellen ceased strangling rowland and released her.she asked who he was.he said that he was insane,and that they were both victims.a neighbor heard the commotion in rowland kitchen and called the police,who arrived shortly after ellen stopped his attack.the two officers who arrived at the house first reported that ellen was sweaty and bloody,and was still wearing only shorts.rowland was experiencing difficulty breathing,had multiple bruises and abrasions,and appeared to be in shock.
ellen admitted to the officers that he had hit rowland but stated that he did not know why he had done so.the officers subsequently searched rowland house,and found additional pieces of clothing,taken from her bedroom closet and the storage box in the attic,which were knotted,ripped,tied to furniture,or strewn about.the phone in rowland bedroom had been unplugged the bulkhead door providing access to rowland basement had been wedged open.
ellen was taken to the amesbury police station,where he was booked by officer ouellet and given miranda warnings.he declined to make any statements at that time.ellen was tried in october on four charges burglary with assault on an occupant,assault and battery with a dangerous weapon,assault with intent to murder,and assault with intent to rape.at trial,ouellet testified at length about the chronology of events on the night of the crime.at the end of a series of questions about the miranda warnings given during the booking process,ouellet was asked what he said to ellen or did with him.ouellet replied,arguably,that ellen declined to make a statement to the police at that time 
immediately after this answer,defense counsel objected and the lawyers and trial judge engaged in a sidebar discussion.ellen lawyer requested a mistrial,but the judge asked for argument and some research on the constitutional implications of the prosecutor question and the officer answer.while the jury took a recess,the lawyers presented arguments to the judge.after reviewing relevant cases,the judge decided that an immediate curative instruction could resolve the problem and that a mistrial was unnecessary.defense counsel again objected and argued that an instruction to the jury would exacerbate the error.nonetheless,the judge recalled the jury,sustained the objection,struck officer ouellet final answer from the record,and gave a lengthy instruction on the burden of proof and the right against.the judge also explicitly told the jurors that they could not draw any adverse inferences from the challenged testimony defense counsel unsuccessfully renewed his motion for a mistrial.
ellen defense was that he experienced a dissociative episode on the night in question,and thus was not guilty by reason of insanity.he testified that he had no memory of his entry into rowland house,or of his attack on her.ellen also offered the testimony of a psychiatrist who described various traumas in ellen past.the psychiatrist opined that ellen experienced two prior incidents that were consistent with a diagnosis of dissociative episodes,and that ellen behavior and symptoms on july,were indicative of a third dissociative episode.after officer ouellet testimony and the judge curative instruction,no other reference was made to ellen silence,either by a witness,or in the prosecutor closing argument.
procedural background 
ellen conviction on three of the assault charges was affirmed by the massachusetts appeals court the state court held that ouellet disclosure that ellen declined to speak to the police after being given his miranda warnings was not error because the testimony was stricken from the record and the judge gave a curative instruction.commonwealth ellen,unpublished.because the court found no error,it did not discuss the issue of prejudice to the defendant ellen application to the supreme judicial court for further appellate review was denied.
ellen filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court,claiming only that officer ouellet disclosure of his silence and the trial court response to it was a violation of his due process rights.the district court denied the petition in a brief ruling from the bench.the court also granted a certificate of appealability as to the issue of silence and ellen filed this appeal.
we review the district court denial of habeas relief de novo.see,caputo nelson,cir.the question we must address is whether the massachusetts appeals court finding that no constitutional error occurred was either contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal case law.d we must first identify what constitutes the relevant clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.id.we will then consider whether the appeals court decision was contrary to that law,as that term has been narrowly defined by the supreme court.finally,we will examine whether the state court decision was an unreasonable application of the clearly established law.in making this evaluation of the state court decision,we do not focus on the quality of the court reasoning but rather on the reasonableness of the outcome.hurtado tucker,cir the ultimate question on habeas,however,is not how well reasoned the state court decision is,but whether the outcome is reasonable.
a.the clearly established law 
we begin with a brief survey of the relevant clearly established federal law at the time of the state court decision.williams taylor,d citing d.our inquiry into whether a particular legal rule is clearly established is de novo.the federal courts must make an independent evaluation of the precedent existing at the time the state conviction became final.wright west,d,concurring in the judgment.
in miranda arizona,d,the supreme court held that an individual exercise of his right against can not be used against him.id.at.in accord with our decision today,it is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his fifth amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation.the prosecution may not,therefore,use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.it has long been clear,therefore,that a defendant silence in response to the prophylactic miranda warnings can not be used as substantive evidence of his guilt.id.
in doyle ohio,d,the two defendants claimed in their separate trials that they had been framed by a government informant.given this defense,the prosecutor asked during extensive of each defendant why he said nothing about being framed at the time of his arrest.id.at.the prosecutor repeatedly asked the defendants whether they had told the arresting officer all about what happened to them and why they did protest their innocence.id.the state claimed that these questions by the prosecutor were a justified form of impeachment because the defendants were offering at trial a new exculpatory account of the events.id.at.
the supreme court rejected the state attempt to distinguish impeachment from substantive evidence of guilt,holding that the use for impeachment purposes of petitioners silence,at the time of arrest and after receiving miranda warnings,violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.id.at.the court based its decision on the assurances of fairness implicit in the miranda warnings 
w hile it is true that the miranda warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty,such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings.in such circumstances,it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.
the supreme court held the doyle rationale equally applicable where the prosecutor seeks to use evidence of a defendant silence as evidence of the defendant mental state.in wainwright greenfield,d,the prosecutor asked each of the two arresting officers about the multiple occasions on which the defendant invoked his right to remain silent following the miranda warnings.id.at.there,the defendant pled not guilty by reason of insanity,and the prosecutor sought to show that his decision to remain silent after arrest demonstrated his mental competence.id.at.the supreme court reaffirmed its reasoning in doyle,citing the unfairness of promising an arrested person that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter breach ing that promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony.id.at.the court concluded that the same unfairness would result from using silence as evidence of sanity t he implicit promise,the breach,and the consequent penalty are identical in both situations.id.
however,mere reference to a defendant silence does not necessarily amount to a due process violation.in greer miller,d,the prosecutor second question to the defendant was why did you tell this story to anybody when you got arrested.id.at.defense counsel objected to the question before the defendant could answer.the judge sustained the objection and instructed the jury to ignore the question,but gave no explanation for the ruling.the trial continued without further reference to the defendant silence after receiving the miranda warnings.the supreme court held that there was no due process violation in these circumstances because t he fact of the defendant postarrest silence was not submitted to the jury as evidence from which it was allowed to draw any permissible inference.id.at.
we draw from greer this proposition in cases where a prosecutor refers to the defendant silence in a question to a witness or a statement to the jury,or elicits testimony about such silence from a witness,and the offending question,statement or testimony is promptly addressed by the court,in an instruction to disregard strike from the record,there may not necessarily be a doyle violation because the government has not been permitted to use the defendant silence against him.this is a determination,as greer made clear.id.at.the majority in greer explicitly stated that its decision was not based on the absence of prejudice to the defendant.instead,its ruling addressed the existence of a constitutional error in the first place.id.at.noting that the decision was not based on the standard,but on the fundamental question whether an error of constitutional dimension occurred.
these supreme court decisions comprise the core of clearly established federal law governing the state use at trial of a defendant silence.we turn now to an examination of whether the massachusetts appeals court decision was either contrary to or an unreasonable application of this law.
was the appeals court decision contrary to federal law 
a federal court may provide habeas relief to a state court prisoner where the state court proceedings resulted in a decision that was contrary to clearly established federal law.d.in williams taylor,d,the supreme court explained the two ways in which a state court decision might be contrary to federal law.first,a state court decision that applies an incorrect legal standard,or misstates the rule articulated in a supreme court case,will be contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent.id.at.the court was careful to define incorrect,saying that it requires a legal standard that is substantially different,and thereby contradictory or opposite to the appropriate standard.id.second,if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from supreme court precedent,that decision would also be contrary to federal law.id.at.
ellen only developed contrary to argument relies on the incorrect legal standard definition here,the massachusetts appeals court did not specifically refer to any supreme court precedent in its discussion of the arresting officer testimony about ellen exercise of his right to remain silent after receiving miranda warnings.at.however,the appeals court cited to commonwealth mahdi.mahdi discusses the supreme court decision in doyle at some length and accurately recites and applies the rule announced therein.id.at.further,although mahdi was decided before wainwright,the massachusetts supreme judicial court predicted the rule later announced in wainwright,saying w e fail to see how use of evidence to infer sanity substantively differs from use to infer guilt fundamental unfairness results from the use of evidence of such silence regardless whether the person exercising his or her constitutional right to remain silent claims insanity as a defense.id.the state court thus accurately stated the governing federal law through its reliance on mahdi.
was the appeals court decision an unreasonable application of federal law 
federal courts may grant habeas relief to state prisoners who can show that the state court decision in their case involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.d.as with the contrary to provision,we start with the supreme court explanation of this statutory language.in williams,the supreme court held that a federal habeas court making the unreasonable application inquiry should ask whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable.at.the court continued by noting that the most important point is that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.id.at.see also mccambridge hall,cir.
the massachusetts appeals court found that no doyle violation occurred.in greer,the supreme court explained that the hallmark of a doyle violation is the use of the defendant silence against him,especially where the prosecution is allowed to call attention to the defendant silence.at.quoting doyle,at.the court went on to say that it was significant that in each of the cases in which this court has applied doyle,the trial court has permitted specific inquiry or argument respecting the defendant silence.id.at.this language suggests that in order to establish the existence of a doyle violation,the defendant must show that the prosecution used the defendant silence against him by asking questions,eliciting testimony,or making a statement or argument that invites or encourages the jury to infer guilt or sanity,as the case may be from the defendant silence.the court decision in greer,finding that no doyle violation occurred,hinged on two key facts the prosecutor was not permitted to call attention to the defendant silence because the defendant objection to the prosecution question was prom
