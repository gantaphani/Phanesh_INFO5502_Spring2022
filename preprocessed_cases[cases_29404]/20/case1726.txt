background 
on october,a jury convicted william anthony of the aggravated murder of patricia smith,with firearm specifications.anthony was sentenced to life imprisonment with eligibility for parole at the end of twenty years,plus three years additional incarceration for the firearm specification.
several months prior to the murder,smith had filed felony theft charges with the police against anthony friend,rommell knox,for stealing a ring from her apartment when knox was performing a routine pest extermination.knox,who had a prior criminal record,feared going to jail for the theft.on the evening of january,rommell knox and william anthony drove to smith apartment complex with rommell brother,john knox,and rommell girlfriend,mary buffy payne.when they got to the apartment complex,john and rommell knox stayed in the car while payne and anthony walked to smith door.as smith started to open the door,she was shot and killed with rommell gun.subsequently,rommell knox and william anthony were prosecuted for aggravated murder,and tried separately 
at anthony trial,the state called detective james scott detective scott testified that he investigated the theft of patricia smith ring.as a result of his investigation,criminal charges were filed against rommell knox,a former employee of ohio exterminating.the charges against rommell were dropped after smith murder.

detective brian lacy,who headed the investigation of smith murder,testified that the police had no immediate suspects.a few days later,however,he received a telephone call from a female named regina knox later identified as rommell wife,who claimed to have information regarding smith murder.he persuaded her to come to the station and,after verifying her identity,interviewed her.as a result of that interview,the investigation focused on rommell knox,john knox,a person named will and a woman named buffy.regina knox agreed to accompany police officers to the apartment of john knox,where they found and apprehended john,rommell and an unidentified woman.detective lacy interviewed john knox and testified that,after the interview,the four suspects remained the same but he could now identify buffy as mary payne and will as william anthony.detective lacy observed part of rommell interview and personally interviewed rommell,after which he again confirmed the same four suspects.
after detective lacy testimony but before the state called mary payne,the trial court held a preliminary hearing under ohio evid,outside the presence of the jury,to determine the admissibility of payne hearsay testimony.at the conclusion of the hearing,the trial judge ruled that the state had sufficient evidence to make a prima facie showing of a conspiracy,but that it would need to present its evidence in the proper order.
thereafter,mary payne testified to the following facts.she met rommell knox in november and began an intimate relationship with him.she later met rommell brother,john,and william anthony,who was introduced to her as rommell cousin.the four spent a lot of time together,often went to a club called dee,and rommell always called the shots.at the time of the murder,payne was aware of the theft charges brought against rommell.on january,rommell called and invited her out.rommell arrived at payne home with john knox and william anthony.they all got into john car and drove to smith apartment complex.upon arrival at the apartment complex,rommell pointed out smith apartment.he asked payne if she would accompany anthony to the apartment and knock on the lady door who had filed charges against him rommell so that anthony could talk to her about dropping the charges.rommell told payne that he wanted her to knock on the door because the woman would not open the door for a black man anthony,but would open it for a white woman payne.payne reluctantly agreed to do it.after payne knocked on smith door and smith began unlocking it,anthony told payne she could go back to the car.on her way back to the car,she heard a gunshot.when she turned,she saw anthony running toward her with a gun.she testified that the gun looked like one she had previously seen rommell carry on several occasions and put in the pocket of her coat when they went to the bar.anthony grabbed payne by the arm,said move,bitch,and ran to the car.as the four drove away from the apartment complex,payne opened the door and vomited.upon seeing this,rommell twisted her arm and threatened to kill her if he even thought she would tell anyone what occurred that evening,adding right,guys to which anthony responded,you got that right,cuz.
john knox testified that,on the evening of smith murder,he accompanied rommell,payne and anthony on what he believed to be a marijuana run.the group stopped at smith apartment complex,but he did not see which apartment payne and anthony visited.john did not speak with rommell,anthony or payne after leaving the complex and did not listen to the conversation.instead,he listened to loud music on the car stereo.john further testified that,after he and rommell were in custody,rommell told john that he wanted john to implicate payne and anthony in smith murder,and to tell the police that he rommell was not at the scene.john refused to change his story and rommell threatened to harm his children.
rommell wife,regina knox,testified that rommell returned home at about the evening of smith murder.he told her that he went to smith apartment along with his brother,payne and anthony.he explained that payne and anthony went to smith door and payne asked to use the telephone.he said that anthony stepped from the side of the apartment and shot smith in the face through the glass.he told regina that he planned to pay anthony and payne each for going along with the plan,and further asked regina to lie in order to create an alibi for his whereabouts during the time of the murder.he asked her help in searching the house for stray bullets in the event the house was eventually searched.he told regina that he wanted smith shot because he did not want to go to jail.on january,regina contacted the police and made a videotaped statement to detective brian lacy because she was scared and believed that rommell should be punished.she further testified that rommell contacted her numerous times while awaiting trial to ask her to lie for him,and she identified the murder weapon as belonging to her husband.
william anthony presented an alibi defense.his uncle and aunt testified that,on the evening of smith murder,anthony was at home with them from the late afternoon through 
following his conviction,anthony filed a direct appeal asserting,among other arguments,that the state failed to lay a proper foundation to admit the hearsay statements of rommell knox and that,even with a proper foundation,the hearsay evidence was improperly admitted.the appellate panel determined that mary payne testified to the following two statements 
that rommell asked her to knock on smith door so that appellant could talk to her about dropping the charges and that rommell threatened payne life if she told anyone what happened there that night.
