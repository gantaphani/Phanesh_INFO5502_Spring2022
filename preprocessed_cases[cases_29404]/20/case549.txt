alfred norde appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york marrero,dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought pursuant to.in,norde was sentenced in the new york state supreme court,new york county,to a prison term of years to life after a jury found him guilty of burglary in violation of new york penal law section.in his pro se petition to the district court,norde contended,inter alia,that the trial court violated his sixth amendment rights when the state trial judge remove d him from the courtroom during voir dire without warning procured a waiver of his right to be present at the proceedings by improper delegation of a judicial function to a court officer and denied him assistance of counsel when it failed to grant d efense counsel application for a brief adjournment.the district court denied the petition and declined to grant a certificate of appealability.we granted a certificate of appealability to consider the following issues whether norde was denied the right to be present at voir dire and trial whether he waived that right and whether he was denied the assistance of counsel when the trial judge denied counsel request for an adjournment.we conclude that the state court denial of counsel request for an adjournment to consult with her client upon norde removal from the courtroom and its communication with him through a court officer rather than counsel unconstitutionally deprived norde of the assistance of counsel.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case with instructions to issue the writ unless within sixty days the state elects to retry norde.
background 
on october,annick vandermore arrived at the private home where she worked as the director of household management located at east street.she entered the house and,as she turned to close the front door behind her,saw norde standing in the doorway.norde held the door open slightly,stated that he had a summons,and asked that vandermore get the building superintendent.vandermore informed him that there was no superintendent because the home was a private residence,but indicated that she would get someone to help him.vandermore then attempted to close the door.norde pushed the door open,shoved her aside,and closed the door.he then ordered her to hand over her purse and attempted to grab it from her.vandermore resisted and screamed.norde was able to wrest the purse from her and pulled her wallet out of the purse.roger sahli,the project architect at the residence,was inside the house at the time.hearing vandermore screams,sahli ran to the doorway and jumped on top of norde,who dropped the wallet and struggled with sahli.while the two were struggling,vandermore housekeeper also came to vandermore aid.sahli instructed her to call the police.during the struggle,norde freed himself from sahli after biting his arm.norde ran out of the house,and sahli chased him down the street.in response to sahli requests for assistance,three men apprehended norde and held him for about twenty minutes until the police arrived.
norde was indicted on two counts of burglary in the first degree and two counts of robbery in the second degree in violation of new york penal law sections and.jury selection for his trial on the indictment began the morning of april,in the new york state supreme court,new york county rothwax.norde was represented at all times by his assigned counsel,sarah jones.fifty prospective jurors were present in the courtroom and sworn for voir dire.thereafter,fifteen were seated in the jury box and voir dire began.the court recessed for lunch before any jurors were selected.when court reconvened that afternoon,but before any prospective jurors were brought into the courtroom,norde addressed the trial judge in the following words 
your honor,the defendant has a statement to make.justice rothwax,the defendant at this time asks the court tha t counsel be removed from the case because of the opportunity she has not given the defendant for any situation for defense in the case.
and as the court record showed,on,the defendant appeared here for court in view of having these which he was not produced sic.counsel made no representation as far as the date it would be held to any scheduled hearings or would be ready for trial.
counsel did not provide defendant with any words or documents or records of the defendant statement that he would be ready to go to hearing and trial.
the defendant at this time has sent a letter to the attorney of record and the new york bar association asking for relief of counsel that represents defendant.that is already in the mail.
the defendant also now wishes to have privately retained counsel which his family is also in preparation to make.it is not in lieu to stall this trial.the defendant has not been adequately represented and does not have a chance to have the defendant represent himself at trial as justice rothwax already declined the fact that counsel made motions.it been five or six months.she has not requested the appearance of the complaint.
my family has already been in the process of getting this retained counsel.and wishes to be assigned as counsel immediately.
the court ruled that the application for of counsel is denied.norde then said i object to all further proceedings.the prospective jurors were then led back into the courtroom and voir dire continued.soon thereafter,the people exercised four peremptory challenges and norde counsel exercised five.the trial judge inquired as to whether the remaining six prospective jurors were acceptable.both the people and norde counsel responded that they were.at that point norde again objected.the six jurors were sworn in and addressed by the court as follows 
now ladies and gentlemen,you just heard the defendant yell out in the courtroom.he been instructed by me not to do that.and i am going to instruct you to disregard any statements that the defendant makes in this courtroom other than if he should take the stand and testify.just disregard it.
immediately thereafter,the following exchange took place 
the defendant the defendant wishes to be represented by his own attorney.
the court norde,i want you to remain quiet.if you do remain quiet 
the defendant what you want to do 
the court you will either remain quiet or you will be removed.
the defendant if i will be represented by my own counsel i will be removed sic.
the court you will remain quiet or you will be removed.
at this time ladies and gentlemen,since the defendant has brought up the issue of his not being represented by his own counsel,i think that it is important that i bring to your attention that the attorney who represented him has represented him from the outset of this case.and that until this afternoon he has never made any protest about being represented by this counsel.
the defendant objection.i made plenty of objections.
the court remove the defendant from the courtroom.
norde is removed by a court officer.
the court he has never protested having this counsel until the time when this case was moved to trial this afternoon.the defendant will be allowed to return to this courtroom under circumstances where he indicates that he will follow the court instructions.if he does not follow the court instructions he will be removed from the courtroom.it is just that simple.
please do not allow his activity in any way to effect your judgment i do want you to feel either sympathy for him or prejudice against him.i want you to base your decision solely on the evidence in the case.please do that.
after being given instructions to return the following day,the six sworn jurors left the courtroom.norde counsel then stated,your honor,i would ask for a brief adjournment at this point.i would ask that the remaining potential jurors be excused.the court denied the request,and instructed norde counsel not to make those applications in front of the potential jurors.jury selection continued in norde absence.fifteen of the remaining potential jurors were asked to sit in the jury box when their names were called.the court then stated ladies and gentlemen,while we have been calling your name s i have had a court officer inquire of the defendant whether he wishes to be present during these court proceedings.and he has indicated to the court officer that he does not wish to be present during these proceedings.in addition,the court again instructed the potential jurors that their ultimate decision had to be based on the facts of the case and not on norde courtroom behavior.voir dire then proceeded until six additional jurors and two alternates were chosen,at which point the following took place 
the court w hile we were exercising the challenges i asked a court office r to go up and speak to the defendant,advise him that the proceedings would continue in his absence,a nd ask him whether or not he wished to return to the courtroom.the court officer is now here.would you place your name on the record please.
court officer officer banano,and the defendant advises me that he does not want to take part in the proceedings.
the court i will proceed in his absence.i am going to let you make your record fully.i have no problem with you doing that but we are going to do that after jury selection.
jones that is fine.
voir dire then resumed and continued until the third and final alternate juror was chosen,at which point all jurors were excused.the trial judge then directed that norde be brought back into the courtroom and the following exchange took place 
the court i have asked that you be brought out norde because we have to make a record on a number of things.after that if you do want to be present at your trial you wo have to be present at your trial.so let me just tell a few things to you,okay.
under the law,you know or you should know that you have a right to be present at your own trial.but you may give up or waive that right or forfeit that right by your behavior.
now you are on notice,of course,having been present for at least part of the jury selection that your trial has begun.i put you on notice that your trial will go forward in your presence or in your voluntary absence.if you choose not to be present i place you on notice that the case will proceed.
obviously you should understand that if you fail to appear in court during your trial you are in effect also giving up your right to testify do you understand what i have said 
the defendant no i do.i object.i want my own attorney.i am not present of representing the trial sic until i receive the counsel of my choice counsel and i do get along.
when there is no defense i can not have a fair trial.i was brought here by force and i was returned to this court after the jury was picked.
the court the record should reflect t hat jones has been the lawyer since the inception of the case and t hat it was until this afternoon after the hearings that norde ever state d in this courtroom a desire to be represented by anybody else.
it is this court clear judgment based on years of experience that this defendant does want to go to trial with this case.his application to have jones relieved at this point in time is denied.
thereafter,norde counsel requested a mistrial because the comments the court made earlier to the jury regarding norde behavior prejudiced norde.she also objected to norde removal from the courtroom,stating that the courtroom should have been cleared and norde should have been issue d a warning and given the option of being present or not.the court denied counsel application for a mistrial,noting that c ourt officers on a number of occasions went up to the defendant while he was upstairs and a dvised him that he could be returned to the courtroom at any time if he wished to do so.the court also stated that i ndeed,norde has returned to the courtroom now against his will.in response,norde counsel pointed out that the information regarding norde right to return to the courtroom was communicated to norde through a court officer and not through an attorney.in response,the judge stated 
it is interesting jones,now that you bring that up,that i had asked you once all the jurors were selected and excused for the day if you wanted to go up to him and speak to him and you said you did.and it is clear to me that you should because given the relationship between you at this point in time i felt and i believe that you felt that that would be more in the nature of a provocation.
so i find it ironic that although given the opportunity after the jury had been excused you declined the opportunity to go in and speak to your client because of the deterioration in the relationship between you.but now you claim you should have been offered the opportunity at an earlier time.
as appears from the above,counsel was not given an opportunity to consult with her client,following norde removal from the courtroom,until voir dire was completed and all the jurors and alternate jurors were selected,sworn,and excused.
the trial began the following day,and consisted of the testimony of vandermore,sahli,norde,norde supervisor at travelers process service world wide,and one of the arresting officers.prior to norde testimony,the court again directed his removal from the courtroom after the following exchange 
the court jones,are there any witnesses you wish to call 
the defendant yes,i have several witnesses to call,your honor.
the court norde,i do want you to make statements in open court.i have advised you of that previously in front of the jury and outside of the presence of the jury.i am addressing your attorney.you will remain quiet.remain quiet.
the defendant she addresse d me,your honor.
the court norde,i have indicated to you that you are not to speak up in open court.
the defendant yep.
norde is then called to testify.
the defendant your honor,i want my defense witnesses to be present.
the court norde,i have indicated to you that if you want to testify you will testify from the witness chair.
the defendant i will testify,your honor.
the court if you are going to testify,testify now.
the defendant your honor i wish for my defense counsel 
the court remove the defendant from the courtroom.
once again,a court officer removed norde from the courtroom.on this occasion,however,norde was able to consult with his attorney immediately after his removal and thereupon returned to the courtroom.upon entering the courtroom,norde sought to address the jury directly,and was again admonished by the judge.shortly thereafter,he testified in his own defense,with direct examination by jones,and remained in the courtroom for the rest of the trial.
the jury convicted norde of burglary,and he was sentenced as a persistent felony offender to a term of imprisonment of years to life.judgment was entered on november.norde appealed his conviction to the new york state supreme court,appellate division,first department.his assigned counsel brief argued that the people failed to prove the element of physical injury required for burglary the people made several prejudicial remarks during summation and a sandoval violation occurred norde filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he argued that he was denied his right to be present at trial and that the people failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.on october,the appellate division affirmed norde conviction in a short published opinion,discussing only the evidence relating to the physical injury involved,the allegedly prejudicial remarks,and the prosecutor inquiry into norde prior convictions.see people norde,dep t.no reference was made to any of norde other arguments.
on november,norde moved for reargument in the appellate division,based on the new york court of appeals october,decision in people antommarchi.in antommarchi,the defendant conviction was reversed because during voir dire several potential jurors were questioned about their ability to be jurors at a side bar outside the hearing of the defendant.the new york court of appeals held that such a procedure during voir dire denied the defendant his sixth amendment right to be present during a material portion of his trial.norde motion for reargument was denied on february.norde sought leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals,and leave was denied on february.see people norde.norde then moved for a rehearing,which was granted.on april,after reconsideration,leave was again denied.see people norde.norde then filed a motion for a writ of coram with the appellate division,first department.on june,the appellate division denied in its entirety norde motion for the writ.
norde filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus dated april,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.on june,the district court dismissed the petition as untimely,the court having found that it was by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.see.however,the court granted a certificate of appealability on that issue.in july,we vacated the district court judgment and remanded the case after finding that in cases such as norde,where a conviction has become final prior to the effective date of the aedpa,prisoners have a grace period of one year after the effective date in which to file their habeas corpus petitions.ross artuz,cir.accordingly,the case proceeded in the district court.
on october,southern district magistrate judge james francis iv held an evidentiary hearing in order to expand the record with respect to the circumstances under which norde was excluded from the courtroom during jury selection in his trial,and the circumstances under which he ultimately returned.at the hearing,norde testified that,among other things,he was never given any warning prior to his removal and was never asked if he wished to return to the courtroom during jury selection.in a report and recommendation dated february,magistrate judge francis recommended that the petition be dismissed,concluding that norde behavior during voir dire was sufficiently disruptive to warrant his removal.
the magistrate judge also found that norde did not sufficiently demonstrate that he had been prejudiced by the court denial of his counsel request for a brief adjournment for consultation immediately following norde initial removal from the courtroom.in a decision and order dated november,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation in full and for the reasons stated therein and dismissed norde petition.the district court also held that a s no substantial question is presented,the court denies a certificate of appealability and certifies that any appeal would not be taken in good faith within the meaning of.judgment was entered on november,and norde filed a timely notice of appeal.we considered the notice of appeal as an application for a certificate of appealability.in an order dated june,we granted norde a certificate of appealability to consider the issues of whether he was denied the right to be present at voir dire and trial,whether he waived that right,and whether he was denied the assistance of counsel when the trial judge denied counsel request for an adjournment.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision to grant or deny a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.morris reynolds,cir.
under the aedpa,a federal court may not grant a habeas petition with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d see also aparicio artuz,cir.if a state court has failed to adjudicate a claim on the merits,the aedpa more stringent standard does not apply,and we instead review both questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact de novo.washington schriver,cir.the aedpa is applicable to habeas petitions filed after the statute effective date,april.because norde petition was filed after the effective date,the aedpa governs our review of his petition.therefore,in order to determine which level of deference to apply here,we must decide whether norde sixth amendment claims were adjudicated on the merits in state court.
a state court adjudicates a petitioner federal constitutional claims on the merits when it disposes of the claim on the merits,and reduces its disposition to judgment.sellan kuhlman,cir.in applying this test,we consider what the state courts have done in similar cases whether the history of the case suggests that the state court was aware of any ground for not adjudicating the case on the merits and whether the state court opinion suggests reliance upon procedural grounds rather than a determination on the merits.id.at quoting mercadel cain,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in this regard,we have given a broad reading to state court dispositions,noting that a state court need only dispose of the petitioner federal claim on substantive grounds,and reduce that disposition to judgment.no further articulation of its rationale or elucidation of its reasoning process is required.aparicio,at citing sellan,at.furthermore,an issue raised may be considered adjudicated on the merits for aedpa purposes even when the state court does not specifically mention the claim but uses general language referable to the merits.id.at sellan,at.
here,the appellate division opinion on direct review addressed only norde arguments that the evidence relating to the physical injury was insufficient,that the prosecutor was improperly allowed to make prejudicial remarks during summation,and that the prosecutor inquiry into norde prior convictions was prejudicial.see people norde,dep t.the court did not mention norde sixth amendment claims,and the opinion does not contain any language,general or specific,indicating that those claims were considered and denied on the merits.norde again raised his sixth amendment claims in his motion to reargue before the appellate division.the appellate division denied the motion,stating only as follows u pon reading and filing the papers with respect to said motion,and due deliberation having been had thereon,i t is ordered that the motion be and the same is denied.norde then moved for leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals.the motion was denied and was denied again after reargument.following the rulings of the court of appeals,norde attempted to raise his sixth amendment claims to the appellate division in a petition for a writ of coram nobis.that petition was denied in its entirety.
because the appellate division never indicated in any way that it had considered norde sixth amendment claims,we find that those claims were not adjudicated on the merits,and therefore that the aedpa new,more deferential standard of review does not apply.it is of no consequence that norde sixth amendment claims were subsequently raised in a motion for reargument and in a petition for a writ of coram nobis,both of which were denied with general language.under new york law,a motion for reargument is an application to the appellate court to exercise its discretion to order a reargument or reconsideration of the appeal.pro.law.such an order confine s the appellate court reconsideration to of the issues as previously argued or submitted upon the appeal proper.id.thus,an order granting or denying a motion to reargue is not a decision on the merits.rather,it is the court determination as to whether its own prior ruling should be reconsidered.accordingly,the appellate division decision on norde reargument motion is not a factor in determining whether his claims were adjudicated on the merits.similarly,because,under new york law,a writ of coram nobis may issue based only on claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,aparicio,at,the appellate division ruling on norde petition for the writ does not affect the question of whether his sixth amendment claims were adjudicated on the merits.
thus,because the merits of norde sixth amendment claims were not adjudicated in the state courts on direct review or otherwise,we review his claims de novo.
ii.norde sixth amendment claims 
norde argues that the district court erred in refusing to grant his petition because his removal from the courtroom during jury selection and the trial court failure to grant his counsel an adjournment for consultation deprived him of his sixth amendment rights to be
