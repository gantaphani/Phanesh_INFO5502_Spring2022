petitioner paul david crews,who faces a death sentence for a,appeals the dismissal without prejudice of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.crews concedes that the petition is a mixed petition,it contains both exhausted and unexhausted claims,so that the district court lacks the power to grant relief under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,codified at b.however,he argues that,instead of dismissing the petition without prejudice,the district court should hold it in abeyance while he attempts to exhaust his unexhausted claims in state court.he contends that dismissing the petition without prejudice has created the possibility that he will be under aedpa from returning to federal court after his attempt to exhaust his unexhausted claims,even though his initial habeas petition was timely under aedpa.we agree with crews and will reverse the district court dismissal of the petition and remand it to the district court.
facts and procedural history 
the following facts,which are not in dispute,are drawn from the pennsylvania supreme court decision in commonwealth crews.
on september,two hikers,geoffrey hood and molly larue,were killed at an overnight shelter on the appalachian trail in perry county,pennsylvania.larue was bound,raped,and stabbed.she died approximately fifteen minutes after receiving a knife wound to the neck.hood,her boyfriend,died five to eight minutes after being shot three times with a revolver.a week after the killings,crews was arrested.
at trial,witnesses testified that two days before the murders,crews visited a library in east berlin,pennsylvania,seeking a map of the appalachian trail.closer to the trail,crews asked other hikers for directions to the trail.other witnesses observed him heading south on the trail after the killings,wearing gear that belonged to the victims.when arrested,crews possessed numerous personal articles that belonged to the victims.the police also found in crews possession,a handgun,which a ballistics expert testified was the handgun that killed hood,and a knife with blood on it.the blood on the knife matched larue blood type.other witnesses identified objects found at the murder scene and along the trail south of the murder scene as belonging to,or resembling property owned by,crews.
fbi dna expert deadman testified that crews dna patterns matched the dna patterns of semen samples obtained from larue vagina in three of four genetic loci.he did not testify as to the statistical probability that such a match could occur by chance.crews expert,acton,criticized any conclusion reached without a statement of the probability that the match occurred by chance.the jury found crews guilty on two counts of first degree murder,and the trial proceeded to the capital sentencing phase.
during the capital sentencing phase,a physician for the prosecution testified that larue hands had been tied before she was killed.crews presented evidence that he had no prior convictions.he also presented his employer,who testified about crews work experience and drinking habits.finally,he presented a psychiatrist,who testified that crews had a schizoid personality and suffered from an organic aggressive syndrome aggravated on the day of the killings by alcohol and cocaine.
the trial judge instructed the jury that the potential aggravating circumstances pertaining to hood murder were that the killing occurred during the perpetration of a robbery,there was a grave risk of death to another,and crews was convicted of another murder.in the larue murder,the aggravating circumstances submitted to the jury were that the killing occurred during the perpetration of a rape,the killing was committed by torture,and crews was convicted of another murder.the mitigating circumstances submitted to the jury regarding both killings were that crews did not have any prior convictions,he was under extreme mental or emotional disturbance,his capacity to appreciate or conform his conduct was substantially impaired,he acted under extreme duress,and any other mitigating evidence concerning petitioner character and record or the circumstances of his offense that the jury considered relevant.
the jury found two aggravating circumstances in the hood murder grave risk of death to another and conviction of another murder and all three aggravating circumstances in the larue murder.in both murders,the jury found that aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating ones and returned verdicts of death.the court immediately sentenced petitioner to two consecutive death sentences.
following his conviction and sentence,crews appealed.the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed his conviction on april.crews,at.crews motion for reargument was denied on may,and he did not petition the united states supreme court for a writ of certiorari.
on january,crews filed his first petition for relief under the pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.ann,et.the court of common pleas dismissed the petition,and the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed on august.commonwealth crews.crews did not seek reargument in the pennsylvania supreme court or petition the united states supreme court for a writ of certiorari.
on september,crews filed a document entitled motion for a stay of execution and request for appointment of counsel under,q,and mcfarland scott and request for in forma pauperis status in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.on september,the district court granted crews in forma pauperis status,appointed counsel,denied crews motion for a stay of execution based on the commonwealth representation that a death warrant would not issue,and ordered crews to file a habeas petition by march.in compliance with this order,crews filed a habeas petition on march.on november,the district court determined that the habeas petition was a mixed petition,dismissed it without prejudice to allow exhaustion,and denied a certificate of appealability.crews appealed the dismissal,and we granted a certificate of appealability on april.
on february,while his habeas corpus petition was pending before the district court,crews filed a second pcra petition in the court of common pleas,raising the unexhausted claims.on august,the court of common pleas granted the commonwealth motion to dismiss the second pcra petition as untimely.that ruling is currently on appeal.
ii.jurisdiction and standards of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over this habeas corpus petition pursuant to a.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise plenary review over statute of limitations issues.see nara frank,cir.whether a district court has the power to stay a habeas petition is a question of law,and thus review is plenary.see united states higgins,cir.while we have not addressed the standard of review for a district court decision to dismiss a mixed petition rather than to grant a stay,as we discuss below,we now adopt an abuse of discretion standard.however,for the reasons we state below,in view of the time limitations imposed by the aedpa,where outright dismissal could jeopardize the timeliness of a collateral attack,a district court would abuse that discretion if it were not to offer to the petitioner the opportunity of staying,rather than dismissing,the petition.see zarvela artuz,cir,cert.denied,d.
iii.discussion 
aedpa requires a state prisoner to file a petition for federal habeas corpus relief within one year of the occurrence of several events,the only event relevant to this appeal being the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.d.the purpose of this requirement is to further the interest in finality of state court judgments by ensuring rapid federal review of constitutional challenges.see woodford garceau,d duncan walker,d.since crews conviction became final prior to april,the effective date of aedpa,he had a grace period,until april,to file his habeas corpus petitions.see nara frank,cir.
under aedpa statutory tolling provision,the limitations period is tolled for the time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending d.it is undisputed that crews qualifies for statutory tolling for the period from january,to august,because his properly filed first pcra petition was pending during this period since days of crews limitations period passed prior to the filing of his first pcra petition,he had days following the pennsylvania supreme court denial of his first pcra petition,or until november,to file his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.he satisfied this deadline by filing his september,application,in response to which the district court granted him an extension until march,to file his habeas corpus petition he filed his habeas corpus petition on march.thus,his habeas corpus petition was timely.
the petition,however,is a mixed one.under aedpa,subject to certain exceptions,a n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted unless it appears that a the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state b.this exhaustion rule promotes comity in that it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal district court to upset a state court conviction without an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional violation.walker,at.since the petition contains unexhausted claims,the district court dismissed it without prejudice to refile after exhaustion,concluding that rose lundy,d,compelled dismissal.
in lundy,the supreme court held that because a total exhaustion rule promotes comity and does not unreasonably impair the prisoner right to relief,we hold that a district court must dismiss habeas petitions containing both unexhausted and exhausted claims.at.however,in relying on lundy,the district court did not fully appreciate that aedpa,which was enacted after lundy,has altered the context in which the choice of mechanisms for handling mixed petitions is to be made.zarvela,at.by introducing a time limit,aedpa calls into doubt the conclusion in lundy that dismissal of a mixed petition does not unreasonably impair the prisoner right to relief,lundy,at,because in situations such as the present one,aedpa limitations period may act to deprive a petitioner of a federal forum if dismissal of the habeas petition is required.see zarvela,at.
since crews limitations period expired on november,he will be from returning to federal court if his petition is dismissed unless he can demonstrate that he is entitled to equitable or statutory tolling.it is not clear,however,that crews will be able to establish an entitlement to statutory or equitable tolling for the time during which his first federal habeas and second state pcra petitions were pending.see carey saffold,d walker,at.artuz bennett,d merritt blaine,cir nara,at fahy horn,cir,cert.denied,d banks horn,cir,rev on other grounds,d 
staying a habeas petition pending exhaustion of state remedies is a permissible and effective way to avoid barring from federal court a petitioner who timely files a mixed petition.in walker,four justices indicated that district courts should stay mixed petitions where there is a danger that dismissal will deny a petitioner federal review.in a concurring opinion,justice stevens,joined by justice souter,stated that 
although the court decision in rose lundy,d,prescribed the dismissal of federal habeas corpus petitions containing unexhausted claims,in our world there is no reason why a district court should not retain jurisdiction over a meritorious claim and stay further proceedings pending the complete exhaustion of state remedies.indeed,there is every reason to do so when aedpa gives a district court the alternative of simply denying a petition containing unexhausted but nonmeritorious claims,see b,supp.v,and when the failure to retain jurisdiction would foreclose federal review of a meritorious claim because of the lapse of aedpa limitations period.
at.stevens,concurring.justices breyer and ginsburg,in dissent,agreed with justice stevens that federal courts should hold mixed petitions in abeyance under such circumstances.see id.at.breyer,dissenting.the walker majority did not reject this conclusion it did not reach the issue.see id.at.
virtually every other circuit that has considered the issue has held that,following aedpa,while it usually is within a district court discretion to determine whether to stay or dismiss a mixed petition,staying the petition is the only appropriate course of action where an outright dismissal could jeopardize the timeliness of a collateral attack.zarvela,at quoting freeman page,cir,cert.denied,d see also neverson bissonnette,cir mackall angelone,cir,cert.denied,d brewer johnson,cir palmer carlton,cir kelly small,cir noting that there is a growing consensus that the zarvela approach is proper.the only circuit to come out the other way is the eighth circuit.see carmichael white,cir.however,carmichael relies on precedent and does not address the timeliness problems created by aedpa.see id.citing victor hopkins,cir.
in zarvela,the court recognized that the purpose of aedpa limitations period is to further the goal of finality by avoiding endless delay in deciding constitutional challenges to a conviction,particularly in capital cases.see id.however,the zarvela court found that the concern about excessive delays in seeking exhaustion and in returning to federal court after exhaustion can easily be dispelled by allowing a habeas petitioner no more than reasonable intervals of time to present his claims to the state courts and to return to federal court after exhaustion.id.at.the zarvela court concluded that a reasonable interval normally is days.see id.
the commonwealth argues that controlling precedent in this circuit,namely christy horn,cir,is contrary to the zarvela line of cases.in christy,we held that a district court erred in staying a mixed petition instead of dismissing the petition without prejudice because there was no substantial danger that the proffered potential harm would occur.see id.at.the potential harm in christy was execution,see,while the potential harm in the present case is being barred by time limitations from returning to federal court.even assuming that christy is applicable in cases involving other types of potential dangers,christy is factually distinguishable from the present case.in christy,a death warrant had not been issued and the general counsel to the governor of pennsylvania assured the christy court via letter that christy would not be executed during the pendency of his state court proceedings.thus,there was no substantial danger of execution.see id.at.
however,as discussed above,in the present case,there is a substantial danger that crews will be from returning to federal court because his petition will be filed after the expiration of the limitations period and it is not clear that he will be entitled to tolling.christy suggests that,under such circumstances where there is a substantial danger that the proffered potential harm will occur,the petition should be stayed,noting that i f a state court has refused to grant a stay pending its adjudication of a prisoner federal constitutional claims,such action by the district court would be appropriate.christy,at.
the commonwealth also argues that we should not follow zarvela because the tools of statutory and equitable tolling are sufficient to ensure that crews will not be from returning to federal court if he has acted with reasonable diligence in bringing the claims.however,where,as here,outright dismissal could jeopardize the timeliness of a habeas petition,there are two advantages to staying a mixed petition,rather than dismissing it and relying on tolling to determine if a subsequent petition is timely.
first,a stay preserves judicial resources.while there is an additional cost to district courts in terms of managing their dockets,this cost is more than by the savings in the amount of time that courts will have to spend analyzing timeliness issues.under the commonwealth proposed approach,when a district court decides whether to dismiss a mixed petition,it must determine the likelihood
