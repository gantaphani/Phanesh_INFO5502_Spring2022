background 
the following facts are undisputed except to the extent noted.on february,henry shot anthony bookard in an apartment in the presence of several individuals.henry immediately departed,leaving those bystanders behind with bookard,who died in the apartment several minutes later.later,henry returned to the apartment and,with the help of several others,placed bookard body in the trunk of a car and then buried the body in a snow bank near an elementary school.
on december,an oneida county grand jury charged henry with two counts of murder in the second count of intentional murder in the second degree and one count of murder in the second degree under a depraved indifference theory.penal law.on january,a jury found henry guilty of depraved indifference murder,in violation of penal law but he was acquitted of intentional murder.on april,henry was sentenced to an indeterminate prison sentence of years to life.
henry appealed his conviction,arguing,among other things,that the evidence adduced at trial was not sufficient to establish his guilt.the new york state supreme court,appellate division,affirmed his conviction,people henry,dep t,and the new york court of appeals denied leave to appeal,see people henry.
in,henry,proceeding pro se,filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court pursuant to.the district court referred the matter to magistrate judge david peebles,who,on november,filed a report and recommendation advising that henry petition be denied.in objecting to the magistrate judge report,henry time through his conviction could not stand because the intervening holding of the new york court of appeals in people suarez,which was decided after the magistrate judge had filed his report and recommendation,made it clear that a point blank shooting is insufficient to establish depraved indifference murder.petitioner objection to the magistrate judge report and recommendation,henry ricks,quoting suarez,at,some brackets added.notwithstanding henry objection,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation,reasoning that,although the new york court of appeals had recently altered new york law of depraved indifference murder in a material way,henry was not entitled to relief because the alteration did not apply retroactively.henry,wl,at.
following the district court denial of relief,henry moved for a coa so that this court could review two constitutional contentions.aff.in support of pet rs mot.for coa,henry ricks,at,motion for coa.in his moving papers,henry informed the district court that he wished to argue that pursuant to decision in dixon miller,cir,the decisions of the new york court of appeals in suarez and people gonzalez,as well as other cases,must be applied in our collateral review of his conviction because they constitut ed a clarification of the law as it existed at the time of his conviction and not a change in the law,motion for coa at,and even if the decisions marked a change in new york law of depraved indifference murder,as a matter of federal constitutional law the change must be applied retroactively,id.at.
the district court granted the motion for a coa in full,henry ricks,wl,at,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review de novo a district court denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.see,anderson miller,cir.where a claim for relief has been adjudicated on the merits in state court,we may grant habeas relief only if the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
under the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments,no conviction may be sustained except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.in re winship,d.a habeas petitioner is entitled to habeas corpus relief if it is found that upon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.einaugler supreme court of new york,cir quoting jackson virginia,d internal quotation marks omitted.
when evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence adduced at a state court criminal proceeding,we look to state law to determine the elements of the relevant crime.fama comm r of corr,cir see also dixon,at the state court interpretation of the proof required must be applied on collateral review to prevent a violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.pursuant to our decision in dixon,which,for purposes relevant to this appeal,simply applied the supreme court holding in fiore white,d w here a state highest court for the first time interprets a criminal statute to require proof of a particular element and that interpretation does not create a new law but merely clarifies what the law was at the time of a defendant conviction we apply the new interpretation of the criminal statute on collateral review of the conviction.dixon,at citing fiore,at.
it is undisputed that a recent line of opinions by the new york court of appeals,beginning with gonzalez,affected our understanding of penal law,which describes the offense of depraved indifference murder under new york law.see policano herbert,noting that gonzalez and subsequent cases,including people payne,suarez,at,and people feingold,have recast the law of depraved indifference murder.in these cases,the new york court of appeals explained that,contrary to prior interpretations of penal law,new york law does not permit a jury to convict a defendant of depraved indifference murder where the evidence demonstrates the defendant intent to kill the victim.see gonzalez,at,depraved indifference murder involves a killing in which the defendant does not have a conscious objective to cause death but instead is recklessly indifferent,depravedly so,to whether death occurs.
henry argues that he is entitled to application of the rule articulated in gonzalez because,according to henry,that decision and subsequent decisions of the new york court of appeals merely clarified new york law as it existed at the time of his conviction.appellant br.far from asserting actual innocence or a lack of intent to kill his victim,he contends that the evidence adduced at his trial amply demonstrated his intent to wound the victim mortally.henry urges that,in light of the evidence of his intent,the evidence was not sufficient to convict him of depraved indifference murder under the new pronouncement of the law by the new york court of appeals as to penal law.forthrightly conceding that his position is disturbing,appellant br,henry posits that his is,his intent to kill entitles him to the issuance of the great writ.
henry argument that the recent decisions of the new york court of appeals merely clarified the law as it existed at the time his conviction became final is squarely foreclosed by the holding of the new york court of appeals in policano herbert,in which the
