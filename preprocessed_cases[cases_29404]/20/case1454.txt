ken mckee,warden for james craig cristini,appeals an order from the district court conditionally granting petitioner a writ of habeas corpus after finding prosecutorial misconduct.in this habeas action originally filed in the eastern district of michigan,petitioner cristini argued inter alia that the michigan prosecutor improperly offered and argued evidence and that the prosecutor improperly commented on the credibility of defense witnesses.the district court agreed.on appeal,warden mckee maintains that the prosecutor did not engage in misconduct and that,even if he did,the misconduct did not result in such prejudice as to warrant habeas relief.
for the reasons stated below,we reverse the district court.
background 
the michigan court of appeals summarized the facts in the underlying crime as follows 
defendant convictions arise out of the killing of james scott bussell,who died of blunt force injuries to his head after being repeatedly kicked by defendant in an auto body shop owned by tayser mona in the early morning hours of january.at trial,mona was the key prosecution witness testifying pursuant to an agreement with the prosecutor following his convictions for mutilation of a dead body and habitual offender,fourth offense arising from his involvement in the incident.see people mona,unpublished opinion per curiam of the court of appeals,issued september,docket.
according to mona,on january,defendant,mona and bussell spent the late afternoon together at the oakland mall,purchasing merchandise with bad checks.thereafter,the threesome went together in mona car to various places,including mona home.defendant,mona and bussell then went to tycoon,a topless bar,where they stayed until closing time.after leaving the bar,between and on january,the threesome went together in mona car to his collision shop located on dequindre just north of nine mile to make calls to several escort services.mona testified that while he was on the phone,he saw bussell stand up and push defendant.in response,defendant hit bussell in the face,causing bussell to fall to the floor.at that point,mona saw defendant,who was wearing cowboy boots,repeatedly kick bussell in the head.when mona asked them to stop fighting,defendant ceased kicking bussell,who was injured and lying on the floor.however,according to mona,defendant again started kicking bussell,about two or three times.after defendant sat down in response to mona request to stop hitting bussell,defendant got up again and began kicking bussell.mona then went to the back of his shop to get some ice,returning with a rag with cold water on it.when mona returned,defendant,who was standing over bussell,told mona that bussell was dead.at that point,defendant again kicked bussell very hard in the head.subsequently,defendant asked mona to let him use his car to move bussell body.
thereafter,mona assisted defendant in moving bussell body to his car and transporting the body to an alley near seven mile and john r in detroit.placing the body next to a dumpster,defendant poured lacquer thinner over the body and set it on fire.mona and defendant then returned to the collision shop to clean up the blood stains on the floor and to destroy any evidence that might implicate them in bussell death.next,mona and defendant drove to a motel on eight mile and dequindre,where they threw out a piece of carpeting that was used to wrap the deceased body.as they drove along eight mile,mona and defendant also tossed out the deceased personal effects,bloody clothes and rags through the car window.
according to mona,he and defendant then went to a white castle at eight mile and gratiot,where defendant bought hamburgers to bring back to the shop for a final look.then,defendant and mona went to the oakland mall to retrieve bussell car.mona testified that he then followed defendant driving bussell car to a gasoline station on woodward and eleven mile road to buy a gas can and gasoline.according to mona,defendant went into the station,bought the gas can and pumped the gas.after purchasing the gasoline,mona followed defendant in bussell car to another location in detroit.there,defendant poured gasoline into bussell car and then set it on fire.
people cristini.lexis,wl july,
michigan brought murder and charges against both petitioner cristini and tayser mona.after mona trial was severed,a michigan jury convicted mona of being an accessory to murder after the fact and with mutilation of bussell body.after being found guilty,mona agreed to testify against cristini.in return for mona testimony,the prosecutor agreed to reduce the habitual offender charge so that mona faced years rather than a life sentence.
at trial,the prosecution offered evidence that cristini introduced victim bussell to mona,who had not previously known bussell.defendant cristini testified that he grew up with scott bussell and he had hung out with scott.the three went out together on january,staying out until after the bars closed,when they went to mona body shop,apparently to call prostitutes.after returning to that location,mona testified that cristini and bussell got into an argument,that cristini punched bussell,knocking him down,and then continued kicking bussell in the head while bussell lay on the ground,causing his death.
according to the prosecution,cristini and mona then took bussell body to a location in detroit and set it on fire with paint thinner.the prosecution also offered evidence that cristini and mona recovered bussell car,purchased gasoline at a gasoline station,and then set bussell vehicle on fire on a detroit street.
in addition to mona testimony describing how cristini killed bussell,the prosecution offered testimony of a number of witnesses who corroborated mona testimony and identified cristini or a person with cristini features as being involved with the disposition of bussell body.darold sayler,a garbage collector,testified that he saw three people in the alley in detroit where the victim body was found between and am at a distance of approximately to feet.the three people were all kind of like shoulder to shoulder coming around the can like they were moving something and they started the fire.sayler blew his horn and two of the men ran off to a vehicle at the other end of the alley way.another individual later found scott bussell burnt body at the place where sayler saw these two men start the fire.
a security guard at oakland mall,jason lee,testified that he saw the victim car parked at the mall between and am and recorded it in his log.between and am,guard lee noticed a second vehicle taking a place adjacent to the abandoned vehicle.he saw two white men in their to early thirties.one he identified as mona,and the second man he described as having a lighter complexion,bushy long blonde hair,and weighing about pounds.eventually,one of the persons entered victim bussell blue aries,and both vehicles drove off.
police recovered the victim car ten days later.it had been burned by a fire set by spreading gasoline in the car interior.the police found two melted down plastic containers in the car.
an amoco gas station attendant,ramsey,testified that she recognized both mona and cristini as having purchased a gasoline container and gasoline from her between and am on the morning following bussell death.she described the person who purchased the gasoline as tall and he had blond hair and it was on the back of his neck.she further testified that mona had bought a gas container with gas from another attendant.
the other gas station attendant,christian,testified that mona had purchased a small amount of gasoline from her and was accompanied by another man who had blonde hair he was on the lot next to the car when they were pumping the gas,and i could only see the back of his head.and he was tall and he had blonde hair and it was on the back of his neck.she testified that it was unusual for people to buy gas containers most people do want to pay for a gas can they only need for a few minutes.she could not identify this second man.
in addition to this testimony,the prosecution called seven witnesses who testified about prior assaults that cristini had committed.prior to trial,the prosecutor had filed a notice of his intention to use this prior bad acts evidence pursuant to b.the prosecutor had sought to use this evidence to show cristini modus operandi in committing unprovoked assaults by striking the heads of his victims with various objects.over defense counsel objection,the trial court ruled that evidence regarding these prior assaults could be admitted.in his opening argument,the prosecutor indicated he would not rely solely on tayser mona testimony,but would also offer evidence that cristini had a history of directing his assaults to the faces of his victims this evidence,he said,would demonstrate that the petitioner had a propensity for assaulting persons,without provocation,by striking the victim face and head with objects.the prosecution argued that this evidence would establish his identity as the killer and contradict his alibi defense.
as a defense,cristini offered alibi testimony that he had been with bussell and mona on january,until about pm,when he claimed bussell and mona dropped him off at his mother home.he testified that he remained at his mother home with his brother until near midnight and then left to pick up bet winnings from bobby rizzo.he said he then went to his brother craig cristini home with some friends.he testified that he was with these friends at the time of the killing and questioned the identification testimony of certain prosecution witnesses.
cristini presented several alibi witnesses,who claimed that he was with them from approximately pm on the night of bussell murder until the next morning,when he went to his brother car wash at am.the prosecution attacked this testimony.for example,craig cristini,the defendant brother,testified that the defendant had been with him on the night of the murder.in response,the prosecution showed that craig cristini knew within weeks that his brother was sought for the murder and yet never approached police to claim that defendant james cristini had been with him on the night of the murder 
with regard to alibi witness craig cristini,the prosecution also elicited testimony from dawn macro,decedent scott bussell sister.macro testified that craig cristini called her to see if her family had been able to locate her brother,scott.she testified that in her conversation she asked alibi witness craig cristini when he last saw james cristini before her brother disappearance.in conflict with his alibi testimony,she testified that craig cristini told her that he had last seen his brother three days before the murder.
cristini also called robert rizzo,to provide alibi testimony.rizzo testified that he had been with defendant cristini on the night of the murder,that cristini had a short brush haircut at the time,and that he had never known cristini to have long hair and a beard.responding to this,the prosecution offered evidence that rizzo had been questioned about the murder less than a month after its occurrence and had failed to tell the investigating police officer that cristini had been with him on the night of the murder.
cristini testified that he did not kill james scott bussell,claiming that he was elsewhere at the time of the murder.he testified to his reasons for going to florida shortly after bussell murder,and further explained that he had used mark sawka name when he was driving in florida because he had outstanding traffic warrants.in response,the prosecution presented evidence that the florida officer arrested cristini on an arrest warrant for mark sawka for a probation violation,believing that cristini was mark sawka,the name given by cristini.even after being arrested,cristini never gave his true name.the prosecutor argued that cristini explanation made no sense why would he suffer a probation violation arrest to avoid arrest for a traffic matter 
in his closing arguments,the prosecutor made the argument that the alibi defense is a dangerous defense,it a sword.the man lives or dies,so to speak,figuratively with an alibi defense.recognizing this nature of an alibi defense,the prosecutor principally challenged the testimony of the alibi witnesses,focusing on their failure to come forward with their alibi defense until trial.he also contended that these alibi witnesses lied,without objection from the defense.
as to alibi witness michael hay,the michigan prosecutor similarly challenged hay claim that he did not come forward with his alibi testimony because he did not know that james cristini had been charged with murder.the prosecutor ridiculed this position,saying that michael hay admitted to speaking weekly with defendant brother,craig cristini,and would have long known that james cristini had been charged with murder.summarizing,the prosecutor charged that hay is a liar.again,cristini attorney made no objection.
finally,regarding alibi witness rizzo,the prosecutor again attacked his failure to earlier come forward with the alibi information,especially in light of his having been questioned by a police officer you heard from detective christian that rizzo is a fellow who told detective christian february,one month after the murder that the last time he saw jimmy cristini was early january he comes here before you,commits perjury,and says oh,jimmy cristini was with me january and,a whole big lie.and,again,cristini attorney made no objection.
the prosecutor used similar tactics in suggesting that cristini should not be believed.specifically,the prosecutor said that cristini falsely used the name sawka when stopped in florida and continued using that name even after learning that a warrant existed for sawka arrest 
but okay,so he he decided to give a false name because he was worried about a traffic warrant for james cristini,there is none.there none,it would be here.once the officer said oh,sawka,there is a warrant outstanding for a probation violation,he said hold everything,i sorry,officer,you know,i a little drunk here,i do think well,i tired,and look officer,my name is really james cristini.that what he would have done.why would he want to go to jail in somebody else name that ridiculous that he was wanted on a probation violation under the name of mark sawka,it does add up.he gave the name because he killed scott bussell,that a logical explanation.
again,cristini attorney made no objection.
in addition to describing the alibi witnesses as liars in final argument,the prosecutor made numerous remarks regarding cristini prior charges and convictions for offenses involving hitting victims in the face or extinguishing cigarettes on a victim face.the prosecutor indicated that earlier assaults upon robert rizzo,james dudas,kimberly sellers,and robert plant showed an identifying modus operandi 
he said because that what boxers do,they injure people.he knows that,he goes for the head,he goes for the face.that his trademark,that his calling card.he may as well have left a calling card saying this was done by james cristini.i hurt people,i hit them in the face.and he also uses objects.he uses his foot,his uses a beer bottle,he uses car windshields,he uses cigarettes.he goes for your head and your face,that what he does.and it always unprovoked,always unprovoked.
responding to cristini position that mona had killed bussell,the prosecutor said cristini leaving michigan for florida,cristini use of someone else name,and cristini past assaultive behavior suggested that cristini,not mona,had killed bussell 
but who has three assaultive convictions on his record involving the use of weapons or dangerous objects against the face or head of the victims it cristini.the finger points towards him and him alone.
the petitioner conviction was affirmed on appeal.people cristini,wl.july,remanded,reconsideration den.on remand,the michigan court of appeals again affirmed the conviction.people cristini,wl on remand.february,lv.den.cristini then filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in federal court.the district court dismissed the application without prejudice,because cristini had not exhausted his claim of prosecutorial misconduct.
cristini next filed a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to,et.the trial court denied the motion.people cristini,macomb county circuit court,may.the michigan court of appeals denied petitioner application for leave to appeal,but remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing on petitioner claim of newly discovered evidence in support of his actual innocence claim.people cristini.november.the michigan supreme court denied petitioner application for leave to appeal because it was not timely filed.on remand,the trial court denied the motion for a new trial,stating that the evidence of actual innocence lacked credibility.people cristini,macomb county circuit court,february.this decision was affirmed on appeal.people cristini.december,leave,reconsideration den.
in the meantime,cristini had renewed his pursuit of habeas relief in the eastern district of michigan,asserting ten grounds for relief.without holding an evidentiary hearing,the district court conditionally granted the petitioner habeas relief,finding three of his grounds meritorious and declining to consider his other seven claims.specifically,the district court granted relief based on the prosecutor introduction of evidence of prior convictions in the state and the prosecutor arguments that the petitioner prior convictions showed his propensity for violence.the district court further granted habeas relief after finding the prosecutor made improper remarks in his closing statements,calling several witnesses liars and accusing one of perjury.respondent mckee filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.legal standard 
in an appeal of a habeas action,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo,but will not set aside its factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.dyer bowlen,cir.the standard for reviewing determinations on habeas is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,codified at d.
the aedpa provides that federal courts can not grant a habeas petition for any claim that the state court adjudicated on the merits unless the adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.see also miller francis,cir.
the united states supreme court outlined the proper application of d in williams taylor,d.to justify a grant of habeas relief under the contrary to clause,a federal court must find a violation of law clearly established by holdings of the supreme court,as opposed to its dicta,as of the time of the relevant state court decision.miller,at internal quotations omitted citing williams,at.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at quoting williams,at.even if a federal court could determine that a state court incorrectly applied federal law,the court still could not grant relief unless it also finds that the state court ruling was unreasonable.simpson jones,cir.
a violation of state law is not cognizable in federal habeas corpus unless such error amounts to a fundamental miscarriage of justice or a violation of the right to due process in violation of the united states constitution.floyd alexander,cir,cert.denied,d.we must accept as valid a state court interpretation of the statutes and rules of practice of that state.estelle mcguire,d.
moreover,the factual findings of a state court are presumed to be correct.a federal court may only diverge from a state court factual findings if the petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that the findings are erroneous.see e.
the aedpa standard of review applies only to habeas claims that are adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.d maples stegall,cir see also wiggins smith,d.when a habeas claim is not adjudicated in state court,we apply the standard,reviewing de novo questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact.hargrave mckee.cir citing maples stegall,cir.
iii.analysis 
procedural default 
cristini says that the michigan prosecutor committed misconduct by using prior assaultive conduct as propensity and identification evidence.however,cristini never made this claim to the michigan state courts until he filed a belated motion for relief from judgment in state court.respondent admits that he did not argue to the district court that cristini claim of prosecutorial misconduct was procedurally defaulted.respondent also concedes that,as a result,we may deem this argument forfeited.see howard bouchard,cir.p rocedural default is normally a defense that the state is obligated to raise and preserve if it is not to lose the right to assert the defense thereafter.trest cain,d internal quotation marks omitted.we may consider the issue of procedural default when raised for the first time on appeal and raise the issue sua sponte,but this court does not do so as a matter of course.howard,at white mitchell,cir elzy united states,cir.here,we decline to consider procedural default for the first time on appeal.
prosecutorial misconduct 
in his petition,before the macomb county circuit court,cristini argued that his constitutional rights had been violated by prosecutorial misconduct.that court found that cristini had previously raised the same issue on direct appeal and that res judicata barred him from litigating the issue again,albeit in an ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
in reviewing the record,the court notes that defendant already raised the following issues on appeal prosecutorial misconduct and the trial court alleged improper admission of evidence regarding his prior bad acts.see the court of appeals july,unpublished decision.further,defendant assertion regarding the prosecutor closing argument is apparently premised on the prosecutor reference to prior bad acts evidence.as indicated above,such evidence was already addressed by the appellate court.
in its may,opinion,the michigan circuit court denied cristini relief on the grounds that the claim was barred by res judicata.but while cristini had earlier raised a claim that improper character evidence had been admitted,he had never directly raised this claim as a prosecutorial misconduct claim.
the michigan court of appeals found error under state law in the admission of character evidence,but it also found the error to be harmless.although we review claims not reached by state courts de novo,we do so because there is no disposition on the merits to review.since the michigan courts applied the harmless error test after finding the same underlying conduct an error,we will review that decision under d,asking whether it resulted in a decision contrary to or involving an unreasonable application of clearly established law.see maples stegall,cir applying de novo review only where there was no state court decision on the merits see also wiggins smith,d applying d to the performance prong under a strickland analysis but not to the prejudice prong where there was no state court decision on that issue.
since there is no decision on the merits of whether the prosecutor committed constitutional error,this court reviews that issue de novo,but it will review the harmless error analysis employed by the michigan court of appeals under the deferential d standard.we emphasize that we apply d to the harmless error analysis because the michigan courts reviewed the harmless error issue with regard to the same conduct at issue here.filiaggi bagley,cir using aedpa standard of review when the analysis bears some similarity to the requisite constitutional analysis.the michigan court discussed not only the admissibility of the propensity evidence,but the prosecutor arguments stemming from the evidence and found the error to be harmless.
this court employs a test to determine whether prosecutorial misconduct requires a new trial.girts yanai,cir.under this approach,a court must first consider whether the prosecutor conduct and remarks were improper,and then consider and
