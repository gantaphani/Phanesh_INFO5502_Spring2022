jimmy fernandez garcia,garcia seeks habeas relief on the grounds that the state of texas violated the double jeopardy clause when it tried him for the capital murder of jimmy lynn garza lynn garza after a jury had already acquitted garcia of the capital murder of david moran moran.garcia contends that collateral estoppel applies because the moran jury allegedly determined a factual issue that precluded the lynn garza jury from finding him guilty of capital murder.we reject this argument,and in so doing reverse the district court grant of habeas relief.
facts and proceedings 
the undisputed facts giving rise to these murders are as follows moran agreed to purchase pounds of marijuana from garcia and his three friends for.garcia and his stokes stokes,ishmael mendez mendez,and raymond bursiaga bursiaga intended to rob moran rather than to sell him marijuana.garcia and his three friends collectively defendants were apprehensive about robbing moran because moran could retaliate against mendez and stokes and their families.defendants concluded that to avoid this possibility,they would have to kill moran after robbing him.
on the day of the planned robbery,stokes met moran at a restaurant,and the two agreed that the drug deal would occur at a remote location.immediately following the meeting,moran and his friend,lynn garza,drove to the location,as did defendants.defendants were in garcia automobile,with mendez driving,bursiaga in the front seat,and stokes and garcia hidden in the trunk.while en route,stokes and garcia passed weapons to mendez and bursiaga.
upon reaching the location,mendez and moran exited their respective cars.garcia and stokes emerged from the trunk.while they were emerging,bursiaga shot lynn garza with a revolver.mendez attempted to shoot moran with a shotgun,but the weapon jammed.moran ran and hid under his vehicle,then emerged to hand mendez the money,which garcia retrieved and placed in the trunk.mendez then gave the shotgun to garcia.at that point,mendez restrained moran while stokes,bursiaga,and garcia allegedly beat him with the gun and their fists.after the beating,defendants got into garcia car and ran over the twice and lynn garza once.
garcia was charged with the capital murders of moran and lynn garza.the state first tried garcia for moran murder the second murder,and then for lynn garza murder the first murder.the jury in the moran trial was instructed to find garcia guilty of capital murder only if garcia killed moran while in the course of committing or attempting to commit the offense of robbery of david moran garcia encouraged,directed,aided,or attempted to aid stokes,mendez,and bursiaga in killing moran,and they did so while in the course of committing or attempting to commit the offense of robbery of david moran or garcia conspired to commit the felony offense of robbery with stokes,mendez,or bursiaga,and in attempting to carry out that conspiracy,any one of the conspirators intentionally killed moran.without elaborating,the jury did not find that any of these conditions applied,instead finding garcia guilty of the offense of murder.the second trial used the same jury instructions for the murder and robbery of lynn garza.in that case,the jury found that garcia had murdered lynn garza while in the course of robbing him,and so convicted garcia of capital murder.
garcia appealed the lynn garza conviction.he argued that because of collateral estoppel,the moran verdict of the offense of murder barred the state from trying him for the capital murder of lynn garza.the state court of appeals affirmed the conviction,and the texas court of criminal appeals denied his petitions for discretionary review.the texas court of criminal appeals further denied his petition for habeas review.
garcia then sought habeas relief in federal court.a magistrate judge considered the habeas petition initially,and recommended that relief be granted based on collateral estoppel.the district court adopted the recommendation,and in doing so provided a supplemental analysis regarding the issue.the state appeals the district court ruling.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
garcia challenges this court jurisdiction on the basis that the state did not procure a certificate of appealability coa.although federal rule of appellate procedure b provides that the state need not obtain a coa to appeal a grant of a habeas petition,garcia argues that this rule violates the equal protection clause of the fifth amendment.where a habeas petition is denied in the district court,an appellate court lacks jurisdiction to hear the petitioner appeal unless the petitioner obtains a coa.black cockrell,cir.in contrast,where a habeas petitioner prevails,the state need not obtain a coa.fed.b.this difference,garcia argues,amounts to a disparity in the treatment of parties who are similarly situated.
garcia argument fails.prisoners are not a suspect class for purposes of constitutional protection.wottlin fleming,cir.this constitutional challenge is therefore subject only to a rational basis standard to be permissible,the disparate treatment must merely further a legitimate state interest.massachusetts bd.of ret.murgia,d.here,the coa requirement furthers a legitimate governmental interest.the apparent rationale for the disparate treatment is to preserve resources of states in defending appeals.the coa bar does not deny prisoners access to courts,but simply requires them to facially demonstrate that the appeal has merit by making a substantial showing that the state has deprived them of a constitutional right.see c.because congress interest in preserving state resources is legitimate,the coa requirement does not violate the equal protection clause.consequently,jurisdiction lies for this court to hear the state appeal.
standard of review 
this court review s the district court factual findings for clear error,but review s issues of law de novo.dyer johnson,cir citation omitted.because the district court opined that the double jeopardy clause prevents garcia from being convicted for the capital murder of lynn garza,this court reviews that conclusion de novo the jury factual findings supporting that conclusion are reviewed for clear error.
because garcia filed his habeas petition after april,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa applies to his appeal.see neal puckett,cir citing lindh murphy,d noting that aedpa applies to all federal habeas petitions filed on or after april.according to aedpa,habeas relief can not be granted unless the challenged state court proceeding resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.under subpart d of,unreasonable does not mean merely incorrect.schaetzle cockrell,cir.a n application of clearly established supreme court precedent must be incorrect and unreasonable to warrant federal habeas relief.id.internal quotations omitted accord williams taylor,d.
double jeopardy 
garcia argues that because the moran jury acquitted garcia of capital murder,the lynn garza conviction is a violation of the double jeopardy clause.the district court accepted this argument,reasoning that the only possible way a jury could have acquitted garcia of capital murder was to have found that there was no theft,and that if there was no theft as to the first trial,the government was barred by the fifth amendment from,in the second trial,prosecuting garcia for a crime that has that same theft as a necessary element.in fact,the jury reasonably could have acquitted garcia of capital murder because it had found that the murder of moran did not occur during the robbery.
the district court wrongly concluded that the moran jury must necessarily have found that no theft had occurred in order to acquit garcia of capital murder.
garcia relies on ashe swenson,d.in ashe,the supreme court held that violating the doctrine of collateral estoppel in a criminal case violates the double jeopardy clause.id.at.t
