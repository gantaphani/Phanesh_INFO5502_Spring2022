a jury convicted daniel bedford of the aggravated murder of gwen toepfert and the murder of john smith,and at the jury recommendation a state trial court sentenced him to death.the ohio courts affirmed his convictions and sentence on direct review and denied postconviction relief.bedford sought a writ of habeas corpus under,which the district court denied.we affirm.
in,bedford met toepfert,whose father owned the bar where bedford worked,and for the next several years the two were involved in an,relationship.ja.by,they were estranged.see state bedford,ohio.
bedford feelings for toepfert remained,however,prompting him to try to rekindle their prior romance.id.on april,he visited her apartment bearing a gift and hoping to make to learn that toepfert new boyfriend,john smith,was already there.id.three days later,bedford tried again.at around on tuesday,april,bedford,who had spent the evening working at one bar and patronizing another,telephoned toepfert to learn from her roommate,jo ann funk,that toepfert was asleep and that smith was with her.id.
later that morning,funk woke to the sounds of gunshots and screams.id.apparently overcome by toepfert rejection,bedford entered her apartment armed with a revolver and a shotgun,shot smith after a brief struggle and shot toepfert.during the melee,toepfert ran into funk bedroom,screaming that she had been shot.bedford found her there and shot her again with the revolver and the shotgun.smith and toepfert died from the gunshots.see id.
bedford fled to tennessee.once there,he visited an acquaintance,to whom he confessed his crime,and who reported bedford to the police.after tennessee police arrested bedford and mirandized him,he gave a statement admitting the crimes and eventually gave a similar statement to cincinnati authorities.id.
an ohio jury convicted bedford of the aggravated murder of toepfert and the murder of smith.id.at.after a mitigation hearing,the jury recommended the death penalty,and the trial court agreed.id.on direct review,the state court of appeals and the ohio supreme court affirmed bedford conviction and death sentence.see state bedford,no,wl,at ohio,per curiam,aff,bedford,at.bedford sought state relief,which the ohio courts denied.see state bedford,no,wl ohio,per curiam,appeal denied,state bedford,ohio.he filed a motion for reconsideration and another seeking reinstatement of his direct appeal,both to no avail.see state bedford,ohio,state bedford,ohio.
in,bedford filed a federal petition for habeas corpus in the district court.as amended,his petition raised separate grounds for relief.in a pair of thorough opinions spanning pages,the district court denied each of bedford claims.most of the claims,the court concluded,were procedurally defaulted or otherwise not cognizable in federal court,and the remainder failed on the merits.the court granted a certificate of appealability on several claims.see slack mcdaniel,d.
because bedford filed his federal habeas petition before aedpa effective date,aedpa standard of review does not apply,see lindh murphy,d.we thus give fresh review to the state courts legal conclusions and review to their fact findings.see fitzgerald withrow,cir.
bedford first claims that the trial court unfairly limited his questioning of prospective jurors during voir dire by too quickly dismissing four prospective jurors for cause that he wished to rehabilitate and by precluding his counsel from asking certain questions of the jurors.
a prospective juror may be struck for cause if he is substantially impaired in his ability to impose the death penalty under the framework.uttecht brown,d.that includes jurors who express an unwillingness to recommend the death penalty,no matter what the weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors suggests.see dennis mitchell,cir.
the four dismissed jurors each expressed views that qualified them as substantially impaired.juror herweh told the court that he definitely did not think he could sign a recommendation,ja,even if the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors.juror tucker did not think she could be a part of convicting someone to the death sentence,would not recommend a death sentence under any circumstance and could not follow a law requiring her to do so.ja.and jurors dotterweich and jordan stated that they could not sign a verdict recommending the death penalty.based on these statements,the trial court had ample cause to excuse each juror,see dennis,at,a view amplified by the considerable deference we give to the trial court assessment of each juror capacity to serve.see uttecht.at bowling parker,cir.
bedford counters that his counsel might have rehabilitated the jurors had the trial judge not cut short each colloquy.but the court did allow bedford lawyers to follow up with questions after initial inquiries elicited disqualifying responses,and each time the additional questions confirmed the juror unwillingness to sign a death verdict.
the question,then,is not whether the trial court was required to permit questions it is whether the court was required to permit still further questions.bedford contends that,had the jurors been reminded that their task required them only to make a recommendation to impose the death penalty the jurors might have modified their views.but bedford counsel did mention to all four jurors that they would make only a recommendation.
bedford adds that further questioning might have shown that the jurors were simply confused about the task before them,not unwilling to do their duty.br.at.but chalking up the jurors statements to confusion does not help bedford,because voir dire responses that signal serious confusion about the jury role in the process suffice to excuse a juror.see morales mitchell,cir.
even if bedford could show that the trial court erred in excusing the jurors,at any rate,he still could not obtain relief.to prevail,he must show not only that the trial court decision was incorrect but also that it resulted in an actually biased jury.hill brigano,cir.yet bedford has not alleged,let alone proved,that the jury that convicted him was biased.wilson mitchell,cir.
also unavailing is bedford claim that the trial court improperly limited the scope of questioning at voir dire.the constitution does not dictate a catechism for voir dire,but only that the defendant be afforded an impartial jury.morgan illinois,d.neither due process nor the sixth amendment entitles a defendant to ask prospective jurors every question that might prove helpful.virginia,d.what matters is whether the defendant inability to ask a question renders the proceeding fundamentally unfair by making it impossible to identify an unqualified juror.id.at.and in answering that question,we again remain mindful that the trial court vantage point gives it a superior perspective to assess which inquiries will be fruitful in uncovering bias and which will not be.see morgan,at.
the court gave each side ample opportunities to explore the venire members five days spanning nearly pages of transcript to the task.nor did it restrict either side to abstract questions about whether a juror would follow instructions or perform his duties impartially,morgan,at.it allowed the parties to press jurors about their attitudes.
the trial court,it is true,drew the line at questions that sought to elicit the jurors views on bedford specific many judges understandably and properly would do the same thing to prevent the lawyers from previewing their case through voir dire.united states lawes,cir wayne lafave et,criminal procedure a ed.the court allowed defense counsel to ask whether a juror would consider a specific fact at all during the sentencing phase,whichever way that fact might cut,but it barred bedford lawyers from asking whether a juror would find that fact to be mitigating.the court allowed his lawyers to explore each juror general attitudes about the death penalty,but it did not permit them to ask for what crimes the juror thought it appropriate or whether death always would be warranted for intentional homicide.and it allowed counsel to ask whether a juror thought various alternatives to the death penalty such as prison time were serious punishments,but it did not let them ask whether such sentences would be serious for defendants who committed murder.ja.
these limitations did not render the process fundamentally unfair.see dennis,at upholding similar restrictions.they reflect instead a reasonable effort to enable adequate exploration of juror biases on the one hand while preventing counsel from extracting commitments from individual jurors as to the way they would vote on the other.cabining counsel questions in this way did not block bedford from uncovering a juror unwillingness to consider relevant factors,nor did it inhibit him from exploring any avenues where bias might lurk.it merely prevented bedford counsel from mapping every alley and side street of each juror mind,a level of detail that the constitution does not entitle criminal defendants or the prosecution to obtain.
bedford next claims that the prosecutor closing arguments at the guilt and penalty phases violated due process.to prevail,bedford must show that the prosecutor remarks were not just improper but that they were flagrant.united states carson,cir.flagrancy turns on content and context whether the comment was likely to mislead the jury or otherwise prejudice the defendant whether it was an isolated occurrence or part of an extensive pattern whether it was made deliberately or by accident and whether the prosecution other evidence was strong.see id.
guilt phase.bedford complains about comments by the prosecutor in closing argument at the guilt phase that allegedly disparaged defense counsel tactics.the prosecutor called s ome of bedford arguments mickey mouse defenses,ja,and he characterized others as attempts to confuse the jury by fill ing the courtroom with as much smoke as you possibly can,ja,casting aspersions all around the courtroom and putting everyone on trial in the case except our little boy over here all in the hope that the jury would lose sight of the real issues in the case,ja.attempting to deflate an attempt by the defense to discredit a particular government witness,the prosecutor also predicted that the witness would be dragged through the mud by the defense.ja.
these comments were not improper.the prosecution necessarily has wide latitude during closing argument to respond to the defense strategies,evidence and arguments.united states henry,cir see byrd collins,cir.how far the government may go,true enough,depends on what the defense has said or done or likely will say or do.see united states young,d.and in all events the prosecutor may not simply belittle the defense witnesses or deride legitimate defenses,see slagle bagley,cir gall parker,cir,abrogated on other grounds as recognized in bowling parker,cir,nor may he offer his own opinion about a witness credibility,see cristini mckee,cir.but the prosecutor remarks in this made in the course of the thrust and parry of a criminal no more than respond to bedford actual and reasonably likely contentions and tactics.see united states bernard,cir united states rivera,cir.
several of the prosecutor comments,bedford adds,were calculated to incite the jury passions and were engineered to elicit an emotional,not a reasoned,reaction to the evidence.responding to the defense theory that bedford conduct was the culmination of an unplanned by alcohol and emotion and sparked by a confrontation with toepfert new prosecutor argued that the evidence,including graphic photographs of toepfert and smith bodies,proved bedford conduct was purposeful and planned that bedford inner demon his alcohol not responsible for his behavior,as the only demon in this case was bedford and that the jurors duty required finding bedford guilty and that,if they did so,each juror could say to himself i did gwen justice and i did johnny justice,ja.
these comments did not deprive bedford of a fair trial.by alluding to the victim photographs,already admitted into evidence,and arguing that they established bedford intent,the prosecutor permissibly sought to draw an inference from the evidence.see byrd,at.calling bedford a demon comes closer to the was unnecessary and it goes no further than similar comments that have not required setting aside a state conviction.see olsen mcfaul,cir holding that prosecutor deliberate,repeated references to defendant as a deadbeat,a thief,a creep and a liar did not violate due process see also byrd,at same regarding prosecutor repeated references to defendant as a predator.
neither did the prosecutor overstep by urging the jury to do justice for smith and toepfert.nothing prevents the government from appealing to the jurors sense of justice,see coe bell,cir,or from connecting the point to the victims in the case,hicks collins,cir.the prosecution,to be sure,may not urge jurors to identify individually with the victims with comments like i t could have been you the defendant killed or i t could have been your children,johnson bell,cir,nor may it fan the flames of the jurors fears by predicting that if they do not convict,a crime wave or some other calamity will consume their community,see united states solivan,cir.but the prosecutor did no such thing here.
penalty phase.in arguing that the prosecutor summation contained unfairly prejudicial comments,bedford targets the following the prosecutor reminded the jury that they make only a recommendation,not a final decision,on bedford sentence he read a passage from gregg georgia,d,concerning the death penalty role in society he suggested that it was unpleasant for bedford counsel to represent him,ja he redisplayed photographs of both victims and argued that they established an aggravating circumstance he speculated that despite the minimum imprisonment under current law,bedford might be paroled sooner and he commented on bedford unsworn statement.
we can quickly dispatch with bedford complaints about the first four comments.there was nothing improper about accurately explaining to the jury that,under ohio scheme,they do not definitively defendant sentence.hicks,at.that was an accurate statement of the law.see see also coleman mitchell,cir.it was not in any case did not render the trial fundamentally quote from the supreme court opinion in gregg to support the state argument that the death penalty is consistent with,and in some instances necessary to,an ordered society.byrd,at.that,too,was an accurate statement of what the supreme court said.nor did the prosecutor reference to the unpleasantness of representing bedford cross the line.viewed in context,the prosecutor did no more than urge the jurors not to shrink from their difficult duty even though the process was unpleasant for all,defense counsel and jury included.ja.
the prosecutor also did not overstep by using the pictures of the victims as evidence of an aggravating circumstance.true,only bedford conviction for toepfert aggravated murder carried a death specification,see bedford,at,and yet the pictures depicted toepfert and smith.but the specification fact that toepfert murder was part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more persons,ohio a made smith murder relevant,and thus by putting pictures of smith before the jury again the prosecutor did not invite them to consider a aggravating factor.see also smith mitchell,cir consideration of aggravating factors,even if contrary to state law,does not violate federal constitution.nor was it improper to use the photographs to make the point the jury saw the images during the guilt phase,and the prosecution may use evidence at sentencing,see beuke houk,cir.
the remaining two statements require more explanation.the prosecutor suggested that,even though under state law a life sentence would keep bedford behind bars for or years before he could obtain parole,the law could change,enabling bedford to obtain parole sooner.that statement is similar to informing the jury that if it selects a life sentence,state officials might commute the sentence to a shorter term.so long as the jury receives accurate information,it may consider the possibility,speculative though it may be,that future decisions of state executive officials could lead to the defendant early release.see california ramos,d.
even if we assumed for the sake of argument that the prosecutor comments crossed the line,they were not sufficiently flagrant to make bedford trial unfair.carson,at.the prosecutor statement,for one thing,was unlikely to mislead the jury the prosecutor said nothing general assembly,or state or federal courts,could change the application of life sentences in the both the trial court and the defense made the current law clear to the jury.the remark also was isolated,and it may have been accidental,as the prosecutor appeared to downplay the point almost immediately.the other evidence relevant to the jury sentencing decision also was strong.as the ohio supreme court observed,the evidence showed that bedford could distinguish right from wrong,considered his conduct in advance,lay in wait for his victims and after shooting toepfert once returned twice to shoot her again.see bedford,at.
bedford claim about the prosecutor comments on his unsworn statements fares no better.under the fifth and fourteenth amendment,the prosecution ordinarily may not comment on a defendant refusal to testify.see griffin california,d durr mitchell,cir.ohio law,however,adds a wrinkle it allows a capital defendant,at his option,to make an unsworn statement at the sentencing phase,which is not subject to.see ohio d.when the defendant exercises that option,we have held that the prosecution may remind the jury that the defendant statement was not made under oath,in contrast to the testimony of all other witnesses.durr,at internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added.but the prosecution may go no further and may not disparage the defendant decision not to testify under oath.see depew anderson,at,cir.
after noting that bedford statement was unsworn and not subject to,the prosecutor continued 
i think because of that you can judge his credibility and the things that he had to say to you with a jaundice d eye because even if a person is under oath,you do have to believe what they say and the mere fact that this man elected to avoid being scrutinized by the prosecutor in this case should be considered by you.
ja.whether that comment was improper is a close call.the only point of allowing the prosecution to remind the jury that the defendant statement was not made under oath,after all,is to enable the state since it can not him to challenge his credibility.at least the first part of the prosecutor comment seemed trained on that objective,encouraging the jury to question the truthfulness of what bedford did say,not his refusal to testify under oath on another subject.depew,at holding improper prosecutor statement that the defendant decision to give unsworn statement but not to undergo under oath prevented the prosecutor from questioning him about a different subject.the last part of his comment,however,may have gone too far,arguably inviting the jury to draw an adverse inference from the fact that bedford never testified under oath at all.durr,at.
even assuming the prosecutor crossed the line,however,any violation was not flagrant.the likelihood that the jury was misled was low,as the court and the prosecutor told the jury bedford was entitled to make an unsworn statement.the comment was isolated,and the prosecution other evidence was plentiful.the potential for prejudice was reduced still further by the fact that the state trial and appellate courts independently weighed the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.bedford,at,see lundgren mitchell,cir.even if improper,in short,the prosecutor comments do not require setting aside bedford sentence.
before turning to bedford next argument,we must acknowledge one oddity about this analysis.simply put,it is strange to think of bedford contention in conventional fifth amendment terms.the guarantee says that an individual shall not be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.const.amend.v.yet this issue arose not because the prosecution compelled bedford to testify or because he exercised his right to remain silent and the prosecution disparaged his classic settings in which fifth amendment violations because bedford did speak to the jury.bedford voluntarily invoked a state allocution procedure that federal law does not require and that allowed him to make an unsworn statement to the jury during the penalty phase.at least ten states by our rough count have similar procedures that apply at the penalty phase of capital cases.see jeffries blodgett,cir applying washington law people borrego,shelton state,booth state,vacated on other grounds,d,overruled by payne tennessee,d state zola,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in state delibero,homick state,state herrera,state wilson,bassett commonwealth,idaho death penalty criminal jury instruction see also jones state,so d,state young,utah opinion of durham.and because these procedures are creations of the states,the states are fully entitled to adopt an assortment of limitations on the exercise of the right as well as limitations on what the prosecution may say about a defendant exercise of the right.
why any of this raises an issue of federal law in this case,however,is not.doubtless,the invocation of the right could implicate the fifth amendment if the prosecution insisted on the defendant about other crimes.see,depew,at.or the invocation of this right could implicate the sixth amendment if the prosecution violated rules about the allocution procedure and defendant counsel unreasonably failed to object.see,durr,at.but it is far from obvious why the fifth amendment,as opposed to state law,constrains a prosecutor who wishes to comment not on a defendant silence but on his voluntary choice to speak.as the above analysis confirms,we need not decide the case on this ground,and therefore we have not done so.we simply register the observation in the event future litigants or panels of the court may profit from it.
bedford next argues that the trial court gave an unduly coercive allen charge to the jury during the penalty phase.a day into its deliberations,the jury sent a note to the court asking what would happen if the jury could not reach a unanimous sentencing recommendation and whether there was an approximate time frame for reaching a decision.ja.after consulting with the parties,the court responded with a supplemental instruction informing the jury that there was no fixed time limit but urging the jurors to make every reasonable effort to agree on a recommendation,given the time and energy already invested in the trial and the jurors superior position having already participated in the guilt phase to make a fair decision.ja.the court suggest ed that the jury first determine whether they were in fact deadlocked and,if so,to return a recommendation.ja.
the question is whether the instruction,viewed in context,was coercive.lowenfield phelps,d internal quotation marks omitted see mason mitchell,cir.bedford says it was for several reasons it omitted the standard language directing all majority and reconsider their views it failed to caution them not to abandon their conscientiously held views and it misled the jury by suggesting that if they could not reach a decision,another jury would take up their task,when in reality a deadlock would force the judge to impose a life sentence.
by instructing the entire jury to make every reasonable effort to agree on a recommendation if they could do so in good faith,the trial court at least implicitly encouraged all of the jurors to reconsider their positions.yes,the court did not explicitly direct the majority and the minority to do so.but that did not make the charge coercive.reminding both sides of a split jury to remain no doubt may ensure that those in the minority are not singled out and pressured to acquiesce in the majority view,see williams parke,cir,and it may prevent those in the majority from dismissing their own reservations or second thoughts as counterproductive.but a general instruction,addressed to all jurors,suffices so long as it does not imply that only those in the minority should rethink their position.see id.at.
nor was the charge coercive because it omitted a caution that the jurors
