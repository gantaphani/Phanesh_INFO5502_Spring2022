in this case,a habeas petitioner contends that the government made an oral promise,never incorporated into his written plea agreement,that he could conditionally plead guilty,retaining the right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.it is undisputed that the petitioner lawyer erroneously informed him that the guilty plea was conditional and that the petitioner would not have pleaded guilty absent this representation moreover,the government conceded,and the district court found,that in making this representation,the petitioner lawyer provided constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel,which rendered the petitioner guilty plea involuntary.nevertheless,without holding an evidentiary hearing,the court found the petitioner had not proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the government had made the asserted oral promise that the petitioner could conditionally plead and so summarily denied the petitioner request to reform his plea agreement.because we believe that material factual disputes require an evidentiary hearing in this case,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
a grand jury charged gavin roderick white with one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of a.apparently,the police uncovered the cocaine during a traffic stop of white car white moved to suppress the cocaine,asserting that the search of his car proceeded without his consent.the district court denied the motion to suppress.
thereafter,pursuant to a written plea agreement,white pleaded guilty to the charged offense.neither that plea agreement nor the district court plea colloquy expressly informed white that by pleading guilty he waived his right to appeal the suppression motion.but the plea agreement,which contained an integration clause,also did not state that white guilty plea was conditional.thus,when white appealed the denial of his suppression motion to this court,we dismissed the appeal because his plea agreement did not include the express provision,described in.a,that would have made it conditional.united states white,wl cir.june,per curiam 
represented by new counsel,white then moved,under,that his conviction and sentence be vacated and he be granted all relief to which he may be entitled.first,white asserted that his guilty plea was not voluntary and knowing because,when he entered into the plea agreement,he believed that he was making a conditional plea,subject to the appeal of the denial of his suppression motion.second,white asserted that the united states attorney made an oral agreement that white guilty plea would be conditional,subject to the appeal of his suppression motion,and that this fraudulent oral agreement induced white to enter the plea.finally,white asserted that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel because his counsel during plea negotiations,david heilberg,erroneously assured him that he could appeal the denial of his suppression motion after he pled guilty.white declared under penalty of perjury that all three of these assertions were true and correct.
in response,the government moved for partial summary judgment,agreeing that white allegations amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel and urging the court to grant white initial request to vacate and then reinstate judgment,restarting the time period for filing a notice of appeal.white filed a response asserting that the government mischaracterized the relief he requested,and clarifying that he in fact wished to have his conviction vacated.nonetheless,the district court granted the relief advocated by the government,vacating,then reinstating,the original conviction and sentence with a later date of entry,permitting an additional ten days for appeal.
because this did not provide white any real would still be procedurally barred from challenging the search on appeal because his written plea agreement remained filed a motion for reconsideration asking the district court to either allow him to plead anew,or i n the alternative reform the plea agreement to reflect the assertedly conditional plea.the district court granted white motion to reconsider and referred the case to a magistrate judge to conduct any or all proceedings that may arise in this civil action,including an evidentiary hearing,and to submit all findings and recommendations to the district court.
pursuant to this referral,the magistrate judge ordered discovery and scheduled an evidentiary hearing.four days after entry of the discovery order and well prior to the scheduled evidentiary hearing,however,the government moved that white be granted the relief he sought,which the government characterized as vacat ing the conviction and sentence and returning white for trial.in reply,white again disputed the government characterization of the requested relief,specifying that he was not merely seeking vacatur,but also asking the court to reform the plea agreement to reflect a conditional plea.responding,the government argued that reformation was not a proper remedy because it had never consented to a conditional plea but neither at this point nor at any other time in these proceedings did the government offer any affidavit or other direct evidence denying that it had entered into an oral agreement that white plea would be conditional.
nevertheless,no evidentiary hearing was ever held.instead,the magistrate judge heard oral argument on whether the court should vacate white conviction and sentence and set the case for trial as the government argued,or vacate the conviction and sentence only to reenter them under a reformed conditional plea agreement as white argued.concluding that the government had indeed promised white he would be entitled to appeal his suppression motion,or at the very least acquiesced to a conditional plea by failing to challenge white allegations through the greater part of the proceedings,the magistrate judge recommended granting white motion to vacate his guilty plea,permitting him to plead anew conditionally.
the district court disagreed.noting that neither party had produced hard,objective evidence supporting their respective assertions,the court found dispositive white oral affirmation of the unconditional written plea agreement during his rule hearing.the court refused to order reformation of the plea agreement,concluding that white had failed to prove the existence of an oral agreement by a preponderance of the evidence.the court concluded,however,as the parties had agreed,that white plea was involuntary due to the ineffective assistance of counsel.accordingly,the district court vacated white conviction and sentence and set the case for trial.the court denied white subsequent motion to reconsider,but did grant a certificate of appealability.
before us,then,it is undisputed that white counsel at the time of the plea negotiations,david heilberg,erroneously informed white that he could appeal the denial of his suppression motion notwithstanding the failure of the written plea agreement to contain any provision permitting this.similarly,it is uncontroverted that white relied on his lawyer representation in pleading guilty,which he would not have done absent this representation.moreover,the government concedes,and the district court found,that these facts equate to ineffective assistance of counsel,rendering white guilty plea involuntary and mandating vacatur of white conviction and sentence.thus,as the parties agree,the only question we face is a narrow one did the district court err in refusing to grant white any relief on his claim that the government actually promised that he could conditionally plead 
it is that when a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise of the prosecutor,so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration,such promise must be fulfilled.santobello new york,d.hence,as the government properly conceded at oral argument,if a government representative orally promised white that he could conditionally plead,white would be entitled to the relief he asking for despite his attorney failure to preserve this right in the written plea agreement.proof of the government refusal to abide by such an oral promise would clearly constitute evidence of government overreaching or fraud in the inducement,admissible without running afoul of the parol evidence rule.united states garcia,cir see also united states harvey,cir

with these governing principles in mind,we turn to the case at hand.
we first examine whether the district court erred in summarily dismissing white allegations.in his sworn petition,white alleges that t he united states attorney made an oral agreement that white guilty plea would be conditional,subject to the appeal of the denial of his suppression motion,and that his plea of guilty was induced by this fraudulent oral agreement.despite ample opportunity to respond to these allegations,the government has steadfastly refused to introduce any affidavit or other direct evidence attesting that no government agent promised white he could appeal his suppression motion.nonetheless,without holding an evidentiary hearing,the district court summarily rejected white allegations,reasoning that white,during the plea colloquy at his rule hearing,had affirmed the written plea agreement and had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the government made an oral agreement that was not memorialized in the final written plea agreement.
although,as blackledge teaches,a court can summarily dismiss allegations of a petitioner who attempts to challenge statements made during his plea colloquy or in his plea agreement,the district court in this case subjected white allegations to the wrong legal standard.a court can not summarily dismiss a petitioner allegations simply because the petitioner has yet to prove them by a preponderance of the evidence.summary dismissal of habeas allegations is warrant ed only if a habeas petitioner allegations when viewed against the record of the plea hearing,are palpably incredible or patently frivolous or false.blackledge,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,the proper inquiry here is are white sworn allegations that a government prosecutor made an oral agreement that his guilty plea was conditional palpably incredible or patently frivolous or false when viewed against the record of white plea hearing 
that record undeniably reveals that the sentencing court engaged white in a proper rule colloquy and that white affirmed his assent to a written agreement that,in fact,contained no provision for a conditional plea.however,neither party disputes that the record of the plea hearing also evidences an involuntary plea,which white entered only because constitutionally ineffective counsel specifically assured him that entering into that plea would not prevent him from appealing the denial of his suppression motion.moreover,the record demonstrates that neither the written plea agreement nor any aspect of the plea colloquy contradicted defense counsel incorrect assurance to white that his plea was conditional.viewed against this record,we can not conclude that white sworn allegations are palpably incredible or patently frivolous or false.
first,one of the central purposes of a rule plea ensure that a defendant plea is truly voluntary has been defeated in the case at hand.mccarthy united states,d.ultimately,the validity of a bargained guilty plea depends on the voluntariness and intelligence with which the not his the bargained plea.harvey,at.but here the government concedes and the district court held that white guilty plea which implicitly included the waiver of his right to appeal was involuntary.thus,in this case,the commendable procedures of the rule plea colloquy failed to achieve one of their primary ensure the voluntariness of white guilty plea.as such,it would be perverse to allow white affirmations during these proceedings to serve as an insurmountable barrier to his claim 
this is particularly critical given the reason white plea has been held involuntary.the government conceded and the district court held the plea involuntary because attorney representing white during his plea constitutionally ineffective in assuring white that the plea was conditional.although simply being represented by ineffective counsel,of course,does not entitle a defendant to reformation of a plea agreement,it certainly diminishes the substantial weight normally accorded to a defendant representations.see crawford united states,cir noting,in dicta,that if the accused has waived counsel at the taking of his plea,his rule statements may be less conclusive than if he had been represented,and in those circumstances an evidentiary hearing is required,overruled on other grounds by united states whitley,cir hedman united states,cir distinguishing the court decision to grant an evidentiary hearing in fontaine in part on the ground that fontaine involved an uncounsel ed plea.moreover,in this case it would be grossly unjust to turn a blind eye to white allegations that the government agreed to preserve his appellate rights when he was represented by counsel deemed ineffective for erroneously informing him of precisely that.
furthermore,we believe it significant that nothing in the written plea agreement contravenes white allegations.compare hartman,at.indeed,the plea agreement nowhere mentions the right to appeal,or waiver of that right.although a guilty plea constitutes an automatic waiver of defects not inconsistent with the establishment of factual guilt as a matter of law,menna new york,d per curiam,this legal principle would hardly be apparent to a lay defendant,especially when,as here,his own lawyer was not aware of the need to include such a provision in order to preserve his right to appeal.
nor did the district court orally clarify the issue during the rule hearing.the court never advised white that by entering into a guilty plea he waived his right to appeal.moreover,in its only express mention of white appellate rights,the court inquired as to whether white underst oo d that in some circumstances,either you or the government may have the right to appeal any sentence which i impose.this might confirm to a layman that he had indeed preserved a right to appeal 
the remainder of the plea colloquy did not eliminate the possibility of a layman making this assumption.in it,white acknowledged that he had reviewed the plea agreement,had no questions about it,and fully understood it.he affirmed that it actually reflect ed his agreement,and that aside from the plea agreement,nobody made any other promise or assurance of any kind in any effort to induce him to plead guilty.neither these nor the other questions put to white during the plea colloquy would have alerted him to the fact that his right to appeal was waived in the absence of a provision preserving that when his own lawyer expressly told him otherwise 
moreover,the dissent repeated contention that the district court questioned both heilberg and the prosecutor about the agreement contents,post at see also post at,is belied by the record.in fact,the judge asked the attorneys just one question about the agreement contents whether the assessment fee should be or.and,the district court only asked heilberg and the prosecutor if there was anything further in the case at this time other than to set up a sentencing date,post at,after the court had accepted the plea agreement,taken white plea,adjudged white guilty,and ordered a presentence report.in reality,the attorneys involve ment in the rule colloquy,post at,upon which the dissent so heavily relies,consisted of a few terse responses to routine questions having nothing whatsoever to do with the plea agreement 
in sum,this case presents the type of extraordinary circumstances that warrant an evidentiary hearing.despite the dissent alarmist rhetoric,this holding does not invite a deluge of evidentiary hearings.this case presents circumstances that must by any definition be considered rare,and simply does not encompass nearly every instance where a prisoner files a petition alleging that he was induced to plead guilty by an oral promise from the prosecutor.post at.indeed,the dissent is able to posit its slippery slope argument only by ignoring the unique factual circumstances at issue in this case.here,we view white sworn allegations and the lack of any sworn denial from the government against the record of a plea hearing involving an involuntary plea,a defendant relying on mistaken advice from constitutionally ineffective counsel,a plea agreement that does not contradict the defendant understanding,and a rule colloquy that also fails to negate the erroneous advice provided by constitutionally ineffective counsel.under these extraordinary circumstances,we believe it clear that white allegations can not be deemed palpably incredible or patently frivolous or false.accordingly,the district court erred in summarily dismissing those allegations.
we therefore must consider whether white allegations that the government orally promised he could conditionally plead can be resolved without an evidentiary hearing.as noted above,summary judgment provides a viable mechanism for disposing of even habeas petitions in the proper case.see blackledge,at.of course,the district court did not purport to grant summary judgment here.rather,the court weighed the evidence under a preponderance of the evidence standard altogether foreign to summary judgment.
nevertheless,both and the that the district court could,and should,have granted summary judgment in its favor.the fact that both parties simultaneously are arguing that there is no genuine issue of fact does not establish that a trial is unnecessary thereby empowering the court to enter judgment as it sees fit.tfws schaefer,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.rather,a court may grant summary judgment only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c,with any permissible inferences drawn from the underlying facts to be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.united states lee,cir.
the government claimed entitlement to summary judgment rests largely on its repeated contention in court submissions that it did not orally agree to a conditional plea.but an attorney unsworn argument does not constitute evidence,and the government has offered no affidavit,deposition,sworn statement,or other direct evidence that a government agent did not make the oral promise.the only proof the government offers that it made no such promise is the plea colloquy and written plea agreement.although as noted above they carry a strong presumption of verity,they do not render a guilty plea invulnerable,blackledge,at.internal quotation marks omitted,particularly given that the only evidence directly addressing the alleged oral sworn the view that the government did make that promise.
in his sworn petition,white unequivocally states that t he united states attorney made an oral agreement that white guilty plea would be conditional,subject to the appeal of the denial of his suppression motion.moreover,white has also offered as evidence an affidavit from his counsel during plea negotiations.heilberg does not directly attest to entering into an oral agreement with the government,but he does swear that he provided ineffective assistance of counsel by not invoking the technical requirements of rule a.drawing all permissible inferences from his affidavit in white favor,a court could reasonably infer that the technical requirements of rule a,which heilberg failed to invok e,refer to his failure to incorporate the government oral promise into the final written plea agreement.indeed,it is difficult to imagine how the total failure to obtain the government consent to a conditional plea could be characterized as just a technical requirement.
in sum,the record evidence to date certainly contains a dispute of material fact sufficient to preclude the grant of summary judgment to the government.see peavy united states,cir finding petitioner entitled to an evidentiary hearing when the only evidence in the record was an affidavit supporting petitioner claims,and concluding that the government must present evidence in support of its position,and that its unverified responses were plainly inadequate.
we find white contention that he merits summary judgment equally unpersuasive.white principally bases his argument on statements made by the government in its motion for partial summary judgment,responding to white sworn petition.there,the government stated,inter alia,
no material factual issues are in contention petitioner has alleged facts which,even if not true,would entitle him to a hearing,and the united states evidence on these points would likely not overcome the petitioner evidence,if the petitioner evidence were believed.
white maintains that by these statements,the government conceded that it made the alleged oral promise that white could enter a conditional guilty plea.
this argument ignores the very next paragraph of the government motion,which clarifies that i n reaching this conclusion,it relies exclusively on heilberg sworn affidavit admitting that his own professional errors deprived white of an opportunity to preserve his appeal after the plea,errors which the government recognized ma de out a prima facie case of ineffective assistance of counsel.thus,the government plainly did not concede that it had made the alleged oral promise it simply conceded that white had produced evidence demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel 
white also relies on the assertion of heilberg that the government breached its verbal agreement to permit white to enter his conditional guilty plea.however,this assertion appears not in heilberg affidavit or in any other sworn statement,but in a reply brief filed in the direct appeal in this case that white submitted as an exhibit to his habeas motion.just as we concluded that the contrary unsworn statements in memoranda filed by government counsel do not constitute evidence so,too,we can not regard this statement as evidence.all of the other evidence on which white relies as support for the grant of summary judgment establishes simply that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that his plea was involuntary none of it goes to the question of whether the government actually made the alleged oral promise.in sum,just as the undisputed facts fail to demonstrate that the government did not make an oral promise,they also fail to demonstrate the government did make the alleged promise.rather,the facts as to this matter are hotly disputed.summary judgment on this record would clearly be improper.
indeed,the need for an evidentiary hearing is particularly compelling in this case.although neither defense nor government counsel has directly attested under oath to the existence of an oral agreement nor were they questioned about the agreement during the rule hearing,both have made express representations in their court submissions,acting as officers of the court,and those representations directly contradict each other.when,as here,the factual allegations relate primarily to purported occurrences outside the courtroom and upon which the record could,therefore,cast no real light,machibroda united states,d,and where the ultimate resolution rests on a credibility determination,raines united states,cir,an evidentiary hearing is especially warranted.
accordingly,we remand for an evidentiary hearing on the question of whether the government did make the alleged oral promise that white plea was conditional,permitting him to appeal denial of the suppression motion we note that even if the district court concludes after that hearing that the government orally agreed to a conditional plea,this does not necessarily entitle white to reformation of his plea agreement.although a court ought to accord a defendant remedial preference considerable,if not controlling,weight in determining the appropriate relief,santobello,at.douglas,concurring.a grants the district court absolute discretion with regard to accepting or rejecting the conditional plea,and the court can refuse to accept it for any reason or for no reason.see united states davis,cir see also united states muldoon,cir.
for all of these reasons,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
vacated and remanded 
the effect of the majority opinion is to require an evidentiary hearing nearly every time a prisoner files a petition alleging that he was induced to plead guilty by an oral promise from the prosecutor.it is undisputed in this case that white signed an unambiguous and unconditional plea agreement and swore during his rule plea colloquy that he understood the written plea agreement and that no one had made any other promises to him to induce him to plead guilty.i believe that,given these facts,white later unsupported assertion in his sworn petition that the prosecutor made an oral promise that he could appeal the denial of his suppression motion is insufficient to overcome the presumption that the statements he made during his rule plea colloquy are accurate and truthful.accordingly,i do not believe that an evidentiary hearing is necessary or appropriate in this case,and i respectfully dissent.

on november,white pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.white unconditional plea agreement contained the following clause this agreement constitutes the full and complete understanding among the parties.at.as the majority acknowledges,white affirmed this written agreement at his rule plea colloquy and stated that the agreement accurately reflected his agreement with the government,and that,aside from the written plea agreement,no one had made any other promise or assurance to him of any kind in any effort to induce him to plead guilty.at.white also stated that he had reviewed and fully understood the plea agreement 
both white trial counsel,heilberg,and the participated in the plea colloquy.when the district court reviewed the plea agreement during the colloquy,it questioned both heilberg and the prosecutor about the agreement contents.at that time,neither attorney asserted that he had orally agreed that the plea was conditional.at the conclusion of the rule colloquy,the district court asked heilberg and the prosecutor if there was anything further in the case other than to set up a sentencing.at.again,neither attorney mentioned having agreed that the plea was conditional or asserted that the written plea agreement was incomplete.
after the district court accepted white plea,white attempted to appeal the denial of his pretrial suppression motion,but we dismissed his appeal because he had not preserved his right to appeal as required by federal rule of criminal procedure a west supp.united states white,wl cir unpublished.white then filed a motion pursuant to west supp to vacate,set aside,or correct his sentence.
in his sworn petition,white asserted that his guilty plea was not voluntary and knowing because his attorney had advised him that he could appeal the denial of his suppression motion after he pled guilty,and because he was induced to plead guilty by the prosecutor fraudulent oral agreement that the plea was conditional.at.attached to his petition were a letter and an affidavit from heilberg.in the letter,dated october,approximately three weeks before white pleaded guilty,heilberg wrote,as you can see from the wilson case,you can appeal judge kiser ruling even after your guilty plea.this is probably the course that you must choose at.in the affidavit in support of white motion,heilberg averred that he had made an inaccurate prediction about white right to appeal and mistaken ly assur ed white that he could appeal.at.heilberg affidavit does not state,however,that he orally agreed with the prosecutor that white guilty plea would be conditional,nor did heilberg state that he had informed white of any such agreement.at.instead,heilberg blamed white predicament on heilberg mistaken promise and admitted ineffectiveness.at.the government,relying on heilberg affidavit,conceded that white had received ineffective assistance of counsel and asked that the court to set aside white guilty plea and schedule the case for trial at in reaching this conclusion,the united states relies exclusively on the affidavit of david heilberg.
the district court then granted white petition and gave him the remedy that normally follows a finding that a guilty plea was unknowing and court vacated white guilty plea and instructed the clerk to set the case for trial.see,osborne,cir holding that when a guilty plea is involuntary the writ of habeas corpus should issue subject to the state right to bring the defendant to trial within a reasonable period of time.realizing that he would no longer receive the benefit of the reduced sentence that had accompanied his guilty plea white appealed the district court remedy.
white avers that,based on the record,he is entitled to reformation of his plea agreement,so that it will reflect the terms of his alleged oral agreement with the prosecutor.in the alternative,white wants the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing so that he can prove the existence of the oral agreement and thus gain reformation of the plea agreement.in short,white wants both to keep the benefits of the favorable sentence that he received under his plea agreement and to be able to appeal the denial of his pretrial suppression motion while i agree with my colleagues that white is not entitled to summary judgment on his claim for reformation of his plea agreement,see ante at,i do not believe that white is entitled to an evidentiary hearing.accordingly,i would affirm the district court vacatur of white conviction and sentence and remand the case for trial.
because this case does not involve the most extraordinary circumstances,the sworn statements that white made during his plea colloquy bar his subsequent attempt to prove that he relied on an oral promise made by the prosecutor.solemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity.blackledge allison,d.r epresentations of the defendant at plea hearing s constitute a formidable barrier in any subsequent collateral proceedings,id.at,because courts must be able to rely on the defendant statements made under oath during a properly conducted rule plea colloquy.united states bowman,cir see crawford united states,cir t he accuracy and truth of an accused statements at a rule proceeding in which his guilty plea is accepted are conclusively established by that proceeding unless and until he makes some reasonable allegation why this should not be so,partially overruled on other grounds by united states whitley,cir en banc.to allow indiscriminate hearings in federal proceedings would eliminate the chief virtues of the plea,economy,and finality.blackledge,at.accordingly,when a defendant attempts to contradict statements that he made during a properly conducted plea colloquy in a collateral attack on his sentence,he will be entitled to an evidentiary hearing only in the most extraordinary circumstances.id.at.
my colleagues hold that a district court is required to hold an evidentiary hearing unless a habeas petitioner allegations,even those contradicting sworn statements made during his rule colloquy,are palpably incredible or patently frivolous or false.ante at quoting blackledge,at.i respectfully disagree that this is the proper test.my colleagues in the majority draw this proposition from blackledge but neglect to consider the historical context in which blackledge was decided and the critical factual difference between this case and blackledge here,unlike in blackledge,the district court conducted a proper rule plea colloquy.
blackledge was decided shortly after the supreme court first blessed the practice of plea bargaining,see santobello,d,and well before district courts had become familiar with the procedures mandated by rule.blackledge,at.before santobello,plea bargaining was generally kept secret,and defendants often were instructed to lie about the deal that they had received.id.at.in blackledge,the north carolina court that had accepted the defendant allison guilty plea had not conducted a plea colloquy in the modern sense,but instead read from a printed form questions,generally concerning the defendant understanding of the charge,its consequences,and the voluntariness of his plea.id.at.so far as the record show ed,there was no questioning beyond this routine no inquiry was made of either defense counsel or prosecutor.id.in this context,the supreme court held that allison specific allegation that he had been promised a certain sentence as part of a plea agreement was not palpably incredible or patently frivolous or false,and that he was thus entitled to an evidentiary hearing.id.at.
had there been no properly conducted rule colloquy in this case,the palpably incredible or patently frivolous or false standard likely would apply.the court in blackledge noted approvingly,however,that north carolina had,after the time of allison plea,adopted procedures similar to those now dictated by rule.id.at.the court opined that h ad these commendable procedures been followed allison petition would have been cast in a very different light.id.the court continued,
a petitioner challenging a plea given pursuant to procedures like those required by rule will necessarily b e asserting that not only his own transcribed responses,but those given by two lawyers,were untruthful.especially as it becomes routine for prosecutors and defense lawyers to acknowledge that plea bargains have been made,such a contention will entitle a petitioner to an evidentiary hearing only in the most extraordinary circumstances.
blackledge,at.thus,blackledge palpably incredible and patently frivolous or false language does not apply to cases in which procedures like those specified in rule are used id.in such cases,like this one,habeas petitioners will be entitled to an evidentiary hearing only if the case presents the most extraordinary circumstances.see lasiter thomas,cir the petitioner i s bound by his solemn declarations in open court and his unsubstantiated efforts to refute that record a re not sufficient to require a hearing.this case does not involve the most extraordinary circumstances.ouellette united states,cir holding that an evidentiary hearing is not required when a petitioner uncorroborated allegations are directly contradicted by his testimony at the time of his plea colloquy pennington housewright,cir the procedures followed in pennington case are closer to those requiring a hearing only in the most extraordinary circumstances.thus,t he lack of any indication that evidence,other than pennington allegations,would be forthcoming warranted the district court dismissal without a hearing.
the only possible extraordinary circumstance that could justify holding an evidentiary hearing in this case is heilberg ineffectiveness.unquestionably,heilberg was constitutionally ineffective,and his ineffectiveness resulted in an unknowing and involuntary plea.but,as explained below,heilberg ineffectiveness is immaterial to the reliability of the specific representations made by white during his plea colloquy.accordingly,i do not believe that this case presents us with the most extraordinary circumstances,and i conclude that we are entitled to rely upon white sworn assertion that,aside from the written plea agreement,no one had made any other promise or assurance to him of any kind in any effort to induce him to plead guilty.at.
as the government concedes,heilberg erroneously promised white that he would be able to appeal the denial of his pretrial suppression motion despite his guilty plea.this admitted ineffectiveness,however,would not have induced white to conceal or deny the existence of an oral agreement with the prosecutor.white stated during his plea colloquy that he had gone over the plea agreement and understood it.it is undisputed that the plea agreement did not contain a term preserving his right to appeal the denial of his pretrial suppression motion,and that it contained an integration clause.at the plea colloquy,white agreed that no one had made any other promise or assurance of any kind to induce him to plead guilty and affirmed the written plea agreement.although white might have believed that the plea agreement did not need a term preserving his right to appeal,this belief does not explain his failure to mention his alleged oral agreement with the prosecutor during his plea colloquy.notably,white does not allege in his petition that heilberg or the prosecutor instructed him to keep the oral agreement a secret,or that either told him that the plea agreement contained a term preserving his right to appeal.instead,he claims that the plea agreement failed to alert him that his guilty plea was unconditional.at.although this evidences a misunderstanding of the law,it does not explain why he failed to note his alleged oral agreement with the prosecutor when asked if anyone had made any other promises or assurances to induce him to plead guilty.at.
moreover,as the district court reviewed the plea agreement and questioned heilberg and the prosecutor about its contents,neither attorney averred that the plea was conditional.therefore,white is,in essence,averring not only that he lied during his rule colloquy,but that both his attorney and the prosecutor remained silent when each had a duty to inform the court of any agreements not contained in the written plea agreement.see.c the parties must disclose the plea agreement in open court when the plea is offered bryan united states,cir t he defendant and all counsel have a duty to disclose the existence and details of any agreement which relates to the plea tendered.this is exactly the situation that the blackledge court noted would almost never entitle petitioners to evidentiary hearings.blackledge,at.
because heilberg ineffectiveness does not relate to or explain white sworn statement during the rule plea colloquy that he had received no promises not included in the plea agreement,this case does not present us with the type of extraordinary circumstance that would justify an evidentiary hearing to determine whether such a promise was made.instead,we are entitled to rely upon the text of the plea agreement and white rule plea colloquy,in which he disavowed the existence of such an agreement.accordingly,white is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing 
not only does my conclusion that white is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing comport with a proper interpretation of blackledge,it is also consonant with the cases from this circuit and others applying the parol evidence rule to exclude extrinsic evidence of promises not included in unambiguous written plea agreements.see hartman blankenship,cir holding that because the record did not support hartman contention that the written plea agreement was not intended to be the final,exclusive expression of his bargain with the government,the parol evidence rule barred consideration of extrinsic evidence of an alleged contrary oral agreement see also united states nunez,cir under the parol evidence rule,a court looks to,and enforces,the plain language of a plea agreement and does not look to extrinsic evidence to interpret the terms of an unambiguous written instrument.united states rockwell int l,cir regardless of whether the defendant extrinsic evidence vindicates his assertion that the government agreed to be limited in its actions in a plea agreement,the parol evidence rule forbids the defendant from asserting this additional term.united states ballis,cir p arol evidence is inadmissible to prove the meaning of an unambiguous plea agreement.united states rutledge,cir a n integration clause negates any effort by a defendant to undo the terms of the plea agreement by pointing to an alleged promise,made before the agreement was signed.the parol evidence rule prevents a disaffected party,unhappy with what his bargain has bought for him,from supplant ing the order of a concluded agreement with the chaos of a reconfiguration of the bargain.hartman,at in this case,if the parol evidence rule applies,it would bar consideration of white sworn allegations.white plea agreement is unambiguous.it clearly states that it is the complete understanding among the parties,and it does not preserve white right to appeal the denial of his pretrial suppression motion.white assertion that the prosecutor orally agreed that white would be able to appeal the denial of his suppression motion varies the terms of the written plea agreement,and,accordingly,it is inadmissible parol evidence.
i acknowledge that the parol evidence rule is not applied as strictly to plea agreements as it is to commercial contracts.see united states garcia,cir enforcing a promise in the cover letter sent by the government along with a plea agreement when the government conceded that it had made the promise.this is because we will not allow the government to take advantage of a rule of contract law to profit from an omission in a contract it prepared when it concedes that it made a promise not contained in the written plea agreement.id.at.thus,when contemporaneous documentary evidence demonstrates that the government in fact made a promise to the defendant,we will not apply the parol evidence rule to prevent enforcement of the promise.id.white,however,has not presented contemporaneous documentary evidence.instead,the only evidence that he has presented is the unsupported allegation in his sworn petition.although we should not allow the government to profit from its own omission,if the parol evidence rule ever applies,it must apply when the only evidence of the alleged omission is a allegation in a sworn habeas petition.garcia,at see hartman,at.indeed,all of the evidence before us,other than white sworn petition,shows that white believed he could appeal the denial of his suppression motion not because of a fraudulent promise by the prosecutor,but because his counsel misunderstood the applicable law.the record contains no evidence of governmental overreaching or misbehavior.when i couple these facts with the fact that during his rule plea colloquy white explicitly denied the existence of any promises not contained in his plea agreement,i conclude that if we can not apply the parol evidence rule in this case,we can not apply it in any case involving a written plea agreement.i believe that such a step will lead to countless unnecessary evidentiary hearings.see blackledge,at.
in sum,under the majority rationale,nearly every time that a convicted criminal defendant asserts that he was induced to plead guilty by an oral promise from the prosecutor,he will be entitled to an evidentiary hearing,even if his allegations conflict with the unambiguous terms of his written plea agreement and his sworn statements made during a rule plea colloquy.given that more often than not a prisoner has everything to gain and nothing to lose from filing a collateral attack upon his guilty plea,this will result in an enormous waste of governmental resources blackledge,at.because the sworn statements made by white during his rule plea colloquy and the unambiguous written plea agreement conclusively establish that white received no oral promise from the prosecutor that his plea was conditional,and because this case does not present the most extraordinary circumstances,an evidentiary hearing is unnecessary in this case.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
courts have interpreted.a to make direct review of an adverse ruling on a motion available only if the defendant expressly preserves that right by entering a conditional guilty plea.united states wiggins,cir.
although never asserting that white somehow failed to preserve a reformation remedy,the government also criticized white unreliable expression of remedial preference.but it is that pursuant to.c,a court has broad power to grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled,even if the party has not demanded such relief in the party pleadings.see minyard,southeastern chem.solvent,cir.the dissent does not challenge this statement of hornbook law,but it does intimate that white improperly seeks to retain the sentence he received under the plea agreement and pursue an appeal of the denial of his suppression motion.see post at.but there is nothing improper about this the government agreed to a conditional plea,then,as government counsel conceded at oral argument,white certainly would be entitled to seek to hold the government to its promise and retain the benefit of his bargain.
hartman blankenship,cir,which preceded garcia,contains some dicta suggesting that a defendant can never use parol evidence to vary the terms of an unambiguous written plea agreement.but hartman itself goes on to acknowledge that this is not always the case.see id.noting that the record made in the arraignment proceeding the rule colloquy and plea agreement is not invariably immune from attack see also blackledge allison,d bemis united states,cir collecting cases.moreover,the holding in hartman presents no conflict with our holding in this case.in hartman,this court refused to permit the grant of a writ of habeas corpus when the state court,after holding an evidentiary hearing,rejected petitioner allegation that the prosecutor had made an oral promise expressly contradicted by the written plea agreement,at,whereas here,we only require an evidentiary hearing not the grant of a writ of habeas corpus to determine if a prosecutor made an oral promise,a promise that is not expressly contradicted by anything in the written plea agreement.
the dissent maintains that this is not the proper test that it does not apply when procedures similar to those dictated by rule are utilized.post at.according to the dissent,after a rule colloquy,an evidentiary hearing is only available in the most extraordinary circumstances.id.at.we agree that when rule safeguards are afforded to a defendant,an evidentiary hearing will indeed be rare,but stating that a hearing is only available in extraordinary circumstances begs the question of when such circumstances exist.to answer this question,a court must weigh a petitioner allegations against the record including the rule plea colloquy as mandated by blackledge.in conducting this analysis,often the petitioner allegations will be deemed palpably incredible or patently frivolous or false in light of affirmations made at the rule hearing.but,the blackledge palpably incredible test still applies when petitioners have been provided proper plea procedures,see,tran lockhart,cir marrow united states,cir united states unger,cir mckenzie wainwright,cir,though petitioners will only be able to satisfy it in extraordinary circumstances.no case cited by the dissent espouses the dissent theory,that after a rule hearing or its equivalent,the palpably incredible standard does not apply.indeed,in the dissent lead case,in the course of denying a petitioner an evidentiary hearing because the case did not involve extraordinary circumstances,the tenth circuit expressly relied on and quoted its earlier interpretation of blackledge,refusing to order an evidentiary hearing because petitioner claims were wholly incredible.see lasiter thomas,cir quoting phillips murphy,cir.
although the dissent acknowledges that white u nquestionably entered an unknowing and involuntary plea,it nonetheless insists that white affirmations be given conclusive weight.post at.but the reason why a petitioner statements during the rule hearing are often conclusive is because the procedural safeguards are believed sufficient to demonstrate voluntariness.see united states bowman,cir the rule colloquy is designed to provide a structure to protect the defendant against making an uninformed and involuntary decision to plead guilty emphasis added see also pennington housewright,cir.when,as here,these admittedly imperfect safeguards fail,and the colloquy is tainted by involuntariness,the weight given to a defendant declarations must be diminished accordingly.none of the cases relied on by the dissent suggest otherwise indeed,none of them involve a concededly involuntary plea.
we do not suggest that the district court in any way violated rule that rule does not require a district court to inform a defendant that,by pleading guilty,he is waiving his right to appeal any antecedent rulings or constitutional violations.see united states floyd,cir.
to the extent that the dissent seeks to portray white as a and savvy career criminal,more astute than a mere lay person,post at,this characterization is not borne out by the record.in fact,white scored a and on his two iq tests,dropped out of high school in the eleventh grade,and although he attended college,he received poor grades and only accrued nine credits during a period.and,although white was sentenced as a career offender because of two prior drug offenses,he had only been in federal court on one previous occasion.
for example,heilberg,white lawyer,spoke only words less words than in this footnote during the entire plea hearing.thus,contrary to the dissent suggestion,post at,the lawyers minimal involvement in the plea colloquy here is a far cry from that mandated by the revised north carolina procedures that the blackledge court found commendable.see blackledge,at.explaining that the revised north carolina procedures require s pecific inquiry about whether a plea bargain has been struck of defense counsel and the prosecutor.
of course,simply filing a sworn declaration alleging that the government made promises outside the written plea agreement does not make those allegations,and certainly does not entitle the petitioner to an evidentiary hearing.rather,a petitioner must first overcome the formidable barrier erected by the representations he made in open court at the plea proceedings,and even then,as detailed above,an evidentiary hearing may not be required.see blackledge,at.
alternatively,relying on.d,white contends that the government response,by failing to deny his sworn allegations of an oral promise,must be deemed to have admitted those allegations.we disagree.see rule of the rules governing proceedings for united states district courts stating district court may apply the federal rules of civil procedure see also.d referring to responsive pleadings,not motions rule of the rules governing proceedings for united states district courts governing contents of answer,not motion.
of course,if one side concedes the correctness of the other position on this issue,eliminating any factual dispute,no hearing would be necessary.
given that i believe that the appropriate disposition of this case is granting white petition for collateral relief,i can not understand my colleagues view that i intimat e that rule procedural safeguards immunize a guilty plea from collateral attack.ante at.i also do not believe that rule procedural safeguards always render an evidentiary hearing unnecessary.indeed,i believe that the case cited by the majority,fontaine united states,d,a case in which the petitioner introduced documentary evidence supporting his claim that he was severely ill,both physically and mentally,and uncounseled at the time of his rule colloquy,is a paradigmatic example of a case involving the most extraordinary circumstances entitling a petitioner to an evidentiary hearing.
i note that white does not claim that his intelligence or mental capabilities were impaired during the plea colloquy.in fact,during the plea colloquy,white testified that he was years old,not under the influence of drugs or alcohol and that he had attended two years at virginia state university.at.the district court also advised him that if he d id understand any of the questions or if at any time he want ed to talk with heilberg,all he ha d to do was say so.at.the court further instructed white that he was under oath and if he answer ed any of the court questions falsely,then those false answers could later be used against him in another prosecution for perjury or for the making of a false statement.at.the majority claims that a lay person might have misunderstood the district court question whether white understood that in some circumstances,either he or the government may have the right to appeal any sentence which the court may impose.ante at at emphasis added.white,however,was not simply a lay person white was a career criminal offender who undoubtedly understood the difference between a sentence imposed by the court and a pretrial motion that would result in the suppression of evidence.in fact,i believe that white silence in the face of the district court question,which expressly limited the right to appeal to any sentence,makes his assertion of an oral promise all the more implausible.united states floyd,cir holding that a guilty plea was knowing and voluntary when a district court asked the identical question during a plea colloquy but failed to inform the defendant that he was waiving the right to appeal the denial of pretrial motions.
the plea agreement was signed by assistant united states attorney,ray fitzgerald.the government was represented by another assistant united states attorney,joel vengrin,at the rule hearing.for convenience sake,we will refer to all attorneys representing the government in this case as the prosecutor.
although it is not completely clear,heilberg was likely referring to united states wilson,cir,a case in which a defendant had preserved his right to appeal the denial of his pretrial suppression motion as part of his guilty plea.if this is in fact the case that heilberg was referencing,his concession of incompetence is unremarkable,given that wilson specifically noted that the defendant had reserved his right to appeal.id.at.
the government did not concede that,as part of the plea agreement,heilberg told white that he would be able to appeal the denial of his suppression motion.
