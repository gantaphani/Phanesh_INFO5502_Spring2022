roy lee pippin seeks a certificate of appealability coa to appeal the district court summary judgment dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.because pippin can not make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,we deny his application for a coa.
background 
pippin owned and operated an air conditioning business known as pippin services.in december,pippin became involved in a money laundering scheme to funnel proceeds from the sale of colombian cocaine in the united states to mexico,using air conditioners and modified gas tanks of trucks to transport large sums of money across the mexican border.when approximately million in drug proceeds was reported missing,pippin rented a white panel van from pv rentals and reserved two rooms at a motel on april,at pippin request,abraham pacheco,an employee at pippin services,took two men,elmer buitrago and his cousin,fabio buitrago,to the motel and held them captive against their will for several days before dawn on may,pippin and pacheco took elmer and fabio buitrago to a warehouse in the rented van.pippin then shot them each approximately four times through a pillow to muffle the sound,and both men then left the warehouse to get rid of the murder weapon.shortly thereafter,houston police officer eddie parodi,responding to a call of criminal mischief in progress at the apartment complex located directly behind the warehouse,arrived at the scene and found the fatally wounded elmer buitrago crying out in english and spanish for help 
before the ambulance arrived,buitrago spoke with officer parodi and identified pippin as the shooter.buitrago described pippin as a white male,approximately and pounds,with sandy brown hair buitrago also claimed that after pippin shot him in the warehouse,he was able to hit pippin with a pipe and escape.garza later testified that he also heard buitrago say pippin shot me and mention the name roy.buitrago died later that day at the hospital from his gunshot wounds.the body of fabio buitrago was not discovered until the next day,when lieutenant richard maxey returned to the warehouse to obtain statements from witnesses.upon further investigation,the police found eight fired cartridge cases from a semiautomatic weapon on the right side of the room and some bullet holes and fired bullets lodged in the north wall of the warehouse.
law enforcement officers arrested pippin on june,at a friend house.at his trial,pippin admitted to participating in the aggravated kidnappings of elmer and fabio buitrago but denied killing any of them or even being present when they were killed.charles anderson,a ballistics expert for the houston police department,testified about a ballistics report he prepared regarding the bullets and cartridge cases found at the crime scene.both the prosecutor julian ramirez and pippin defense attorneys richard wheelan and joan campbell had access to anderson report well in advance of the trial.
on september,pippin was convicted of capital murder for intentionally killing more than one person during the same criminal transaction,and for killing elmer buitrago during the course of a kidnapping.despite the presentation of mitigating evidence during the punishment phase of his trial pippin was sentenced to death.the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence.pippin state.may.
pippin filed his original state habeas corpus petition on may.on july,he filed a second petition and supplemental memorandum of law raising several new claims.on august,the state trial court entered an order construing both the second application and the supplemental memorandum as successive petitions.in a per curiam order issued on february,the texas court of criminal appeals expressly adopted the trial court findings and conclusions,denied pippin first petition on the merits,and dismissed the other two as abuses of the writ.ex parte pippin,unpublished.the supreme court of the united states subsequently denied pippin petition for a writ of certiorari on october.pippin texas,d.
on june,pippin filed his original federal habeas petition in the district court for the southern district of texas.the district court subsequently granted pippin motion for appointment of new counsel on december,which resulted in an amended petition that was filed on may.in two separate memoranda and orders,issued on november,and january,respectively,the district court granted the respondent motion for summary judgment to deny habeas relief and sua sponte declined to issue a coa 
pippin now asks this court to grant a coa and raises several grounds already rejected by the district court for relief pippin was deprived of due process of law because the prosecutor allegedly withheld material evidence concerning the ballistics evidence in violation of brady maryland,d,because the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of felony murder,and because a juror was purportedly inattentive during his criminal trial pippin trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to adequately examine the ballistics evidence the trial court denied pippin constitutional right to confront adverse witnesses under the sixth amendment by admitting the dying declaration of elmer buitrago and the district court erred in refusing to allow pippin the opportunity to depose the prosecutor julian ramirez.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
pippin claim is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa because he filed his original federal habeas petition under on june,after the aedpa april,effective date.see fisher johnson,cir citing lindh murphy,d.under the aedpa,a state habeas petitioner may appeal a district court dismissal of his petition only if the district court or the court of appeals first issues a coa.c cockrell,d describing a coa as a jurisdictional prerequisite without which federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to rule on the merits of appeals from habeas petitioners neville dretke,cir.in determining whether to grant a petitioner request for a coa,the supreme court has instructed that a court of appeals should limit its examination to a threshold inquiry into the underlying merit of his claims,at.citing slack mcdaniel,d.this threshold inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.in fact,the statute forbids it.id.at.
a coa will be granted only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c.in order to meet this standard,pippin must demonstrate that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further,at.citing slack,at.the coa determination under c requires an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.id.at.although the issuance of a coa must not be pro forma or a matter of course,the petitioner satisfies the burden under c by demonstrat ing that reasonable jurists would find the district court assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.id.at.a claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree,after the coa has been granted and the case has received full consideration,that petitioner will not prevail.id.at.finally,any doubt as to whether a coa should issue in a case must be resolved in favor of the petitioner.medellin dretke,cir per curiam newton dretke,cir.
in determining whether the district court denial of pippin petition was debatable,we must keep in mind the deferential standard of review that the aedpa requires a district court to apply when considering a petition for habeas relief.see brown dretke,cir with respect to the review of factual findings,aedpa significantly restricts the scope of federal habeas review.see also miniel cockrell,cir.under the aedpa,a federal court is not to grant a writ of habeas corpus with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless it determines that the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a state court decision is contrary to supreme court precedent if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at a result opposite to that of the supreme court.williams taylor,d opinion of,interpreting the statutory language contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of.a state court decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law whenever the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case in an objectively unreasonable manner.young dretke,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord williams,at.an unreasonable application may also occur if the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from supreme court precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.young,at alteration in original quoting williams,at.
a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct unless the petitioner rebuts the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.e.this presumption of correctness attaches not only to explicit findings of fact,but also to unarticulated findings which are necessary to the state court conclusions of mixed law and fact.pondexter dretke,cir quoting valdez cockrell,cir.a writ of habeas corpus may issue if the state court adjudication of a claim resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
due process claims 
the brady claim 
pippin asserts that his constitutional rights were violated by the prosecutor alleged suppression of exculpatory evidence in violation of brady maryland,d.these allegations of prosecutorial misconduct involve the disputed contents of the state ballistics report in this case.at trial,houston police firearms examiner charles anderson testified about two sets of bullets one set was recovered from elmer buitrago body and one set from fabio buitrago body.in addition,anderson testified about cartridge cases recovered from the crime scene.anderson testified that the cartridge cases were all fired from the same gun.he also testified that two of the bullets found in the body of fabio buitrago were fired from the gun that fired one of the two bullets found in the body of elmer buitrago.during its,the defense recalled anderson,who then testified that two of the bullets recovered from elmer buitrago came from different guns.anderson explained that this fact was not clearly stated in his report,but that he had discussed this discrepancy with the prosecutor before he testified.
anderson affidavit stated that the defense ballistics expert floyd mcdonald had access to and examined the bullet fragments before trial.both experts concluded that the bullets were fired by two separate guns.the prosecutor julian ramirez has consistently asserted that he employed an policy with the defense during the course of this trial and relied upon the same written ballistics reports that were provided to the defense counsel,which did not clearly disclose the involvement of a second gun.
pippin now contends that the prosecutor withheld this information from the defense.thus,pippin asserts that this court should issue a coa because the district court resolution of his brady claim was debatable among jurists of reason.the texas court of criminal appeals held that pippin failed to establish the materiality of the evidence that two guns were involved.in resolving this claim of error,the court observed that failure to disclose evidence favorable to the defendant is constitutional error only if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.pippin state,slip op.at citing united states bagley,d.the court reasoned that defense counsel had learned about the evidence in time to anderson and the jury had elmer buitrago eyewitness statement identifying pippin as the shooter.id.at.therefore,the court found that pippin had failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different to support his brady claim.
although finding the facts somewhat unclear,the district court correctly focused on the state court resolution of the alleged brady violation to determine whether it was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.in examining the state court findings,the district court noted that while anderson ballistics report fails to explicitly mention the possibility of a second gun,the prosecution theory that pippin was responsible for both deaths does not necessarily conflict with the available evidence from the ballistics report according to the district court,the report did clearly state that anderson could not identify two of the bullets designated and from fabio buitrago body.the report also affirmatively indicated,however,that bullets and recovered from fabio buitrago body were fired from the same gun as one of the two bullets recovered from elmer buitrago body.
to establish a brady claim,the petitioner must demonstrate the prosecutor suppressed evidence,favorable to the defense,and material to guilt or punishment.brady,at.miller dretke,cir.the suppressed evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.united states bagley,d see also kyles whitley,d t he prosecution,which alone can know what is undisclosed,must be assigned the consequent responsibility to gauge the likely new effect of all such evidence and make disclosure when the point of reasonable probability is reached.pippin contends that the fact that the defense had a separate ballistics expert does not obviate the state affirmative obligation to disclose material exculpatory evidence under brady.the state argues,however,that the evidence that two guns had been used to shoot elmer buitrago was equally available to defense expert floyd mcdonald.see rector johnson,cir the state has no obligation to point the defense toward potentially exculpatory evidence when that evidence is either in the possession of the defendant or can be discovered by exercising due diligence.moreover,the state maintains that pippin arguments more accurately question the competence of his own expert witness,rather than demonstrate any negligent or intentional withholding of evidence on the part of the prosecution.
because the defense ballistics expert floyd mcdonald had full access to the ballistics evidence and an opportunity to conduct his own tests before trial,we conclude that the district court resolution of pippin brady claim is not debatable among jurists of reason.as the district court pointed out,notwithstanding the confusion in anderson report,the record does not show that the prosecution actually withheld any exculpatory evidence from the defense during the trial to satisfy the first prong of the brady inquiry.see united states agurs,d noting that there is no constitutional requirement that the prosecution make a complete and detailed accounting to the defense of all police investigatory work on a case quoting moore illinois,d.although the district court acknowledged that due process is offended when the prosecution withholds exculpatory evidence,the state bears no responsibility to direct the defense toward potentially exculpatory evidence that either is in the possession of the defense or can be discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence.bigby dretke,cir citing rector,at cir see also kutzner cockrell,cir explaining that defendant must bear the responsibility of failing to conduct a diligen
