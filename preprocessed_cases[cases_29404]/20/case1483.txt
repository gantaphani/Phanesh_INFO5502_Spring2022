petitioner lawrence reynolds was convicted and sentenced to death by an ohio jury for the murder of loretta foster.after exhausting his state court appeals,both direct and collateral,he filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court.the district court denied reynolds petition,and we now affirm the district court.
in the late afternoon or early evening of january,lawrence reynolds assaulted,robbed,and killed his neighbor,loretta foster,in her home.he took forty dollars in cash and a blank check from her purse,and left her body lying on the living room floor.later that same night,reynolds told two friends much of what he had done.uncertain whether to believe him,the two went to foster home,looked through the window,and saw the body.they alerted the police,who arrested reynolds early the next morning.
reynolds father consented to a search of his son bedroom.reynolds was years old at the time of his acts,and continued to live at home.the search revealed several items of physical evidence later used against reynolds at trial gloves and a camouflage jumpsuit,both smeared with blood of the same type as foster and containing fibers matching those from a red jacket found in her bedroom a piece of rope identical to that used on foster,stained with blood of her type and containing human hair matching her own a section of a tent pole,in keeping with what reynolds had told his friends he brought to foster house and a blank check drawn on foster account.an autopsy concluded that foster had died from strangulation.based on the color of the bruises on her wrists,the coroner testified that foster had been alive when tied up.the coroner was unable to find any physical evidence of sexual conduct.
while in jail,reynolds told a fellow inmate essentially the same story as he had told his friends,but with more,at times conflicting,details.for example,reynolds stated to the inmate that he had tried to stick his meat in her,and yet when the inmate questioned reynolds specifically on the matter,he denied trying to rape her.
an ohio jury convicted reynolds of aggravated robbery,aggravated burglary,kidnaping,and attempted rape,as well as aggravated murder of the type with four specifications attached.he was sentenced to years imprisonment and death.he unsuccessfully sought relief via direct appeal.state reynolds,wl ohio.july,aff,ohio,ohio,cert.denied,d.he was also unsuccessful in obtaining state relief and was denied an evidentiary hearing,which he sought in order to buttress his claims.state reynolds,summit county.com.pl,aff,wl ohio,juris.denied,ohio.reynolds did not file a murnahan motion,which is ohio vehicle for raising ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims.see state murnahan,ohio,syllabus.
on february,reynolds filed a federal habeas corpus petition raising claims.the petition was denied,and he now appeals this ruling,citing five issues for review.a certificate of appealability was granted on each of the five issues.
reynolds federal habeas petition was filed subsequent to the passage of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa in,and thus its provisions govern this court review.under aedpa,a federal court may not grant habeas relief unless the state court adjudication of the claim either 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.under the unreasonable application prong of this section,the prong most relevant to the instant case,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the decision applied a supreme court case incorrectly.price vincent,d.rather,i n order for a federal court to find a state court application unreasonable,the state court decision must have been more than incorrect or erroneous it must have been objectively unreasonable.wiggins smith,d.as this court has stated,a federal habeas court must ask whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively reasonable.if the federal court finds that,viewed objectively,the state court has correctly identified the governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applied that principle to the facts of the prisoner case,it may grant the writ.millender adams,cir.
in considering a district court decision to deny an evidentiary hearing,which we normally review for abuse of discretion,see white mitchell,cir,we must also keep the precepts of aedpa deference in mind.schriro landrigan,d because the deferential standards prescribed by control whether to grant habeas relief,a federal court must take into account those standards in deciding whether an evidentiary hearing is appropriate.
denial of evidentiary hearing 
reynolds principal argument on appeal is that he was improperly denied an evidentiary hearing,during both state and federal habeas proceedings,to adduce evidence in support of his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim and his claim regarding deficiencies in the trial court sentencing opinion.he relies primarily on two cases from outside this circuit in support siripongs calderon,cir in a capital case,a habeas petitioner who asserts a colorable claim to relief,and who has never been given the opportunity to develop the factual record on that claim,is entitled to an evidentiary hearing in federal court.and buenoano singletary,cir a federal court must hold an evidentiary hearing if the habeas petitioner did not receive a full and fair hearing in the state courts.the evidentiary hearing was required,reynolds maintains,because i n order for a reviewing court to determine whether trial counsel decisions were a result of a reasoned strategic decision not to present expert testimony or other mitigating evidence to the jury,the court must review trial counsel reasons for their failures,and t he only way to obtain this information is through discovery or an evidentiary hearing.appellant br.at.
a peculiar procedural twist seems at first blush to favor reynolds.the trial judge who presided over both the guilt and penalty phases of reynolds trial,judge schneiderman,was also assigned to reynolds proceedings.judge schneiderman scheduled an evidentiary hearing for march.in anticipation of the hearing,reynolds issued almost twenty subpoenas to various individuals and entities,such as the cuyohoga falls police department,cuyohoga falls general hospital,and even judge schneiderman himself based on reynolds allegations of improprieties in the preparation of the judge sentencing opinion.joint app x at.judge schneiderman became a potential witness by virtue of this subpoena,and thus he voluntarily recused himself from further proceedings and matters were reassigned to a different judge,judge hayes.judge hayes denied the evidentiary hearing that had been granted by his predecessor,and subsequently dismissed reynolds petition for relief.judge hayes denial of the evidentiary hearing was based on his finding that reynolds had been given ample time,id.at,to develop a factual basis for his ineffective assistance it in respect to how his alcoholism was handled at trial and mitigation,id.at,what further mitigating evidence generally might have been presented,id.at,or what further neurological testing could have been conducted on reynolds,id.at yet had come up with precious little to justify a hearing.reynolds now maintains that judge hayes decision was in error because 
p counsel had conducted extensive investigation in preparation for the hearing and was prepared to present a number of witnesses and experts,including a psychologist and neuropsychologist,to factually develop reynolds claims had an evidentiary hearing been granted testimony would have been presented of serious incidents of abuse in the reynolds home and of reynolds father serious alcohol problem.
appellant br.at.
judge hayes decision not to conduct an evidentiary hearing was reviewed by the ohio court of appeals.state reynolds,wl ohio,unpublished.the appeals court noted that w hen a new judge has been appointed after the recusal of the trial judge in a petition,it is incumbent on the new judge to consider all motions de novo.id.at citing state perdue,ohio app d.in other words,the appeals court held,the mere fact that judge schneiderman had originally scheduled an evidentiary hearing did not preclude judge hayes from making an independent determination that such a hearing was not ultimately required.as to the merits of judge hayes decision,the appeals court held that under ohio c,a petitioner is only entitled to an evidentiary hearing if he can show,in the first instance,substantive grounds for relief.see state jackson,ohio,before a hearing is granted,the petitioner bears the initial burden in a proceeding to submit evidentiary documents containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel and also that the defense was prejudiced by counsel ineffectiveness.emphasis added.because reynolds had made no threshold showing of these substantive grounds for relief nor had he come forward with any showing that his trial counsel actions materially prejudiced the outcome of the case,the appeals court concluded that judge hayes did not err in denying his request for an evidentiary hearing.
we now hold that reynolds is precluded from relief on his evidentiary hearing claim.first,as articulated by the ohio court of appeals,under ohio collateral review procedures,specifically ohio c,reynolds is not guaranteed an evidentiary hearing rather,he is only entitled to one upon a showing that he has substantive grounds for relief.jackson,at see also state kapper,ohio.reynolds puts the cart before the horse by arguing that evidence obtained from the people he intended to subpoena would have provided exactly such grounds for relief.the point is that he must make an initial evidentiary affidavits and the he has grounds for relief.and here,the state judge determined that this initial showing was insufficient,especially in light of the fact that reynolds had been given ample discovery time since the termination of his direct appeal to make the showing.
reynolds argument,at least with respect to the ineffective assistance claims,also fails for a second reason.judge hayes noted during state proceedings that e vidence outside the record will not guarantee a hearing,if the petition does not allege facts to show that the issue could not have been brought on direct appeal.joint app x at see also state perry,ohio,our statutes do not contemplate relitigation of those claims in postconviction proceedings where there are no allegations to show that they could not have been fully adjudicated by the judgment of conviction and an appeal therefrom.in this case,reynolds was represented by different counsel from his trial counsel when he sought direct appeal.as such,he had the duty to bring the instant ineffective assistance claims at that juncture,state lentz,ohio,and he fails to explain now why these claims were not already properly resolved,or why any new evidence he now hopes to use could not have been discovered at the time of his direct appeal.reynolds could have argued that his state appellate counsel was ineffective for not adequately evidence of his trial counsel inadequate performance,but he is procedurally defaulted from making such a claim because he failed to file a murnahan motion in state court,as noted in the procedural history above.
finally,reynolds claim fails due to the strictures of aedpa,as recently applied to the evidentiary hearing context in schriro.while it is true that a district court,sitting in federal habeas,has the power independently to grant an evidentiary hearing,the federal court decision owes considerable deference to that of the state courts on the same issue.at.here,it does not appear that reynolds is asking for an evidentiary hearing to present evidence any different from what he hoped to present to judge hayes almost a decade ago.since we do not find that judge hayes unreasonably denied the evidentiary hearing back then,it almost goes without saying that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying effectively the same evidentiary hearing now.even at the federal district court level,having had even more time to put on a case,reynolds appears unable to have marshaled evidence to convince the district court that an evidentiary hearing would be necessary,or that the state courts resolution of the matter had been unreasonable.he continues to assert that he needs the evidentiary hearing to factually develop his constitutional claims,but he has failed at every level to make a factual showing as opposed to conclusory statements as to why those claims merit development through the crucible of an official hearing.
at bottom,reynolds is asking us to accept the generalized proposition that a defendant sentenced to death should always be entitled to an evidentiary hearing on review that is,if he is denied one at the state level,then he must be granted one at the federal level.yet schriro expressly refutes this proposition.id.a district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing.we might be inclined to agree with reynolds if it were true that an evidentiary hearing were the sine qua non of and.but of course,there are other ways to present evidence,and as discussed above,an evidentiary hearing was decidedly not required for reynolds to be able to make an initial factual showing of his counsel deficiencies instead,affidavits and other forms of evidence would have sufficed.
we therefore affirm the district court denial of reynolds request for an evidentiary hearing.
failure to timely dismiss prospective juror for cause 
in his second claim,reynolds argues that statements made by officer john vanhyning,an ohio police officer,unconstitutionally tainted the jury venire.officer vanhyning was himself on the jury venire.he revealed during voir dire that he knew several of the police officers involved in reynolds case,including at least one,detective gay,who would be testifying against reynolds.when asked by the prosecutor whether he would be able to objectively evaluate gay testimony even though he knew gay,vanhyning did not directly answer the question,but rather said i have always found him to be completely truthful.later,when the prosecutor asked vanhyning if he thought it was problematic that he had worked with the prosecutor on previous occasions,vanhyning stated that he could remain prior to doing so noted how efficient the prosecutor was,and how the prosecutor demanded a lot from police officers before moving forward with a prosecution.after hearing more about the relationship between officer vanhyning and some of the members of the prosecution,the trial court excused him from the jury venire,noting 
well,you know,officer vanhyning,i think i am going to take the bull by the horn.i am going to excuse you.and i hope i do insult your integrity in any way,i do mean to do that.but you are pretty close to it,not because you are close to this case,but you are close to law enforcement,and it has been your whole life.
joint app x at.
reynolds now claims that this dismissal came too late.he argues that vanhyning statements,which were made in the presence of the entire jury venire,cast a sheen of credibility on the prosecutor by indicating how efficient he was and how completely truthful some of his testifying officers would be.reynolds points out that his defense counsel had previously moved to strike vanhyning for cause,but the court had denied the motion,and then during the subsequent voir dire vanhyning statements were heard by the entire jury venire.reynolds counsel did not,however,move to strike the entire venire based on those statements.
reynolds claim rests on a very tenuous theory,one which the district court labeled as a sub silentio argument that the trial court has a sua sponte duty to discharge the entire jury panel,even in the absence of a defense motion to that effect,at.we are inclined to agree.although vanhyning statements could theoretically have biased jurors in favor of the prosecution and its wit
