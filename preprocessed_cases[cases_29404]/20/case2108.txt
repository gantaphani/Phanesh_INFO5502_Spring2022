kevin rittenhouse appeals the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.in addition to arguing that the district court incorrectly denied his petition with respect to the two claims in the certificate of appealability,rittenhouse also asks us to amend the certificate to include two other claims.for the reasons stated below,we will not amend the certificate of appealability granted by the district court,and we deny rittenhouse petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
a jury found kevin rittenhouse guilty of three counts of first degree murder,three counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault,three counts of criminal sexual assault,one count of concealment of a homicidal death,and one count of obstruction of justice,in connection with the rape and murder of mal chaplin.the murder and sexual assault counts were based on rittenhouse criminal responsibility for the acts of shawn chaszar,who raped chaplin,and jeffery whitehead,who also raped and then murdered chaplin in an apartment in normal,illinois.at rittenhouse trial the state provided evidence indicating that rittenhouse was in the apartment while these crimes were being committed,that he witnessed whitehead and chaszar raping chaplin,and that he took affirmative steps to conceal chaplin rape and murder after the crimes were committed.rittenhouse was convicted by a jury and subsequently sentenced to consecutive terms of twenty years for one count of first degree murder and six years for each count of aggravated criminal sexual assault,for a total of years incarceration.
rittenhouse appealed to the illinois appellate court challenging the validity of his conviction and sentence.the appellate court rejected his claims.see people rittenhouse,d.rittenhouse then filed a petition for leave to appeal to the illinois supreme court,raising the same claims brought before the court of appeals.the illinois supreme court denied rittenhouse petition.see people rittenhouse.
rittenhouse next initiated collateral review proceedings by filing a petition in illinois state trial court,alleging that he was denied the effective assistance of trial and appellate counsel due to their failure to raise certain issues regarding the instructions given to the jury.he subsequently filed a supplemental petition as well.both of these petitions were denied.rittenhouse appealed the trial court ruling,asserting five different claims.the illinois appellate court affirmed the denial of rittenhouse petition.see people rittenhouse,d.petitioner again filed a petition for leave to appeal to the illinois supreme court,and that petition was subsequently denied.see people rittenhouse.
rittenhouse then filed the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the united states district court for the central district of illinois.in his petition,rittenhouse claimed that the trial court instructions on the charges of murder and sexual assault invaded the province of the jury and denied rittenhouse his due process rights under the fourteenth amendment he was denied effective assistance of counsel when counsel failed to notice and object to the improper instructions,and failed to offer an alternative instruction that did not contain a presumption of legal responsibility he was denied the right to effective assistance of trial counsel by counsel failure to adequately confer with him regarding a plea bargain offer and by failing to inform him that consecutive sentences were mandatory or allowed and the trial court refusal to instruct the jury on rittenhouse mere presence theory of defense was a denial of his fundamental right to due process and equal protection.
the district court denied rittenhouse petition for habeas corpus.in reaching this decision,the court concluded that rittenhouse challenge to the jury instructions on the charges of murder and sexual assault and his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel were procedurally defaulted.with regard to his two remaining claims,the district court found that the illinois appellate court analysis on these issues was neither an incorrect statement of supreme court precedent nor an unreasonable application of the law to the facts.rittenhouse,slip op.at.rittenhouse then filed a petition for a certificate of appealability,presenting two issues he wished to raise on appeal to this court that the trial court instructions on the charges of murder and sexual assault invaded the province of the jury and denied rittenhouse of his due process rights under the fourteenth amendment and that the trial court refusal to instruct the jury on rittenhouse mere presence theory of defense was a denial of his fundamental right of due process and equal protection under the fourteenth amendment.the district court granted rittenhouse petition for a certificate of appealability on these issues.see rittenhouse,slip op.at.
ii.analysis 
request for amendment of the certificate of appealability 
rittenhouse raises two other claims that are not included in the district court certificate of appealability.he asks us to consider his claims that he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel when his attorney failed to object to instructions that he contends contained a mandatory presumption of legal responsibility and he was deprived of the effective assistance of appellate counsel when his counsel did not raise an issue regarding the trial court failure to instruct the jury on his mere presence theory of defense.
in accordance with c,a habeas petitioner may appeal only those issues for which a certificate of appealability has been granted.see porter gramley,cir.thus,the state asks this court not to consider the two claims included in rittenhouse brief that were not encompassed by the certificate of appealability.this court has recently explained,however,that we shall continue to consider requests to amend a certificate of appealability even when they are presented in a petitioner briefs to this court.ouska,cir.a party can make such a request by specifically asking us to consider the issue in its brief or by simply including issues in its briefs that were not specified in the certificate.id.at.in this case,rittenhouse did both he included his additional claims in his initial brief without requesting that we amend the certificate,and in his reply brief,he explicitly asked us to consider these other issues.
in order to issue a certificate of appealability w here a district court has rejected a habeas petitioner constitutional claims on the merits,the showing required to satisfy c is straightforward the petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.slack mcdaniel,d.in this case,the district court rejected rittenhouse claim that he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel when his attorney failed to object to certain instructions that allegedly contained a mandatory presumption of legal responsibility.thus,rittenhouse must now demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court conclusion that he was not denied the effective assistance of trial counsel to be debatable or wrong.he has made no such showing.
rittenhouse first ineffective assistance claim stems from a phrase that was included in nine different instructions submitted to the jury at rittenhouse trial to which his trial counsel did not object 
to sustain the charge of criminal sexual assault as charged in count iv involving the penis of jeffery whitehead and vagina of mal chaplin,the state must prove the following propositions 
first that whitehead,one for whose conduct the defendant is legally responsible,committed an act of sexual penetration upon mal chaplin 
rittenhouse asserts that the emphasized language contains an improper presumption of legal responsibility and that this error is magnified by the fact that his culpability for the sexual assault and murder charges was based on a theory of legal accountability for the actions of whitehead and chaszar.thus,rittenhouse claimed before the illinois courts that he was provided with ineffective assistance of trial counsel when his counsel failed to
