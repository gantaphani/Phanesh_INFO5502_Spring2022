charles delaney iii,a massachusetts state prisoner,sought a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,but voluntarily withdrew his application when the commonwealth pointed out that it contained unexhausted claims.after pursuing all available state remedies,the petitioner returned to federal court.at that juncture,the court dismissed his new application as untimely under the limitation period enacted as part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat.
the petitioner appeals this order,asseverating that the district court erred in refusing to toll the limitation period during the pendency of his original federal habeas petition that absent such tolling the statutory limitation violates the suspension clause and that,in all events,the district court abused its discretion by failing to resuscitate his claim on equitable grounds.recent supreme court precedent holding that the relevant statutory provision,d,may not be tolled by the pendency of federal,as opposed to state,proceedings defeats the first of these asseverations.see duncan walker,d.the second fails on the law.the third fails on the facts even assuming,for argument sake,that equitable tolling is available in the precincts patrolled by section d a matter on which we take no district court supportably determined that the petitioner had not established a sufficiently compelling basis for remediation.consequently,we uphold the district court dismissal of the petitioner application for habeas relief.
background 
we retrace the relevant portions of the petitioner journey through the procedural labyrinth that typifies modern habeas litigation.the facts are essentially uncontested.
in,a massachusetts jury found the petitioner guilty of murder in the second degree.the trial judge sentenced him to life imprisonment.on direct review,his conviction was sequentially affirmed by the massachusetts appeals court and the supreme judicial court.see commonwealth delaney,aff.the conviction became final on september.
on february,ten months after the aedpa effective date,the petitioner for the first time asked the federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus.see.in this pro se petition petition,he reasserted various claims that he had presented to the state courts and added four new unexhausted claims.the commonwealth promptly moved to dismiss this mixed petition.see rose lundy,d holding that a federal habeas court ordinarily should not adjudicate a mixed petition,one containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims adelson dipaola,cir same.the petitioner countered by moving to dismiss the action without prejudice.the district court granted the latter motion on may.
on june,the petitioner returned to state court and filed a motion for a new trial that raised two ineffective assistance of counsel claims.these claims were not the claims previously asserted in petition,but,rather,were newly minted.the superior court denied this motion a few weeks later and,by march,the petitioner had exhausted all available state appellate remedies.
on april,the petitioner refiled for federal habeas relief,raising only the two ineffective assistance of counsel claims.citing d,the district court dismissed this application petition as untimely.when the petitioner moved for reconsideration,the court withheld a ruling and asked us to consider whether petition was a second or successive habeas petition,and thus subject to the gatekeeping requirement of b.see generally pratt united states,cir.following the reasoning explicated in slack mcdaniel,d,we advised the lower court that petition was not a second or successive petition and that,therefore,the gatekeeping regime did not apply.
the district court proceeded to deny the petitioner motion for reconsideration on the merits.the court then granted a certificate of appealability.see c.we augmented the issues,appointed counsel for the petitioner,consolidated the case for argument with a case containing a similar limitation issue,and heard oral argument on november.four days later,the supreme court granted certiorari to review the decision of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in walker artuz,cir,cert.granted sub nom.duncan walker,d.because duncan squarely raised the question of whether section d could be tolled by the pendency of federal,as well as state,proceedings,we stayed our hand.
the supreme court decided duncan on june.by order entered june,we vacated the stay previously entered in this case and the companion case.we resolved the companion case in an opinion filed on august,see neverson bissonnette,cir,and now decide the petitioner appeal.
ii.analysis 
congress enacted the aedpa on april,in part to combat increasingly pervasive abuses of the federal courts habeas jurisdiction.felker turpin,d.pertinently,the aedpa imposed a limitation period applicable to state prisoners habeas applications.see d.this period of limitation normally begins to accrue on the date on which the state court judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.id.d a.
the courts have determined that this language encompasses a grace period within which state prisoners may file federal habeas petitions to test the correctness of convictions that became final before the aedpa effective date.see gaskins duval,cir per curiam see also duncan.at stevens,concurring collecting cases to like effect from other circuits.accordingly,the petitioner had until april,to file an application for federal habeas relief.he docketed petition within that window of opportunity,but he voluntarily withdrew that petition.he did not propound petition until april,nearly a year after the grace period had run its course.hence,that petition was,as the district court ruled,absent some sufficiently excusatory circumstance.
the petitioner principal attempt to rescue his habeas application implicates d,which provides that t he time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under section d.but this provision is of no help to the petitioner although it plainly tolls the limitation period from and after june,the date upon which he moved for a new trial in state court,the period already had elapsed by that date.
in an attempt to overcome this obstacle,the petitioner contends that the reference in section d to other collateral review includes not only state collateral review proceedings but also federal habeas proceedings.if that were so,the pendency of petition would have tolled the limitation period from the date of filing february,to the date of dismissal may,and this hiatus,coupled with the tolling that accompanied the petitioner pursuit of remedies in the state courts during the period from june,through march,would have rendered petition timely,filed within one year of april,after subtracting tolled periods.as a first fallback position,the petitioner maintains that the statutory limitation period,if construed otherwise,violates the constitution.as a second fallback,he asserts that even if his reading of section d proves overly sanguine and the provision nonetheless is constitutional,the district judge erred in refusing to apply principles of equitable tolling to assure his day in court.we address each of these arguments.
statutory tolling.
the question of what congress meant when it wrote that the aedpa limitation period,d,would be tolled while a state prisoner pursued state or other collateral review,id.d,is no longer open.the duncan court made it crystal clear that the adjective state qualifies both of the phrases that follow.at.accordingly,section d,properly construed,toll s the limitation period for the pursuit of state remedies but not during the pendency of applications for federal review.id.it follows inexorably that an application for federal habeas corpus review is not an application for state or other collateral review within the meaning of d.id.at accord neverson,at.this means,of course,that the pendency of petition did not
