this case involves assessment of whether an appearance compelled by a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum by one federal district court to the custodian of an individual detained in another federal district on the basis of unrelated pending charges triggers the speedy trial act sta day arrest to indictment clock with respect to the charges in the jurisdiction that issued the writ.this appears to be a question of first impression.we hold that the sta was not triggered and affirm the decision of the district court denying the motion to dismiss the indictment for violation of the sta.
on may,a criminal complaint was filed in the district court for the district of maine against howard kelly.the complaint alleged that kelly had committed identity theft and aggravated identity theft in violation of a and a.an arrest warrant was issued the same day,but was not executed,as kelly was not in maine at the time.
kelly was in federal custody in new york on different charges.on october,a complaint had been filed in the western district of new york,alleging that kelly had knowingly and unlawfully escaped from a halfway house in that district earlier that month.kelly was arrested in new hampshire on that new york charge on may.the new hampshire district court held a detention hearing on may,and afterwards ordered that kelly be detained pending trial,and be committed to the custody of the attorney general for transport to the western district of new york to answer the indictment that issued in the western district on the same day.kelly was moved to new york and the new york case moved forward during the summer of.
back in maine,on september,the united states moved for a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum,requesting kelly presence for an initial appearance on october,to respond to the maine federal criminal complaint.the writ was granted by the maine district court the next day.kelly was transported to maine on october,under the writ,and appeared before the maine court.he waived his right to a hearing and consented to being detained in the district of maine.he remained in custody in maine until,when he was transported to new york.he was in new york when he was indicted in maine on the charges in this case on december.
the prosecution and defense filed,in the maine action,two joint motions to exclude time under the sta,on november and december.these motions represented that the defendant wishes to seek additional time to reach an alternate resolution to this case that would negate the need for an indictment,and that the defendant is facing charges in another jurisdiction new york and wishes to seek additional time to reach an alternate resolution to those cases.the court allowed the motions and its orders excluded the time between november,and january,from the sta calculation 
kelly was convicted in new york and sentenced to months imprisonment on may.he was returned to maine on july,and was arraigned there on july.
upon his return to maine,various proceedings took place before the district court.of particular relevance to this appeal is kelly motion,filed on september,for dismissal of the maine federal indictment based on an alleged sta violation.kelly argued that his initial maine appearance took place on october,while the indictment was not issued until december,and that this violated the sta requirement that the indictment issue within days from the date on which such individual was arrested or served with a summons in connection with such charges.b emphasis added.the government opposed the motion and kelly requested a hearing,which was held on december.
the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation on december,recommending that kelly motion to dismiss the indictment be denied.the magistrate judge first noted that f rom all that appears in the record,this defendant was never arrested or served with a summons in connection with the maine charge.thus,at least technically,the act appears not to apply at all.the magistrate judge further noted that even if the sta did apply,it had not been violated,because the time spent in maine was devoted to an attempt to resolve the new york charge along with the maine charge,and as a result was excludable delay.see h excluding a ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant,including but not limited to eight particular examples.despite kelly objection,the district court adopted the report and recommendation on march,explaining that the delay in this maine case resulted from the defendant attempt to resolve,while here,the new york escape charge.
on may,kelly entered a conditional guilty plea on the maine charges,but reserved his right to challenge the march order denying his motion to dismiss the indictment based on the purported sta violation.the district court accepted the plea,and kelly was sentenced to a term of months on november.
kelly now appeals,raising a single challenge that the delay between his appearance in maine on october,pursuant to the writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum,and the issuance of the maine indictment on december,violated the sta and required dismissal of the indictment,pursuant to b,a.
because this case involves interaction between the sta and writs of habeas corpus ad prosequendum,some context for each may be of use.
a.the speedy trial act 
enacted in and amended in,the sta imposes a variety of time limitations designed to ensure a speedy trial.first,the sta has a day arrest to indictment requirement,which requires a ny information or indictment charging an individual with the commission of an offense to be filed within thirty days from the date on which such individual was arrested or served with a summons in connection with such charges.b.the purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the defendant is not held under an arrest warrant for an excessive period without receiving formal notice of the charge against which he must prepare to defend himself.united states spagnuolo,cir quoting united states meade,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
second,the act imposes a separate day indictment to trial requirement,requiring that a trial commence within seventy days from the filing date and making public of the information or indictment,or from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending,whichever date last occurs.c.
not every calendar day constitutes a day for purposes of the sta,however certain periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time under both the arrest to indictment and indictment to trial sections.id.h.for example,delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant,such as that resulting from the filing of pretrial motions or the court consideration of plea agreements,is excluded.id.h.the parties may request continuances,which the court may grant if consideration of several factors supports granting such a continuance.id.h.
if an indictment or information is not filed within the day limit,the court must dismiss the charges,either with or without prejudice,based upon consideration of several factors.id.a.a similar provision requires dismissal if the day indictment to trial limit is violated.id.a.
the act also addresses individuals charged with federal crimes who are already serving a term of imprisonment.section j provides that i f the attorney for the government knows that a person charged with an offense is serving a term of imprisonment in any penal institution,he shall promptly a undertake to obtain the presence of the prisoner for trial or b cause a detainer to be filed regarding the prisoner.id.j.when the person having custody of the prisoner receives a properly supported request for temporary custody of such prisoner for trial,the prisoner shall be made available to that attorney for the government id.j.
