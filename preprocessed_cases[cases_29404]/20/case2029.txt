after the supreme court of indiana affirmed the murder conviction and death sentence of,akeem the united states district court for the northern district of indiana granted his petition for writ of habeas corpus,finding that the state trial court violated his constitutional equal protection and due process rights during jury selection.the district court vacated petitioner conviction and sentence and ordered him released unless retried.on behalf of,superintendent cecil davis,the state of indiana appeals the district court order granting habeas relief.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
we presume the facts underlying petitioner conviction are stated correctly in the record of the state court proceedings.the indiana supreme court recited those facts as follows 
in the early morning hours of june,petitioner,armed with a handgun,jemelle joshua,armed with a shotgun,and three others set out to steal audio and video equipment from the basement of school teacher michael richardson.petitioner and joshua were admitted to richardson home and their three accomplices followed them in.besides richardson,they encountered a number of children and adults,including richardson sister,debra rice,and robert hollins.while petitioner held his gun to richardson head and joshua held rice,their accomplices headed for the basement.hollins intercepted them and began to wrestle with one of them in the kitchen.petitioner responded by shooting hollins in the back.
the electronic equipment proved too difficult to remove and petitioner ordered the occupants of the house to lie down.rice attempted to escape and joshua shot her in the chest.as the invaders left the home,petitioner shot each of hollins,rice and richardson once in the head despite richardson plea,please do kill me.a few hours later,petitioner would tell his sister that he shot the victims so there would be any witnesses.

petitioner,who is,was charged with three counts of murder and felony murder in lake county,indiana.code.the prosecution further alleged two aggravating factors for which it sought the death penalty i intentional killing during the course of a robbery.code b f and ii commission of multiple murders.code b.
during a pretrial hearing on january,judge james letsinger outlined procedures for jury selection,including peremptory challenges,intended to ensure compliance with the due process and equal protection requirements of batson kentucky,d,and its progeny.the following exchange took place between judge letsinger and trial counsel for petitioner 
trial court from the first peremptory strike,each side is going to have to have some reason for striking that person.i mean there almost no,no person on a jury that is protected now.i mean they extended it to everything.
defense counsel so what i hearing from the court is the peremptory challenges have now all been converted to challenges for cause 
trial court almost.almost.in the words of splunge you got to have some plausible reason supported by the record,supported by the record,plausible reason that is nonracial,nonreligious,language.they wo even wo even allow body language.splunge struck a black juror because she did understand the burden of proof in a criminal case,when actually her answers were the same as everybody else answers.it had to be supported by the record.
during voir dire on january,the trial court sua sponte instructed counsel for each party to present its peremptory challenges along with a neutral reason for each.the trial court excused two individuals after accepting the prosecution stated reasons for challenging them,and another two after accepting petitioner stated reasons for challenging.however,the trial court rejected petitioner stated reasons for five of his seven total challenges,even though the prosecution raised no objection to petitioner challenges.with respect to four of those five,petitioner argued on direct appeal to the indiana supreme court that the trial court improperly rejected his reasons for peremptorily challenging them.in its opinion affirming petitioner conviction and death sentence,indiana supreme court synopsized the trial court rejection of those four challenges as follows 
the defense indicated that it sought to strike prospective juror sosnawski,a white male,because in defense counsel discussions with him,defense counsel did get the impression that he really understood what was going on.finding impressions to be a terrible reason and a euphemism presumably for a racially motivated strike,the trial court found the explanation not race neutral and refused to excuse sosnawski.
the defense indicated that it sought to strike prospective juror wilson,a white male,because defense counsel general impression was,number one,that he was not being honest two,that his responses left defense counsel with the impression that this gentleman was maybe not being entirely honest with the trial court.because counsel was not able to point to a question and answer in the record that gives a good reason for striking wilson from the jury,the trial court refused to excuse wilson.
the defense indicated that it sought to strike prospective juror bobalik,a white female,because she failed to understand the presumption of innocence.during voir dire,defense counsel had asked all the members of the panel who believed that the defendant was not guilty at that point to raise their hands.bobalik was apparently the only juror who did not raise his or her hand.the trial court rejected this reason,commenting that counsel has asked a trick question,the kind that gets students flunked out of law school.because counsel did not have a record showing that bobalik could not give the defendant the presumption of innocence,the trial court refused to excuse bobalik.
the defense indicated that it sought to strike prospective juror brandys,a white female,because she did understand that the defendant has the absolute right not to testify and that s he clearly indicated in two points,one that she wanted the defendant to testify two,that she thinks defense attorneys are slicksters.the state argued that brandys did properly understand the presumption of innocence.concluding that most people want the defendant to testify and do understand that they have a constitutional right not to unless it is explained to them and that defense counsel had introduced the word slickster,not brandys,the trial court refused to excuse brandys.
williams,at.
at the trial conclusion,the jury found petitioner guilty on all counts but,deadlocked as to his punishment,it was unable to return a sentencing verdict.instead,the trial court sentenced petitioner to death on march.on direct appeal of the conviction and sentence before the indiana supreme court,petitioner challenged,inter alia,the trial court denial of his peremptory challenges.after the indiana supreme court affirmed his conviction and sentence,williams,at,it denied petitioner request for rehearing,and the united states supreme court denied his petition for writ of certiorari.williams indiana,d.petitioner subsequently filed,and the lake county superior court denied,a petition for relief raising various issues not directly relevant to our disposition of this matter.the indiana supreme court affirmed the denial of relief in williams state,and declined to rehear the matter,and once more the united states supreme court denied petitioner petition for writ of certiorari in williams indiana,d.
in december,petitioner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the northern district of indiana seeking federal collateral review of his conviction and death sentence.petitioner claimed violations of his constitutional rights as a result of i the trial court denial of his peremptory challenges and the indiana supreme court failure to apply purkett elem,d,in reviewing that denial ii the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel iii prosecutorial misconduct at trial iv the trial court use of a psychological questionnaire at sentencing and v the trial court limitation of funds available to petitioner to develop mitigation evidence
