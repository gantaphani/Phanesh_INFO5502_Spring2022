opinion of the court 
the district court conditionally granted a writ of habeas corpus to christopher boyd.the appealed,and after a panel heard argument,the court ordered rehearing en banc.we will reverse the district court judgment and remand to a different district court judge for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the facts of this case and the basis of our jurisdiction are set forth in parts i and ii of judge hardiman opinion.for the reasons given in part iii of that opinion,we conclude boyd claim was properly exhausted and has not been procedurally defaulted.see cone bell,d.
furthermore,a majority of the court finds that boyd claim is governed by the test for ineffective assistance of counsel enunciated in strickland washington,d it is not barred by tollett henderson,d,or mabry johnson,d.
although the district court correctly identified the strickland test as the rule of decision,it erred in reviewing boyd claim de novo.as explained in chief judge scirica opinion,because the state courts adjudicated boyd claim on the merits,federal habeas relief is subject to the standards prescribed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d.accordingly,we will remand for the district court to apply the proper aedpa analysis,consistent with the instructions in chief judge scirica opinion.see chief judge scirica op.at.
a further word is needed about the appropriate use of evidentiary hearings.the magistrate judge in this case conducted such a hearing,and both the magistrate judge and the district court relied on the evidence adduced therein.neither they,nor the parties,appear to have queried whether the hearing was permissible under e.as detailed in chief judge scirica opinion,on remand we instruct the district court to address this question in the first instance,and to consider the evidence from the magistrate judge hearing only if that hearing was consistent with aedpa statutory strictures.
for reasons also given by chief judge scirica,we conclude the district court improperly a cold magistrate judge finding that boyd had not demonstrated prejudice as required by strickland.although we have no doubts about the district court judge fairness,we will remand to a different judge to ensure the appearance of impartiality.if the district court again reaches the prejudice prong of the strickland test,it should hold its own hearing subject again to e if it declines to accept the magistrate judge finding.
i agree with judge hardiman that boyd did not procedurally default his claim.when a state court refuses to readjudicate a claim on the ground that it has been previously determined,the court decision does not indicate that the claim has been procedurally defaulted.to the contrary,it provides strong evidence that the claim has already been given full consideration by the state courts and thus is ripe for federal adjudication.cone bell,d.accordingly,i join part iii of judge hardiman opinion.
in my view,however,tollett henderson,d,and mabry johnson,d,do not dispose of this case.instead,i believe the test for ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in strickland washington,d,provides the rule of decision,as the magistrate judge and district court determined.at the same time,however,i believe the district court erred in reviewing boyd ineffective assistance of counsel claim under a de novo standard.because the pennsylvania superior court adjudicated boyd claim on the merits,habeas relief is subject to the restrictions imposed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d.accordingly,i would reverse and remand with instructions for the district court to apply the proper aedpa standards.
aedpa provides 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.as the supreme court has explained,aedpa place d a new constraint on the power of a federal habeas court to grant a state prisoner application for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to claims adjudicated on the merits in state court.terry williams taylor,d majority opinion of.accordingly,as a threshold matter,in order to determine whether the constraints of d apply to federal review of boyd petition,we must determine whether the state courts decided his claim on the merits.see chadwick janecka,cir.if the state courts decided a given claim on the merits,our standard of review is narrow we may not grant the writ unless the adjudication of that claim meets one of the conditions set forth in d or d.id.at.conversely,w e review de novo issues that the state court did not decide on the merits.bond beard,cir.the district court concluded without elaboration that it would review boyd petition de novo as the state courts failed to accurately construe petitioner claim against trial counsel.boyd nish,wl,at,

boyd has claimed his trial counsel was ineffective on two different grounds.the first ground,initially presented on direct appeal in pennsylvania superior court,was that trial counsel allegedly failed to give boyd sufficient advice about the sentencing guidelines to allow him to make an informed decision about whether to accept the commonwealth initial plea offer.boyd does not dispute that the pennsylvania superior court recognized this claim and decided it on the merits for purposes of d on its way to denying this claim,the pennsylvania superior court found,as a matter of fact,that boyd counsel fully informed boyd about the availability of the original plea offer,but boyd decided to take his chances on the discretion of the court as to sentencing.boyd contests this factual finding.
boyd first presented the second ground for trial counsel alleged ineffectiveness in his pcra petition,on state collateral review,arguing that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by rejecting the initial plea offer before discussing it with him.the pcra court did not recognize that boyd claim was different from the one he had presented on direct appeal.it believed boyd was again asserting that guilty plea counsel was ineffective for advising defendant to reject a negotiated plea offer of four to eight years in light of the seriousness of the crimes charged,rather than for rejecting the offer before consulting boyd.given this mistaken formulation,it is not surprising that the pcra court concluded defendant raised the exact issue on direct appeal that he is now raising in his pcra petition and,accordingly,dismissed the claim as previously litigated.the commonwealth concedes the pcra court misidentified boyd ineffectiveness claim.commonwealth suppl.br.see also id.at t he pcra court incorrectly described the ineffectiveness claim and never correctly identifies it.
on pcra appeal,however,the pennsylvania superior court correctly identified boyd claim,accurately describing the question presented as whether trial counsel rejection of the initial offer before discussing it with boyd rendered his assistance ineffective.the pennsylvania superior court correctly contrasted this claim with boyd claim on direct appeal that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to discuss a plea agreement in which he would have received a sentence in the mitigated range of the sentencing guidelines.the highest state court to review boyd petition,therefore,did not misunderst and the nature of his pcra claim.chadwick,at.the pennsylvania superior court rejected the pcra claim on the basis of the previously litigated rule but that disposition can not mean the pennsylvania superior court thought the claim was previously litigated,since as noted,that court,unlike the pcra court,correctly distinguished between the pcra and claims.
instead,the superior court looked back to its opinion and saw that it had already rejected the factual predicate of boyd pcra claim.boyd claim that trial counsel was ineffective for rejecting an earlier plea offer before discussing it with him contains both factual and legal elements,and boyd must establish both in order to prevail.first,he must show that,as a matter of fact,his trial counsel had rejected the initial plea offer before boyd had an opportunity to consider it.second,he must demonstrate that this factual state of affairs amounted legally to ineffective assistance of counsel,that is,that such behavior by boyd counsel was constitutionally deficient and prejudiced him the pennsylvania superior court found boyd could not establish the factual element of his claim because the court had already found on direct appeal that trial counsel fully informed boyd about the availability of the original plea offer,but boyd decided to take his chances on the discretion of the court as to sentencing.accordingly,the pennsylvania superior court adjudicated boyd pcra claim on the merits,rejecting it because the court had rejected its factual predicate at an earlier stage of the litigation.the pennsylvania superior court therefore had no occasion to reach the legal question whether,if trial counsel had rejected the offer before consulting boyd,such conduct would constitute ineffective assistance.
whether the pennsylvania superior court factual determination is unreasonable under d deferential standard is distinct from the threshold question of whether that standard is applicable in the first place.see teti,at t he adequacy of the procedures and of the decision are addressed through the lens of d,not as a threshold matter.the state courts rejection of boyd ineffective assistance of counsel claim is entitled to aedpa deference because it is an adjudication on the merits.the pennsylvania superior court recognized the distinct nature of boyd pcra claim.the pennsylvania superior court disposed of boyd claim on factual rather than legal grounds,but this means only that it is d that applies to federal review of the claim the pennsylvania superior court relied on a finding made at a previous stage in the litigation,but this does not prevent its decision from being an adjudication on the merits.it means only that federal courts reviewing boyd habeas petition should examine the superior court opinion on direct appeal,as well as its opinion on collateral review,in order to determine whether the adjudication of boyd claim was unreasonable.
since the state courts decided both variations of boyd ineffective assistance of counsel claim on the merits,boyd is eligible for relief only if he can satisfy the standards imposed by d.accordingly,the district court erred in exercising de novo review of boyd claim.i would reverse and remand with instructions for the district court to apply the proper aedpa standards.see terry williams,at.describing the difference between d standards and de novo review.
in the course of this appeal,other issues have arisen that should be dealt with on remand.one issue involves the federal evidentiary hearing held by the magistrate judge.although both the magistrate judge and district court relied on testimony from that hearing,neither the magistrate judge report and recommendation nor the district court opinion appeared to examine whether the hearing complied with aedpa,e.that section provides 
if the applicant for a writ of habeas corpus has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings,the federal court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows that 
a the claim relies on 
i a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable or 
ii a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence and 
b the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
as boyd does not contend that he can fulfill the conditions of either e a or b,the section opening clause is dispositive.if boyd failed to develop the factual basis of his claim in state court,then he should not receive a federal evidentiary hearing.
in construing this opening clause,the supreme court has stated that t he purpose of the fault component of failed is to ensure the prisoner undertakes his own diligent search for evidence.michael williams taylor,d.boyd argues that he was sufficiently diligent in seeking an evidentiary hearing in state court,and that e is therefore no obstacle to the magistrate judge hearing.see id.at.if there has been no lack of diligence at the relevant stages in the state proceedings,the prisoner has not failed to develop the facts under e opening clause,and he will be excused from showing compliance with the balance of the subsection requirements.the michael williams court did not exhaustively explain what a petitioner must do to be deemed diligent under the statute,but it did state that d iligence will require in the usual case that the prisoner,at a minimum,seek an evidentiary hearing in state court in the manner prescribed by state law.id.
on remand,i would instruct the district court to decide in the first instance whether boyd efforts to obtain a evidentiary hearing were sufficient to allow a federal hearing.if the court finds boyd satisfied the diligence requirements of e opening clause,it may again rely on the evidence adduced in the magistrate judge earlier hearing otherwise,this evidence should be excluded.
the magistrate judge hearing,if permissible,raises another issue.we have held that a district court may not reject a finding of fact by a magistrate judge without an evidentiary hearing,where the finding is based on the credibility of a witness testifying before the magistrate judge and the finding is dispositive of an application for relief involving the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant.hill beyer,cir citing united states raddatz,d.this rule is grounded,at least in part,on prudential reasons.our judicial system affords deference to the finder of fact who hears the live testimony of witnesses because of the opportunity to judge the credibility of those witnesses.id.although boyd had testified at the evidentiary hearing held by the magistrate judge that he would have accepted the initial offer had he been adequately advised by trial counsel,the magistrate judge concluded that was not,in fact,the case.this finding necessarily implied a determination that boyd testimony was not credible.applying a de novo standard of review,the district court,without holding a hearing of its own,rejected the magistrate judge determination and found that boyd had satisfied the prejudice prong of strickland.boyd,wl,at.i would hold that,if the district court again reaches the prejudice prong of the strickland test after applying the deferential standards of d,it should hold its own evidentiary hearing if it declines to adopt the magistrate judge finding 
the court of appeals for the second circuit reached the same conclusion on a similar set of facts.cullen united states,cir.petitioner cullen had been tried and convicted of drug offenses and sought habeas relief on the ground that his trial counsel had failed to advise him adequately with respect to a plea bargain offer that,if accepted,would have resulted in a shorter sentence.the magistrate judge found that counsel had performed deficiently and that this performance had prejudiced cullen,noting that cullen testified that if defense counsel had discussed the sentencing guidelines he would have pleaded guilty.id.at.the district court agreed as to the prong,but rejected,without taking testimony,the magistrate judge prejudice finding based in part on the fact that cullen had adamantly protested his innocence.id.accordingly,the district court denied the writ.
the second circuit vacated and remanded.although the district court had characterized the issue as a matter of law,the second circuit noted that the prejudice question hinged on an essentially factual determination.id.at see id.t he determination of the likelihood that cullen would have accepted the plea bargain if he had been fully informed of its terms and accurately advised of the likely sentencing ranges under the plea bargain and upon conviction after trial was,like all predictions of what might have been,a factual issue,albeit a hypothetical one.the district court had not simply asserted that it disbelieved cullen testimony it had pointed to other evidence,like his claims of innocence,that weighed against that testimony.nonetheless,the second circuit recognized that the prejudice determination necessarily involved a credibility determination,id.at,and that pieces of evidence extrinsic to cullen statement,like his claims of innocence and the disparity between the guideline range cullen faced and the range as represented by defense counsel,were factor s bearing upon cullen credibility.id.at.accordingly,under the line of precedent including the supreme court decision in united states raddatz and our decision in hill beyer,see cullen,at,the second circuit vacated the district court judgment and remanded,so that,if the district court again declines to accept any credibility findings made based on live testimony before the magistrate judge,there would be an opportunity for cullen credibility to be assessed after the district court has seen and heard him testify.id.at.
cullen is instructive in another respect as well.the second circuit remand order assigned the case to a different district court judge.i would do the same here.this reassignment is dictated solely by concerns about the appearance of inherent in the procedural posture of the case,as cullen recognized 
for these reasons,i would reverse and remand to a different district court judge 
in reviewing judge hardiman opinion,it is important to note that judge hardiman never denies that boyd counsel did not inform boyd of the commonwealth plea offer before boyd pled guilty that judge hardiman never denies that counsel has an obligation to directly inform a defendant of a proffered plea agreement that judge hardiman never flatly states that failure to advise a client of a plea offer is ineffective assistance of counsel that there is nothing in the record to support the state court assumption and it is nothing short of an assumption that boyd knew about the initial plea offer yet decided to take his chances with the discretion of the court and that the majority of the en banc court has not adopted nor endorsed judge hardiman view of the effect of tollett and mabry.
the principal issue raised on this appeal is whether,as the district court found,trial counsel for the defendant christopher boyd was ineffective when he failed to communicate directly to boyd a plea offer of to years or to years made by the commonwealth.the petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by boyd,who was sentenced to to years,alleged that t he conviction was obtained and sentence imposed in violation of the sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel at all critical stages the petitioner alleges that trial counsel failed to communicate a favorable plea agreement before rejecting it that trial counsel failed to discuss a favorable plea agreement before rejecting it.the petitioner alleges he would have accepted the year plea had it been presented to him for consideration before the lawyer rejected it.petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to at,boyd warden,sci waymart.
the magistrate judge to whom the district court referred the petition for habeas corpus found,after an evidentiary hearing,that trial counsel did in fact reject the commonwealth plea offer without the prior consent of petitioner,app.at emphasis in original,although the magistrate judge recommended denial of the petition.the district court,in ruling on the petition for habeas corpus,agreed,holding,based on undisputed facts this court finds that trial counsel did not communicate the plea offer to petitioner before rejecting the plea and thus failed to act as counsel as guaranteed under the sixth amendment.app.at.
the commonwealth appealed to this court and listed as one of the three issues presented whether plea counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to convey the original plea offer directly to boyd appellants br.at.in its supplemental brief filed at our direction after we granted en banc hearing,the commonwealth listed as one of the issues i f trial counsel communicated the plea offer to boyd not directly,but only through boyd mother,would this in itself amount to ineffective assistance of counsel supp.br.for appellants at.judge hardiman never answers this question.to reach the answer,we must review the proceedings that have landed a young man in prison for the last seven years.
judge hardiman opinion concedes that the extensive briefing and oral argument presented to the court en banc focused entirely on the substantive issue,whether sciolla,boyd trial counsel,was ineffective.hardiman op.at nonetheless,judge hardiman opinion concludes that the adequacy of sciolla representation with respect to the commonwealth initial guilty plea offer is immaterial,hardiman op.at,and,in so concluding substantially curtails the scope and effect of strickland.
backgrounda.the original offense 
judge hardiman opinion accurately describes the facts relating to the commission of the offense.boyd did indeed commit a grievous assault on jones,and it can not be excused or mitigated by the fact that,as boyd later told the police,jones threatened that if boyd did not pay the bet,jones would kill boyd parents.app.at.there is no question that boyd was appropriately charged with aggravated assault,possession of a weapon,and related offenses.it is the proceedings thereafter that are at the heart of the issue before us.
b.the guilty plea 
boyd parents retained attorney guy sciolla to represent boyd.at all relevant times boyd was an adult and was never held to be mentally incompetent.the commonwealth does not dispute that there was never an issue regarding competency.the assistant district attorney ada assigned to the case extended a plea offer to sciolla,which called for a term of imprisonment of four to eight or four to ten years.sciolla rejected the offer,telling the ada that it was unacceptable.app.at.after rejecting the offer,sciolla called boyd boyd mother,told her about the plea offer,and stated that he had already rejected the offer when asked at the hearing before the magistrate judge whether he had already rejected the plea bargain offer prior to the conversation with boyd,sciolla testified,i had.app.at see also app.at.
it is undisputed that sciolla did not communicate the offer directly to.at judge hardiman states that the state court found that sciolla informed boyd of the initial plea offer and boyd chose not to accept it.hardiman op.at.he never acknowledges that the state court was for boyd disastrously wrong.when asked under oath by boyd federal habeas counsel if sciolla ever communicated the plea offer directly to defendant boyd,sciolla said,n app.at when sciolla was asked under oath by the magistrate judge whether he ever discuss ed the four to eight year plea offer with boyd,sciolla said that he did not he only told boyd about the offer.app.at boyd then testified under oath that sciolla at no time discussed with him directly and personally that the commonwealth had made an offer of four to eight or four to ten years.app.at.
there is no support in the record for the commonwealth statement that t he offer was discussed with boyd directly at several points later in the proceedings.appellants br.at.the only citation to the record that bears on this statement is the colloquy referred to in footnote.
in addition,sciolla did not discuss with boyd the statutory maximum sentence that he could receive.sciolla did not discuss with boyd or the boyd family the pennsylvania sentencing guidelines,including possible sentencing enhancements and aggravating factors.he never told boyd that he could receive a sentence as high as years imprisonment,which was the statutory maximum.sciolla did not counsel boyd about the plea bargain offer,statutory maximum penalty,sentencing guidelines,and how those factors should impact boyd decision whether to accept the plea bargain,enter an open plea,or go to trial.in fact,what sciolla did tell boyd was that he could receive a sentence of four to eight years imprisonment.sciolla did not tell boyd that he could get more than four to eight years imprisonment.sciolla also testified that he is not even sure boyd did participate in the plea decision,but to the extent that boyd did participate,the only information he had was that he could get four to eight years imprisonment.app.at.
the commonwealth states the plea agreement remained open,a statement which it has not supported by any written communication by it nor by any affidavit by the prosecutor sciolla testified that he did not know if it was still an open offer after he had rejected it.judge hardiman opinion states there is a dispute regarding whether the offer remained open after sciolla rejected it.hardiman op.at.even if the commonwealth had been willing to the offer after sciolla rejected it but before the guilty plea hearing,boyd did not know it because sciolla never told him and there was no mention of an outstanding offer at the guilty plea hearing or sentencing.the reason it is irrelevant whether the offer was still technically open is because it was never discussed with boyd.the commonwealth does not argue otherwise.
on october,following sciolla advice,boyd entered an open guilty plea to aggravated assault and possession of an instrument of crime.the commonwealth agreed to enter a nolle prosequi to the other charged offenses.at the plea colloquy,the trial court asked boyd if he had a chance to talk to sciolla about whether he wanted to plead guilty,and boyd said that he had.the court did not tell boyd,as it likely had no reason to know,that the commonwealth had made a plea offer to boyd,nor did it comment on whether any such offer was still open.rather,the court informed boyd that t here is no plea agreement in this case app.at.the court informed boyd that the statutory maximum sentence was years.the court did not inform boyd before the guilty plea what the sentencing guidelines prescribed for his charged offenses,nor did the court explain the applicability of aggravating circumstances to boyd case.the court never asked boyd whether sciolla had explained to him the potential statutory maximum sentence,the sentencing guidelines,or the concept of aggravating circumstances.likewise,the court never asked sciolla whether he had counseled boyd in those respects.sciolla testified that even though boyd walked through the plea colloquy,he did not seem to fully grasp the seriousness of the potential sentence.app.at.
sentencing 
the trial court applied the aggravated sentencing guideline range applicable when an offense involved the use of a deadly weapon,in this case a baseball bat.the court sentenced boyd to a sentence of months imprisonment on the assault charge and months on the weapon possession charge,to be served consecutively.the resulting sentence was months,or eight to years imprisonment.this must be compared to the or months months sentence had the plea offer been accepted.
procedural history 
boyd timely filed a direct appeal in the pennsylvania superior court,alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.boyd was not represented by sciolla on that appeal.in the direct appeal to the superior court,boyd attached an affidavit to appellate counsel brief,in which he stated sciolla did not discuss the offer directly with me on that date or at any other time.app.at,the brief also raised arguments regarding sciolla failure to tell boyd about the sentencing guidelines and statutory maximum,as well as his failure to counsel boyd in any meaningful way about what his options were with respect to the guilty plea.app.at arguing that a hearing was necessary to determine why sciolla elected not to discuss boyd potential sentence under the guidelines,and why trial counsel for no apparent rational reason chose to advise boyd not to take the offer that was the best chance he had at reduced jail time.
in an opinion dated november,on boyd direct appeal,the superior court affirmed boyd judgment of sentence.although the superior court acknowledged the existence of boyd affidavit that was attached to boyd appellate brief,it did not refer to the portion of boyd affidavit quoted above.the court found that sciolla communicated the plea offer to boyd and fully informed boyd about the availability of the original plea offer.app.at.this erroneous statement misinterprets or misstates the record.
in his brief to the superior court,boyd had cited commonwealth napper,in support of his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.napper had been convicted of two counts of aggravated robbery and sentenced to two consecutive terms of five to twenty years imprisonment.the trial court denied napper petition for relief that was based upon counsel ineffectiveness in failing to fully advise napper of the availability of a plea bargain offer.the superior court reversed,reasoning that counsel had failed to make clear to his client the risks,hazards or prospects of the case.id.at.
in its opinion on boyd direct appeal,the superior court recognized that in napper,counsel all but admitted that he had been ineffective in failing to advise napper fully on the availability of a plea bargain app.at.the court sought to distinguish napper by the statement,amazing under the circumstances,that boyd counsel informed him of the existence of the first plea bargain and the recommended sentence.app.at.that conclusion was patently erroneous in light of boyd affidavit stating that counsel never informed him directly of the plea bargain offer and in light of the legal precedent that the superior court cited in the very decision denying boyd claim.instead,the superior court concluded that sciolla was not ineffective,and that boyd claims were without arguable merit.app.at.boyd appealed to the pennsylvania supreme court,which denied allocatur on february.
on october,boyd filed for relief under pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra,claiming that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to consult with boyd about the commonwealth plea offer.the court of common pleas the pcra court dismissed the petition on february.
the court rejected boyd claim that guilty plea counsel was ineffective for advising defendant to reject a negotiated plea offer of four to eight years in light of the seriousness of the crimes charged and that appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to make the foregoing argument on direct appeal.app.at.the pcra court concluded that this argument had previously been litigated because,on direct appeal,the superior court held that boyd guilty plea was entered knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily.app.at the pcra court then stated that,assuming arguendo that the claim had not been previously litigated,the claim was without merit because there is no absolute right to withdraw a plea.the court stated that t o withdraw a plea after sentencing,a defendant must make a showing of prejudice amounting to manifest injustice which would involve a plea which was entered into involuntarily,unknowingly,or unintelligently.app.at citations omitted.significantly,even the alternative holding of the pcra court does not discuss boyd claim of ineffective assistance of counsel nor the prejudice that resulted therefrom.
on november,the superior court affirmed the denial of the pcra petition.the superior court determined that boyd claim was unreviewable based upon pennsylvania previous litigation rule because boyd had already raised the issue on direct appeal.the superior court opinion on appeal from the pcra court dismissal of boyd pcra petition never discussed the merits of boyd ineffective assistance of counsel claim and,obviously,never discussed whether there was any prejudice resulting therefrom.it follows that the only state court opinion of relevance for purposes of aedpa is the superior court opinion of november,an opinion,as noted above,that was clearly based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding,and therefore not entitled to the deference required by aedpa.see d.
boyd turned to the federal court,having exhausted his state court options.he filed a petition for habeas corpus,pursuant to,in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.the district court referred the case to the magistrate judge who held the first,and only,evidentiary hearing on boyd claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.the magistrate judge heard the testimony of boyd,sciolla,and his direct appeal counsel.because of its importance to the issue on appeal,i repeat here the magistrate judge finding of fact i do find that sciolla did in fact reject the commonwealth plea offer without the prior consent of petitioner app.at emphasis in original.the magistrate judge concluded that boyd claim was not procedurally defaulted,but he ultimately recommended denying the petition on the merits.
the district court did not adopt the magistrate judge report and recommendation although the district court also made the same relevant factual finding from the undisputed facts on the record that trial counsel did not communicate the plea offer to petitioner before rejecting the plea.boyd nish,wl,at.in addition to agreeing that boyd claim was not procedurally defaulted because,under the facts of this case,the previous litigation doctrine is not a state rule of procedure,id.at,the district court reviewed boyd claims de novo.it did so because the state courts failed to accurately construe boyd claims and did not cite relevant federal precedent.id.at.the district court concluded that trial counsel failure to communicate the commonwealth plea offer to boyd constituted a gross deviation from accepted professional standards,and thus constituted failure to act as counsel under the sixth amendment.id.at citing united states ex rel.caruso zelinsky,cir.the court also concluded that boyd had demonstrated prejudice because he testified he would have accepted the commonwealth plea offer,whereas the sentence he received was significantly greater than the plea offer terms.id.at.
the district court entered an order conditionally granting boyd petition for habeas corpus on january.nonetheless,boyd is currently serving a sentence of eight to years imprisonment in a state correctional facility he has already served more than seven years.
discussiona.the guilty plea 
judge hardiman opinion would decide this case primarily on the premise that boyd has conceded his entire claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because he agreed at sentencing that his guilty plea was knowing,voluntary,and intelligent,hardiman op.at,and has never receded from that position.quoting from mabry johnson,d,judge hardiman opinion states it is well settled that a voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty made by an accused person,who has been advised by competent counsel,may not be collaterally attacked.hardiman op.at.emphasis added.of course,the issue in this case is boyd claim that he was not advised by competent counsel.furthermore,in neither mabry nor tollett was there any allegation made that counsel had performed in an ineffective manner.
in tollett henderson,d,a state prisoner who had pled guilty to murder years earlier sought a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the grand jury that indicted him excluded african americans,an exclusion that had already been declared unconstitutional.id.at.instead of affirming the decision of the lower courts directing tollett release,the court remanded,holding that respondent must not only establish the unconstitutional discrimination in selection of grand jurors,he must also establish that his attorney advice to plead guilty without having made inquiry into the composition of the grand jury rendered that advice outside the range of competence demanded of attorneys.id.at.
tollett is irrelevant to the issue before us.tollett challenge to his guilty plea was directed to the state right to convict a defendant who was indicted by an unconstitutionally selected grand jury.if tollett challenge was successful,as it was in the court of appeals,he would have been entitled to release and a new trial following his indictment by a properly constituted grand jury.that was the relief directed by the sixth circuit,see henderson tollett,cir,and which the supreme court modified by remanding for further findings.
that is a far cry from what boyd has been contending and what he seeks.boyd does not claim he should be exculpated because of some constitutional violation by the state.we have seen such cases when appellants or petitioners allege a miranda violation,a brady violation,or a bruton violation.in contrast,boyd admits that he committed the assault for which he was convicted.he does not argue that his conviction should be overturned because of an antecedent constitutional violation.his current counsel forthrightly conceded before this court that boyd was guilty,and knowingly and voluntarily pleaded guilty to the assault.his claim goes not to his guilty plea but to his sentence.
boyd does not challenge his factual guilt.he does not wish to withdraw his guilty plea and stand trial he seeks the more favorable sentence contained in the initial plea offer.because boyd does not contest his guilt,but only his sentence,his guilty plea does not render thus does not claim.
in a case subsequent to tollett,the supreme court stated that n either tollett henderson,nor our earlier cases on which it relied,stand for the proposition that valid counseled guilty pleas inevitably waive all antecedent constitutional violations i n tollett we emphasized that waiver was not the basic ingredient of this line of cases.menna new york,d per curiam internal citations omitted.instead,t he point of these cases is that a counseled plea of guilty is an admission of factual guilt so reliable that,when voluntary and intelligent,it quite validly removes the issue of factual guilt from the case.id.second emphasis added.the supreme court own words are a more effective response to the reliance on tollett in judge hardiman opinion than any i could devise.
must a defendant lie about his guilt in order that he may raise the issue that his counsel was ineffective in failing to advise him of the prosecutor proposed plea agreement 
in contrast,mabry did involve a challenge to the defendant sentence imposed after a plea bargain.at.in mabry,sought habeas corpus to collaterally attack a second plea bargain on the ground that it was unfair for the prosecutor to have withdrawn a more favorable plea bargain.the supreme court rejected that argument.the critical distinction between boyd case and mabry,and which is not noted by judge hardiman,is that in mabry,the r espondent did not challenge the district court finding that he pleaded guilty with the advice of competent counsel and with full awareness of the consequences.id.at.whatever may be the similarities in the facts between this case and mabry,these factual similarities are irrelevant as the respondent in mabry,unlike boyd,chose not to contest the conduct of his attorney.
judge hardiman opinion is so focused on the seemingly talismanic properties of the phrase knowing,intelligent,and voluntary that it is unable to see the additional requirement of competent counsel in tollett,or that different iterations of the same test have been used by the supreme court.in tollett itself,chief justice rehnquist then justice rehnquist quoted from the supreme court earlier decision in mcmann richardson,d,where the court stated that in reviewing claims of ineffectiveness of counsel,the focus is not on whether a court would retrospectively consider counsel advice to be right or wrong,but on whether that advice was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.tollett,at.quoting mcmann,at.see also tollett,at.when a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged,he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.he may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea by showing that the advice he received from counsel was not within the standards set forth in mcmann.
the requirement of competent counsel,not surprisingly,is widely reiterated in opinions of the various courts of appeals.see,acha united states,cir moreover,a guilty plea does not preclude a defendant from raising a claim that ineffective assistance of counsel rendered the guilty plea itself unintelligent and invalid.citations omitted united states arteca,cir ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations can invalidate a guilty plea and make granting withdrawal appropriate,to the extent that the counsel deficient performance undermines the voluntary and intelligent nature of defendant decision to plead guilty.citations omitted hammond united states,cir if counsel was ineffective,it follows that hammond pleas were involuntary.the brady trilogy makes it perfectly plain that the sine qua non to a voluntary plea of guilty is the assistance of counsel within the range of competence required of attorneys representing defendants in criminal cases.quotations and citations omitted united states glinsey,cir a voluntary guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional defects in the proceedings against the defendant.this includes claims of ineffective assistance of counsel except insofar as the ineffectiveness is alleged to have rendered the guilty plea involuntary.citation omitted united states brown,cir brown does not claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel,which would be a valid basis for claiming that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary.citation omitted thomas lockhart,cir we agree with the district court that thomas did not receive effective assistance of counsel consequently he did not make a voluntary,knowing,and intelligent guilty plea.langford day,cir the fact that overshadows this case is that langford strongly and repeatedly insisted on pleading guilty and seeking the death penalty.that fact does not mean that langford loses his right to effective assistance of counsel his plea must be not only voluntary but intelligent,and counsel advice enters into the determination of intelligence.counsel advice must be within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.quotation and citation omitted maldonado winans,cir per curiam e ffective assistance of counsel within the range of competence required of attorneys representing defendants in criminal cases is indispensable to a voluntary guilty plea.quotation omitted scott wainwright,cir a guilty plea can not have been knowing and voluntary if a defendant does not receive reasonably effective assistance of counsel in connection with the decision to plead guilty,because the plea does not then represent an informed choice.citation omitted in re sealed case,it is that the validity of a guilty plea depends on whether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice,and that the voluntariness of the plea depends on whether counsel advice satisfies the sixth amendment guarantee of effective assistance.quotation omitted.
this court has also endorsed that view.see,siers ryan,cir.we can not avoid examining whether boyd received the effective assistance of counsel when making his guilty plea.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
the sixth amendment provides that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defence.const.amend.vi.an accused right to be represented by counsel is a fundamental component of our criminal justice system.united states cronic,d.assistance of counsel is fundamental because counsel are the means through which the accused other rights are guaranteed.id.of all the rights that an accused person has,the right to be represented by counsel is by far the most pervasive for it affects his ability to assert any other rights he may have.id.at.quotation omitted.
the right to counsel means the right to the effective assistance of counsel.id.quoting mcmann,at.that is because the text of the sixth amendment itself suggests that the accused must receive assistance,and that assistance must be for his defence.id.the supreme court has thus stated that if counsel does not provide actual assistance,it is a violation of the guarantee provided by the sixth amendment.id.otherwise,the requirement of counsel would be a mere sham,meaning nothing more than formal compliance with the constitution.id.citation and internal quotations omitted.
the right to effective assistance of counsel applies to an individual pleading guilty,just as it would apply to an individual electing to stand trial.see von moltke gillies.the decision whether to plead guilty is a fundamental decision in a criminal case.jones barnes,d.
trial counsel performance 
analysis of the merits of boyd claim of ineffective assistance of counsel requires application of the familiar test enunciated by the supreme court in strickland washington,d.the first prong entails a determination whether trial counsel performance was deficient when measured by an objective reasonableness standard.strickland,at.second,if counsel performance was deficient,it is necessary to consider whether the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.id.
in hill lockhart,d,the supreme court held that the strickland washington test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel.the court explained that i n the context of guilty pleas,the first half of the strickland washington test is nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence already set forth in tollett henderson and mcmann richardson id.at.the mcmann standard requires that counsel advice in connection with a guilty plea be within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.id.at.quoting mcmann,at.in short,counsel performance in connection with a guilty plea must meet standards of objective reasonableness.id.at.
it is supreme court precedent that an accused individual has the ultimate authority to decide whether to plead guilty and whether or not to accept a plea offer extended by the prosecution.see jones,at.emphasizing that the defendant has the ultimate authority to make fundamental decisions regarding the case,including whether to plead guilty faretta california,d explaining that the sixth amendment grants to accused the personal right to make his defense von moltke,at.stating that the accused must decide whether to plead guilty see also strickland,at.noting that counsel has particular duties to consult with the defendant on important decisions and to keep the defendant informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution.
because there are weighty consequences at stake,the decision whether to plead guilty is an intensely personal one that may be made only by the defendant.see gov t of virgin islands weatherwax,cir stating that the decisions regarding the plea process ultimately must be made by the defendant himself people whitfield,concluding that the right to accept state plea offer belonged to defendant,not to counsel or defendant mother.there could be an exception to that rule if an individual is deemed incompetent or a minor,neither of which is at issue here.
the commonwealth seeks to bypass the uniform authority adhering to the rule set forth above by referring to sciolla difficulty communicating with boyd and his subjective good intentions to use boyd mother as a translator.a review of the case law reveals no communication problems exception to the constitutional rule that the defendant must make the decision whether to plead guilty following direct consultation with counsel,and the commonwealth has cited no such case.
the defendant right to make fundamental decisions affecting the objectives of the representation is also in this circuit.see,weatherwax,at stating that fundamental decisions,like the decision whether to plead guilty,relate directly to the objectives of representation and thus must be made by the defendant himself citing model rules of prof l conduct a.see also sistrunk vaughn,cir explaining that the decision whether to plead guilty is a fundamental decision reserved for the defendant himself to make.
in united states ex rel.caruso zelinsky,cir,defendant caruso was convicted of murder following a trial,and was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment.when he later discovered that trial counsel failed to advise him that the prosecutor had offered a plea bargain if he agreed to plead guilty,he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus based upon ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court granted the writ.on review,we agreed with the district court conclusion that the failure of counsel to communicate to caruso the prosecutor plea bargain offer was a violation of his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.we stated that t he decision to reject a plea bargain offer is a decision for the accused to make.id.at.we explained that the right to counsel attaches during the guilty plea process because the right to counsel attaches at all critical stages of the criminal process,and the guilty plea stage is such a critical stage.id.citation omitted.we also stated that i t would seem that,in the ordinary case,a failure of counsel to advise his client of a plea bargain would constitute a gross deviation from accepted professional standards.id 
other courts of appeals have held the same.in united states blaylock,cir,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit collected cases from five other circuits agreeing that defense counsel failure to communicate to the accused the existence of a plea bargain offer,as well as the failure to advise the client of the available options and consequences of such an offer,constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.
in boyd case,sciolla provided ineffective assistance of counsel in three ways.first,there is no dispute that sciolla did not communicate to boyd directly the commonwealth plea offer.because a defendant decisions regarding a guilty plea are inherently personal ones,it was a gross deviation from accepted professional standards for counsel to have communicated with boyd mother,rather than boyd.see caruso,at.
second,consultation with boyd would not excuse counsel ineffectiveness because the duty of effective representation is one owed directly to the accused,not the accused family.if counsel had concerns about boyd competency,it would have been prudent to request a competency evaluation.that duty can not be excused based upon arguments about communication difficulties.
third,counsel did not even communicate the offer to boyd until after he rejected it.once counsel rejected the offer,he reduced the spectrum of possibilities available to boyd.the act of rejecting the offer before communicating it to the defendant is constitutionally deficient because the case law clearly requires that such a fundamental decision must be made by the defendant.see jones,at.
each one of those actions would be enough to find that counsel performance failed to meet constitutional standards.but here,the constitutional ineffectiveness runs even deeper.specifically,sciolla never counseled boyd in connection with the guilty plea he never informed boyd of his potential sentencing exposure under the statute and the sentencing guidelines,and he never gave boyd meaningful advice about the pros and cons of each plea bargain offer,the open guilty plea,or the trial.
we have held that counsel must reasonably inform a defendant regarding his potential sentencing exposure and the various options a defendant faces in the plea bargaining stage of a criminal case.in united states day,cir,we held that a facially valid claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was presented by defendant day allegation that,although his counsel told him about a plea offer extended by the prosecutor,he did not counsel him about the potential effect of the united states sentencing guidelines,nor did he explain the mandatory maximum sentence exposure.day argued that the failure to counsel him about his potential options and sentencing exposure constituted assistance.we agreed that if what day alleged was true,he would have made a showing of constitutionally deficient performance.id.at.we explained that a defendant has the right to make a reasonably informed decision whether to accept a plea offer.id.at citing hill,at.von moltke,at.prior to trial an accused is entitled to rely upon his counsel to make an independent examination of the facts,circumstances,pleadings and laws involved and then to offer his informed opinion as to what plea should be entered.included in that informed decision is knowledge regarding the comparative sentencing exposure between the accused various options.day,at.we therefore remanded to the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing.id.at.
as we explained in weatherwax,at,the requirement that counsel consult with his or her client concerning issues on which the client has the final word enables the accused to assist with his or her own defense.we stated that the client views and desires concerning the best course to be followed are relevant considerations that must be evaluated and taken into account by counsel.id.we noted that consultation promotes a strong relationship,and enables the accused to seek alternative representation if he or she does not agree with the course of conduct undertaken by counsel.id.at.
in strickland,the supreme court pointed to p revailing norms of practice as reflected in american bar association standards as guides to determining what is reasonable.boria keane,cir citing strickland,at.according to the american bar association standard,a defense lawyer in a criminal case has the duty to advise his client fully on whether a particular plea to a charge appears to be desirable.see id.emphasis omitted citing model code of prof l responsibility ec.the performance required of defense counsel is not merely telling the client that there is a plea bargain offer or even telling the client the nature of the offer.rather,the constitutionally required performance is that of complete disclosure in conjunction with full advice and counsel regarding the client potential sentencing exposure,options regarding plea bargains,and the potential consequences with respect to each option.
in this case,in addition to not communicating the offer to boyd at all,sciolla,like the defense lawyer in day,did not counsel boyd about the advantages and disadvantages of the plea offer,or how it compared to the options of entering an open plea or going to trial.thus,boyd was in no position to make a reasonably informed decision regarding his plea because counsel failed to advise him about the statutory maximum sentence,the sentencing guidelines,and differences between the options he faced.counsel never told boyd he could receive a sentence greater than four to eight years imprisonment.see app.at.as a result,as sciolla testified,boyd had little,or no,participation in the process regarding the plea process.app.at.
in sum,boyd counsel performance was below the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.there was,in effect,a complete lack of meaningful assistance with respect to the guilty plea process.the pennsylvania superior court conclusion that counsel actions can not be deemed ineffective,app.at,was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,because it was based on the superior court finding that boyd counsel informed him of the existence of the first plea bargain,app.at,which itself was an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented to the superior court.
judge hardiman avoids any comment on the above analysis of boyd ineffectiveness of counsel claim by his conclusion that boyd was not entitled to a hearing in federal court,hardiman op.at et,and that boyd state court offer of proof was insufficient to establish prejudice.id.i consider boyd showing relating to the prejudice issue first.
as the supreme court has stated,prejudice requires a showing that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.this requirement has been applied,inter alia,in cases such as this where the claim is ineffectiveness in the guilty plea context.see hill,at.caruso,at.in such an instance,then,of course,the prejudice question is whether,absent the ineffective assistance,there is a reasonable probability that the defendant would have accepted the plea bargain offer.see wayne lafave et,criminal procedure b,at,ed hereinafter lafave.
the question arises what constitutes a reasonable probability we have explained that strickland does not require certainty or even a preponderance of the evidence that the outcome would have been different with effective assistance of counsel it requires only a reasonable probability day,at citing strickland,at.hill,at.it is a relatively low standard,given that it is not necessary to even prove it is more likely than not that the outcome would be different.
this court has held that when a defendant would have otherwise accepted a plea bargain offer,there is prejudice in the mere fact that lost that opportunity if the plea bargain offer included a significantly lesser degree of punishment than the sentence received.in caruso,we held that caruso had alleged prejudice because he claimed that he received a significant additional term of imprisonment resulting from trial counsel failure to communicate a plea offer that caruso would have accepted.at.we considered two essential factors whether caruso would have accepted the plea bargain offer,and whether caruso received a significantly greater sentence than that which was offered in the plea bargain.id.in applying those factors,we concluded that caruso allege d the requisite prejudice,a significant additional term of imprisonment that resulted from counsel failure to communicate the plea offer which he would have accepted.id.
we rejected the government argument that,because caruso received a fair trial subsequent to his counsel failure to inform him of a plea offer,the fair trial remedied the deprivation.at citing rose mitchell,d rejecting state argument that habeas review should be foreclosed where claimed error did not affect determination of guilt.we explained that such an argument was untenable in the plea bargaining context because the subsequent proceeding could not remedy the fact that the defendant was denied the opportunity to present the plea bargain to the judge.id.although we did not presume prejudice,we did find that,if caruso made a showing that he would have accepted the plea offer,the loss of that opportunity prejudiced him even though he subsequently received a fair trial.our analysis came close to presuming prejudice but created a requirement that the petitioner prove that he would have accepted the original plea offer.
we considered this issue again in day,at,where day,who rejected a plea offer of five years imprisonment and ultimately received a sentence of almost years imprisonment,alleged that trial counsel failed to tell him what his sentencing exposure was under the sentencing guidelines and under the statutory maximum penalty.we held that day allegations,if true,created a showing of prejudice.we rejected the district court holding that because day received a subsequent fair trial,he could not have suffered prejudice.id.at.we reiterated our holding in caruso that a subsequent fair trial does not remedy the harm caused to a defendant when he is deprived by counsel of the opportunity to accept a plea bargain and be sentenced with that bargain in place.id.
in day,we explained that the basis for our conclusion was that the sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel guarantees more than the fifth amendment right to a fair trial.id.at.in other words,in the plea bargaining context even if counsel constitutionally deficient conduct does not affect the determination of the accused guilt under the fifth amendment,see caruso,at citing rose,at,petitioner has shown prejudice if there is a reasonable probability that the constitutionally deficient performance resulted in an outcome different than that which would have occurred if counsel had been effective.see day,at.
in united states gordon,cir,the court of appeals for the second circuit addressed a similar issue.gordon,whose offenses subjected him to imprisonment for months,was not told by counsel that the government had made a plea offer somewhere in the range of months.id.at.nor did gordon attorney counsel him about the difference between the range in the plea offer and that in the potential maximum sentence.id.
the second circuit held that the relevant inquiry as to prejudice because of counsel ineffectiveness was whether there was a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different had gordon been accurately informed of his sentencing exposure.id.at.if so,gordon suffered prejudice.the second circuit held that he did,based on the fact that gordon did not have accurate information upon which to make his decision to pursue further plea negotiations or go to trial.id.at.in reaching this decision,the court relied on two factors gordon statement that he would have accepted the plea bargain offer had counsel told him about it and counseled him with respect to his potential sentencing exposure,subjective evidence,and the presence of objective evidence in the form of the great disparity between gordon actual sentencing exposure under the guidelines and the sentence exposure represented by gordon counsel.id.at.
coincidentally,a case strikingly similar to boyd has recently been decided by the supreme court of south carolina.in davie south carolina,the petitioner,pursuant to a plea agreement,pled guilty to various cocaine offenses,child endangerment,and traffic offenses.the judge sentenced him to an aggregate of years imprisonment which petitioner did not appeal.instead,he filed a post conviction relief application pcr asking the court to vacate his guilty plea on the ground,inter alia,that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his plea counsel had failed to inform him of a written plea agreement in which the state offered a sentence in exchange for his plea to all of the pending charges.plea counsel testified he was unaware of the state offer until after it had expired because he was relocating his office.the pcr court denied relief,finding that petitioner knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty because he was fully advised of the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty and understood the underlying charges.
the supreme court of south carolina reversed,applying an analysis that was comparable to the second circuit in gordon.although the court stated that it gives great deference to the relief court findings of fact and conclusions of law,it adopted the rule that counsel failure to convey a plea offer constitutes deficient performance,a rule that would be consistent with the majority of other state and federal jurisdictions,citing in excess of other opinions.id.at.the court held that even if counsel was not aware of the plea offer he was deficient in not objecting to the plea hearing.
the court then turned to the issue before us,whether petitioner was prejudiced by this deficient performance.the court noted that following strickland,some state courts have essentially presumed prejudice merely based on the fact that plea counsel failed to communicate a plea offer,while other state courts have found prejudice based on the defendant statements that he would have accepted the plea offer had he been made aware of it.id.at.the court noted that other courts have applied a burden that is seemingly higher and requires objective evidence to show prejudice,not only that defendant would have accepted the offer but that he would have received a lesser sentence than that which he received.
the court opted to join those courts that use a analysis looking strictly at the facts of each case.the court noted that it is not always necessary for a defendant to offer objective evidence to support a claim of actual prejudice.it concluded that davie had proven that he was prejudiced by plea counsel deficient performance and that the difference in the sentence petitioner received and the plea offer is proof of prejudice.it noted that both the state counsel and plea counsel acknowledged that the state originally offered a sentence in exchange for the guilty plea,that plea counsel failed to communicate the offer to davie,that both plea counsel and davie testified that had this offer been communicated davie would have accepted the plea agreement,and that had he accepted the original offer,he would have received a significantly lesser sentence than the sentenced that was imposed.
boyd situation fits precisely into the analysis applied by the south carolina supreme court.the commonwealth has not denied that there was a plea offer of years,sciolla admitted he failed to communicate the offer to boyd,boyd testified he would have accepted it had he known of the offer which sciolla never counseled him about,and had he accepted it he would have received a significantly lower sentence than the years sentence that was imposed.
in day,this court stated,t he government mocks day contention that although he did not plead guilty when he believed that his sentence exposure was approximately eleven years,he would have pleaded guilty had he known that he would receive a sentence of almost years.we do not find the contention so implausible that it was properly dismissed without a hearing w e do not find it at all implausible that a young man would think twice before risking over extra days in jail just to gain the chance of acquittal of a crime that he knew that he had committed.day,at.
in this case,as in day,boyd failure to accept the proffered guilty plea led to a sentence substantially higher than offered,a sentence of months imprisonment compared to the offered or months imprisonment.such a finding is sufficient under our precedent,gordon,and davie,to demonstrate prejudice.
right to a hearing 
i turn next to judge hardiman disapproval of the evidentiary hearing held before the magistrate judge and the evidence produced first opportunity boyd was given to produce the relevant facts of counsel failure to inform him of the plea offer and failure to counsel him regarding the guilty plea.this issue of the right to an evidentiary hearing in habeas corpus cases is of great importance to the district courts.although the case law speaks in terms of a hearing in the district court,it is equally applicable to a hearing before a magistrate judge to whom the matter is referred by a district judge.a thorough analysis of the relevant case law suggests that not only did the federal court have discretion to grant boyd an evidentiary hearing,it was actually required to do so.
in townsend sain,d,a case involving the proper standard for determining whether to grant or deny an evidentiary hearing in federal habeas corpus proceedings,the united states supreme court announced the following rule where the facts are in dispute,the federal court in habeas corpus must hold an evidentiary hearing if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court,either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding.in other words a federal evidentiary hearing is required unless the trier of fact has after a full hearing reliably found the relevant facts.emphasis added.the court enumerated six specific circumstances in which a federal habeas court must grant an evidentiary hearing the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state hearing the state factual determination is not fairly supported by the record as a whole the procedure employed by the state court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing there is a substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence the material facts were not adequately developed at the hearing or for any reason it appears that the state trier of fact did not afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact hearing.id.at.with respect to scenario,the court reasoned that a federal hearing is necessary if,for any reason not attributable to the inexcusable neglect of petitioner,crucial evidence pertinent to the federal claim was not developed.id.at.
if an evidentiary hearing is not mandatory,the court explained,i n all other cases where the material facts are in dispute,the holding of such a hearing is in the discretion of the district judge.id.at.importantly,the court stressed that i n every case the district court has the power,constrained only by his sound discretion,to receive evidence bearing upon the applicant constitutional claim.id the opportunity for a petitioner,such as boyd,to submit an affidavit does not equate with the full and fair evidentiary hearing referred to in townsend.
this court has stated that f ollowing townsend it was generally recognized that district courts had plenary authority to conduct evidentiary hearings in their discretion,constrained only by those six occasions in which a hearing was required.cristin brennan,cir citing campbell vaughn,cir,cert.denied,d hakeem beyer,cir keller petsock,cir.
almost thirty years later,the supreme court partially overruled townsend,albeit not on this issue.in keeney,d,the court addressed the limited question whether the deliberate bypass standard is the correct standard for excusing a habeas petitioner failure to develop a material fact in a proceedings.id.at.the court replaced the deliberate bypass standard with the cause and prejudice standard for determining whether a petitioner failure to develop facts in proceedings should be excused.id.at.
we considered the effect of keeney in cristin,where we stated,keeney never applied to all requests for evidentiary hearings in habeas actions.the court described its holding as relevant only when the petitioner fail ed to develop the facts of his habeas claim in state court.cristin,at alteration in original citation omitted.in other words,the holding in keeney was limited to circumstances in which the material facts were not developed in state court due to the fault of the petitioner.id.
in williams taylor,d,decided after the passage of aedpa,the supreme court explained that the opening clause of e codifies keeney threshold standard of diligence,so that prisoners who would have had to satisfy keeney test for excusing the deficiency in the record prior to aedpa are now controlled by e.the court clarified that,as in keeney,b y the terms of its opening clause e applies only to prisoners who have failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court proceedings.id.at.the court elucidated,u nder the opening clause of e,a failure to develop the factual basis of a claim is not established unless there is lack of diligence,or some greater fault,attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner counsel.id.at.
as to the concept of diligence,the court continued,t he question is not whether the facts could have been discovered but instead whether the prisoner was diligent in his efforts.id.at.it does not matter whether the petitioner could have been successful rather,what matters is whether the petitioner made a reasonable attempt to pursue claims in state court.id.diligence will require in the usual case that the prisoner,at a minimum,seek an evidentiary hearing in state court in the manner prescribed by state law.id.at.if there has been no lack of diligence on the part of petitioner,then he has not failed to develop the facts under e opening clause,and he will be excused from showing compliance with the balance of the subsection requirements.id.
in other words,if a petitioner seeks and is denied a hearing in state court,there is nothing in e that bars the district court from granting a hearing.see id.at.if the petitioner is not in the group that would have had to satisfy keeney test,cristin,at quoting williams,at,then the townsend rule applies,and the district courts have the requirement,or at least the discretion,to grant an evidentiary hearing.see,taylor horn,cir cristin,at campbell,at love morton,cir see also hertz liebman b,at even after aedpa townsend its delegation to district courts of broad discretion to hold evidentiary hearings that are not to govern all situations save those in which the petitioner procedural default accounts for the state courts failure to develop the material facts.for a full discussion of the requirement of a federal evidentiary hearing,see goldblum klem,cir pollak,dissenting.in this case,because boyd did not fail to develop the factual record in state court within the meaning of e,see williams,at.cristin,at,the district court was not prohibited from granting an evidentiary hearing.
the hertz liebman treatise cautions that reviewing federal courts have sometimes confused the townsend standard for the right to a hearing as partially modified by keeney and aedpa section e with the statutory standard for determining the effect of state factfindings as modified by aedpa sections d and e.hertz liebman d,at.although the two inquiries overlap,they are distinct issues.that the state court may have made a finding of fact does not preclude the requirement of a hearing in the federal habeas court if no hearing was granted in the state court.
here,the district court was required to grant boyd an evidentiary hearing because the petition alleges facts that would entitle boyd to relief if proven the claims are not frivolous and the factual claims were not previously the subject of a full and fair hearing in the state courts for reasons beyond the control of boyd and his lawyer.id.b,at.the absence of an evidentiary hearing can not be laid at boyd feet.boyd counsel sought,and was denied,an evidentiary hearing on his ineffectiveness assistance of counsel claim in his direct appeal,app.at,and in his subsequent pcra petition,and that denial of a hearing was affirmed on appeal to the superior court in its decision,app.at,the same court earlier responsible for the significant misstatement of fact in its decision.boyd therefore met the diligence standard enunciated in williams thus,he was not responsible for the lack of a hearing,and aedpa does not limit the federal court discretion to grant a hearing in this case.it was therefore not error for the federal court to have granted boyd an evidentiary hearing.
even if it were not mandatory,there is no question that under the relevant supreme court precedent and aedpa,the district court had discretion to grant boyd a hearing.see schriro landrigan,d.this court recently stated that if a petitioner factual record is insufficiently developed in the state court through no fault of his own,e does not preclude the district court from granting a hearing.goldblum klem,cir.in cases where an applicant for federal habeas relief is not barred from obtaining an evidentiary hearing by e,the decision to grant such a hearing rests in the discretion of the district court in exercising that discretion,courts focus on whether a new evidentiary hearing would be meaningful,in that a new hearing would have the potential to advance the petitioner claim.id.citations and internal quotations omitted.
the supreme court has never disavowed or retreated from its decision in townsend sain.the court cited townsend in boumediene bush,d,and placed the constitutional right to habeas corpus above even congress power to emasculate its essential features,such as the right to a hearing.moreover,the supreme court cited townsend for the proposition that prior to aedpa the decision whether to grant an evidentiary hearing was left to the sound discretion of the district courts,and t hat basic rule has not changed.schriro landrigan,d emphasis added.this court,in a case,applied townsend as the relevant legal standard for determining whether an evidentiary hearing is required in a era.see richardson.bd.of prob.parole,cir.
boyd entitlement to an evidentiary hearing is supported by years of precedent of this court.see,goldblum,at emphasizing that decision to grant evidentiary hearing should be left to the sound discretion of district courts citation and internal quotations omitted richardson,at applying townsend as relevant legal standard for determining whether evidentiary hearing is required in era marshall hendricks,cir applying townsend to require a hearing where district court failed to hold one in era campbell,at stating that aedpa permits evidentiary hearing in federal court if petitioner diligently sought to develop factual basis for his claim in state court but was denied the opportunity for a hearing by the state court yohn love,cir stating general rule that i n cases where an evidentiary hearing is not mandatory the holding of a hearing is left to the discretion of the district court lesko lehman,cir stating that district court must hold an evidentiary hearing,if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court citation and internal quotations omitted united states dawson,cir keller,at vacating district court denial of petition for habeas corpus and remanding for an evidentiary hearing which was required where no hearing had been held in state courts and facts were disputed mayberry petsock,cir stating general rule that where there are material facts in dispute which if proven would entitle a petitioner to relief and the petitioner has not been afforded a full and fair evidentiary hearing in state court,either at the time of trial or in a collateral proceeding,a federal habeas court must hold an evidentiary hearing bibby tard,cir an evidentiary hearing is required if there is a dispute of material is,facts which,if true,would entitle the petitioner to the petitioner was not afforded a full and fair evidentiary hearing in the state courts.united states ex rel.mcnair new jersey,cir hearing required in district court where material facts not adequately developed at state court hearing.see also united states carmichael,cir hearing was necessary to determine whether defendant would have accepted plea offer and whether trial court would have approved it.
the importance of an evidentiary hearing is illustrated by the testimony at the only evidentiary hearing in this case that was held by the magistrate judge,which is set out in note supra.this significant evidence directly contradicts the pennsylvania superior court determination that trial counsel informed boyd of the existence of the plea offer.this case therefore directly falls within the exception to aedpa requirement of deference because the state court determination was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
judge hardiman goes on at length to explain why,under pennsylvania law,the pennsylvania courts were not required to grant the hearing request because boyd could have developed the factual basis of his claim by submitting more detailed affidavits.therefore,he concludes that the federal court was prohibited from holding the only hearing ever held on boyd petition.this claim has no basis in law,and is not supported by precedent.
assuming the pennsylvania courts had the option to deny boyd request for a hearing,that does not mean,and can not mean,that the federal court was barred from holding a hearing.the discretion afforded to federal district courts to hold a hearing is a cornerstone of supreme court habeas corpus precedent going right up to the schriro case in.federal law requires,or at a minimum permits,a hearing in a case such as this,even if state law does not.
the issue here is not whether boyd would have succeeded in his habeas is judge hardiman position that boyd was not entitled to the one evidentiary hearing he received in federal court.boyd was clearly diligent,the only issue recognized in williams as relevant to the denial of a state court hearing.
despite the tenor of the footnotes in judge hardiman comments,i suggest that the proper focus must be on judge hardiman conclusion repeated throughout that boyd was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing to further develop the factual record.we can not glide over the dangerous effect of the process favored by judge hardiman.it could preclude any evidentiary hearing at all in a habeas case even though the state courts had declined all requests by the petitioner for an evidentiary hearing,as they did in boyd case.in stark contrast,the supreme court has recognized the significance of an evidentiary hearing in habeas corpus cases.
in wingo wedding,d,the court stated,
to experienced lawyers it is commonplace that the outcome of a hence the vindication of legal more often on how the factfinder appraises the facts than on a disputed construction of a statute or interpretation of a line of precedents.thus the procedures by which the facts of the case are determined assume an importance fully as great as the validity of the substantive rule of law to be applied.
quoting speiser randall,d.
surely,judge hardiman would not question the relevance of justice brennan comments about the importance of developing the facts merely because they were written before the passage of aedpa.the respected habeas corpus commentators hertz and liebman have commented that even after aedpa,
a n evidentiary hearing is mandatory if three conditions are met a petitioner alleges facts that,if proved,entitle the party to relief the petitioner factual allegations survive summary dismissal because they are not palpably incredible or patently frivolous or false and for reasons beyond the control of the petitioner and the petitioner attorney assuming the attorney rendered constitutionally satisfactory assistance,the factual issues were not previously the subject of a full and fair hearing in the state courts or,if a full and fair state court hearing was held,the hearing did not result in factfindings that resolve all the controlling factual issues.
hertz liebman,federal habeas corpus practice and procedure,infra at a emphasis added.all three conditions are satisfied here.but whether mandatory or not,surely the federal court had the discretion to direct an evidentiary hearing.
one might reasonably inquire what judge hardiman finds dangerous in the only evidentiary hearing afforded to boyd,that before the magistrate judge.it is,after all,only at that hearing that sciolla admitted that he did not tell boyd directly about the commonwealth plea offer,that he rejected that offer even before he told boyd mother,that he did not counsel boyd about the pennsylvania sentencing guidelines,and that he did not tell boyd about the potential sentence he could receive.sciolla admissions supply the fulcrum of boyd sixth amendment claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,which is the subject of the habeas corpus claim before us 
what goal is served by requiring the federal habeas court to don blinders to the relevant facts that were never the subject of inquiry by the pennsylvania courts in this case there is no duplication of effort such as one encounters occasionally in a habeas proceeding.and although judge hardiman states as a fact that boyd knew about the initial plea offer yet decided to take his chances with the discretion of the court,hardiman op.at,the record made at the evidentiary hearing before the magistrate judge,where the witnesses were subject to the commonwealth,shows that was not the fact at all.and the magistrate judge found to the contrary.
habeas corpus,and the evidentiary hearing to which petitioner is entitled,subject the constitutional claim of the petitioner to the light of federal review.the blinders proposed by judge hardiman would have the federal court limited to seeing through the glass darkly.paraphrasing the unforgettable words of eleanor roosevelt,it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.
in my view,we should affirm the district court determination that boyd has shown both ineffective assistance and prejudice.
the district court directed that the commonwealth reinstate its prior offer.the south carolina court in davie,noting there was no evidence that petitioner expressed a desire to proceed to trial rather than plead guilty,imposed a different remedy.it stated that it can not compel the state to reinstate or the circuit court judge to accept the original plea offer.instead,it remanded the case for a new sentencing hearing,but directed the state and the circuit court judge to take into consideration the prior offer.
in light of the disposition of the majority of this court to remand for findings related to the merits,i do not discuss the remedy ordered by the district court.i note merely that if i were writing for the court,i would have directed that the matter be remanded to the state court for its determination of the appropriate remedy.
although i maintain my adherence to the foregoing opinion,i believe we have an obligation to make every effort to achieve a judgment concurred in by a majority of the en banc court.see green tree fin.bazzle,d stevens,concurring in judgment.for that purpose,and because my view of what i regard as the principal legal issue presented,the application of strickland to boyd claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and the rejection of the reliance in judge hardiman opinion on tollett and mabry in situations such as this,comports with chief judge scirica view,i concur in his judgment for the court.
in reviewing the issues on this appeal,we can not overlook that the supreme court has recently the importance of the protection of habeas corpus,and,in particular,the need for judicial review in connection with that constitutional safeguard.the court stated that the protection for the privilege of habeas corpus was one of the few safeguards of liberty specified in a constitution that,at the outset,had no bill of rights.in the system conceived by the framers the writ had a centrality boumediene bush,d.that was because t he framers viewed freedom from unlawful restraint as a fundamental precept of liberty,and they understood the writ of habeas corpus as a vital instrument to secure that freedom.id.
nevertheless,the court stated that w e do consider it uncontroversial,however,that the privilege of habeas corpus entitles the prisoner to a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he is being held pursuant to the erroneous application or interpretation of relevant law.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,the necessary scope of habeas review in part depends upon the rigor of any earlier proceedings id.at.citing townsend,at,the court noted that f ederal habeas petitioners long have had the means to supplement the record on review,even in the postconviction habeas setting.id.at.the court stressed that a petitioner in that case,a detainee must be able to present reasonably available evidence to a habeas corpus court,see id.at,noting that in the habeas cases presentation of evidence is limited only where a habeas petitioner has already had a full and fair opportunity to develop the factual predicate of his claims or failed to exercise diligence in doing so.id.although the case before us does not involve detainees in guantanamo,both the supreme court holding and its language are instructive.
all members of the court sitting en banc agree that the district court correctly determined that boyd claim was not procedurally defaulted.as for boyd claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,however,nine judges agree that the district court erred when it conditionally granted boyd a writ of habeas corpus.although i agree that the writ should not have issued,i must respectfully dissent from the majority which holds that the district court error requires a remand.
boyd should be denied habeas relief for two independent reasons.first,pursuant to the supreme court decisions in tollett henderson,d,and mabry johnson,d,boyd guilty he candidly admits was knowing,intelligent,and and rendered immaterial any ineffective assistance of counsel that preceded it.second,even assuming that tollett and mabry do not apply,boyd can not show prejudice under strickland washington,d.
in the summer of and one month before his twentieth birthday,boyd was living at home with his parents when he decided to pass the time by drinking in a park with william carpenter,raymond jones,and a few other friends.in a fit of bravado,jones wagered that he could drink ten shots of alcohol in ten minutes.after boyd and carpenter refused to pay jones for what can best be described as a pyrrhic victory,an argument ensued and a short time later boyd retrieved an aluminum bat and beat jones with it.jones lay unconscious and bleeding on the ground for some time before boyd and carpenter took him to the hospital.jones suffered permanent brain injuries which left him confined to a wheelchair.boyd initially attempted to conceal his role in the crime by hiding the baseball bat and fabricating an alibi.five days after the attack,boyd confessed to police.
the commonwealth charged boyd with attempted murder,aggravated assault,simple assault,reckless endangerment,tampering with evidence of a crime,and possession of an instrument of crime.boyd parents posted bail and hired a family friend,attorney guy sciolla,to represent their son.during the pretrial phase,the commonwealth contacted sciolla and proposed a plea agreement that included a recommended sentence of years of imprisonment sciolla telephoned boyd mother,informed her of this offer,and asked her to communicate it to boyd.sciolla also advised boyd mother that the offer was unacceptable,and asked her to tell boyd as much.she did so,and sciolla rejected the offer thus,boyd himself never was asked to accept or reject the initial plea offer,and there is no evidence that the trial court approved it or was even aware of its existence.
after he rejected the initial plea offer,sciolla negotiated a second deal with the commonwealth pursuant to which boyd would enter an open plea to the charges of aggravated assault and possession of an instrument of crime.in exchange,the commonwealth agreed to nolle prosequi the charges of attempted murder,simple assault,reckless endangerment,and evidence tampering.on sciolla advice,boyd accepted this second offer,and pleaded guilty to the two aforementioned charges before the honorable gary glazer of the court of common pleas of philadelphia county.
about two months later,judge glazer sentenced boyd to a term of imprisonment of years.boyd appealed and judge glazer issued a written opinion in which he found that boyd entered a knowing,intelligent,and voluntary plea of guilty after having signed a written guilty plea,which was supplemented by an extensive oral colloquy.judge glazer reviewed the details of the oral included an admonition that boyd could be sentenced to anything up to and a half to years in prison,app.concluded nothing more could have been done to ensure that boyd guilty plea was knowing,intelligent and voluntary.app.
in his direct appeal to the pennsylvania superior court,boyd second lawyer,thomas quinn,argued that trial counsel sciolla was ineffective by failing to discuss the relative merits of accepting the commonwealth initial plea offer.quinn asserted that sciolla had communicated the initial plea offer to boyd and his parents,and that boyd accepted the advice of counsel,and rejected the plea.app.in support of this claim,boyd submitted an affidavit in which he admitted that sciolla told me,through my mother of the initial plea offer.app.boyd did not attack the validity of his open guilty plea,but the superior court noted nonetheless that boyd guilty plea was entered knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily.app.the superior court affirmed the judgment of sentence,finding that boyd own affidavit conceded that he knew about the initial plea offer,but decided to take his chances on the discretion of the court as to sentencing.app.the pennsylvania supreme court denied allocatur.
upon the conclusion of direct review,boyd third counsel,cheryl sturm,filed a collateral challenge under pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.ann.et,in which boyd alleged for the first time that sciolla provided ineffective assistance when he rejected the initial plea offer without first discussing it with him.boyd also argued that quinn had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to present all of the pertinent facts on direct appeal.significantly,boyd did not challenge the validity of his guilty plea.
the pcra court denied the application,holding that boyd claims were previously litigated under.ann.a and,in an alternative holding,explained that boyd claim against sciolla would fail on its merits.the superior court affirmed on the basis that boyd claims against sciolla and quinn under strickland were previously litigated,and noted that boyd own affidavit conceded trial counsel informed him of the existence of the first plea offer,which boyd chose not to accept.app.
during the pendency of his pcra application,boyd filed an initial and an amended petition for writ of habeas corpus collectively,petition under,in which he reiterated the same strickland claims against sciolla and quinn that he had raised in his pcra application.the case was assigned to united states magistrate judge peter scuderi,who held an evidentiary hearing at which boyd,sciolla,and quinn testified.once again,boyd failed to allege in his petition that his guilty plea was not knowing,intelligent,or voluntary.nevertheless,at some point that issue appeared to have been joined before the magistrate judge.in his report and recommendation r r,magistrate judge scuderi specifically addressed the issue,noting that boyd guilty plea was constitutionally valid because the thorough colloquy belie d any claim boyd would make regarding the voluntary and knowing nature of his plea.app.the magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny boyd petition because it failed on the merits under strickland 
following the adverse r r,boyd filed objections in which he alleged that the magistrate judge misperceive d the nature of his claims.boyd is not claiming the guilty plea was not knowing,intelligent and voluntary boyd does not want to take back the plea.boyd warden,civ,dkt.at.boyd argued that he was entitled to a writ of habeas corpus because sciolla failure to communicate the commonwealth plea offer directly to him constituted ineffective assistance that prejudiced him under strickland.
the district court agreed with boyd and rejected the r applying de novo review without holding any hearing,the district court found that boyd was entitled to relief under strickland because sciolla failure to speak directly with boyd before rejecting the commonwealth initial plea offer was per se deficient and boyd was prejudiced because he ultimately received a sentence which was more than double the sentencing guidelines range under the initial offer.the district court concluded that because boyd should be returned to the position he would have been in but for sciolla ineffectiveness,the writ should issue unless the commonwealth revived the original plea offer.the district court also noted that boyd abandoned his strickland claim as to quinn.
the commonwealth filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied.the commonwealth also filed a motion to stay the issuance of the writ pending appeal,but the district court denied that motion as well.
the commonwealth filed a timely appeal in this court and we have jurisdiction pursuant to and.a panel heard argument on october.this court granted initial rehearing en banc,and oral argument was held before the full court on november.although the appeal presents two important issues affecting our habeas corpus procedural and one extensive briefing and oral argument presented to the court en banc focused entirely on the substantive issue.
we begin by addressing the commonwealth procedural challenge,that boyd claims are unexhausted and procedurally defaulted.our review is plenary.see holloway horn,cir.as we will explain,the commonwealth arguments are premised on a fundamental misunderstanding of the import of pennsylvania previously litigated rule.see.cons.stat.ann.a.because this rule has generated confusion,we will discuss its ramifications for the procedural default analysis at some length.
under the pcra,a petitioner can not obtain review on the merits unless he can show that an allegation of error has not been previously litigated or waived.id.an allegation is previously litigated if the highest appellate court in which the petitioner could have had review as a matter of right has ruled on the merits of the issue or the allegation has been raised and decided in a proceeding collaterally attacking the conviction or sentence.ann.a and.furthermore,an issue may not be relitigated merely because a new or different theory is posited as a basis for reexamining an issue that has already been decided.commonwealth senk.
boyd did not dispute that his strickland claim was previously litigated for purposes of the pcra,but he argued that this did not constitute a procedural bar to his federal habeas claim.the district court agreed,stating t his court agrees with the determination of other courts in this district holding that the pcra previously litigated rule is not a state procedural requirement within the meaning of coleman thompson,d.
it is axiomatic that a habeas petitioner is required to exhaust available state remedies before requesting habeas relief in federal court.mcmahon fulcomer,cir.exhaustion is accomplished when a petitioner presents in the state courts substantially the same claim he asks the federal courts to review.see johnson pinchak,cir.the habeas petitioner carries the burden of proving exhaustion of all available state remedies.lambert blackwell lambert i,cir citation omitted.
in this case,the district court found that boyd exhausted his claim that sciolla was ineffective in rejecting the initial plea offer without consulting his client.the record supports the district court conclusion because boyd made this argument to the pcra courts.additionally,boyd alerted the pcra courts to the federal nature of his claim by citing strickland,which satisfied the presentation requirement.see baldwin reese,d see also hameen delaware,cir.that the courts denied boyd claim on procedural grounds does not change the fact that he presented it.see holloway,at.
although the commonwealth concedes that boyd presented this federal claim in the pcra proceedings,it argues that the district court finding of exhaustion is contrary to wenger frank,cir,where we held that a habeas petitioner who neglected to file a timely petition for allocatur to the pennsylvania supreme court failed to exhaust his claims.id.at.significantly,however,boyd claim arose after the pennsylvania supreme court issued in re exhaustion of state remedies in criminal and post conviction relief cases,judicial administration docket order.since wenger we have held that order renders review from the pennsylvania supreme court unavailable for purposes of exhausting state court remedies under c.lambert blackwell lambert ii,cir.accordingly,we hold that boyd exhausted his strickland claim in state court.see cristin brennan,cir.
our conclusion that boyd exhausted his strickland claim does not answer the question of procedural default,however,because the supreme court has made clear that a procedural default forecloses relief even when the petitioner has exhausted his remedies.see boerckel,d stevens,dissenting see also id.at,writing for the majority we do not disagree with justice stevens general description of the law of exhaustion and procedural default and s pecifically,we do not disagree with his description of the interplay of these two doctrines.
whereas the exhaustion inquiry asks whether a claim was presented to the state courts,the procedural default analysis considers whether the claim was presented in the manner that state law requires.see edwards carpenter,d emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.thus,a petitioner who does not fairly present his claim to the state courts is barred from presenting it to the federal courts.cristin,at.
to understand why pennsylvania rule against relitigating claims in pcra proceedings that have been previously litigated under the current statute does not operate as a procedural default,we need only consider the pennsylvania rule in light of the adequate and independent state ground doctrine,of which the procedural default rule is but one application.see villot varner,cir citation omitted.that doctrine precludes a federal habeas court from addressing a question of federal law decided by a state court if the decision of that court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.coleman,at.a state rule provides an adequate and independent basis for precluding federal review if the rule speaks in unmistakable terms all state appellate courts refused to review the petitioner claims on the merits and their refusal was consistent with other decisions.nara frank,cir citations omitted.pennsylvania law provides that a claim raised in a pcra petition is previously litigated if the superior court decided the issue on the merits on direct appeal.see.cons.stat.ann.a.thus,when a pcra court refuses to reach the merits of an issue because it was previously litigated,it confirms that a pennsylvania appellate court already rendered a decision on the merits.because this rule assumes the inverse of one of the preconditions of a procedural,that all state appellate courts refused to review the petitioner claims on the merits,see nara,at emphasis added it is not an independent state law ground.
the commonwealth contends that our decision in sistrunk vaughn,cir,commands a different result.we disagree.in sistrunk,we held that the version of a was an adequate and independent state law ground supporting procedural default.see id.at.significantly,however,that version of the statute provided that a claim was previously litigated if the trial court ruled on the merits of the issue and the petitioner did not appeal.cons.stat.ann.a.because sistrunk did not raise his claim on direct appeal,we concluded that the claim was procedurally defaulted.see sistrunk,at.nevertheless,writing for a unanimous panel,judge stapleton explained the oxymoronic aspect of the statute insofar as it defined unappealed claims as previously litigated 
the previously litigated doctrine foreclose s state review in a pcra proceeding of claims that have been fully litigated and rejected on direct appeal as well as claims which were not presented on direct appeal.while such claims and claims like sistrunk are both categorized by the statute as previously litigated,the two categories are distinct for purposes of the adequate and independent state ground doctrine unlike here,in a situation where a claim has been previously litigated and collateral review is barred by a because the claim has been fully litigated and rejected on direct petitioner will have exhausted state remedies and the state appellate courts will have had the required opportunity to address the federal claim.nothing here said is intended to address whether federal habeas review would be available with respect to claims fully litigated on direct review in such a case.
id.at emphasis added.in,the pennsylvania legislature amended the statute to clarify that unappealed claims are waived,and not previously litigated as they had been under the prior version of the statute.see.ann.a and b.
in the case at bar,this distinction makes all the difference.because the state courts invoked the previously litigated rule to decline reconsideration of boyd strickland claim on the ground that it had been litigated on direct appeal,and did not find this claim to be waived within the meaning of b,we are presented with the situation anticipated by the panel in sistrunk.in light of the supreme court acceptance of justice stevens characterization of the procedural default doctrine as a waiver rule,see,at,we conclude that sistrunk holding is limited to those cases arising under the waiver section set forth in b.
in its current form,the previously litigated rule codified in a simply relieves pennsylvania courts of the burden of revisiting issues which are res judicata.but res judicata is not an adequate state law ground to support a procedural default.see,daniels knight,cir see also stevens zant,cir.even the courts of appeals that have yet to hold res rules inadequate,have refused to treat them as a basis for procedural default.see carter giurbino,cir california bar against relitigation in state habeas proceedings of claims already litigated on direct appeal is neither a ruling of procedural default nor a ruling on the merits see also page lee,cir although north carolina bar against relitigation of issues decided on appeal was an adequate and independent state procedural rule,it was not a state procedural bar that prevents federal habeas review 
even apart from a adequacy or independence,it is clear that the previously litigated rule insulates state courts from duplicative effort but does not preclude federal habeas review.when a pcra court invokes the previously litigated rule,it does so not because an applicant has failed to present his claims,but because he has already presented those claims at least once before and received a decision on the merits.this situation may implicate res judicata,but f ederal review is precluded only by procedural forfeitures,not by res judicata concerns.page frank,cir emphasis added citations omitted.viewed from this perspective,treating pennsylvania previously litigated rule as a procedural default would contravene the very purpose of that doctrine to ensure that state courts have had an opportunity to address a petitioner claims in the first instance.coleman,at.state rules that preclude relitigation on collateral review of claims already decided on direct appeal serve a salutary purpose in state courts,but they are not the kind of state procedural requirement that lead to a default of habeas claims in federal court,which typically occurs because a petitioner fails to raise an issue,not because he raises that issue twice.see,slutzker johnson,cir this is consistent with supreme court dicta.see ylst nunnemaker,d noting that a state decision based on ineligibility for further state review does not constitute a procedural default.
for all of the foregoing reasons,we hold that the district court correctly determined that boyd exhausted his strickland claim in the state courts,and that this claim was not procedurally defaulted by pennsylvania bar against the relitigation of previously litigated claims in pcra proceedings.
turning to the merits,in preparation for en banc review,we ordered the parties to brief numerous issues including the appropriate standard of review in light of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa the propriety of the magistrate judge evidentiary hearing and the district court de novo review of the facts found by the magistrate judge.review of these complex questions was essential to a proper evaluation of boyd claim that sciolla rendered ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to the commonwealth initial guilty plea offer.ultimately,however,the adequacy of sciolla representation with respect to the commonwealth initial guilty plea offer is immaterial because boyd knowing,intelligent,and voluntary guilty plea represents a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process.tollett henderson,d.that is,once boyd pleaded guilty,he forfeited his ability to challenge any constitutional deficiency that came before that,of course,that the plea was validly entered.
in tollett,henderson,a state prisoner who had pleaded guilty and was sentenced to years in prison,sought federal habeas relief because negroes had been excluded from the grand jury which indicted him in.id.at.the district court granted the writ of habeas corpus and ordered henderson release,finding that he did not waive his right to be indicted by a constitutionally selected grand jury.id.at.the court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed,holding that there was no intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.id.quoting johnson zerbst.
the supreme court reversed,holding that henderson was not entitled to release from custody solely by reason of the fact that the grand jury which indicted him was unconstitutionally selected.id.at.instead,once henderson pleaded guilty,he forfeited his right to challenge any constitutional violations that antedated the plea.see id.at.the court reasoned 
we thus reaffirm the principle recognized in the brady trilogy a guilty plea represents a break in the chain of events which has preceded it in the criminal process.when a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is charged,he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.he may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the guilty plea by showing that the advice he received from counsel was not within the standards set forth in mcmann richardson,d.
tollett,at.the focus of federal habeas inquiry is the nature of the advice and the voluntariness of the plea,not the existence as such of an antecedent constitutional infirmity.id.at.emphasis added.because the record was unclear whether henderson was precluded from raising the issue of the voluntary and intelligent nature of his guilty plea,id.at,the supreme court remanded the case.
eleven years after tollett,the supreme court considered the case of george johnson,who was convicted in arkansas state court of burglary,assault,and murder.see mabry johnson,d.although johnson was sentenced to concurrent sentences of years for the burglary and years for the assault,the arkansas supreme court vacated the murder conviction.id.at.upon remand,negotiations ensued and the prosecutor offered johnson a plea bargain on the murder charge that included a recommendation for a concurrent sentence of years.id.at.three days later,johnson accepted the prosecutor offer.claiming that he was mistaken,the prosecutor purported to withdraw the offer that johnson had already accepted,and offered a plea bargain that included a recommendation for a consecutive sentence of years.id.at.johnson initially rejected the prosecution second offer,but later accepted it and received a consecutive sentence of years.id.
presumably because he learned that he could have enforced the initial plea offer for a recommendation for a concurrent sentence,johnson filed a habeas petition in federal court.the district court denied the petition,but the court of appeals reversed,holding that the prosecution initial offer was enforceable.id.at.
writing for a unanimous supreme court,justice stevens began by noting it is well settled that a voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty made by an accused person,who has been advised by competent counsel,may not be collaterally attacked.id.at.it is only when the consensual character of the plea is called into question that the validity of a guilty plea may be impaired.id.at.the court summed up its terse opinion by noting that johnson was fully aware of the likely consequences when he pleaded guilty it is not unfair to expect him to live with those consequences now.id.at.
like henderson and johnson,here boyd does not challenge the validity of his guilty plea.indeed,both in his brief before the en banc court and at oral argument,boyd conceded that his plea was knowing,intelligent,and voluntary.instead,boyd claims ineffective assistance of counsel at a point that preceded the entry of the valid guilty plea.in light of the supreme court decisions in tollett and mabry,boyd valid guilty plea should be the beginning and the end of the matter.
neither counsel for boyd nor the federal defender amici even cite,much less attempt to distin
