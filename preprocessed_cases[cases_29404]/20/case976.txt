billy williams moves for authorization to file a successive habeas corpus application pursuant to west supp.see b west supp.we deny this motion.
williams was convicted in virginia state court of second degree murder and other offenses arising from a shooting incident on may.his convictions were upheld on appeal,and his ensuing application was denied.see williams angelone.cir.per curiam dismissing appeal of denial of habeas relief,cert.denied,d.
since his first application was denied,williams has filed three motions pursuant to b seeking authorization to file successive applications.his first motion for authorization pfa motion alleged that he had been convicted based primarily on the testimony of two eyewitnesses,torrey wright and richard teach.he further alleged that teach had recently recanted his testimony and admitted to his trial had criminal charges pending against him when he testified at williams trial.we denied williams motion without prejudice because he failed to provide materials required by fourth circuit rule d.see in re williams,cir.june,unpublished order.
williams filed a second pfa motion eight days after his first motion was denied,this time complying fully with rule d.once again,williams relied on teach recantation.we denied authorization,concluding that the new evidence described in williams motion did not satisfy the requirements of b.see in re williams,cir williams i.we did not decide,however,whether we would be willing to consider a new pfa motion reiterating the current claim and providing additional information favorable to williams.id.at.
williams has now filed a third pfa motion,which expands his previous description of the trial evidence and the new evidence he has allegedly obtained.in particular,the new motion alleges that williams was tried twice on charges relating to the may shooting the first trial ended with a hung jury,but the second only one in which teach in williams being convicted on all counts.the new motion also avers that wright,the only eyewitness other than teach,testified that he had never seen williams before the shooting in contrast,teach and williams were acquainted before the shooting occurred.we appointed counsel for williams and ordered briefing and oral argument on the question of whether a prisoner may file a successive pfa motion that additional claims in a previous,unsuccessful pfa motion.
the problem of repetitive collateral litigation has absorbed the attention of congress and the federal courts for at least a century.see generally mccleskey zant,d discussing history of rules governing successive applications for collateral review.section b and its counterpart for federal prisoners,west supp,represent the most recent congressional response to this problem.as we have previously explained,congress enacted b as part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa in order to raise the threshold that a prisoner must cross to obtain review of claims presented in a successive application for collateral review.see united states winestock,cir,cert.denied,d.
under b,a claim presented for the first time in a successive application may not be reviewed unless 
a the applicant shows that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable or 
b i the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence and 
ii the facts underlying the claim,if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
b.the initial determination of whether a claim satisfies these requirements must be made by a court of appeals.see id.b a.by assigning this role to the court of appeals,the aedpa transfer red to the court of appeals a screening process previously performed by the district court.in re king,cir en banc.
in transferring responsibility for screening successive applications,the aedpa potentially exposes the courts of appeals to the very problem it alleviates in the district courts a deluge of repetitive applications for collateral review.we implicitly acknowledged this concern in williams i,when we left open the question of whether we would be willing to consider a third pfa motion raising similar claims,noting at the time that two other circuit courts had faced this question and reached divergent results.see williams i,at.williams current pfa motion compels us to resolve the question we reserved in williams 
we begin our analysis of b by examining the language of the statute.see ramey director,cir.we conclude that this language,construed in light of habeas practices,requires us to deny a successive pfa motion that relies entirely on evidence and constitutional decisions that were available to the applicant during previous pfa proceedings.
in order to satisfy the requirements of b,a prisoner filing a pfa motion must cite a legal rule that was previously unavailable,b a,or proffer facts that could not have been discovered previously,id.b b i.although both of these clauses use the word previously,neither clause indicates what the availability of a new rule or the discovery of new evidence must be previous to.we hold that the word previously refers to the last federal a pfa which the applicant challenged the same criminal judgment.consequently,constitutional rules that were established at the time of the applicant last pfa motion were not previously unavailable,and facts known or reasonably discoverable at the time of the applicant last pfa motion can not satisfy the could not have been discovered previously requirement 
our conclusion is based on longstanding principles of habeas practice that were incorporated into the aedpa.before the aedpa was enacted,review of successive applications was governed by the abuse of the writ doctrine.see mccleskey,at.this doctrine generally precluded a federal court from considering claims presented in a successive application unless the applicant could demonstrate cause and prejudice see noble barnett,cir.cause was defined as an external impediment,whether it be governmental interference or the reasonable unavailability of the factual basis for the claim,that prevented petitioner from raising the claim.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.significantly,the cause inquiry focused on whether the applicant was prevented from including a particular claim in his most recent application.see id.holding that the claims presented in the applicant third habeas petition were barred by the abuse of the writ doctrine because the applicant had full knowledge of the facts central to each of these claims at the time that he filed his second petition for a writ of habeas corpus emphasis added.
the word previously,as used in b,codifies the cause requirement associated with the abuse of the writ doctrine.see daniels united states,cir en banc.for this reason,previousness inquiries under b should follow the same path as cause inquiries.because courts evaluating cause considered whether the applicant new claims were available at the time of the most recent federal proceeding,it is appropriate for courts applying b to do likewise.accordingly,a successive pfa motion must present claims that rely,at least in part,on evidence or supreme court decisions that the applicant could not have relied on in his last pfa motion.see bennett united states,cir 
as noted in williams i,two other courts have already issued opinions addressing the proper treatment of successive pfa motions.see williams i,at citing bennett and bell united states,cir per curiam.we consider it appropriate to explain why our approach differs from those chosen by our sister circuits.
in bell united states,cir per curiam,the second circuit considered an initial pfa motion alleging that a prosecution witness perjured himself at bell trial.see bell,at.the court denied authorization because it could not determine from the pfa motion how great a role the witness testimony played in s
