the defendant,james lee clark,has filed a successive habeas petition in this case,arguing that the evidence presented to the state courts established that he suffers from significantly intellectual functioning to the point of mental retardation and thus may not be executed.the district court concluded that the state court did not err in finding that clark had failed to establish that he had significantly general intellectual functioning,the first element of the texas test for mental retardation,and did not proceed further to the other elements.clark argues that the district court erred in upholding the state court findings on that element and erred in refusing to consider clark arguments as to the other elements of the test.upon our review,we determine that the district court did not err in affirming the state court as to the significantly intellectual functioning element of mental retardation and that the district court did not err in considering only that element.
standard of review 
this case is governed by aedpa.for questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact,habeas relief may not be granted unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in supreme court cases or confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at an opposite result.williams taylor,d.a state court decision unreasonably applies clearly established federal law if it identifies the correct governing legal rule from supreme court cases,but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case,or if it unreasonably extends a principle to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle where it should apply.id.at.for questions of fact,relief may not be granted unless the decision was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings.d moore johnson,cir.a factual determination made by a state court must be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.e.
initially,we note that clark is incorrect in arguing that the district court erred in failing to address the other elements of mental retardation under the texas definitions after it had determined that the state court did not err in finding that clark did not have significantly intellectual functioning.
the texas court of criminal appeals adopted two definitions of mental retardation in the aftermath of atkins,both of which contain the same substantive elements.the first,the aamr definition,defined mental retardation as a disability characterized by significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning accompanied by related limitations in adaptive functioning the onset of which occurs prior to the age of.ex parte briseno.the second,from the texas health and safety code,requires significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning that is concurrent with deficits in adaptive behavior and originates during the developmental period.id.it is plain from the use of the words accompanied by and concurrent that both of these definitions require that all three elements exist to establish mental retardation.it therefore was not in error for the district court to determine that clark could not prevail once it had already held that the state court had not erred in holding that clark failed to meet the first element.if the state court correctly found that clark failed to meet any of the three elements,he can not demonstrate mental retardation under the texas definitions.
we agree with clark contention that the question of whether he suffers from significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is a question of fact,and not a mixed question of law and fact as determined by the district court.see united states webster,cir discussing,in the context of the federal death penalty act,that the judge may act as on the issue of mental retardation.however,clark also raises the separate,legal question of whether federal law permits the state court the discretion to choose as the relevant score the base iq score or the low point on the range that the score represents.
we review questions of law to determine whether the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.but we review questions of fact for whether the state court decision was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings.d.the burden is on clark to rebut the state court determination with clear and convincing evidence.e.
clark raises issues with respect to each of the three elements of mental retardation in texas.with respect to the first element,the question of whether clark had significantly subaverage intellectual functioning,clark argues that the state court erred in considering the numerical iq scores of clark tests instead of the confidence band,or range of potential true scores someone with clark score falls within.this confidence band is designed to account for the measurement error inherent in intelligence testing,and indicates the upper and lower scores between which a psychologist conducting the test can be percent confident that the true score lies.
the texas court of criminal appeals held when adopting its tests for mental retardation that scores gathered through intelligence testing are necessarily imprecise and must be interpreted flexibly.briseno,at.the testing error,coupled with the differences between various iq tests,mean that in many cases an individual who tests as having an iq above,the rough for mental retardation,may still be diagnosed as mentally retarded,and vice versa.id.under this approach,courts should not rigidly consider an iq score to be determinative of the defendant intellectual functioning.
to support his argument that the state court erred in choosing his base iq score as the relevant iq score rather than the lowest number in the confidence band,clark argues that the texas courts must apply the approach articulated by the american association on mental retardation aamr,which dictates that iq examiners account for the appropriate confidence band.he argues that the aamr approach is the proper standard for determining whether an individual has subaverage intellectual functioning.clark is thus asking us to consider whether the texas courts were properly given the discretion to choose between a base iq score and a confidence band,see briseno,at.
the supreme court,in atkins virginia,d,left to the state s the task of developing ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences.id.at.although the court did refer to the clinical definitions of mental retardation promulgated by the aamr and the american psychiatric association apa,it did not dictate that the approach and the analysis of the state inquiry must track the approach of the aamr or the apa exactly.it also did not mention the portion of the aamr manual upon which clark relies in his argument.therefore it is not clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states that state court analysis of subaverage intellectual functioning must precisely track the aamr recommended approach.see d.
under the definition of mental retardation as established by the texas court of criminal appeals,the state court did not unreasonably determine the facts in light of the evidence relating to clark intellectual functioning.the court was confronted with multiple iq tests taken by clark.the first,taken in november of when clark was,measured his iq at.the true iq range indicated by the confidence band for this test was to.on april,after the atkins decision,clark took another test which measured his iq at.the confidence band of this test indicated that his iq ra
