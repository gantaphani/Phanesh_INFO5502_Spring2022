in the early morning hours of august,police officer terrence flomo was shot to death while he sat in his car near the intersection of street and cecil moore avenue in north philadelphia.the commonwealth charged william johnson and mumin slaughter with murder based on witness identifications and forensic testimony.the shooting occurred after flomo had stopped his car and solicited brenda bowens,a prostitute and slaughter and johnson drug customer.
at trial,the jury acquitted both defendants of murder,but convicted slaughter on murder and criminal conspiracy.it failed to reach a verdict on any remaining charges as to johnson.
at johnson retrial,the prosecution introduced a statement that slaughter had given police that implicated johnson.everyone agrees that this violated johnson right to confront witnesses against him,and johnson now argues that the error caused him prejudice warranting habeas relief.separately,johnson urges that the prosecutor calling slaughter to testify knowing that slaughter would invoke his fifth amendment privilege denied him of due process.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the district court denial of johnson habeas petition.
background 
johnson second trial began on may,and lasted four days.the commonwealth witnesses included lieberman,the medical examiner,who testified that flomo was shot in his right elbow and wrist area,as well as his chest.he opined that the gunshot to the chest caused significant damage to his liver,right lower lung,heart,and left lung,and as such was the more immediately fatal of all three gunshot wounds.lieberman also testified that the muzzle of the gun was fired from to three feet from flomo.he opined that the entries were on the right side of his body,including the shot that actually kill ed him,the one to his heart,the most immediately fatal one.given the scenario of flomo sitting in the driver seat of the car,lieberman testified that the shots could only have come from the front passenger side of the vehicle.
further,a firearms expert testified that two particles of unburnt gunshot residue were recovered from the front passenger side armrest,indicating that the gun was within three feet of the passenger side window.
there was no physical evidence,however,linking johnson to the crime scene.the commonwealth offered two eyewitnesses,brenda bowens and nora williams,each of whom implicated slaughter and johnson and identified johnson as the passenger side shooter.the commonwealth also put slaughter on the stand and,when he refused to testify,introduced the statement he gave to police implicating johnson.because slaughter statement was admitted erroneously,and the remaining two identifications are central to our analysis as to harmless error,we recount their testimony in some detail.
brenda bowens 
to support her crack addiction,bowens worked as a prostitute in the area of street and cecil moore avenue.slaughter,whom she knew as muk,and johnson,whom she knew as juice,were her drug dealers.she testified that she had known johnson for five,six years,and slaughter for ten,twelve.in fact,she would see them every day because she always bought crack from them.
on the morning of the murder,bowens reported being solicited by a man near the intersection of and cecil moore.she declined because she intended to go into a nearby house to get high she crossed the street and reported the encounter to slaughter and johnson,who were walking up cecil moore avenue.bowens then continued to an convenience store around the corner.upon her return shortly after,she saw the same car that had solicited her before.as she approached the house,she turned around and saw muk and juice.muk standing on the driver side juice was on the other side,the passenger side.she testified that johnson was leaning in the car.she stated 
i did see it happen,but i saw flashes and i heard a gunshot,and immediately i ran,because that what i do.when you see two neighborhood drug dealing guys,you run,because,you know.i do have to go into detail.but i ran and started banging on the door,saying let me the hell in.
while banging on the door to be let in,she glanced behind her to make sure that she was out of harm way.she then heard another shot and saw the flash again.she testified that johnson,at that point,was still standing at the passenger side door.she then finally was able to enter the house.
at trial,the prosecutor reviewed the entire episode using a demonstrative map of the intersection.bowens identified the house she intended to smoke in as well as where other events occurred.bowens also addressed her failure to come forward to the police initially 
q when you went the second time to homicide,after they talking to you and you told them what you saw,what caused you to tell them that you saw this what happened 
i was saying that my family was real concerned that i was in danger,someone was going to kill me and that i needed help.
on,bowens was impeached with her severe drug habit,and criminal history.bowens admitted to a prior conviction for which she was sentenced to to months in jail,to being on probation,and to having a bench warrant out for her arrest when she gave her statement.she was also impeached with her failure to report what she saw to the police and her initial refusal to give a statement after she was picked up for questioning.bowens disclosed that,during these interrogations,she was promised that she would be given help with her drug addiction.
bowens perception of the shooting was also impeached.while bowens reported seeing johnson leaning into flomo car,she did not see anything in his hands.bowens admitted that she only glanced in the direction of the shooting for what defense counsel characterized as a a flash.defense counsel also impeached her with her prior inconsistent statements about the exact location of flomo car in the intersection when the shooting occurred.finally,the distance between the shooting and the crack house bowens attempted to enter and in the vicinity of which bowens reportedly saw the shooting was,defense counsel urged in his closing,approximately feet 
on,the prosecutor attempted to rehabilitate bowens on a number of points.he reviewed bowens identification of johnson again 
q.in terms of that car,and counsel has asked you where the car was back and forth.when you see the shooting,are you concentrating on where the car is 
no,not at all.
q.what are you concentrating on 
me getting away.
and did you recognize the guys who did it 
and who are they 
juice and muk.
and is juice here now 
point to juice.
right there indicating 
no doubt in your mind it was them,right 
that a hard question.it was so many years ago,and i done been through so much,sir.i really honestly going to say that i am not really sure.i really honestly going to say that i not really sure.i been through so fucking much.i been through so much.and i know you been through brenda,listen to me 
defense counsel your honor,may we have a break at this point 
prosecutor look at me.no.
defense counsel excuse me.
i asking the court.
the court no.well,let me see.are you all right you all right 
witness crying.
defense counsel your honor,perhaps we should take a break.
the court we going to take a break.
after a brief recess,bowens testified that she was very tired,and agreed with the prosecutor that she was emotionally drained and want ed to get this over with.she continued,however,and testified again that slaughter and johnson stood next to flomo car 
okay.now,i going to ask you this that morning when you were out there and you hear the shot,what do you see 
that morning when i was out there,i see juice and muk standing at the car.
q.you sure of that 
am i positive,a hundred percent positive i just said i was.you asked me did i have any doubt,and i just said it.i was just i mean,i emotionally drained.you all asking me the same thing over and over and over again.
q.when you made the statement to homicide,did you tell them the truth 
q.when you went to the preliminary hearing remember it was just a judge,no jury,and i was there and asked you questions did you tell that judge the truth 
q.when you were here in before that judge and another jury,did you tell this judge the truth 
the court i was the judge.
the witness yes.
by the prosecutor 
are you telling us the truth now 
the prosecutor then read portions of bowens prior consistent statements to the jury,which confirmed the essential details of her eyewitness account,including that johnson stood on the passenger side of flomo car 
bowens also testified that she feared for her safety.she stated that she had to be relocated after giving her statement to the police.the prosecutor also questioned whether persons in the courtroom might have threatened her 
q.you said you were worried or not comfortable about certain people in this room.are you afraid of the defendant people and his family that are sitting in this room right now 
i afraid of everything right now,you know.i afraid of everything right now.i very yeah,very afraid of everything.not only them,but everybody.it like everybody out to get me.when this shit went down,everybody was out to get me.
the court you want to get off the stand is that correct 
the witness yes.i have a life.i just tired of being badgered.it been five,four years i been being badgered,badgered,badgered.the da been badgering me,other people badgering me,everybody badgering me.
she was then briefly recrossed and redirected before being excused 
nora williams 
the commonwealth next called nora williams,who also placed johnson at the passenger side of flomo car during the shooting.williams was also a prostitute who worked in the vicinity of street and cecil moore avenue and who knew bowens from having worked there williams knew johnson and slaughter too and testified that she saw them every day on the block.williams also purchased her drugs from them,sometimes several times a day.
on the morning of the murder,williams had just finished with a customer when she saw bowens across the street arguing with a man in a car.she then saw bowens walk away.she testified that bowens walked to slaughter and johnson and talked to them for a minute before bowens left the area.then williams saw the car come back around the block.when asked what happened next,she relayed the following 
q.when you see the car on,what happens 
that when i seen muk and juice running towards the car.
okay.when they run towards the car,do they get to the car 
and what happens 
that when i just heard i seen them both had guns.i heard the guns start just shooting,pop,pop.and i could really do nothing or move or nothing.there was nowhere to hide.
okay.now,i going to take you back a little.you said you see muk and juice coming towards the car,right 
tell me,when muk gets to the car,what side of the car does he go on 
he on the driver side.
q.when you see juice get to the car,what side does he get on 
he on the passenger side.
and in looking at them,are you facing the front of the car or the back of the car 
i like the front,yeah,the front of the car.
now,they at the car.when they getting to the car,do you see anything in their hands 
q.so we could be clear,does muk have a gun in his hand 
does juice have a gun in his hand 
okay.you said muk on the driver side juice on the passenger.when they get up to the car,you said you saw the guns.what happens next 
a.then i heard the firing,pow,pow,pow.
q.once the shooting stops,what does muk do what does juice do 
a.they run off.
see also testifying on cross examination that johnson was on the passenger side.williams reported being right across the street,which was,in her estimation,approximately feet from the shooting when it occurred.
williams also initially declined to give a statement to the police,although she eventually did.williams agreed with the prosecutor that,after she gave her statement,certain things happen ed to her in the neighborhood that caused the police department to relocate her.williams also testified that she relayed the same testimony at the preliminary hearing and at the first trial.
williams was impeached with her drug history.she admitted to having a crack habit at the time of the murder,to having some cocaine in her system on the morning of the murder,and to possibly having cocaine in her system when she gave her statement to police.she was also questioned about her motivation in giving a statement to the police,including the fact that she had some open cases and a bench warrant on her when she was interrogated.she also said that,at one of those interrogations,the police blamed her for the murder.williams testified that she only glance d at the shooting,for what defense counsel characterized as a.finally,williams did not agree with defense counsel assertion that johnson and slaughter were leaning into the car.instead,she reported them to be a foot,foot and a half away.
at the same time,williams testified that there was any question in her mind about what she saw.
mumin slaughter 
the prosecution last witness was mumin slaughter,johnson convicted.slaughter had given a statement to police implicating johnson,and based on this cooperation and his anticipated testimony at johnson retrial,his sentence had been vacated.however,at trial,he essentially refused to testify.the jury was then read portions of his statement over defense counsel objection and slaughter repudiation of the statement itself.because johnson argues that the introduction of this statement violated his rights and substantially influenced the verdict,we recount not only the statement itself,but also the context within which it was introduced.
just before slaughter was to testify,counsel appeared in the judge robing room,which was out of earshot of the jury.the prosecutor informed the trial judge that slaughter was refusing to come upstairs to testify despite being subpoenaed.the trial judge stated that slaughter had no fifth amendment privilege and the prosecutor agreed slaughter was then brought into the courtroom and called to the witness stand.
slaughter answered a few questions,confirming,for example,that he had been convicted of murder in the first trial,that his sentence had been vacated,and that he had spoken to the prosecutor that day and understood he would be held in contempt if he refused to testify.but he denied making the statement to police that implicated johnson.when the prosecutor began to press slaughter on that issue,he became uncooperative 
q did you make a statement 
q.did you,on august,in that period of time,did you sell drugs 
the witness your honor,i do know why i sitting here.i do have nothing to say.
the court you been called as a witness,slaughter.
the witness well,i did not witness anything.
the court well,you been called as a witness because your sentence was vacated,and i was the sentencing judge who gave you to years.
and we here now.and the prosecutor is going to ask you some questions.
the witness i have nothing to say,your honor.
by the prosecutor 
good.well,listen to me a little while longer.
defense counsel objection,your honor.
the court no.overruled.it not your you do represent him.
by the prosecutor 
sir,did you serve a federal sentence 
i plead the fifth.i do have nothing to say.
the court you do have a fifth amendment privilege.
the witness well,i just going to sit here with nothing to say,because you all ca force me to do anything.
at sidebar,counsel eventually agreed to attempt to contact slaughter attorney and court recessed for the weekend.
on monday,counsel convened in the robing room outside the presence of the jury.slaughter trial attorney appeared in court and explained slaughter state of mind 
now that he realized he says that he being asked to testify,he said he does want to do that.he says he does want to share the bad fortune that has descended on him in this case,having been improperly convicted,on somebody else.
he talked about how he thought he was misle d by the district attorney office in some fashion and reiterated that he did want to bring any any harm to johnson,and at one point said that he really had no knowledge of,you know,who,in fact,killed the officer in this case.
the court agreed with the commonwealth,however,that slaughter should be brought out again and held in contempt or resentenced if he refused to testify.the jury then returned to the courtroom.the prosecutor resumed his questioning,over defense counsel objection.slaughter admitted to speaking to the prosecutor and his lawyer but answered little else.
the court then interrupted johnson trial to resentence slaughter.the jury was escorted from the courtroom again,as was johnson,and slaughter was seated in the defendant chair.a separate sentencing hearing was then conducted and recorded in a separate transcript under a different case number.see.ultimately,no new sentence was imposed instead the parties probed slaughter unwillingness to testify further.slaughter testified 
the defendant slaughter so i put a freaking statement together to try to help myself,to make him not go to trial.now he want me to come up here and say he did do all this.
the court well,quite frankly,all you have to do is say you gave a statement and answer his questions.
the defendant but if i do that,it going to make his trial look bad.the thing he said he could help us get deals,just to help me.now he want me to go up there and say all this.it going to mess up the trial and make him look like a murderer.nobody do believe us anyway that we did do it.but being though i got years,i wanted to help myself and make it back to my kids.
now he want me to sit here and say he did do this.i not willing to do that,because that going to make me a liar and that going to make me look bad,and i going to have that on my conscience.
the prosecutor then recommended that given this defendant attitude and not showing any type of remorse and,in fact,trying to undermine the process of the commonwealth trying to bring some justice,slaughter should be resentenced in line with his original sentence.the transcript then ended at this point and johnson trial resumed 
the jury was brought out and the prosecutor resumed his questioning.after slaughter remained essentially silent,the prosecutor presented slaughter with his statement and,over johnson attorney objections the court permitted the prosecutor to put slaughter statement on the overhead projector screen so that the jury could see it.slaughter initially denied making the statement to police.he called the prosecutor a liar,a sneak,and vicious.after being asked if he had said,at the earlier sentencing hearing,that he had put a freaking statement together,slaughter interjected in front of the jury 
the witness listen,i got found guilty for a fucking murder that nobody do know who killed this man.they gave me years and nobody said i did nothing.they trying to railroad us.they gave me years.my own lawyer,even him told me i can never get back in court to get back to my kids or nothing.they said just say that you all did it and he wo want to go to trial.you can get your years back and he take a statement i mean,he take a deal.he wo want to go nowhere,because he be scared if i come out there with all these other liars saying that we did something.
i did have no choice.i did know what to do.i was scared.a desperate man do desperate things.i tried it.now,he did go for it.he did take it because he know me.he know that i was lying.he knew that i would do this,because it was a lie.
does that mean he your friend 
a.this is bullshit.you lie.you lie.
answer the question.is he your friend 
a.this is bullshit.
is he your friend 
a.you trying to come in here and make like i really said he did this.
defense counsel then asked slaughter a number of questions,most of which went unanswered,and finally,slaughter was excused.
the prosecutor subsequently called a detective who read slaughter statement,line by line,to the jury.in the written statement,slaughter indicated that he went by the nickname muk and that he knew johnson as juice that on the night of the murder he was on the corner of and moore selling crack that bowens had approached them to report the attempted solicitation by flomo that,when the car pulled up,juice pulled out his gun and started firing at the guy through the passenger side and that they both then ran off in different directions.
finally,at the close of the commonwealth case,the prosecutor called the court reporter,who then read slaughter earlier sentencing hearing transcript in its entirety to the jury.the commonwealth then rested.
johnson presented only one witness,deborah bryant,who also testified in the first trial.her testimony was read in by stipulation because she was unavailable.although bryant denied knowing anything about the murder at the time of the first trial,defense counsel impeached her at the first trial by reading portions of a statement,given to police at an earlier time,claiming that two men by the name of peanut and jeff shot flomo.
the jury was then instructed and retired to deliberate.during deliberations,the jury sent out two notes,to which the judge responded by sending back some of the evidence and giving them further instructions on the law the jury then found johnson guilty of murder and criminal conspiracy,and the court sentenced johnson to consecutive prison terms of to years and to years for the conspiracy.
proceedings 
the pennsylvania superior court affirmed johnson conviction.see commonwealth.johnson.super.on direct appeal,johnson raised three claims,two of which are relevant here.first,he argued that the introduction of slaughter statement violated his right to confront witnesses under the sixth amendment.the superior court recognized that the contents of slaughter statement should not have been allowed in evidence because their introduction violated johnson right of confrontation,part,at,but nonetheless found the error harmless.second,johnson argued that the prosecutor violated his due process clause rights when he called slaughter as a witness,knowing that slaughter would refuse to testify.the superior court concluded that both parties and the trial court were under a mistaken assumption that slaughter no longer had a fifth amendment privilege,but that its introduction was not a due process clause violation.it reasoned that calling slaughter was not an improper attempt by the commonwealth to create an inference of guilt by association between johnson and slaughter.part,at.the pennsylvania supreme court then denied johnson petition for allowance of appeal.see commonwealth johnson.
johnson filed a counseled petition for federal habeas corpus relief and raised three habeas claims denial of due process by the prosecution deliberate elicitation of his assertion of the fifth amendment before the jury,denial of his sixth amendment right to confrontation of witnesses,and denial of due process by introduction of evidence falsely implying that johnson threatened a witness.johnson lamas,civ.action,wl,at.the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that habeas relief be denied on all three claims.although the magistrate judge concluded that federal courts do not owe deference to the state court harmless error conclusion,the magistrate judge found that the evidence against johnson was strong enough,even apart from the evidence admitted in violation of the confrontation clause,that the error did not cause actual prejudice.id.at.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation,and issued a certificate of appealability as to johnson confrontation clause claim.johnson lamas,civ.action,wl,at.july.we subsequently granted johnson motion to expand the certificate of appealability to include the issue of whether the district court erred in denying johnson claim that his due process rights were violated when the commonwealth called and examined a witness who invoked his fifth amendment privilege against.order,dated may.we now turn to these two questions.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over the habeas corpus petition pursuant to,and we have jurisdiction under and.since the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing,our review over the district court denial of johnson habeas petition is plenary.see thomas horn,cir.at the same time,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,d,e,requires that we afford considerable deference to state courts legal and factual determinations,palmer hendricks,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.confrontation clause claim 
the introduction of slaughter statement identifying johnson as being the passenger side shooter after slaughter refused to submit to violated johnson sixth amendment right to confront witnesses against him.this much the commonwealth concedes.therefore,the only question we must decide is whether this error was harmless.for the reasons that follow,we find that it was.
harmless error standard 
to be entitled to habeas relief,a habeas petitioner must establish that the trial error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brecht abrahamson.under this test,we may grant relief only if we have a grave doubt as to whether the error at trial had a substantial and injurious effect or influence.davis ayala,quoting mcaninch.in other words,t here must be more than a reasonable probability that the error was harmful.id.quoting brecht,at.
several factors guide our review of confrontation clause errors,including the importance of the witness testimony in the prosecution case,whether the testimony was cumulative,the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points,the extent of otherwise permitted,and,of course,the overall strength of the prosecution case.delaware van arsdall.
the supreme court has recently discussed the framework we must apply when a habeas petitioner claims that a state court erred in finding that a constitutional error was harmless.in davis ayala,the court confirmed that the brecht standard still governs our harmless error analysis on collateral review at petitioner must meet the brecht standard.however,where a state court has concluded that the error was harmless on direct review,the supreme court clarified that we must defer to that determination under aedpa unless the state court unreasonably applied chapman california see id.at noting that where the state court decides harmlessness,aedpa highly deferential standards kick in.although the supreme court had previously held in fry pliler that brecht subsumes aedpa deference requirement,t he fry court did not hold and would have had no possible basis for holding that brecht somehow abrogate d the limitation on federal habeas relief that d plainly sets out.id.at quoting fry pliler.therefore,while brecht subsumes aedpa requirement such that we need not formal ly apply both brecht and,aedpa d nevertheless sets forth a precondition to the grant of habeas relief.id.alteration in original emphasis added quoting fry,at 
under aedpa,an application for habeas relief shall not be granted for any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.d.a harmlessness determination constitutes an adjudication on the merits.see ayala,at holding that california supreme court harmlessness decision undoubtedly constitute d an adjudication on the merits mitchell esparza.consequently,a federal court may not award habeas relief under unless the harmlessness determination itself was unreasonable.ayala,at quoting fry,at.and a decision is not unreasonable if jurists could disagree on its correctness.id.quoting harrington richter.thus,a habeas petitioner must show that the state court harmless error determination was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.id.quoting harrington,at.
in sum,we must ask whether a jurist could agree with the superior court conclusion that the introduction of slaughter statement was harmless.if we find that she could,then johnson necessarily can not satisfy brecht and we must give aedpa deference to the superior court determination,even if we might decide the case differently were we to undertake de novo review.ayala,at.
application 
here,the superior court concluded that the introduction of slaughter statement was harmless because it was merely cumulative of the testimony provided by bowens and williams.part,at.in so holding,it recounted bowens and williams identifications,id.at,their impeachment,id.at,and some of the factors that rehabilitated their credibility,including that both eyewitnesses had known johnson for years,that both provided consistent identifications at the preliminary hearings,and were unwavering in their identifications during vigorous,id.at.although the district court did not analyze whether it owed deference to this conclusion,it nonetheless concluded that the error was harmless under brecht.
applying the relevant standard,we find that a reasonable jurist could conclude that the cumulative nature of slaughter identification rendered its erroneous introduction harmless.the commonwealth presented two key witnesses,bowens and williams,whose identifications fundamentally corroborated each other on points critical to the commonwealth theory of the case.williams corroborated that bowens spoke to johnson after being solicited by flomo,a conversation that the commonwealth theorized instigated the attack.williams and bowens,moreover,reported seeing the men standing near or leaning on the car before the shooting and,crucially,both saw johnson standing at the passenger side of the car when they saw and heard gun shots.this consistent placement of johnson at the passenger side of flomo car is of particular significance here in light of lieberman testimony that the most immediately fatal gunshot came from that location.slaughter statement,therefore,added very little,if any,new substance to their consistent narratives.in this sense,the superior court reasonably concluded that the written statement given by slaughter was cumulative of bowens and williams testimony.see van arsdall,at directing courts to consider,among a list of factors,whether the erroneously admitted statement was cumulative of other evidence.
johnson responds that bowens and williams testimony,apart from slaughter statement,left serious doubt as to johnson guilt because bowens and williams were significantly impeached.johnson br.johnson points to their criminal and drug histories,proffers motives that might have biased their testimony,and highlights deficiencies in their perception of the shooting itself,particularly that each only glanced for a.reply.we can not say,however,after reviewing the whole record,that the superior court harmlessness determination,which discounted the effect of this impeachment on the jury,was objectively unreasonable such that no jurist could agree with it.to the contrary,a jurist could find that the introduction of the statement did not have a substantial effect on the verdict.
we begin by noting that the jury heard rehabilitation testimony that bolstered bowens and williams credibility.it is true that bowens exhausted,and in tears admitted to some doubt as to her identification.but despite this,bowens affirmed on redirect that she had been telling the truth at this trial,at the previous trial,at the preliminary hearing,and when she gave her statement to the police.in fact,the jury actually heard several portions of these prior consistent identifications.and,unlike bowens,williams expressed no doubt whatsoever during.finally,as the superior court notes,bowens and williams had known slaughter and johnson for over five years,making it more likely that the jury could accept their identifications as accurate 
bowens also responded specifically to charges of bias and fabrication by explaining that she overcame her earlier hesitancy to give a statement at the urging of her family,who believed she was in danger and needed help.further,on redirect examination,bowens repeatedly testified that she feared for her life and that she worried about reprisals.the jury also heard that bowens and williams needed to be relocated.in short,while these reasons could easily be disbelieved,johnson br,the jury,which observed both witnesses throughout their testimony,could have,by the same token,determined that both were in fact more credible given their willingness to testify in the face of these fears.in light of this rehabilitative testimony,we can not say that the superior court determination that slaughter statement was harmless was so lacking in justification that we should refuse to give it aedpa deference.harrington,at.
next,johnson directs our attention to the circumstances surrounding the introduction of slaughter statement.johnson argues that the prosecutor attempt to introduce slaughter statement made it the central focus of the trial,and,as a convicted,slaughter refusal to testify on grounds amplified the statement effect.reply.the commonwealth replies that slaughter testimony repudiating the statement in front of the jury undermined its impact.although it is difficult to ascertain the exact effect this episode had on the verdict,we believe that certain aspects of slaughter statement may have lessened the effect of the statement.slaughter not only denied in front of the jury that he committed the murder,but also explained that he gave the statement implicating johnson in the belief that it would cause johnson not to go to trial.so while the corroborative aspects of slaughter statement might have had some impact on the jury verdict,we can not be certain that it had as damaging an effect as we typically find when a nontestifying statement is admitted,unrepudiated and unchallenged adamson cathel,cir.vazquez wilson,cir.similarly,while confrontation clause errors such as these present a risk of creating guilt by association,slaughter blunted those inferences by denying johnson guilt and even his own.taken together with bowens and williams consistent eyewitness testimony and the forensic evidence,johnson has not shown more than a reasonable possibility that the statement itself was harmful.ayala,ct at quoting brecht,at.
further,we do not agree with johnson argument that slaughter statement was the commonwealth only focus.indeed,the prosecutor devoted roughly equivalent portions of his closing to reviewing bowens and williams testimony.as such,we are not persuaded that slaughter statement had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the verdict,even when we consider the circumstances surrounding its introduction.brecht,at emphasis added.
finally,we disagree with johnson argument that our prior brecht harmless error cases compel a finding in his favor here.johnson br.citing,inter alia,adamson.in adamson,we concluded that a trial court bruton error of permitting presentation of an accomplice inculpatory statements,without a limiting instruction,was not harmless under brecht.at.johnson likens the evidence in his case to the evidence there,but they are not on all fours.in adamson,the only evidence of the petitioner guilt,aside from the erroneously admitted statements of his accomplices,was the petitioner own confession,the validity of which he challenged extensively and credibly at trial.id.at.indeed,t here were no eyewitness statements identifying the petitioner as taking part in the robbery id.at.likewise,in washington sec y.dep t of,the only significant evidence against washington,aside from the statement admitted in violation of bruton,was from a single who was not an eyewitness to the murders and who was impeached with significant inconsistencies in his story,in addition to his history of drug and alcohol abuse,admitted heavy impairment from drugs at the time of the murders,and his motivation to minimize his own role in the crime,cir.
here,although they faced impeachment,there was not just one,but two eyewitnesses who were with johnson and slaughter and whose mutually corroborative testimony established that johnson stood on the passenger side of the car.bond beard,cir.holding the admission of nontestifying confession in violation of sixth amendment harmless where there was defendant allegedly coerced confession but also an eyewitness who testified that he was absolutely certain that defendant committed the crime.thus,we do not have the same doubt that the verdict was substantially influenced by the error as we did in adamson at.
in sum,we do not wish to diminish the importance of the right to confront witnesses,but because slaughter statement was cumulative of bowens and williams largely consistent identifications,the pennsylvania superior court did not act unreasonably in concluding that the error was harmless.therefore,we conclude that johnson necessarily can not satisfy the brecht requirement of showing that he was actually prejudiced by the state court error.ayala,at.accordingly,we will affirm the judgment of the district court on this aspect of johnson appeal.
iv.due process claim 
johnson also claims a separate violation of his due process right occurred when the prosecutor successfully insisted that slaughter take the stand with full knowledge that the witness would assert his fifth amendment right.johnson br.the superior court rejected this claim on the merits,as did the magistrate judge in her report and recommendation which the district court adopted.johnson,civ.action,wl,at noting that johnson arguments rely on portions of namet united states,involving merely dicta.
we do not need to determine whether we owe deference to the superior court determination because we do not think the authorities johnson relies upon clearly establish a due process violation.aedpa permits habeas relief only where a state court unreasonably applies clearly established federal law.c learly established federal law means the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the supreme court at the time the state court renders its decision.dennis sec y.dep t of,cir.quoting lockyer andrade.importantly,it only refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions.yarborough alvarado,quoting williams taylor.

accordingly,we will affirm the district court rejection of johnson separate due process claim as well.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm the district court order.

at least two houses on the street functioned as crack houses,including the house in which bowens testified she intended to get high.there was some indication that johnson and slaughter sold drugs from these houses also,and that bowens and williams,as well as others,would buy their drugs from there.we note that while defense counsel objected to some of these questions concerning the nature of those houses,other testimony regarding the houses was admitted into evidence.
