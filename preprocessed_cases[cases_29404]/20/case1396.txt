john david ruelas pleaded guilty to open murder for causing his mother death.at his degree hearing,where a judge was to find the proper level of criminal homicide for ruelas based on his plea,he was found guilty of murder.ruelas has now filed a petition for a writ of federal habeas corpus,contending that his plea was not made knowingly or voluntarily and was thus unconstitutional.the district court agreed,and granted him a conditional writ of habeas corpus.because we believe that even if his plea was involuntary any constitutional error was harmless,we reverse.
in,ruelas,then years old,moved back into his mother house after he and his wife divorced.ruelas and his mother frequently argued,and in january of that year,he referred to his as a bitch.his mother scolded him,and he gave her a couple of strikings.as a result,his mother,years old,died.
ruelas was arrested and,in july,pleaded guilty to open murder in exchange for the dismissal of a second felony offender charge.in michigan,open murder pleas permit a judge to determine,based on the plea agreement,what level of criminal homicide is appropriate.the plea agreement between ruelas and the prosecutor stated that the circuit court would consider murder,murder,and manslaughter.murder carried a possible sentence of up to life with no parole second was life with the opportunity for parole manslaughter was capped at fifteen years in jail.the circuit court,after ruling out,found ruelas guilty of murder.ruelas was sentenced to months to years in prison with the possibility of parole.
ruelas then began a series of challenges to his guilty plea and conviction.these culminated in an attempt to withdraw his plea.the trial court construed his motion to withdraw his plea as a motion for relief from judgment and denied it.ruelas argued first that the circuit court never mentioned manslaughter when it found him guilty of murder,and,second,that at the time ruelas pleaded to and was found guilty of murder,manslaughter could not have been considered during an open murder hearing under michigan law.ruelas argued that this rendered his plea involuntary because he thought he had a shot of being found guilty of merely manslaughter.
the state courts denied this claim,finding that his plea was not involuntary and,even if it was,any such error was harmless.ruelas then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court,alleging among other things,that his plea was unknowing and involuntary and that his guilty plea must be vacated as a result.ruelas does not argue that someone else killed his mother he argues that the highest charge sustainable against him is manslaughter.br.of at.the district court rejected most of ruelas arguments but agreed that his guilty plea was improper and further that this defect had a substantial and injurious effect on his conviction.the district court granted the writ because it concluded that ruelas was likely to have pleaded innocent if he had known he was ineligible for manslaughter,and therefore he was entitled to habeas relief.michigan appeals.
two minor points must be cleared up before addressing the merits.first,michigan argues that,though ruelas otherwise exhausted his state remedies before filing his habeas petition,we should nevertheless dismiss his claim as unexhausted because there is a chance that,were he to file a new motion in state court,michigan courts might change the law and allow his petition to proceed.specifically,michigan argues that,were we to dismiss ruelas case,the michigan courts might find the supreme court decision in castro united states,d persuasive.in castro,the court held that if a court construes a pro se petitioner motion to have been asserted under a ground different than the one stated,the motion only counts as a first petition under,if the pro se petitioner was warned that the motion would have preclusive effect.id.at.it is a sound rule.
but no michigan court has ever cited castro,and,being grounded in the court supervisory power over lower federal courts,it is not directly binding on them.id.at.michigan attorney general argues,nevertheless,that michigan courts will surely see castro wisdom,and thus this court should dismiss ruelas claim and give them the opportunity to see if they want to adopt the rule for themselves.the ag further assures us that,if we took this action,he would argue for,not against,adoption of the castro rule,even though that would be against the state interests at that point.suffice to say that we can not accept that argument.it is wholly speculative whether michigan would adopt the castro rule,as it is under no compulsion to do so.and we do not even know if ruelas claim would properly fit within motion to withdraw was as a motion for relief from judgment,but michigan would have to delineate the contours of its own castro rule based on michigan procedure,of which this court can not claim any expertise.moreover,dismissing ruelas case for this reason would suggest to michigan courts that they must adopt the castro we were them into adopting it because we,as federal judges,think it is a good idea.yet that is for michigan to decide.the state courts did not adopt the rule the first time ruelas filed for relief,and there is little reason for us to think they have changed their minds.in any event,even if we take the attorney general offer as one made in good faith,it is not to our knowledge enforceable,and it is not for us to force that office hand in a later stage of litigation,wholly apart from federal court.it is best for us to stay out of that speculative game.we hold that ruelas exhausted his state court remedies,and that this appeal is properly before us.
second,after the district court granted judgment in favor of ruelas on his involuntary guilty plea claim,michigan filed a motion for relief from judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b.michigan then appealed this case to this court two days later,and then its b motion with the district court.that motion sought an evidentiary hearing into whether ruelas plea was voluntary,and the state submitted affidavits from the trial prosecutor and defense counsel.the district court has not yet acted on this b motion.
in its brief in this case,michigan improperly relies on evidence it submitted when it filed its b motion.this evidence is not properly before us.first,the district court correctly did not rule on the b motion while this appeal remained pending,as it lost jurisdiction over it after an appeal of a trial court final judgment has been perfected by the filing of a notice of appeal,the trial court no longer has jurisdiction to grant a rule b motion.pickens howes,cir.the district was free,however,to indicate that it would grant the motion,which would allow the appellant to make a motion in this court for a remand of the case so that the district court c ould grant relief.id.at quoting bovee coopers lybrand,cir.that did not happen here,and in any event,the grant of appeal in this case rendered the b any evidence attached thereto that was not part of this to this case.parties may not rely on evidence outside of the record,and that includes the evidence michigan submitted with their b motion,which,as explained above,is treated as an entirely separate proceeding.thus,because those documents were never introduced to either the state courts nor to the district court in this case,we may not consult those documents.and,for the reasons explained below,we do not need to consult that evidence to resolve this case.
on a federal habeas appeal from a state court judgment,we review a district court legal conclusions and mixed questions of law and fact de novo,and we review its factual findings for clear error.armstrong morgan,cir lucas,cir.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,a federal court may not set aside a state judgment sustaining a prisoner conviction without finding that the decision is contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented to the state courts.d.a state court decision is contrary to established federal law if the state court arrived at a conclusion opposite to one reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if it decides a case differently than the supreme court on materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a state court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law if it identified the correct legal principle but unreasonably applied that standard to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.and although clearly established federal law in d simply refers to the holdings of the supreme court,courts may look to the lower courts of appeals decisions to inform the analysis of supreme court holdings in determining whether a legal principle has been clearly established by the supreme court.hereford warren,cir citing hill hofbauer,cir.
a defendant who pleads guilty waives a number of federal constitutional rights,including the right to a jury trial and the right to confront his accusers.boykin alabama,d.because of the importance of these rights,reviewing courts must ensure that the defendant waiver was knowing and voluntary.we therefore insist that the defendant appreciated the consequences of the waiver,did so without coercion,and understood the rights surrendered.brady united states,d fautenberry mitchell,cir.specifically,guilty pleas not only must be voluntary but must be knowing,intelligent acts done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.brady,at.the supreme court defines a voluntary plea as one entered by one fully aware of the direct consequences.id.at.
while a defendant need not know all the possible consequences of his plea,like the loss of his right to vote or own a gun,or the effect on future sentence,he must be aware of the maximum sentence to which he is exposed.king dutton,cir hart marion corr,cir.and,a t a minimum,the defendant must understand the critical or essential elements of the offense to which he or she pleads guilty.united states valdez,cir citing bousley united states,d.the satisfaction of these requirements can not be inferred from the bare fact that the defendant pleaded guilty,because he still might not have known what he was giving up when he did so.boykin,at.
ruelas argues that his guilty plea was invalid because,contrary to the plea terms,manslaughter was not a permissible option during his open murder hearing under michigan law.the law has since changed were ruelas to plead guilty to open murder today,manslaughter could be considered.he argues that his plea was thus involuntary and that he should be permitted to withdraw it.in support,ruelas contends both that michigan law forbade manslaughter from being imposed,so the guilty plea should be held invalid on some kind of mutual mistake theory,and further that the circuit court never discussed manslaughter during his degree hearing,instead concluding that murder applied after ruling out murder.but things are not quite so simple.
michigan law was in flux when ruelas pleaded guilty.it was not clear whether manslaughter was a lesser included offense of thus could be considered during an open murder was not.plea agreements may be held invalid if prosecutors,defense counsel,and the court are confused or mistaken as to the law,bousley,at,and so,ruelas argues,his plea was invalid because the judge at his degree hearing was compelled by law to ignore manslaughter,contra to his plea.but maybe not our court has explained,under michigan law in effect during this period,that i f,based on the evidence adduced at the degree hearing,the trial judge determine d that a conviction for manslaughter but not murder wa s warranted,the trial judge is required to refuse to accept the plea of guilty to the charge of murder.berry mintzes,cir citing people middleton.so it is possible that manslaughter was still on the table as a practical matter,the only difference being that the judge was required to take the extra step of refusing the plea and institute a manslaughter conviction,rather than to do so directly and under the plea agreement.in any event,michigan appears to have outgrown this temporary oddity and now manslaughter may be considered under an open murder plea because it is considered a lesser included or inferior crime to murder.people mendoza.
yet,even if we assume that michigan law forbade the circuit court from considering manslaughter,it is ambiguous what it in fact considered if it did consider manslaughter,even if that was contrary to the law at the time,then it is not clear what ruelas lost.indeed,the circuit court simply never used the word manslaughter,stating only 
the court could not find any specific intent in this case.the court could not find a premeditated murder.and so,murder one is out.but,i do think that murder two was well demonstrated.the defendant did great bodily harm to the victim knowing that he created a high risk of death,or great bodily harm knowing that death from such harm would like result from his actions.and so,the court does make a finding that ruelas is guilty of murder under the laws of this state.
it explained that it was sentencing ruelas to rather than murder because he lacked premeditation.ruelas argues,however,that the court failure to distinguish manslaughter from murder,which the court found him guilty of,indicated that manslaughter was not considered.yet,under michigan law,the difference between murder and manslaughter is that a manslaughter conviction requires the defendant to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he killed in the heat of passion,with such passion caused by adequate provocation,without a lapse of time during which a reasonable person could control his actions.mendoza,at.moreover,the presence of provocation was something ruelas was required to prove,and the fact that the circuit court did not mention manslaughter does not automatically mean that it did not consider it ruelas offers little evidence of provocation.
the final sticky point is,even assuming that the judge could not consider manslaughter,whether that is legally sufficient to render his plea involuntary.on one hand,courts have focused on whether the defendant was aware of the maximum possible sentence,not the minimum.dutton,at.on the other,plea bargains are essentially contracts,puckett united states,d,and courts have long set those aside where the parties here,the prosecutors and defendant,made a mutual mistake,raffles wichelhaus,ex.extending that reasoning here would mean that the plea was invalid because both sides did not know what they were bargaining for,as one of the plea key shot at getting only not actually on the table.the district court did not discuss these concerns,and merely assumed that if michigan could not sentence ruelas to manslaughter then a violation occurred.
but we need not resolve these factual and the simplest way to resolve this case is to assume that michigan either could not or did not consider manslaughter,and to further assume such error rendered ruelas guilty plea involuntary.we thus assume a constitutional violation,so the question is whether that violation was harmless or not.
ruelas argues that a finding that his guilty plea was involuntary ought to end his case because all such errors are structural.structural errors are those that defy analysis by normal harmless error standards,arizona fulminante,d,because their consequences are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate,so reversal is automatic.united states,d.ruelas case,however,neither defies harmless error standards nor is the harm unquantifiable and indeterminate.his argument otherwise relies on a faulty premise that the remedy for all involuntary guilty pleas is the right to go back,plead innocent,and have a trial.that is sometimes the remedy,but not always,and not here.habeas courts have broad discretion in crafting remedies for constitutional errors.see pickens,at.and,because guilty pleas are in the nature of contracts,puckett.at,the remedy for ruelas is specific performance of what he bargained for a degree hearing where murder,murder,and manslaughter could all be considered,pickens,at w e hold that it is unnecessary to permit a person to withdraw an illegal plea or require the state to retry a case when the
