opinion of the court 
kerby keller,a pennsylvania prisoner serving a life sentence for the murder of his wife,appeals the denial of his federal habeas corpus petition.he argues that his federal constitutional right to due process was violated by the introduction at trial of highly prejudicial evidence having little probative value and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because his trial attorney did not adequately prepare for or respond to testimony by the prosecution psychiatric expert,who stated that keller might have suffered from a condition called sadistic personality disorder.we hold that keller did not fairly present his federal due process claim to the pennsylvania courts and that this claim is now barred by procedural default.we reject keller ineffective assistance of counsel claim because he has not shown that the pennsylvania courts application of the prejudice prong of the strickland washington,d,standard for judging ineffective assistance of counsel claims was unreasonable.see d.we therefore affirm.
keller was once a member of a motorcycle gang called the pagans,and his wife,barbara,was a nude dancer.when they married in,keller purportedly renounced his association with the pagans,barbara abandoned her career as a dancer,and the couple moved to a farm in lancaster county,pennsylvania.in,barbara announced that she was leaving keller and their son and moving in with her parents in pittsburgh.keller subsequently learned that barbara did not go to pittsburgh,and he enlisted a private investigator to locate her.
on june,barbara telephoned keller and revealed that she was living with gary reiter,a friend who resided down the lane from the keller farm.later that day,when barbara returned to the farm,keller shot and killed her.he then telephoned reiter and asked that he come to the farm.when reiter arrived,keller ran out of the house firing a rifle at reiter truck.bullets hit the truck,but reiter was able to drive away unharmed.keller returned to the house and telephoned friends and family members to tell them what he had done.he wrote what appeared to be a suicide note,but he did not attempt to kill himself and instead surrendered to the police.
the prosecution argued that keller had premeditated his wife murder,and the prosecution attempted to prove that keller motive might have been his discovery that barbara had been providing information about the pagans to the federal bureau of investigation.the prosecution theorized that keller lured barbara to the house and tied her up on the second floor but that she broke free and was running away from the house when keller shot and killed her.the prosecution introduced evidence of her work for the fbi,as well as evidence that during keller telephone conversations following the shooting,he had connected the killing with pressure resulting from the fbi investigation.in addition,keller suicide note stated lots of stress.all the harassment.unfounded investigation by the fbi,crime commission,the prosecution theory that keller killed his wife because she was informing on the pagans provided a basis for introducing evidence regarding keller association with the gang and its activities 
the defense presented the following,different version of the events.when barbara arrived at the farm,keller urged her to return to him.barbara said that she intended to resume exotic dancing and threw at keller a stack of photos depicting her dancing.the argument became physical,and barbara locked herself in a bedroom upstairs.keller broke down the bedroom door and found that barbara had climbed out the window and was fleeing.keller grabbed his gun and shot and killed his wife.
at trial,keller defense was based on insanity or the inability to form the intent needed for murder.the defense psychiatric expert,abram hostetter,diagnosed keller as suffering from a major depressive disorder.hostetter testified that in his opinion keller satisfied all of the nine criteria for such a diagnosis listed in the third revised edition of the american psychiatric association diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ed,a standard reference work that lists and describes mental disorders.hostetter opined that keller major depression had reached psychotic proportions at the time of the killing,that keller did not fully understand the nature and quality of his acts at that moment,and that he had not planned to kill his wife.app.other witnesses testified to keller increasingly distraught behavior over his wife infidelity.
to rebut hostetter,the commonwealth called its own psychiatric expert,kurtis jens.jens had not examined keller,but based on information provided to him about keller and his behavior during the time leading up to the killing,jens expressed the opinion that keller did not suffer from a major depressive order.trial tr.at.jens stated that the symptoms noted by hostetter were often exhibited for a limited period of time by people suffering from any severe distress,and he stated that hostetter had not noted any psychotic symptoms.app.he expressed the opinion that keller was capable of knowing right from wrong and forming a specific intent to kill.id.at.in addition,in response to a lengthy hypothetical question posed by the assistant district attorney,jens opined that keller might suffer from either of two personality disorders,antisocial personality disorder or sadistic personality disorder.id.at.consistent with this latter possible diagnosis,the commonwealth put on evidence of prior sadistic acts by keller,including testimony that he had tied up and brutally beaten a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair and testimony that he had severely beaten a man who had asked barbara to dance in a bar.
in march,keller was convicted by a jury in the lancaster county court of common pleas of murder in the first degree and attempted murder in the first degree.he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for life and a consecutive term of five to ten years in prison.the superior court of pennsylvania affirmed the judgment,and the supreme court of pennsylvania denied keller petition for allowance of appeal.keller then filed a petition under pennsylvania post conviction relief act.ann.et west.after an evidentiary hearing,the trial judge denied keller petition.the superior court affirmed,and the pennsylvania supreme court declined review.
keller next filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to with the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.keller argued,among other things,that the admission of highly prejudicial evidence regarding the pagans and his wife work as an informant had deprived him of due process as guaranteed by the federal constitution and that his counsel was ineffective in dealing with jens testimony.
the magistrate judge to whom keller petition was referred recommended that it be denied.she concluded that in the state court proceedings keller had challenged the admission of the evidence concerning the pagans on grounds only and that his federal constitutional claim regarding that evidence was barred by procedural default.she also held that the state courts conclusion that keller trial counsel was not ineffective under the strickland standard was not vulnerable to attack pursuant to d.
the district court followed the magistrate judge recommendation,although it did not agree with some of her reasoning.keller larkins,d.the district court concluded that keller had fairly presented his due process claim in the state court proceeding because he had contended that the admission of the evidence in question had deprived him of a fair trial.id.at.the district court held,however,that the admission of this evidence did not rise to the level of constitutional error.id.at.with respect to keller ineffective assistance claim,the district court held that trial counsel had not provided adequate representation in connection with jens testimony but that keller had failed to demonstrate prejudice arising from trial counsel performance.id.at.accordingly,the district court denied the habeas petition but granted a certificate of appealability.id.at.
the first claim on appeal is that the admission of evidence of keller association with the pagans and barbara role as an fbi informant deprived keller of due process under the federal constitution.keller contends that the commonwealth lacked proof of keller knowledge that his wife was an informant and that,accordingly,evidence regarding his association with the pagans was not probative but was highly prejudicial.as is required in order to show that an evidentiary error of this type rose to the level of a due process violation,keller contends that it was of such magnitude as to undermine the fundamental fair ness of the entire trial.mccandless vaughn,cir lesko owens,cir.in response to keller argument,the commonwealth contends,first,that the magistrate judge was correct in holding that keller due process claim is barred by procedural default and,second,that the district court was correct in rejecting the claim on the merits.
we agree with the commonwealth that keller federal due process claim is barred by procedural default.in the absence of an explicit waiver by the state,a federal court is permitted under b a to grant a state prisoner petition for a writ of habeas corpus only if the petitioner has exhausted available remedies.a petitioner has not exhausted such remedies if he has the right under state law to raise his claim by any available procedure.c.to satisfy the exhaustion requirement,a federal habeas claim must have been fairly presented to the state courts.picard connor,d.this means that a petitioner must present a federal claim factual and legal substance to the state courts in a manner that puts them on notice that a federal claim is being asserted.mccandless,at.it is not sufficient that all the facts necessary to support the federal claim were before the state courts,anderson harless,d,and mere similarity of claims is insufficient to exhaust.duncan henry,d.
here,there is no doubt that keller challenged the admission of the evidence relating to the pagans and barbara work as an informant in the state court proceedings,but keller did not give the state courts fair notice that he was asserting a federal constitutional claim rather than a claim that the trial court violated state rules of evidence.on direct appeal,keller superior court brief devoted more than eight pages to this issue.see brief for appellant at,commonwealth keller,phila.july.citing numerous state cases based on state law,the brief cogently argued that the admission of the evidence in question violated the governing pennsylvania standards regarding proof of uncharged bad acts and that the evidence should have been excluded on the ground that its prejudicial impact outweighed its probative value.neither the federal constitution nor any judicial decision based on the federal constitution was mentioned.keller petition for allowance of appeal to the supreme court of pennsylvania was similar.see petition for allowance of appeal at,commonwealth keller,allocatur.neither the superior court brief nor the petition fairly presented a federal constitutional claim.the superior court,the highest state court to entertain keller claim on the merits,understood it to be based on state law,and this reading was entirely reasonable.
in arguing that he fairly presented a federal constitutional claim to the pennsylvania courts,keller relies entirely on passing references to the concept of a fair trial in his state court papers.his brief in the superior court contained one sentence referring to this concept,as did his petition for allowance of appeal.keller maintains these references were enough to give the state courts notice that he was raising not just ordinary evidentiary issues,but a federal due process claim.
keller argument is reminiscent of one rejected by the supreme court in duncan henry,supra.there,the habeas petitioner,henry,challenged the admission of evidence in state court on grounds,arguing that the evidence was irrelevant and inflammatory and resulted in a miscarriage of justice.id.at.the ninth circuit held that henry claim was essentially the same as a claim that he had been denied the fundamental fairness guaranteed by the federal due process guarantee.see henry estelle,cir.the supreme court,however,held that henry argument in state court was insufficient to give the state courts fair notice that he was asserting a federal constitutional claim.the court wrote 
if state courts are to be given the opportunity to correct alleged violations of prisoners federal rights,they must surely be alerted to the fact that the prisoners are asserting claims under the united states constitution.if a habeas petitioner wishes to claim that an evidentiary ruling at a state court trial denied him the due process of law guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment,he must say so,not only in federal court,but in state court.
duncan,at.the court observed that the state court understandably confined its analysis to the application of state law.id.concurring in the judgment,justice souter,joined by two other justices,wrote that henry miscarriage of justice claim in state court was reasonably understood to raise a issue of prejudice,not a federal issue of due process.id.at.souter,concurring in the judgment.thus,the court held that asserting that an evidentiary error produced a miscarriage of justice was not sufficient to put the state courts on notice that henry was arguing that the error violated federal due process requirements.
in the face of duncan henry,supra,we can not hold that keller fairly presented a federal due process claim to the state courts.keller,like henry,did not invoke the federal due process guarantee in the state courts.henry claimed that admission of the evidence produced a miscarriage of justice keller argues that the admission of evidence denied him a fair trial.since the supreme court found the former language insufficient to give fair notice of a federal due process claim,we are hesitant to attach greater significance to the passing reference to the concept of a fair trial on which keller argument rests.here,as in duncan henry,we believe that the superior court understandably confined its analysis to the application of state law,duncan,at,and reasonably understood keller to raise a issue only.id.at.souter,concurring in the judgment.
our decision in mccandless supports this conclusion.in that case,the prosecution was permitted to put on evidence that its cooperation agreement with its key witness was conditioned upon corroboration of the witness assistance.in state court,the habeas petitioner challenged the admission of this evidence on grounds,contending that the cooperation agreement testimony was irrelevant and prejudicial and therefore improperly admitted.at.we concluded that the petitioner had not fairly presented his federal constitutional claim to the state courts,and we view keller state court arguments here as analogous to those that we found inadequate in mccandless.
to be sure,we did note at one point in the mccandless opinion that the petitioner state court papers never mentioned the terms constitution,due process or even fair trial.id.emphasis added.we certainly did not hold,however,that a passing reference to the concept of a fair trial would have been enough to alter our decision,and such a conclusion,we think,would have been inconsistent with the plain thrust of duncan henry,supra,on which mccandless squarely relied.see id.we thus hold that keller current federal due process claim was not fairly presented to the pennsylvania courts.
if keller could still present his federal claim to the state courts at this late date,we would be compelled to dismiss his petition,but it is undisputed that the pennsylvania courts would not entertain that claim.as the magistrate judge noted,keller is barred from seeking further relief in state court because the statute of limitations for filing another pcra petition has expired.see.ann.b west.as a result,his federal due process claim is now procedurally defaulted.see mccandless,at.federal courts may not consider procedurally defaulted claims unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the a
