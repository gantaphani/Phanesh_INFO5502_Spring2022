background 
in,a trial judge in ohio state court found sandra maxwell griffin guilty of complicity to aggravated murder with specifications,complicity to unlawful possession of a dangerous ordnance,complicity to grand theft,and complicity to aggravated robbery with a firearm specification.griffin then obtained new counsel and unsuccessfully appealed her case to the ohio supreme court,arguing that the trial court had violated her fifth,eighth,and fourteenth amendment rights by not following certain state laws regarding her waiver of trial by jury or by panel and regarding the length of her sentence.she lost her appeals,and her conviction became final in.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa became effective on april,and prisoners whose state convictions already had become final were required to file any petitions for habeas corpus relief within one year of that date.see isham randle,cir,cert.denied,d.represented by the ohio public defender office,griffin filed for habeas corpus relief on april.the petition was assigned to judge holschuh.although in her initial petition griffin raised just one ground for relief,namely the trial court failure to follow mandatory statutory requirements of a proceeding in violation of her due process and equal protection rights,at,in her reply to the warden return of writ she expanded her claims.griffin argued that her waiver of trial by jury or by a panel,as provided under ohio law,was neither knowing nor intelligent and that her sentence exceeded that permitted under law.the district court determined that these were clearly distinct from the argument that she presented to the state courts,noted that the new arguments appear to have been procedurally defaulted,and offered griffin the opportunity to demonstrate cause and prejudice before the court would dismiss the claims as procedurally defaulted.at dist.order.griffin argued that the cause of her failure to present the arguments in state court was her counsel ineffective assistance.
judge holschuh ruled that,although ineffective assistance of appellate counsel can constitute cause for procedural default,the petitioner must present the ineffective assistance claim itself to the state courts before using it to excuse the default.because griffin had not brought that claim to the state courts,she could not yet present it to the federal court in a habeas petition.judge holschuh concluded,if she wishes,at some point,to make such an ineffective assistance argument here,petitioner must present her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel to the state courts.at dist.order.on september,the court denied her petition and dismissed the case without prejudice for her failure to establish cause for her procedural default.at.
after this dismissal,griffin filed an application to reopen in state court pursuant to ohio rule of appellate procedure b so that she could press the ineffective assistance claim.the date on which she filed for this relief is not in the record.the supreme court of ohio ultimately dismissed her case without opinion on september.
griffin then returned to judge holschuh,filing on october,a habeas petition under her previous case number.in her,she alerted the court to the fact that she was filing it under the original case number,because it merely continued her previous attack.she also noted that,because her previous filing had been dismissed without prejudice to permit exhaustion,this subsequent filing was not a second or successive petition prohibited under b.at.in this petition,griffin also included notice of the claims that she had brought in her state application to reopen.however,on friday,october,judge holschuh ordered the clerk to strike griffin new filing under the previous case number and directed the clerk to file it with a new case number and assign it to a judge using the ordinary selection process.at dist.order.judge holschuh noted that because the previous case had closed and the petitioner had offered no grounds to reopen the previous case,the petition should be filed under a different case number,and the district judge to which it would then be assigned should consider independently whether to entertain the petition or reject it as a second or successive petition.judge holschuh stated that t he assignment or of a new civil number to a case is obviously not conclusive on the issue of whether the petitioner is entitled to file a second habeas corpus petition,and n othing in this order is intended to convey any opinion as to whether the new petition is or is not a successive petition or has otherwise been properly filed.at.
griffin her second petition on monday,october,and it was given a new case number and assigned to judge smith.after briefing,judge smith dismissed the action for failure to file within the limitation period for actions.the district court noted that when griffin filed her first habeas petition on april,two days before the deadline was to have run,days of her statute of limitations had lapsed.that petition had been dismissed on september.without knowing the actual date of her state court filing,the district court assumed that griffin immediately filed her state court application and that this filing tolled the running of her federal statute of limitations.the district court ruled that when the state court application was resolved on september,griffin had two days in which to return to federal court.she did not submit her second petition until october,after the statute of limitations had run.therefore,the district court dismissed griffin petition.
griffin timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction under.
ii.analysis 
we review a district court disposition of a habeas corpus petition de novo.see harris stovall,cir,cert.denied,d.
because griffin habeas petition was filed after aedpa became effective on april,the provisions of that act apply to this case.aedpa states that a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.d.the statute of limitations begins to run from the latest of four circumstances,which in this case is april,the date on which aedpa became effective.although griffin filed her initial petition on april,with two days remaining in her statute of limitations,her subsequent filings were well after the statutory deadline.the question is during which of those subsequent filings,if any,the statute of limitations was tolled,and whether her final filing in october of was untimely.we take each relevant period in turn.
relevant periods 
the first relevant period is the period from april,when griffin filed her initial petition with judge holschuh,to september,when judge holschuh dismissed the petition without prejudice.the supreme court decision in duncan walker,d,makes clear that the federal habeas statutes do not toll the statute of limitations while the federal habeas petition is pending.section d provides for the statute of limitations to be tolled for t he time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review is pending.d.in duncan,the supreme court held that this provides for tolling only during the pendency of state proceedings,not federal proceedings.duncan,at.accordingl
