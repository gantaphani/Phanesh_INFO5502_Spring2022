after a jury trial in the massachusetts superior court,scott kirwan was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison for killing steven meagher.kirwan appealed,and the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc affirmed his conviction.see commonwealth kirwan.
kirwan filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court,which the court denied,adopting without further explanation the magistrate judge report and recommendation.see kirwan spencer,slip op.at.kirwan then applied for a certificate of appealability coa as to the denial of the writ.the district court granted the coa as to two of the grounds in kirwan petition.thus,the following issues are on appeal whether certain remarks by the prosecutor during closing argument deprived kirwan of his rights to a fair trial and due process,and whether trial counsel failure to object to,and seek curative instructions following,the prosecutor allegedly improper remarks deprived kirwan of his right to effective assistance of counsel.
background 
a.the night of meagher 
on july,at approximately,kirwan and his friend brian perry walked from the apartment building in which they both lived to a crowded bar across the street.there,kirwan had several brief encounters with meagher.the first,essentially a continuation of an earlier argument,ended when perry told kirwan and meagher to grow up and shake hands.during the second,an angry kirwan told meagher that they could take it outside,but meagher walked away.between the second and third encounters,kirwan left the bar for approximately fifteen minutes,ostensibly to record a movie that was scheduled to be televised at midnight.before kirwan left the bar to record the movie,he spoke with perry.as discussed below,kirwan mentioned something about a shank to perry.when kirwan returned,meagher was still at the bar.during their third encounter,meagher approached kirwan and they argued.shortly thereafter,kirwan told perry that he was worried about meagher and another man,leo purcell,who was with meagher.as meagher left the bar,he and kirwan again exchanged words.kirwan then mentioned to perry that he was worried that he was going to have to fight meagher and purcell.approximately ten minutes later,meagher came back into the bar and argued briefly with kirwan.
at approximately,kirwan and perry left the bar.outside,meagher drove his truck alongside kirwan,argued with him,and then parked his truck.kirwan and meagher approached each other in the street.kirwan punched meagher three times.the third time,he struck the front of meagher chest and had a shiny,metallic object in his hand.kirwan then yelled that he was going to get a gun and walked toward his home,approximately fifty feet away.meagher walked approximately thirty feet back toward his truck before falling flat on his face.police and an ambulance arrived and meagher was brought to a hospital,where he died.the cause of death was blood loss caused by a knife wound in his chest.a search of the scene later yielded a small knife with blood on it.the dna of the blood on the knife matched meagher dna.
b.the jury trial 
at trial,the prosecutor solicited testimony from perry regarding the statements that kirwan made before leaving the bar,ostensibly to record the movie.perry and the prosecutor had the following colloquy 
before the defendant left,perry,did he make a statement to you about getting some type of weapon 
a.he really did say it was a weapon.he said something about a shank.
tell us exactly what he said,would you 
i could exactly tell you what he said.he just said something about a shank.he was worried about the two guys sitting with his former girlfriend on the other side,and he was worried about wanting to pick up a shank or something like that.
so,he said he was going home 
a.he was going home for the taping,yes.
said he was going to get a shank 
a.he just said something about a shank.
q.how many times did he say it to you 
i remember twice.
q.did he say it differently the second time 
q.what did he say the second time,exactly,if you recall 
like i said,i had a lot to drink that night,and i would say he just mentioned something about a shank.i did even know what it was.
never seen a prison movie 
defense counsel objection.
the court yes,sustained.
q.after he said this about the shank,did you see him leave 
a.he left before,yes.
in his closing argument,the prosecutor relied in large part upon perry testimony to establish premeditation.the prosecutor stated a number of times,using various terms,that kirwan went home to get a weapon in addition,his closing argument included a quotation of a statement that kirwan supposedly made to perry about the shank 
it is the most critical piece of evidence,ladies and gentlemen,that statement to brian perry,i going to go get my shank,not once,not twice,then going home and arming himself,because that shows beyond any reasonable doubt what his intentions were.
brian perry can tell you all he wanted he did understand what that was about.again,draw on your collective experience and common sense.i going to get my shank,but it gets better than that,because if you look at the evidence on the whole,he comes back,which he did have to do.
emphasis added.
c.the sjc opinion 
on appeal to the sjc,kirwan raised two arguments that are relevant here.first,he argued that the prosecutor had committed prosecutorial misconduct by arguing a critical fact not in evidence during his closing statement.second,kirwan asserted a related claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the grounds that his lawyer failed to object to the relevant portions of the closing statement and failed to seek curative instructions.kirwan first argument had two components.he claimed that it was improper to ask the jury to conclude that kirwan said he went home to arm himself,and that he in fact did so,because these conclusions were not grounded in the evidence,and even if it was proper to argue that the jury could draw these inferences,it was improper for the prosecutor to argue that perry explicitly testified that kirwan said i going to go get my shank.
the sjc dismissed both arguments.first,apparently addressing the first component of the prosecutorial misconduct argument,it explained that c ontrary to kirwan assertion,the prosecutor argument that kirwan said he was going home to get a shank was supported by the evidence.kirwan,at.according to the sjc,perry testimony about his conversation with kirwan shortly before kirwan left the bar permitted an inference that kirwan expressed an intention to go home,in part,to get a shank.id.at.in handling the second component of this argument,the sjc said the following in his decision on the defendant motion for a new trial,the judge observed that,even if the prosecutor had misquoted perry as to what the defendant had said,the statement attributed to the defendant was fairly inferable from the evidence.the argument was not improper.id.the sjc then add ed that the jury were instructed that it was their memory of the testimony that was controlling,not that of the attorneys or even the judge.id.having resolved the prosecutorial misconduct issue,the sjc simply noted,because there was no misconduct on the part of the prosecutor,there was no ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to object.id.
ii.discussion 
kirwan first argues that the prosecutor deprived him of his rights to a fair trial and due process by arguing in summation that kirwan said he was going home to get a shank,and that he indeed went home to retrieve a shank,before killing meagher.kirwan contends that the prosecutor should not have encouraged the jury to draw these inferences because they were not grounded in the evidence he also contends that it was improper for the prosecutor to misquote perry as saying that kirwan had told him i going to go get my shank.second,kirwan argues that his right to effective assistance of counsel was violated because his counsel failed to object and seek curative instructions when the prosecutor mentioned the shank during closing argument.we address each claim in turn after discussing the statutory framework for habeas review.
a.the statutory framework 
under the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,a federal court may not grant habeas relief with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in s tate court unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that either was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established f ederal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.d.if the relevant claim has not been adjudicated on the merits in state court,we review that claim de novo.clements clarke,cir.in addition,aedpa provides that in federal habeas cases,a determination of a factual issue made by a s tate court shall be presumed to be correct and t he applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e.the parties disagree about whether any of the sjc conclusions are entitled to the presumption of correctness under e and also about the applicability of d here.we address those issues below.
denial of the right to a fair trial 
standard of review 
we review the district court denial of habeas corpus relief de novo.clements,at.we may affirm on any basis apparent in the record.chiang verizon new england,cir.
the parties dispute the applicability of two sections of aedpa to kirwan prosecutorial misconduct claim.the government contends that this court should treat as presumptively correct,under e,the sjc conclusion that the inference that kirwan said he was going home to get a shank was supported by the record.kirwan,on the other hand,argues that the presumption of correctness under section e does not apply to that conclusion.we determine below that the sjc correctly concluded that the evidence at trial permitted the inference that kirwan said he returned home to get a shank.thus,we need not decide whether that conclusion is entitled to the presumption of correctness under section e.see forsyth spencer,cir declining to determine whether section e presumption of correctness applies where petitioner could not prevail even under a standard arguably more favorable to him.
in addition,the parties dispute whether the sjc determination that there was no prosecutorial misconduct is entitled to deference under section d,and whether any related factual determinations are entitled to deference under section d,assuming they are not entitled to deference under section e.section d applies to claims that have been adjudicated on the merits in s tate court.d.deference to the state court determination is warranted if the court either expressly resolved the federal claim on its merits or adjudicated it under a state law standard that is at least as protective of the defendant rights as its federal counterpart.young murphy,cir quoting foxworth amand,cir,cert.denied.the government argues that the sjc applied a state standard that is the functional equivalent of the federal standard when it relied on commonwealth duguay,in resolving the prosecutorial misconduct issue.thus,the government claims,the sjc decision is entitled to deferential review under section d,and any factual determinations that are not entitled to the presumption of correctness under section e are entitled to deferential review under section d.kirwan contends that the standard set out in duguay is not as protective of his rights as the standard in darden wainright,and donnelly dechristoforo,and therefore he is entitled to de novo review.because kirwan can not prevail even under the de novo standard,we assume without deciding that section d is inapplicable here.see obershaw lanman,cir declining to decide whether deferential aedpa standard of review applies because petitioner would lose even under de novo standard.
we first address kirwan contention that the prosecutor argument that kirwan said he was going home to get a shank and then went home to retrieve the shank was improper because it was not supported by the evidence.the relevant question is whether the prosecutor comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.darden,at quoting donnelly,at.we conclude that both the inference that kirwan returned home to retrieve a knife and the inference that he stated his intention to perry were grounded in the evidence,and thus that the comments urging the jury to accept these inferences did not so infect the trial with unfairness,donnelly,at,as to constitute a due process violation.
kirwan correctly points out that at one point,when the prosecutor asked perry if kirwan had s aid he was going to get a shank,kirwan replied,he just said something about a shank.this testimony,in isolation,might suggest that kirwan did not tell perry that he was going home to get a shank and did not,in fact,retrieve a shank at home.viewed,however,in light of the surrounding testimony,this statement does not negate the inference that kirwan went home to get a shank.prior to this statement,perry testified as follows in response to a question from the prosecutor 
before the defendant left,perry,did he make a statement to you about getting some type of weapon 
a.he really did say it was a weapon.he said something about a shank.
in his initial answer,perry did not deny that kirwan said he was going home to get something he simply clarified that perry did not refer to a weapon,but rather used the word shank.the direct examination continued as follows 
tell us exactly what he said,would you 
i could exactly tell you what he said.he just said something about a shank.he was worried about the two guys sitting with his former girlfriend on the other side,and he was worried about wanting to pick up a shank or something like that.
here,perry answer again suggests that kirwan was going someplace to pick up a shank.
furthermore,the evidence at trial showed that after making these statements,kirwan went home kirwan later returned to the bar during his fight with meagher,he had a shiny metallic object in his hand meagher died of blood loss from a knife wound and a knife with blood matching the dna of meagher blood was found at the scene.given all of this evidence,it was proper for the prosecutor to argue in closing that kirwan told perry he was going home to retrieve a shank and then did so.therefore,this argument did not violate kirwan constitutional rights.
we next address kirwan contention that the prosecutor violated his constitutional rights when he argued that kirwan twice told perry i going to go get my shank.perry never testified that kirwan said i going to go get my shank.assuming that the prosecutor statement was improper,the statement still did not result in a constitutional violation.
where,as here,the allegedly objectionable statements do not implicate a specific right in the bill of rights,t he relevant question is whether the prosecutor comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.darden,at quoting donnelly,at.there is no precise federal standard governing due process claims based on a prosecutor remarks.dagley russo,cir.darden and donnelly,however,provide the relevant supreme court law.in darden,one prosecutor stated in summation,among other things,that the defendant should only be let out of his prison cell with a leash on,that he wished the victim had blown the defendant face off,and that he wished the defendant had used his final bullet on himself.at.in considering whether the closing argument violated the petitioner right to due process,the court noted that the summation did not manipulate or misstate the evidence,the judge instructed the jurors several times that their decision was to be made on the basis of the evidence alone,and that the arguments of counsel were not evidence,and t he weight of the evidence against petitioner was heavy.id.at.the court reasoned that this last factor was important because the overwhelming eyewitness and circumstantial evidence to support a finding of guilt on all charges reduced the likelihood that the jury decision was influenced by argument.id.quoting darden state,so d.
in donnelly,the prosecutor commen
