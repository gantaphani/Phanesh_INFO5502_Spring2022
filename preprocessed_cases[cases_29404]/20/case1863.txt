eric smiley was convicted of first degree intentional homicide,in violation of wisconsin statutes,a.the court of appeals of wisconsin affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct review,and smiley exhausted his state habeas remedies.smiley then filed in the district court a petition under for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court granted the writ.the state of wisconsin the state,through warden michael thurmer,timely filed a notice of appeal.
for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
smiley lived with his grandmother,his sister,monica walters,and walters boyfriend,christopher garrett.on the morning of june,walters discovered the dead body of garrett blocking the front door.she called the police,who initially believed that garrett had been the victim of a burglary homicide they surmised that garrett had been shot five times and that the shooting had occurred around midnight.after the police spoke with walters and with her grandmother,they expressed an interest in speaking with smiley.the police claim that they were interested in speaking with smiley because he lived in the home with garrett,not because he was a suspect.
upon discovering that they wanted to speak with him,smiley telephoned the police.the police told him to remain at his location,and they immediately dispatched three squad cars to pick him up.according to smiley,the police arrived within five minutes of his phone call.the police discovered that smiley had an outstanding municipal court warrant,and they formally arrested him based on that outstanding warrant.smiley explains,however,that they did not inform him of the reason for his arrest.
the first statement 
after arresting smiley,the police locked him in a holding cell in the police station.at about,the detectives investigating the garrett shooting escorted smiley from the holding cell to an interview room.the detectives told him that,although he was not a suspect,they wanted to question him about garrett shooting.it is undisputed that the detectives did not give smiley a miranda warning at this time.
the detectives had noticed that smiley had a significant and very noticeable limp,ex.w at,and they asked him about it smiley stated that he had tripped the previous day and injured his knee.the detectives also noticed an abrasion on his forehead and another on his left hand.when asked about these injuries,smiley said that he did not know how he had acquired them.
the police questioned smiley about garrett shooting.smiley denied any knowledge of the shooting,but he related that burglars had broken into his grandmother home on several occasions.smiley further said that garrett had not mentioned having problems with anyone.smiley also told the officers that he did not know of anyone who would want to harm garrett.smiley claimed that he had spent the night at a friend house.he explained that he had last spoken to garrett the previous afternoon and that he did not learn about the shooting until sometime after the next day,june.he denied owning a handgun,and he stated that he had not handled a gun since his arrest on a weapons charge in chicago six years earlier.
on several occasions,smiley attempted to rise from his chair each time the detectives ordered him to sit down.after about minutes of questioning,the detectives left the interview room for a few minutes.upon returning,they noticed that smiley had what appeared to be blood on his jacket and boots.the detectives asked smiley about it,and he explained that his girlfriend had given him the jacket and that,if there was blood on it or on his boots,he had no idea how it had gotten there.the detectives asked smiley to remove the articles so that they could test them for blood.at some point,the detectives also had smiley remove his clothes and gave him a white coverall to wear.at this point,the detectives observed a bite mark on his back smiley denied knowing how it had happened.
the detectives exited the room with his jacket and boots.upon returning,they told smiley that they had found blood on the articles,and they demanded to know where it had come from.again,smiley said that he did not know how the blood had gotten there.the detectives told smiley that they knew that he was lying because the blood was garrett and that they therefore knew that he had killed garrett.smiley nevertheless continued to deny any involvement in garrett death,but he began to cry.at approximately,the detectives told smiley that he was under arrest for the garrett homicide they left him alone in the interview room for the next four to five hours except for the taking of additional photographs.the detectives still did not give smiley a miranda warning.
the second statement 
at,the detectives returned to the interview room and,for the first time,informed smiley of his miranda rights.soon thereafter,smiley confessed to having killed garrett in.
in his confession,smiley told the detectives that he had not socialized with garrett and,although he did not know very much about garrett,he thought that garrett had treated his sister well.several months ago,smiley explained,some items had gone missing in the house,including jewelry,money and a caliber handgun that smiley owned.smiley subsequently purchased another gun,a caliber,to replace the missing one.smiley suspected that garrett might have stolen these items,although he had never confronted garrett or voiced his concerns to his sister.
smiley stated that,on june,he went into the bedroom that walters shared with garrett and saw the stolen gun,fully loaded.he took the gun,went into the living room and laid it on an end table.smiley told garrett,i found my gun,now where is my diamond ring,referring to a ring that he suspected that garrett had stolen,ex.w at.smiley recounted that garrett then told him,i do know nothing about your ring.id.at this point,smiley and garrett both became angry garrett pushed smiley,and smiley hit garrett back.a struggle ensued,and,according to smiley,the garrett managed to get him in a bear hug around the top part of smiley back that bent smiley over in a forward position.garrett swung smiley around,a maneuver that resulted in smiley injured knee.garrett also bit smiley in the back.smiley explained to the detectives that he could not breathe and began to fear that he would pass out.smiley reached for a caliber handgun tucked into his waistband and fired it into garrett left leg.garrett released smiley and stumbled backward.
after taking a few steps backward,however,garrett lunged for the caliber gun that smiley was holding.smiley fired two additional shots at garrett,who again fell backward.smiley then saw garrett attempt to reach the caliber handgun that was still on the end table.smiley claimed that,when he saw garrett working the slide action of the handgun to chamber a round,he believed that garrett was going to kill him.as garrett turned toward him,smiley fired two final shots at garrett.smiley claimed that,when he realized that garrett was dead,he panicked.he moved some items in the residence to create the appearance of a burglary gone bad,grabbed both weapons and left.
at approximately,after smiley had finished telling the detectives what had happened,he led them to the weapons,which he had hidden in a friend basement.
prior proceedings 
the state charged smiley with intentional homicide while armed,in violation of wisconsin statutes,a.prior to trial,smiley moved to suppress his first statement.in ruling on the motion,the trial court determined that smiley had not been given a miranda warning preceding the interrogation leading up to the first statement the court further determined that smiley was in custody when he had made that statement.the court nevertheless denied smiley motion because it determined that he had been questioned as a witness,not as a suspect.accordingly,the trial court allowed the state to admit in its all of the statements made by smiley during both interrogations.
smiley defense at trial was that he had shot garrett in.although smiley did not testify at trial,he based his defense on his second statement to the detectives in which he had described the struggle between himself and garrett throughout the trial,however,the prosecutor relied heavily on smiley first statement to depict smiley as a liar and to argue that smiley story about acting in could not be believed.
after the close of evidence,the trial court instructed the jury on intentional murder and,over smiley objection,on the lesser included offense of intentional during deliberations,the jury asked the trial court to explain the difference between first and intentional homicide.the jury convicted smiley of the former.the trial court sentenced smiley to life in prison with eligibility for parole after forty years.
the court of appeals of wisconsin affirmed smiley conviction on direct review,and the trial court and court of appeals denied his petitions for state habeas review.the supreme court of wisconsin denied smiley petitions on direct and collateral review.in all proceedings,smiley challenged,inter alia,the trial court denial of his motion to suppress his first statement to the police.
while his state habeas proceedings were pending,smiley filed in the district court a petition under seeking a writ of habeas corpus.the district court stayed the proceedings until smiley had exhausted his state remedies.after he had done so,smiley returned to the district court and moved for leave to amend his previously filed petition.the district court permitted the amendment,and,in his amended petition,smiley claimed that the court of appeals of wisconsin had erred by refusing to suppress a statement allegedly obtained by the police in violation of miranda arizona,d,and its progeny rejecting his claim that the jury instruction concerning mitigation of the intentional homicide based on the use of unnecessary force violated his right to due process and dismissing his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim.
the district court granted smiley petition.it held that the state court had been confronted with a set of facts materially indistinguishable from those in miranda,d,and mathis united states,d,but nevertheless arrived at a contrary result.the district court further determined that this error was not harmless because smiley credibility was a critical issue in the case and because the prosecutor repeatedly had used smiley first statement to depict smiley as a liar.
the state timely appealed the judgment of the district court.
discussiona.standards of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.davis,cir.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa of,stat,federal courts may grant a state prisoner habeas relief only if the state court adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the relevant state court decision is that of the last state court to address the habeas petitioner arguments on the merits,garth davis,cir,which in this case is the decision of the court of appeals of wisconsin.
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decided a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.terry williams taylor,d.a state court decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.a decision also may fall within the unreasonable application clause if it either unreasonably extends a legal principle from existing supreme court precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.id.at.the supreme court has cautioned,however,that habeas relief may not issue unless the state court decision was incorrect and unreasonable.terry williams,at.horton litscher,cir.
the state court factual findings are presumed correct this presumption can be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.see e cockrell,d barrow uchtman,cir.with these principles in mind,we turn to the decision of the court of appeals of wisconsin and the state arguments.
b.the detectives failure to give smiley a miranda warning 
the detectives gave smiley a miranda warning prior to his second statement,in which he confessed to having killed garrett in.therefore,we confine our review to smiley first statement in which he denied repeatedly any involvement in the crime 
in affirming the trial court denial of smiley motion to suppress his first statement,the state court of appeals relied on state armstrong,a decision of the supreme court of wisconsin.armstrong,in turn,relied upon the supreme court decision in rhode island innis,d.under armstrong,the court of appeals explained,questioning without miranda warnings is lawful when police have no reason to know that their questions would likely elicit an incriminating response,ex.e at quoting armstrong,at.the detectives questioning of smiley between and,the time during which he gave his first statement,was not an interrogation,according to the state court of appeals,but simply an interview of a potential witness who police believed may have had pertinent background information to the investigation because he was a tenant in the home where the homicide occurred.id.at.it was not until,after the police had noticed the blood on his boots and jacket and took his clothing for laboratory analysis,that smiley became a suspect in garrett murder.at that point,the detectives ceased the interview,placed him under arrest for the garrett murder and administered a miranda warning.
the state submits that the court of appeals decision was proper under the supreme court decision in innis.it reads innis as limiting miranda to situations in which the officers conducting a custodial interrogation might reasonably expect the person under interrogation to make an incriminating statement.therefore,according to the state it is simply not an unreasonable application of innis to find that because the police had no reason to know that their interview would elicit an incriminating response,smiley first statement was admissible.appellant br.at.
we respectfully believe that the state submission,as well as the decision of the court of appeals of wisconsin,is predicated on an erroneous reading of innis.in innis,the police arrested thomas innis for the murder of a rhode island taxicab driver.upon arresting innis,an officer issued a miranda warning innis stated that he understood his rights and that he wanted to speak with a lawyer.while en route to the police station,one of the officers told the other officer that he hoped that one of the handicapped children from a nearby school did not find the shotgun used in the murder.the other officer responded that it would be sad if a girl found the gun and perhaps killed herself.innis interrupted the conversation,and he told the officers that he would lead them to the murder weapon.
the supreme court refused to construe the miranda opinion so narrowly as applying only to those police interrogation practices that involve express questioning of a defendant while in custody.innis,at.it reiterated that the concern of the court in miranda was that the interrogation environment created by the interplay of interrogation and custody would subjugate the individual to the will of his examiner and thereby undermine the privilege against compulsory.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the court further explained that the police practices that evoked this concern in miranda included several that did not involve express questioning.id.accordingly,the supreme court held 
we conclude that the miranda safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent.that is to say,the term interrogation under miranda refers not only to express questioning,but also to any words or actions on the part of the police other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.the latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect,rather than the intent of the police.this focus reflects the fact that the miranda safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody with an added measure of protection against coercive police practices,without regard to objective proof of the underlying intent of the police.a practice that the police should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect thus amounts to interrogation.but,since the police surely can not be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions,the definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.
id.at.emphases supplied footnotes omitted.
it is clear from the language,facts and context of innis,that the supreme court defined interrogation as express questioning or its functional equivalent it defined the latter as any statements that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.id.at.thus,as the district court explained,innis does nothing more than define when police practices,other than express questioning,constitute interrogation.
the supreme court of the united states has made it clear that,when an individual is subject to custodial interrogation,the fact that the custody was initiated for a reason other than the subject matter of the interrogation does not alter the necessity of warning the individual of his right to silence and to the assistance of counsel.as justice black wrote for the court in mathis united states,d 
there is no substance to such a distinction,and in effect it goes against the whole purpose of the miranda decision which was designed to give meaningful protection to fifth amendment rights.
indeed,miranda itself specifically says that b y custodial interrogation,we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody.miranda,at.footnote omitted.again in beckwith united states,d,the supreme court stressed that it was the inherently coercive nature of the custodial setting,not the strength or content of the government suspicions,that triggered the need for miranda warnings.id.at.moreover,both miranda and innis specifically note that the holding of miranda applies both to incriminating and exculpatory statements.innis,at.miranda,at.
it is undisputed that smiley was in custody he had been formally it is further undisputed that,for three hours,he was subjected to express questioning about the garrett shooting.the state does not dispute that smiley exculpatory statements were given in response to the detectives express questioning.because smiley was in custody and was subject to express questioning,the state court of appeals had no reason to apply the rule for the functional equivalent of express questioning.see,united states montgomery,cir appellant made incriminating statements only after agent sherman had interjected questions since the questioning here was express,we have no occasion to go farther.this was custodial interrogation.consequently,the decision of the court of appeals was an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent because it unreasonably extend ed a legal principle from supreme court precedent to a new context where it should not have appl ied.malinowski smith,cir second alteration in original.
smiley was in custody when the police subjected him to extensive questioning about the garrett murder.under these circumstances,clearly established supreme court precedent required that the detectives inform smiley about his miranda rights.see mathis,at.refusing to narrow the scope of the miranda holding by making it applicable only to questioning one who is in custody in connection with the very case under investigation see also stansbury california,d explaining that,in determining whether an individual was in custody,a court must examine all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation,but the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there was a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest emphasis supplied quoting california beheler,d per curiam quoting oregon mathiason,d miranda,at.because the detectives failed to administer a miranda warning at the beginning of the first custodial interrogation,all of the statements made by smiley during that interrogation should have been suppressed.missouri seibert,d miranda conditioned the admissibility at trial of any custodial confession on warning a suspect of his rights failure to give the prescribed warnings and obtain a waiver of rights before custodial questioning generally requires exclusion of any statements obtained.footnote omitted.accordingly,we must conclude,respectfully,that the decision of the state court of appeals constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent.
harmless error analysis 
the state court of appeals did not address the harmless error issue.therefore,there is no state court holding to which we owe deference under these circumstances,we must apply the brecht standard of actual prejudice.fry pliler,d.to affirm the district court grant of habeas relief under the brecht standard,we must determine that the miranda violation had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brecht abrahamson,d adopting a standard first announced in kotteakos united states.if a reviewing court is in grave doubt about whether or not that error is harmless,the justices have explained,then that court should treat the error as if it had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury verdict.mcaninch,d quoting brecht,at.see also united states dominguez benitez,d.the harmless error inquiry asks 
not what effect the constitutional error might generally be expected to have upon a reasonable jury,but rather what effect it had upon the guilty verdict in the case at hand.review looks,we have said,to the basis on which the jury actually rested its verdict.the inquiry,in other words,is not whether,in a trial that occurred without the error,a guilty verdict would surely have been rendered,but whether the guilty verdict actually rendered in this trial was surely unattributable to the error.that must be so,because to hypothesize a guilty verdict that was never in fact matter how inescapable the findings to support that verdict might violate the guarantee.
sullivan louisiana,d citations omitted see also wilson mitchell,cir.
at the outset of our analysis,we must begin by acknowledging that the improperly admitted statement was a critical piece of evidence at trial,smiley never denied having shot garrett indeed,the prosecution introduced all of smiley statements to the police.the jury,accordingly,heard smiley story about the serious altercation between garrett and smiley immediately before smiley shot garrett,but it also heard smiley repeated denials,prior to his confession,of any involvement in the murder.smiley sole defense,based on his confession,was that he had shot garrett because he had feared for his life.the jury main task at trial,therefore,was to determine what smiley mental state had been when he pulled the trigger.the wisconsin trial court instructions gave the jury several options it could reject the theory in its entirety and convict smiley,as it ended up doing,of intentional homicide it could convict smiley of intentional homicide,accepting a theory of imperfect or it could elect to acquit smiley,accepting fully his story these instructions and smiley strategy make clear that smiley trial essentially was a referendum on the truthfulness of his second state
