opinion of the court 
this case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the virgin islands supreme court.kamaal francis was identified by an eyewitness as the triggerman in the fatal shooting of omari baltimore on thomas.francis protested his innocence but admitted that he was present during the shooting and claimed that jamal justin fahie wielded the weapon.both fahie and francis were later charged with the murder and related crimes.francis worked out a plea deal with the government.in exchange for reduced charges,he agreed to testify against fahie,which he did,swearing that fahie was the sole shooter.the jury found fahie guilty as charged.after an unsuccessful appeal to the supreme court,fahie petitioned us for a writ of certiorari.
we granted the petition and accepted the following two questions whether the supreme court erred in ruling that it was appropriate for the trial court to give an aiding and abetting instruction under the circumstances of this case and whether the supreme court used the correct standard to assess whether another supposed error in the jury instructions was harmless.in addition to the briefing provided by the parties,the virgin islands bar association has filed an amicus brief challenging our jurisdiction to consider this matter at all.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that we do have jurisdiction,that the ruling on the aiding and abetting instruction was proper,and that we improvidently granted certiorari on the harmless error question.
background 
factual background 
on november,omari baltimore was shot times while walking up bunker hill on thomas.fahie people.carol kelly,a resident of a nearby neighborhood,witnessed the murder.id.she called to report the crime and,later that day,identified kamaal francis as the killer from a police photo array.id.the police arrested francis the following day and charged him with murder and several other crimes.id.at first,francis lied about his location and his involvement in the murder.id.however,he later recanted and informed the police that he was at the scene of the shooting but that it was jamal fahie who shot baltimore.id.francis explained that fahie was motivated by animosity.id.he also gave a detailed description of how fahie committed baltimore murder as well as a description of what clothing fahie was wearing at the time of the murder.id.at.among other details,francis noted that fahie used a glock firearm to commit the crime.id.a subsequent ballistics analysis confirmed that a glock was the murder weapon.police authorities later found the clothing that francis had described secreted in fahie residence.id.the clothes tested positive for gunpowder residue.id.
procedural background 
based on francis statement,the government filed a information against fahie and francis.opening br.at.both men were charged with first degree murder,second degree murder,first degree assault,and three counts involving the unauthorized use of a firearm francis later agreed to plead guilty to the charges of accessory after the fact and misprision of a felony,to cooperate with the government,and to testify against fahie at trial.in exchange,the government agreed to drop the other charges against francis and to recommend a sentence of five to ten years imprisonment for the accessory charge and three years for the misprision charge.
francis kept his end of the bargain.he testified at trial that he and fahie were together on the evening of the shooting and that they saw baltimore walking towards the top of bunker hill.francis said that he and fahie got a ride to the top of the hill from karl webbe,one of francis friends,and that,during the ride,fahie said i gon na deal with this guy i gon na kill him.ja at.at the high point of the road,fahie got out of the car and ran up a flight of stairs to reach baltimore,with francis following.francis described what happened next 
when we got to the top of the stairs fahie then takes a black mask out of his pocket and took an extended ammunition clip out of his right back pocket.so,fahie then puts his mask over his face and loads his clip,and he looks up,sees baltimore and he sho o ts him.i was right behind him.
ja at.after the shooting,francis said that they ran down the stairs and were driven away by webbe.
at trial,in addition to presenting francis account of events and arguing that fahie was the sole shooter,the government presented forensic experts who testified that baltimore was shot nineteen times,that he died of his gunshot wounds,that each of the bullets was fired from the same gun,and that the gun involved in the shooting was manufactured by glock.
following the government presentation of its case,fahie invoked federal rule of criminal procedure and moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts,arguing that the government failed to present sufficient evidence on any count.he emphasized that the government had not presented any evidence to support an aiding and abetting charge of liability.the government opposed the rule motion but agreed to strike the aiding and abetting theory from the information.fahie motion was held under advisement and subsequently denied.
relying on the testimony of carol kelly,fahie mounted a defense which was,basically,that francis committed the murder.kelly testified that she was walking up bunker hill when francis passed her from behind.she indicated that the shooting started about two minutes after francis had passed her,and that she saw francis fire at least some of the shots.kelly further recounted that she called after the shooting and identified francis from a photo lineup 
after fahie presented his case,the government advanced the fifth amended information,which reincorporated the aiding and abetting theory of liability.the amendment was evidently motivated by kelly testimony.over fahie objection,the trial court allowed the amendment and instructed the jury on aiding and abetting as a theory of guilt.the court also gave an instruction.an instruction states,in essence,that the government is not required to employ any specific investigation technique such as fingerprint analysis or dna testing or all possible investigative techniques to prove its case.ja at.the name by which such instructions are known is a reference to the popular television series csi and its spinoffs,which feature crime scene investigators using sophisticated forensic techniques to solve crimes.the instruction in this case told the jury that the government was not required to gather or produce any specific type of evidence so long as it present ed sufficient evidence to convince the members beyond a reasonable doubt of fahie guilt.ja at.fahie was found guilty on all counts.
on appeal to the supreme court,fahie challenged the trial court decision to,inter alia,include the aiding and abetting instruction and the instruction.fahie,at.both challenges were rejected.with respect to the aiding and abetting instruction,the supreme court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support a theory of aiding and abetting liability and that fahie had been given adequate notice of the theory.id.at.with respect to the instruction,it agreed that the trial court should not have included the instruction but concluded that the error was harmless.id.at.
after the supreme court ruled against him,fahie sought a writ of certiorari from us and we granted his petition,specifically as to the questions relating to the aiding and abetting and instructions.ja at.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
the supreme court had jurisdiction under a.fahie,at.neither party contests our jurisdiction,but,in the role of amicus,the virgin islands bar association does,and,in any event,we have an obligation to consider it sua sponte.ins.of ireland,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,a court,including an appellate court,will raise lack of jurisdiction on its own motion.
under the revised organic act of,we had,for a limited time,certiorari jurisdiction over all final decisions of the highest court of the virgin islands from which a decision could be had.version amending the revised organic act of the virgin islands.that grant of jurisdiction,however,was designed to terminate when the supreme court developed sufficient institutional traditions to justify direct review by the supreme court of the united states from all such final decisions.pichardo comm r of labor,cir.quoting version.
on december,the president of the united states signed into law the bill that became the current version of,which provides formal recognition of the supreme court institutionally mature status and began the phasing out of our certiorari jurisdiction.version amending the revised organic act of the virgin islands.section revokes our certiorari jurisdiction over all cases commenced on or after december.note the amendments made by this act amending apply to cases commenced on or after the date of the enactment of this act.
the dispute over our jurisdiction in this case centers on the meaning of the words commenced on.id.the operative question is whether revokes jurisdiction over cases commenced in the superior court on or after december,or whether the law only revokes jurisdiction over cases that have commenced in our court through a petition for writ of certiorari on or after that date.the bar association,expressing a desire to reduce the backlog of cases in the virgin islands court system,supports the latter interpretation the choice of interpretation is relevant here because the case against fahie commenced in the superior court in november,but was not the subject of a petition to us until.
this is not the first time we have been asked to construe.in north america seafarers international union ex rel.bason government of the virgin islands bason,we adopted the first of the two interpretations described above and expressly held that the statute eliminates jurisdiction over all cases commenced in the superior court after december,cir.in that case,the original plaintiff,bason,died during the pendency of an appeal for reinstatement to a previous employment position.id.at.we eventually dismissed the case on mootness grounds,id.at,but we did so only after deciding the threshold jurisdictional question concerning,saying,we conclude that we still possess certiorari jurisdiction over proceedings that were filed in the virgin islands courts before enactment date.id.at.we also said our decision was b ased on the language of the statute,analogous legislation,and prior case law.id.at.
the bar association disagrees with bason and argues that our analysis relating to jurisdiction contravened the jurisprudence of the supreme court and the uncontradicted legislative history of.br.of amicus curiae at.it also asserts that the jurisdictional analysis in bason is because the unequivocal determination that the matter was moot by reason of bason intervening death renders the remainder of the bason decision dicta.id.at.on those grounds,the bar association urges that we overturn bason,and it says that we have the complete freedom to do so without requiring en banc review.id.at.
no matter how we might now view bason,however,the bar association is mistaken about our complete freedom.id.we deliberately chose to assess the jurisdictional question as a threshold issue in bason,recognizing that,while threshold jurisdictional issues must ordinarily be decided before turning to the merits,there is no mandatory sequencing of jurisdictional issues.at quoting sinochem int l malaysia int l shipping,further quotations omitted.then after extensive analysis,we concluded that the words cases commenced were a reference to the filing of a complaint in the virgin islands superior court.id.at quotation and alteration omitted.that ruling was not merely dicta,and it remains the law in our circuit thus,while we are grateful for the interest and assistance of the bar association,we can not accept its argument.according to bason,we have jurisdiction over fahie claims.
inclusion of the aiding and abetting instruction 
fahie objects to the inclusion of the aiding and abetting instruction,not to its content,so we are not asked to review the legal accuracy of the instruction,which would call for de novo review.gov t of isaac,cir.w here the question is whether the jury instructions failed to state the proper legal standard,this court review is plenary.instead,we review for abuse of discretion the trial court decision to include the instruction at all.id.generally,we review the district court refusal to give certain jury instructions on an abuse of discretion basis.see also united states moreno,cir.i n the absence of a misstatement within the jury instructions we review for abuse of discretion.quotation omitted.
when jury instructions are challenged,we consider the totality of the instructions and not a particular sentence or paragraph in isolation.united states thayer,cir.quoting united states coyle,cir,abrogated on other grounds by skilling united states.the issue is whether,viewed in light of the evidence,the charge as a whole fairly and adequately submits the issues in the case to the jury.id.quoting united states zehrbach,cir.
fahie advances two challenges to the aiding and abetting instruction.first,he argues that it was erroneous because it was given despite the fact that the government never presented an aiding and abetting theory at trial.opening br.at.second,he argues that the instruction is problematic because francis pled guilty to being an accessory after the fact,effectively eliminating the possibility of francis being a principal for fahie to aid or abet in the shooting.id.at,see also gov t of aquino,cir.by definition,an accessory after the fact is one who stands outside the commission of the substantive crime,for his offense consists of what he does,after he knows it has been committed,to aid the offender to avoid apprehension or punishment.we address those arguments in turn.
fahie says that the instruction was erroneous because it was included even though the government did not present an aiding and abetting theory but the record demonstrates that the government did,in fact,present an aiding and abetting theory to the jury.in its closing statement,the government discussed kelly testimony and drew the jury attention to the portions of her statement that refer to two shooters.see ja at.the government laid the groundwork for that argument when it questioned kelly.ja at.the record thus shows that the government indeed did contend that fahie was,at the very least,involved in the shooting as an aider and abettor,and there was sufficient evidence to support an instruction to the jury to that effect 
that the government did not use the phrase aiding and abetting when talking to the jury does not mean the judge was precluded from including the instruction.see united states gordon,cir.the words aid and abet need not appear in the indictment in order to sustain a conviction as an aider and abettor o ne who has been indicted as a principal may be convicted on evidence showing that he has merely aided and abetted the commission of the offense.quoting united states vines,cir,cert.denied.the government communicated its intent to argue the aiding and abetting theory when it amended the information to include aiding and abetting as a basis for criminal liability and when it requested that the judge add an aiding and abetting instruction to the jury charge.fahie was thus on notice that the government was indeed relying on that theory.
the second argument fahie advances is that the instruction is problematic because legally,there was no one for fahie to aid and abet since francis was,by virtue of his plea agreement,an accessory after the fact,which precluded any consideration of him as a participant in the shooting.opening br.at.essentially,fahie argues that francis plea to being an accessory after the fact confined the government proof at fahie trial.by fahie lights,since an accessory after the fact b y definition is one who stands outside the commission of the substantive crime,aquino,at see also a defining accessory after the fact as having the same mens rea requirement under virgin islands law,francis could not be a participant in the shooting and there was no one for fahie to aid and abet in the murder 
that argument has a certain superficial appeal but is flawed.it rests on an improper understan
