in,robert riley was convicted in michigan state court of aiding and abetting the felony murder of mark seaton,and sentenced to life in prison without parole.on direct appeal,riley argued that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because his trial attorney failed to move for a directed verdict of acquittal at the close of the state.the michigan supreme court rejected riley claim,holding that riley counsel was not deficient within the meaning of strickland washington,d,for failing to move for a directed verdict,because the evidence adduced by the state was sufficient to support riley conviction.
thereafter,riley filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court.the district court granted the petition,concluding that the michigan supreme court unreasonably applied the strickland test to the facts of riley case.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court.

riley defense 
at the close of the prosecution,riley trial counsel did not move for a directed verdict of acquittal.instead,riley counsel called a single witness,mary mckinney.mckinney is ware mother.riley counsel explained that she felt compelled to note for the record that she had advised riley of the risks entailed in calling mckinney as a witness,but that riley wanted to proceed anyway.
mckinney testified that the day after seaton death,ware told her that seaton had come out of the shower nude and had made a sexual pass at him.seaton told his mother that he responded by trying to push seaton away and then putting a sleeper hold on him when seaton turned around.mckinney further testified that when riley came out of the bathroom,ware told him to get the duct tape from the table and help him subdue seaton,which riley did.ware told his mother that seaton was a large guy.id.at.in response to a question from the prosecutor about whether ware needed riley help to incapacitate seaton because of seaton size,mckinney testified r ight.id.at.
on redirect,riley counsel questioned mckinney about the written statement she gave to the police concerning what ware told her.mckinney agreed that although she had signed off on the statement and made corrections to it,the statement did not reflect that she had told the police anything about riley having assisted ware in taping seaton hands and feet.the parties then stipulated that mckinney written statement to the police did not make any mention of the assistance riley purportedly rendered in subduing seaton.

the jury convicted riley of aiding and abetting seaton murder,and he was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
procedural history 
riley appealed his conviction and sentence to the michigan court of appeals.that court reversed riley conviction on the grounds that the admission at trial of mckinney riley helped ware subdue riley confrontation clause rights because mckinney assertion at trial was not included in her written statement to the police.people riley,wl.july.without mckinney testimony,the michigan appellate court held,there was not sufficient evidence to convict riley of the charged offense.id.thus,the court reversed riley conviction and remanded the case for entry of a judgment of conviction for larceny in a building,the only judgment the court deemed supported by the evidence.id.
the michigan supreme court reversed on the grounds that riley knowingly waived his confrontation clause rights.people riley.the court ruling was based on the statement made by riley counsel that she had advised riley that calling mckinney to testify might harm his case,but that riley wanted to go forward despite the risk.id.
on remand,the michigan court of appeals again reversed riley conviction and remanded for entry of a judgment of conviction for larceny in a building.people riley,wl.the court of appeals reasoned that the failure of riley counsel to move for a directed verdict of acquittal at the close of the prosecution case constituted ineffective assistance of counsel because the evidence adduced by the prosecution was insufficient to convict riley of aiding and abetting felony murder.id.at.
the michigan supreme court again reversed.people riley.it held that riley trial counsel was not deficient within the meaning of strickland because the prosecution had presented sufficient evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the elements of the charged offense were satisfied.id.at.thus,riley counsel was under no obligation to move for a directed verdict.the michigan supreme court reasoned that riley performed acts that assisted the commission of the murder insofar as his misdirection of gloria hollis when she knocked on seaton door possibly precluded the provision of medical assistance to the victim while he was still alive,hampered detection of the murder,or facilitated riley and ware escape.id.moreover,the michigan supreme court held that the jury could have inferred that riley participated in the murder based on his participation in the larceny eyewitness testimony indicates that defendant participated in the crime by engaging in the larceny.id.
riley then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court.the district court held that the michigan supreme court decision rested on an unreasonable application of strickland.riley berghuis,d.the district court determined that riley counsel was deficient in failing to move for a directed verdict of acquittal because the evidence at the close of the prosecution was insufficient to convict riley.the court reasoned,among other things,that there was no evidence that riley performed any acts to assist ware in incapacitating seaton and no evidence that riley and ware conceived of a plan to commit larceny.id.at.furthermore,according to the district court,the deficient performance of riley counsel prejudiced his case because there was a reasonable probability that the outcome of riley trial would have been different had his lawyer moved for a directed verdict.id.at.accordingly,the district court granted riley habeas relief.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.brown palmer,cir.because riley filed his petition for habeas relief after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,his petition is governed by aedpa standards.joseph coyle,cir.under aedpa,a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus with respect to a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.id.quoting d.a decision unreasonably applies federal law where the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.williams taylor,d.
in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support riley conviction,we may not assume the role of jurors and determine whether we believe that the evidence establishes riley guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.instead,the relevant question is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.
the strickland test 
in strickland washington,d,the supreme court held that to prevail on an claim,a criminal defendant must show that his counsel was deficient and that this deficient representation prejudiced his defense.to satisfy the deficiency prong,the defendant must show that his counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness as embodied in prevailing professional norms.id.at.with respect to the prejudice prong,t he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.
strickland prejudice prong applied to the facts here 
the state does not concede that riley satisfies the deficiency prong of the strickland test,but it focuses its arguments on the prejudice prong.as an initial matter
