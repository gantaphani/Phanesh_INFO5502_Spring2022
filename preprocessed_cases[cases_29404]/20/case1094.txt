united states attorney general michael mukasey,the department of homeland of immigration customs enforcement bice,bice commissioner james ziglar,and bice louisiana field officer craig robinson hereinafter the government challenge the district court grant of habeas relief to ha tran.to resolve this issue,we must determine whether a,as construed by the supreme court in zadvydas davis,d,authorizes the continued and potentially indefinite detention of a removable alien based on a determination by the government that the alien mental illness renders him a dangerous risk to the community.in light of zadvydas and its progeny,we conclude that it does not.
factual and procedural background 
the facts underlying this appeal are undisputed.ha tran,a native and citizen of vietnam,was admitted to the united states as a refugee on august.on september,tran became a lawful permanent resident.tran was convicted of firearm possession and assault and battery against his wife on october.as a result,tran was confined to a mental hospital for two years where he was diagnosed with a mental illness.thereafter,he was transferred to a halfway house for six months.one day after his release from the halfway house,tran murdered his wife in the presence of their daughter.tran pled guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to eighteen to twenty years in prison on may.
before tran completed his sentence,the department of homeland security dhs took him into custody and initiated deportation proceedings.on february,based on his conviction for a crime of violence,the immigration judge found tran removable to france,and in the alternative,vietnam.tran did not appeal thus his order of removal became final thirty days later.both france and vietnam,however,refused to accept him.because dhs was unable to deport tran,it continued to detain him.
on december,tran sought release from dhs custody following the supreme court decision in zadvydas,which held that once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable,continued detention is not authorized by a.at.in response,the government initiated proceedings pursuant to f,which provides for the continued detention of an alien who due to a mental condition is likely to engage in acts of violence in the future.tran was evaluated by a number of mental health professionals with the purpose of determining whether he would pose a threat to the public if released.based on a finding that tran alleged mental illness would cause him to commit acts of violence in the future,the dhs issued a decision to continue custody,acknowledging that although tran was not likely to be removed in the foreseeable future,the dhs would continue to detain him under f.
pursuant to f,the immigration judge ij reviewed dhs decision and recommended that tran be released the ij pointed to a number of flaws in tran psychiatric evaluations in finding that the government had failed to demonstrate that tran mental condition made him a special danger to the public.on appeal,the bia vacated the ij ruling,finding that the government had established by clear and convincing evidence that tran had met the criteria for continued detention under f.
on october,tran filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the district court.in his petition,tran argued that his detention under f violated a as construed by the supreme court in zadvydas because his removal was not reasonably foreseeable.before the district court,the government did not argue that tran detention was reasonably foreseeable,nor did they dispute the fact that tran had been held beyond the presumptively reasonable period established in zadvydas.rather,the government argued that tran detention was authorized by zadvydas express pronouncement that the government may detain individuals for extended periods of special circumstances such as when the individuals are mentally ill and dangerous.the petition was transferred to a magistrate judge who concluded that a did not provide dhs with the authority to detain tran indefinitely and recommended that tran petition be granted.the district court adopted the findings of the magistrate judge,ordering that tran habeas petition be granted and that he be released from federal immigration detention under an order of supervision imposing conditions set by the government.the government did not seek a stay of the district court order 
on appeal,the government challenges the district court grant of habeas relief to tran on three grounds.first,the government asserts that the district court ignored supreme court precedent,allowing continued detention in special circumstances.second,pursuant to chevron,natural resources defense council,d,the government argues that the district court should have deferred to the government reasonable interpretation of a.finally,the government contends that the district court failed to uphold congress statutory intent to protect the public.we will address each of the government arguments in turn.
ii.discussion 
in a habeas appeal,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and review its conclusions of law de novo.gochicoa johnson,cir.
the immigration and naturalization act provides that when a final order of removal has been entered against an alien,the government must facilitate that alien removal from the united states within ninety days,a period generally referred to as the removal period.a a.detention beyond the removal period is authorized under a,which provides 
an alien ordered removed who is inadmissible under section of this title,removable under section a c,a,or a of this title or who has been determined by the attorney general to be a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the order of removal,may be detained beyond the removal period and,if released,shall be subject to the terms of supervision in paragraph.
thus,this statute is applicable to three categories of aliens those ordered removed who are inadmissible under those ordered removed who are removable as a result of violations of status requirements or entry conditions,violations of criminal law,or reasons of security or foreign policy or those ordered removed who are determined by the attorney general to be a risk to the community or a flight risk.
in zadvydas,the supreme court considered habeas petitions of two individuals,kestutis zadvydas and kim ho ma,being held pursuant to the second category of a.at.although both men were found removable,no country would accept them as a result,the government continued to detain them for years beyond the expiration of the removal period.in support of the continued detention of these men,the government argued that they may be detained beyond the removal period language of a authorized indefinite detention of a removable alien.the court,however,concluded that it did not,reasoning that continued detention would present serious constitutional problems under the fifth amendment due process clause.id.at.applying the doctrine of constitutional avoidance,the court held that once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable,continued detention is not authorized by the statute.id.at.zadvydas then concluded that six months was a presumptively reasonable period of detention,beyond the removal period,in which to effectuate deportation.id.at.
in clark martinez,d,the supreme court was called upon to consider whether its decision in zadvydas was also applicable to aliens in the first category of a.writing for the majority,justice scalia explained that t he operative language of a,may be detained beyond the removal period,applies without differentiation to all three categories of aliens that are its subject and that t o give these same words a different meaning for each category would be to invent a statute rather than interpret one.id.at.while the specific question before the clark court related to the first category of aliens covered by a,the decision makes clear that the holding of zadvydas,and consequently the presumptive reasonable removal period,applies uniformly to all categories of aliens covered by the statute.
turning our attention to the present case,the government first contends that the district court ignored supreme court
