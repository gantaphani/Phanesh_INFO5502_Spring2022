danny keith thomas appeals an order of the district court dismissing as untimely his pro se motion to vacate,set aside,or correct his sentence under west supp.for the following reasons,we vacate the district court order and remand the motion for further proceedings.
on november,thomas pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to attempted possession of methamphetamine,in violation of a and b c west supp,and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c west supp.he was sentenced to months imprisonment on the methamphetamine charge,and months imprisonment on the firearm charge,to be served consecutively.judgment was entered on august,and no appeal was taken.
on october,thomas filed a pro se motion under,seeking to vacate his c firearm conviction and correct his sentence.thomas acknowledged that the motion would be barred under the general limitations period of,see f,but asserted that his motion was timely under the alternative limitations period set forth in f,because he was filing it within one year of the supreme court decision in watson united states,which held that a person does not use a firearm under c a when he receives it in trade for drugs.
prior to receiving a response from the government,the district court dismissed the petition as untimely under f and rejected thomas claim that his motion was timely under f.the district court held that watson did not announce a new rule of constitutional law and,in any event,the supreme court had not made the holding in watson retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.we subsequently appointed counsel to represent thomas and granted a certificate of appealability to consider the issue of whether watson announced a new rule of law that applies retroactively to cases on collateral review for purposes of f.
on appeal,the government agrees with thomas that the supreme court recognized a new rule in watson and that it is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.however,the government contends that we should affirm the district court decision because thomas procedurally defaulted his watson claim by failing to raise it on direct appeal and can not establish cause and prejudice,or actual innocence,to excuse his default.
under,federal prisoners claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states may move the district court which imposed the sentence to vacate,set aside or correct the sentence.a.section f imposes a limitations period upon the filing of motions,which usually runs from the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.f.section f,however,provides that the limitations period begins to run from the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court,if that right has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.f.
although acknowledging that his motion would be untimely under f because it was filed more than one year after his judgment of conviction became final,thomas asserts that his motion is timely under f,because it was filed within one year of the supreme court decision in watson,see dodd united states,holding that the limitations period runs from the date on which the right was initially recognized by th e supreme court,which he also contends we should apply retroactively to his motion.the government agrees.however,the district court rejected the claim,apparently of the view that a prisoner may not take advantage of f unless the supreme court has made a new rule of constitutional law retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.
in united states sanders,cir,we assume d,without deciding,that a circuit court can declare a new rule retroactive on collateral review in an initial petition.id.at.in doing so,we noted the contrast in the statutory language governing retroactivity for purposes of f and the statutory language governing retroactivity for the purposes of filing a second or successive motion in h.id.unlike in the former,which references a right that has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.f emphasis added,the latter specifically provides that a second or successive motion must be certified as provided in section by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals to contain a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable,h emphasis added we also noted,however,that the language of subsection f can also be read to require the supreme court to make the decision on retroactivity before a petitioner may file an initial motion.sanders,at but see dodd,at stevens,dissenting noting but disagreeing with the assumption made by the majority in dodd and every circuit to have addressed the issue,that the decision to make a new rule retroactive for purposes of this section can be made by any lower court,rather than only by the supreme court first emphasis added.
we now join those circuits that have considered the issue and hold that f does not require that the initial retroactivity question be decided in the affirmative only by the supreme court.see wiegand united states,cir holding that any federal court can make the retroactivity decision for purposes of f dodd united states,cir noting that every circuit to consider this issue has held that a court other than the supreme court can make the retroactivity decision for purposes of f,aff united states swinton,cir concluding that the statute of limitations provision of allows district courts and courts of appeals to make retroactivity decisions and that this may be essential to put the question before the supreme court for final resolution fischer united states,cir noting that district and appellate courts,no less than the supreme court,may issue opinions holding that a decision applies retroactively to cases on collateral review internal quotation marks and alteration omitted united states lopez,cir holding that section f does not require that the retroactivity determination must be made by the supreme court itself.
having determined that f allows us to make the initial determination of retroactivity,we turn to the question of whether the decision in watson announced a new rule of law that applies retroactively to cases on collateral review.
generally speaking,when the supreme court announces a new rule,that rule applies to all criminal cases still pending on direct review.schriro summerlin,citing grifith kentucky.where a conviction is already final,however,the rule applies only in limited circumstances.schriro,at.new procedural rules apply retroactively to cases on collateral review only if they fall within the small set of watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also safle parks.this is because such rules regulate only the manner of determining the defendant culpability.schriro,at.they do not produce a class of persons convicted of conduct the law does not make criminal,but merely raise the possibility that someone convicted with use of the invalidated procedure might have been acquitted otherwise.id.at.
new substantive rules,in contrast,generally apply retroactively.this includes decisions that narrow the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms,as well as constitutional determinations that place particular conduct or persons covered by the statute beyond the state power to punish.id.at citation omitted see also saffle,at noting that rules that decriminalize a class of conduct or prohibit the imposition of certain punishment on a particular class of persons are substantive in nature.a rule is substantive rather than procedural if it alters the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes.schriro,u.at.such rules apply retroactively because they necessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal or faces a punishment that t
