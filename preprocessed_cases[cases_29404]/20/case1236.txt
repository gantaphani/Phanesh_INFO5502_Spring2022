background 
on november,thomas jo,his wife,and kenneth flowers robbed a holiday inn in dallas,texas.during the robbery two employees,doug walker and donald hall,were ordered to lie on the floor,gagged with strips of fabric,and their hands and feet were bound.shot walker twice in the back and shot hall in the side.walker died from his wounds.
the state indicted for capital murder.he pleaded not guilty,and jury selection took place during five weeks in february and march.when voir dire had been concluded,moved to strike the jury on the grounds that the prosecution had violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment by excluding blacks through the use of peremptory challenges.trial occurred before the supreme court decision in batson kentucky,d.therefore,swain alabama,d,was then the controlling precedent.as swain required,sought to show that the prosecution conduct was part of a larger pattern of discrimination aimed at excluding blacks from jury service.in a pretrial hearing held on march,presented evidence in support of his motion.the trial judge,however,found no evidence that indicated any systematic exclusion of blacks as a matter of policy by the district attorney office while it may have been done by individual prosecutors in individual cases.the state court then denied motion to strike the jury.twelve days later,the jury found guilty and the trial court sentenced him to death.
appealed to the texas court of criminal appeals.while the appeal was pending,on april,the supreme court issued its opinion in batson kentucky and established a process for evaluating claims that a prosecutor used peremptory challenges in violation of the equal protection clause.at.first,a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race.id.at.second,if that showing has been made,the prosecution must offer a basis for striking the juror in question.id.at.third,in light of the parties submissions,the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.id.at.
after acknowledging had established an inference of purposeful discrimination,the texas court of criminal appeals remanded the case for new findings in light of batson.state,en banc.a hearing was held on may.there,the original trial court admitted all the evidence presented at the swain hearing and further evidence and testimony from the attorneys in the original trial.
on january,the trial court concluded that evidence failed to satisfy step one of batson because it did not even raise an inference of racial motivation in the use of the state peremptory challenges to support a prima facie case.notwithstanding this conclusion,the state court determined that the state would have prevailed on steps two and three because the prosecutors had offered credible,explanations for each black venire member excluded.the court further found no disparate prosecutorial examination of any of the venire members in question and that the primary reasons for the exercise of the challenges against each of the venire members in question was their reluctance to assess or reservations concerning the imposition of the death penalty.
the texas court of criminal appeals denied appeal,and the supreme court denied certiorari.texas,d.state habeas proceedings fared no better,and he was denied relief by the texas court of criminal appeals.
filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court pursuant to the federal magistrate judge who considered the merits of the batson claim recommended,in deference to the state court acceptance of the prosecutors justifications for striking the potential jurors,that be denied relief.the united states district court adopted the recommendation.pursuant to,sought a coa from the district court,and the application was denied.renewed his request to this court,and we also denied a coa.appealed to the supreme court and certiorari was granted,d.in an opinion issued on february,the supreme court concluded based on a threshold examination of the record,that the federal district court rejection of batson claim was debatable and thus we had erred in not granting coa on batson claim.cockrell,d.the supreme court remanded the case to this court to determine whether can demonstrate that the state court finding of the absence of purposeful discrimination was incorrect by clear and convincing evidence,e,and that the corresponding factual determination was objectively unreasonable in light of the record before the court.id.at.we granted coa for precisely that determination.johnson,cir per curiam.
discussion 
claims of racial discrimination in jury selection are evaluated according to the framework established in batson kentucky,which requires a analysis that shifts the burden of production between the parties.at.first,the defendant must make a prima facie showing that the prosecution has exercised peremptory challenges on the basis of race.id.at.second,if the requisite showing has been made,the burden shifts to the prosecution to provide a explanation for striking the venire member in question.id.at.third,the defendant again has the burden,this time of proving purposeful discrimination.id.at.under batson,the ultimate burden of persuading the court that the state peremptory challenges are attributable to a discriminatory purpose lies with and never shifts from the defendant.id.at.citing.dep t of comty.affairs burdine,d purkett elem,d.
in the present case,there is no dispute that presented a prima facie claim under batson first step.nor is there any dispute that the prosecution presented facially reasons for exercising each peremptory challenge.the only issue is disagreement with the trial court determination at batson third step that had failed to show that the prosecution reasons for exercising the challenged peremptory strikes were not credible and had not demonstrated that purposeful discrimination had occurred.the federal district court has already determined on habeas review that has failed to show that the state court erred,and therefore is not entitled to habeas relief.is now appealing this determination and coa has been granted.therefore we now address the merits of appeal.
under the current scheme for habeas review in federal court,which was substantially updated in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,e requires that we presum e the state court findings of fact to be correct unless can rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.as the supreme court has stated,the state court finding at step three of batson claim was a finding of fact and therefore subject to e presumption of correctness,at.citing hernandez new york,d,for the proposition that the determination made at step three of batson is a pure issue of fact accorded significant deference.
we follow the lead of the supreme court in utilizing their decisions in hernandez new york,d,and purkett elem,d,to guide our decision regarding the trial court finding of no purposeful discrimination at step three in this batson claim.these supreme court opinions state that the critical question in determining whether a prisoner has proved purposeful discrimination at step three is the persuasiveness and credibility of the prosecutor justification for his peremptory strike.purkett,at.hernandez,at.further,these cases,applying a standard of review even less deferential to the trial court finding than we are required to apply under aedpa,articulate that deference is necessary because the reviewing court is not as well positioned as the trial court to make credibility determinations,and once the trial court has made a credibility determination concerning the prosecutor state of mind regarding the peremptory strikes,the step three determination under batson has been decided.purkett,at.citing d and stating that the standard of review for a federal habeas claim required that the factual findings of the state court be presumed to be correct,and may be set aside,absent procedural error,only if they are not fairly supported by the record hernandez,at.applying,on direct review of a state court factual findings,a clearly erroneous standard.
argues that the state court finding of the absence of purposeful discrimination was incorrect and the corresponding factual determinations were objectively unreasonable in light of the following four areas of evidence that he claims were before the court.first,evidence of historical discrimination by the dallas county district attorney office in the selection of juries.second,the use of the jury shuffle tactic by the prosecution.third,the alleged similarity between venire members who were not struck by the prosecution and six blacks who were.fourth,evidence of disparate questioning with respect to venire members views on the death penalty and their ability to impose the minimum punishment.
first,argues that he presented evidence of the dallas county district attorney office unofficial policy of excluding blacks from jury service.some of this evidence was first presented in the swain hearing conducted by the trial court.when counsel attempted to reintroduce this historical evidence at the batson hearing,the prosecution objected,arguing that even if accurate the evidence was irrelevant under batson.the court admitted the evidence but reserved the right to give it no weight.
as the united states magistrate judge found,there was considerable evidence that the dallas county district attorney office had an unofficial policy of excluding blacks from jury service and that this evidence was disturbing.the district court accepted this finding.but both the magistrate and district court noted that the historical evidence,however disturbing,is not determinative of whether there was purposeful discrimination in the selection of jury.we also note that the apparent culture of discrimination that existed in the past in the dallas county district attorney office and the individual discriminatory practices that may have been practiced during the time of jury selection by some prosecutors are deplorable.the supreme court stated that proof that the culture of the district attorney office in the past was suffused with bias against in jury selection is relevant to the extent it casts doubt on the legitimacy of the motives underlying the state actions in case,at.in this case,however,the relevancy of this evidence is less significant because has already met the burden under the first step of batson and now must prove actual pretext in his case.this historical evidence is relevant to the extent that it could undermine the credibility of the prosecutors reasons.here,however,as explained below the reasons are solidly supported by the record and in accordance with the prosecutors legitimate efforts to get a jury of individuals open to imposing the death penalty.the state court,in the best position to make a factual credibility determination,heard the historical evidence and determined the prosecutors reasons for the peremptory strikes to be genuine.under our standard of review,we must presume this specific determination is correct and accordingly the general historical evidence does not prove by clear and convincing evidence that the state court finding of the absence of purposeful discrimination in jury selection was incorrect.
second,argues that the state court erred in not finding purposeful discrimination based on the use of the jury shuffle tactic by the prosecution.the record,however,clearly establishes that shuffled the jury five times and the prosecutors shuffled the jury only twice.again,circumstantial evidence of jury shuffles does not overcome the reasons for exercising the challenged peremptory strikes articulated by the prosecutors and accepted by the state court who observed the voir dire process including the jury shuffles.
third,argues that there were similarities between venire members who were not struck by the prosecution and six blacks who were.maintains that the following six black venire members were victims of racially motivated peremptory strikes roderick bozeman,billy jean fields,joe warren,edwin rand,carrol boggess,and wayman kennedy.
as to each of the black venire members claims were the victims of racially motivated peremptory strikes,it is important to identify the prosecution stated reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge.once we have identified the reasons for the strikes,the credibility of the reasons is.further,we can determine from the record that there were no unchallenged venire members similarly situated,such that their treatment by the prosecution would indicate the reasons for striking the black members were not genuine 
roderick bozeman stated that while he believed in the death penalty as a general proposition,he thought it was only appropriate if there no possible way to rehabilitate a person.if bozeman thought there was a chance of rehabilitation,he did not think the death penalty was appropriate.he said that a mentally disturbed person and a manson type were examples of someone who could not be rehabilitated.he said,however,that repeated criminal acts of violence would not necessarily indicate that a person was beyond rehabilitation.bozeman classified himself as the type of person who believed in the death penalty in principle,but who could not actually serve on a capital jury.he verified his inability to impose the death penalty by stating that even if the evidence compelled yes answers to the special issues posed to the jury at the punishment stage,he might refuse to answer the questions honestly in order to avoid imposing the death penalty.the prosecution exercised a peremptory challenge to remove bozeman,citing his views on the death penalty and on rehabilitation,his belief that a pattern of violent conduct would not be sufficient to render a defendant deserving of death,and his obvious hesitation concerning his ability to override his personal feelings and answer the special issues according to the evidence.
venire member billy jean fields stated that he believed in the death penalty and could serve on a capital jury.however,after being informed that the possibility of rehabilitation would be a factor he would need to consider in assessing whether to impose the death penalty,fields proclaimed that his religious belief was that no one was beyond rehabilitation.fields stated,i feel like,if a person has the opportunity to really be talked to about god and he commits himself,whereas he has committed this offense,then if he turns his life around,that is rehabilitation.he further stated,when an individual has really been truly reached by someone reading the word of god to him and they are repentant and they do have a real act of contrition,they can be rehabilitated and that been demonstrated.additionally,fields indicated in his questionnaire and in response to questions by the prosecution that his brother had been incarcerated numerous times for drug offenses.the prosecution exercised a peremptory challenge to remove fields,citing its concern that his deeply held religious belief in the rehabilitative capacity of all persons could impact his willingness to impose a death sentence and the fact that his brother had been convicted of a felony.
venire member joe warren answered questions during voir dire in a noncommital manner and indicated ambivalence about the death penalty and his ability to impose it.he stated,there are some cases where i would agree with the death penalty,you know,and there are others that i do.when the prosecution described the crimes defined as capital murder under texas law and asked whether warren felt the death penalty could be an appropriate punishment for such crimes,he responded,well,there again,i would say it depends on the case and the circumstances involved at the time.when asked whether the death penalty serves a purpose,warren answered,yes and no.sometimes i think it does and sometimes i think it do.sometimes you have mixed feelings about things like that.when asked whether he could make a decision between a life sentence and a death sentence,warren answered,i think i could.when questioned about his ability to answer the future dangerousness special issue question,warren responded,i suppose there always a chance,but there again,you never know.finally,warren stated,well,it s just like i said you know.there are cases,i mean,personally,that i feel i would want to personally be,you know,involved with it if i had a choice.the prosecution exercised a peremptory challenge to remove warren.counsel did not object to the peremptory strike against warren contemporaneous to the strike,therefore the prosecution did not give its reasons at voir dire.at the batson hearing,the prosecutor cited warren hesitation about imposing the death penalty and his inconsistent responses during voir dire as the reasons for striking him.the prosecutor also noted that warren was struck relatively early in the jury selection process when the state had ten challenges remaining before exercising one to remove warren.the prosecutor noted at the batson hearing that an attorney strategy regarding the use of peremptory challenges necessarily changes as jury selection progresses and peremptory challenges either remain unused or get used more rapidly.in fact,the prosecutor on at the batson hearing admitted that he would have struck jurors sandra hearn and fernando gutierrez,who also gave somewhat ambivalent answers regarding the death penalty,before warren,had they come up earlier in the process.
venire member edwin rand described capital punishment as a touchy subject during voir dire but did indicate on his questionnaire that he believed in the death penalty.in response to several alternative choices put to him by the prosecution,rand described himself as a person who may or may not be able to impose the death penalty.he said,somewhere along the line,i would probably think to myself,you know,can i do this you know,right now i say i can,but tomorrow i might not.the prosecution exercised a peremptory challenge to remove rand,citing his ambivalence about the death penalty generally and his lack of ability to serve on a capital jury.
venire member carrol boggess indicated on her questionnaire that she had a moral,religious,or personal belief that would prevent her from imposing the death penalty.during voir dire she stated,well,i believe i could serve on a case like this,but whether i want to or not is a different thing.i would want to serve and i would want to have that responsibility to do that,but if it fell upon me,i would certainly take it and pray to the lord to help me get through it.later she stated,i not saying that i feel like i could impose the sentence i not going to be imposing the sentence,is that correct when directly asked whether she could vote for a death sentence,she stated,i never been in that situation.i do feel like i would want to be in that situation and whether i could do it or not,i not real sure.she continued by stating whether or not i could actually go through with killing another person or taking another person life,i just do know.i have trouble with that.boggess also indicated that she had testified as a defense witness at her nephew theft trial.the prosecution exercised a peremptory challenge to remove boggess,citing as reasons for the strike her hesitancy about assessing a death sentence and the fact that she had served as a defense witness in her nephew trial.
venire member wayman kennedy stated on his questionnaire he believed in the death penalty only in extreme cases.on voir dire he stated that he believed in the death penalty only for mass murders or cases involving mutilation.kennedy stated he did not think a murder in the course of a robbery would necessitate the death penalty because why would a life sentence be enough.finally,when asked whether he could answer the special issues yes if proved beyond a reasonable doubt,even if he personally felt the defendant should not be sentenced to death,kennedy replied,i think i could.the prosecution exercised a peremptory challenge to remove kennedy,citing his hesitancy to assess the death penalty for murder in the course of robbery,the crime was accused of,his view that the death penalty was only appropriate in extreme cases,and his hesitancy in stating that he could answer the special issues according to the evidence.
claims that three venire members,sandra hearn,marie mazza,and ronald salsini,expressed views about the death penalty as ambivalent as those expressed by bozeman,fields,warren,rand,boggess,and kennedy,but the three venire members were not struck by the prosecution.the record,especially the voir dire transcript,does not support this assertion.
sandra hearn stated in her jury questionnaire and on voir dire that she believed in the death penalty and could assess it in appropriate cases.she did express the belief that someone should not be sentenced to death on a first offense but if the person had committed any prior offense including robbery or some other criminal act of violence the death penalty would be appropriate.the evidence admitted at the punishment phase of trial indicated he had committed two previous armed robberies and one also involved a kidnaping.hearn also stated she thought the death penalty should be available for more than just murder but also severe torture and extreme child abuse.she indicated that she had respect for law officers,that her father was a retired fbi agent,and that she had daily contact with police officers in her employment.counsel must have believed hearn was a venire member because he attempted to have her challenged for cause on numerous grounds,and when the trial judge found hearn qualified,counsel requested an additional peremptory strike in order to remove her.in fact,on direct appeal continued to argue that the trial court erred in denying his challenge for cause of hearn,so it seems disingenuous to argue now that she was similarly situated to the black jurors who expressed reservations about imposing the death penalty.
venire member maria mazza indicated on her juror questionnaire that she believed in the death penalty.when asked about her feelings on the death penalty at voir dire,she stated,it not an easy one and i feel that it depends upon the case,the testimony it kind of hard determining somebody life,whether they live or die,but i feel that is something that is accepted in our courts now and it is something decision that i think i could make one way or the other.mazza served on jury.
venire member ronald salsini stated he believed in the death penalty and that he could impose the death penalty.he did indicate imposing the death penalty would be difficult however,he gave a hypothetical crime based on his personal experience as a bank teller that closely paralleled the crime was charged with and stated that such a criminal act was deserving of the death penalty.the prosecution did not strike salsini but counsel did.
comparing the views expressed by hearn,mazza,and salsini to the views expressed by the challenged black venire members,it is clear that hearn,mazza,and salsini were not similarly situated for several reasons.first,ambivalence about the death penalty was not the sole reason for striking bozeman,fields,or boggess.second,warren,rand,and kennedy were struck mainly because of ambivalence about the death penalty,but they each also expressed doubts about whether they personally could impose the death penalty even if the evidence indicated the death penalty was appropriate.this was not the case with hearn,mazza,and salsini.third,warren refused to give a clear answer as to whether or not he could impose the death penalty if the evidence warranted it.fourth,kennedy stated the death penalty should be limited to extreme cases.finally,rand ambivalence was less pronounced and more in line with the uncertainty expressed by hearn and mazza,although rand still indicated he was uncertain as to whether he could impose the death penalty.under our f
