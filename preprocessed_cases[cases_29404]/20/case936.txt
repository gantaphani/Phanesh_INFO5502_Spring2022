donathan wayne hadden was convicted on drug and gun offenses and received a sentence of months imprisonment.after an unsuccessful direct appeal,he filed a petition in the district court under west supp alleging that his convictions and sentence were unlawful.the district court agreed with hadden in part,vacated one of hadden convictions,and entered a new sentence of months imprisonment.in entering hadden new sentence,the district court did not conduct a resentencing hearing.
hadden now appeals his month sentence,arguing that he was entitled to a resentencing hearing and that the sentence was erroneous under united states booker,d.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
the procedural posture of this case is complicated,due in large part to the fact that it was percolating up from the district court during the supreme court recent interpretations of the sixth amendment in blakely washington,d and booker.because understanding the timing of these decisions in relation to hadden case is necessary to comprehend fully our resolution of this appeal,we set forth this case procedural and factual history in some detail.
beginning in,with the cooperation of drug dealers darlene norris and annie lewis,the government began to target jerry and sherrie miller,two of norris and lewis buyers.in a series of recorded telephone calls,the millers indicated that they knew a third party interested in purchasing two pounds of methamphetamine from norris.acting as the,the millers worked with norris to arrange the transaction on january,at the coastal mall in conway,south carolina.on the day of the reverse sting operation,hadden arrived at the mall with the millers and was arrested.he had three loaded firearms in his truck,digital scales,and in cash.ultimately,the government determined that sherrie miller sister,sheryl knight gruber,had made the arrangement for hadden to buy the two pounds of methamphetamine.
by superseding indictment,hadden was charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of methamphetamine,in violation of a,attempted possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine,in violation of and collectively the drug counts,and with use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c the c count.hadden pleaded not guilty and proceeded to a jury trial.
at trial,the government called joseph evans as a witness.evans testified that over the course of various transactions,he had purchased approximately three or four pounds of methamphetamine from that he then resold.evans purchased all of his methamphetamine from hadden,except for a purchase from the millers.on september,evans was arrested while in possession of eight ounces of methamphetamine,which he testified came from hadden.after evans arrest,hadden loaned him to post bond.hadden continued to loan evans money in connection with his legal fees,and evans testified that he continued to purchase methamphetamine from hadden after his arrest.
the government also called gruber,who testified that evans first introduced her to hadden in may.gruber sold methamphetamine that she purchased from evans and the millers.in december,jerry miller asked gruber if she knew anyone who wanted to buy two pounds of methamphetamine.shortly thereafter,gruber asked hadden the same question.hadden responded that he did not know anyone interested at that time,but later phoned gruber and told her to get in touch with miller to find out if the two pounds were still available.gruber agreed to contact miller and inquire whether the two pounds of methamphetamine were still available for sale.after a series of phone calls in which gruber acted as the middle person,she put hadden in touch with miller for them to deal directly on the transaction.
the government also called the millers as witnesses.jerry miller testified that he initially informed hadden that he had one pound of methamphetamine for sale.hadden indicated that he instead wanted two pounds.miller first met hadden minutes before their arrest,and it was his belief that hadden was there to purchase two pounds of methamphetamine.sherry miller likewise testified that she and her husband met hadden at the mall to sell him two pounds of methamphetamine that they were planning to get from norris and lewis.
the government then called norris and lewis as witnesses.norris testified about phone calls with the millers,which were recorded on behalf of the government.the millers told norris that they knew a man interested in purchasing two pounds of methamphetamine for per pound.on the day of the proposed transaction,lewis met the millers at the mall.the millers told her they had to go and meet their man.when they returned,they were followed by a man in a white truck,who was in fact hadden.just prior to the arrest,lewis testified that miller told her that hadden was going to pay for the drugs.
hadden defense theory was that he drove miles from vidalia,georgia to conway,south carolina to pick up that jerry miller owed evans,and to attempt to sell miller digital scales.hadden attempted to buttress his defense by pointing out that he only had on his person when he was arrested,far less than the purchase price of the two pounds of methamphetamine.
at the conclusion of the trial,the jury returned a guilty verdict on all three counts of the superseding indictment hadden presentence report psr held him accountable for grams of methamphetamine.under the guidelines,hadden was assigned a base offense level of because the psr assigned him a criminal history level of ii and attributed to him a t least kg but less than kg of methamphetamine,or at least g but less than kg of methamphetamine actual.sentencing guidelines manual c.the psr also recommended a upward adjustment for obstruction of justice for a total offense level of.this carried with it a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.hadden filed objections to the psr,arguing that the drug weights attributable to him should be reduced by grams and that the adjustment for obstruction of justice was improper.he contended that he would have an adjusted offense level of if his objections were sustained.
the district court conducted a lengthy sentencing hearing at which it attempted to address hadden objections and reach a drug weight that could be agreed upon by both parties.the district court determined that the evidence clearly demonstrated that hadden had attempted to purchase two pounds of methamphetamine during the reverse sting.the district court,however,found merit in hadden primary objection to attributing an additional grams to him,and accordingly it removed that weight from the calculation.the district court also sustained hadden objection to the obstruction of justice enhancement.nonetheless,based on the two pounds from the reverse sting and the methamphetamine that evans received from hadden some of which was laboratory tested and turned out to be actual methamphetamine,hadden base offense level remained at.based on this offense level and a criminal history level of ii,hadden sentencing range was to months imprisonment.
on june,the district court sentenced hadden at the low end of the guidelines range to months imprisonment on each of the drug counts to run concurrently and months imprisonment on the c count to run consecutively,for a total sentence of months.because hadden month sentence on the c count accounted for his gun possession during the commission of his drug crimes,the government was unable to seek an enhancement of his sentence under sentencing guidelines manual b setting forth an enhancement for possession of a gun during the commission of a drug crime.see sentencing guidelines manual application united states clements,cir noting that if defendant is sentenced under c,the enhancement under b is not permitted so as to avoid.hadden appealed his convictions and sentence,and we affirmed.united states hadden,cir.july,unpublished.
on february,hadden filed a petition under in the district court raising claims of ineffective assistance of counsel relating to all three counts.as to the c count,hadden argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the jury charge based on bailey united states,d holding that c prohibition on the use of a gun during the commission of a drug crime requires active employment of the firearm by the defendant emphasis omitted.on october,the district court entered an order dismissing the petition as it related to the drug counts,but stating,a s to the c count,if the government does not inform the court that it wishe s to retry hadden within sixty days,or if after so informing the court,the government fails to retry hadden within a reasonable time,the writ will be granted and hadden c conviction and sentence vacated.at.on november,the district court entered an order entitled judgment in a civil case,at,which entered judgment on hadden petition employing the same language used in the district court written opinion.hadden appealed that judgment,arguing that the district court erred by denying him relief on the drug counts.
while that appeal was pending,the government notified the district court that it did not intend to retry hadden on the c count.it also notified the district court that it would not seek to enhance hadden sentence under b,despite the fact such an enhancement was no longer prohibited in the absence of the sentence on the c count.on november,without conducting a resentencing hearing,the district court entered an order entitled amended judgment,at,which dismissed the c count and effectively vacated at least a portion of hadden original month sentence by entering a new month sentence on the remaining drug counts.
on december,hadden filed in the district court a document entitled objection to amended judgment,wherein he argued,inter alia,that he was entitled to a resentencing hearing under and rules and of the federal rules of criminal procedure.in this filing,hadden did not present any argument that he would have made at a resentencing hearing regarding the proper sentence he should have been given,but merely asserted that he had an absolute right to such a hearing so that he could have assistance of counsel to raise issues of downward departure.before the district court ruled on the objection to amended judgment,we denied a certificate of appealability coa under west supp on hadden appeal of the judgment in a civil case the order partially conditionally granting hadden petition and dismissed that appeal for want of jurisdiction.united states hadden.cir.april,unpublished.the district court later construed hadden objection to amended judgment as a motion for reconsideration and denied it.
hadden then appealed the amended judgment,repeating his argument that he was entitled to a resentencing hearing.his opening brief,like his motion for reconsideration,did not present any argument that he would have made to the district court at a resentencing hearing regarding the proper sentence he should be given,but merely asserted an absolute right to such a hearing.in opposition,the government argued that hadden was not entitled to a resentencing hearing because the district court did not increase his original sentence,and that any error in failing to hold a resentencing hearing was harmless given that hadden did not present any argument that he would have made to the district court at the hearing.before hadden filed his reply brief,the supreme court decided blakely,which held that washington state determinate sentencing scheme violated the sixth amendment.at.hadden cited blakely in his reply brief,contending that if given a resentencing hearing,he would argue that his month sentence violated the sixth amendment as interpreted by blakely after hadden filed his reply brief but before we resolved the appeal,we decided united states hammoud,cir en banc,vacated by,d,which held that the sentencing guidelines were not invalid under blakely interpretation of the sixth amendment.
on november,we affirmed hadden month sentence.united states hadden.cir.november,unpublished,vacated by united states hadden,cir.february,order granting petition for panel rehearing.in the opinion affirming hadden sentence,we declined to reach hadden argument that he was entitled to a sentencing hearing because we concluded that any error the district court committed in failing to hold such a hearing was harmless,given that hadden did not present any argument that he would have made to the district court at the hearing.id.at.we observed that hadden had stated in his reply brief that he would make a sixth amendment argument based on blakely,but we concluded that hadden blakely argument did not undercut our harmlessness conclusion because the argument would have failed under hammoud.id.at.
on november,hadden filed a petition for panel and en banc rehearing,raising arguments immaterial to this appeal.before we ruled on the petition for rehearing,the supreme court decided booker,which held that the sentencing guidelines were invalid under blakely interpretation of the sixth amendment,and which remedied this problem by making the sentencing guidelines advisory.at.believing it improper to continue to base a harmlessness conclusion on the hammoud,the panel granted hadden petition for panel rehearing and requested supplemental briefing on issues relating to booker.
in his supplemental brief,hadden argued that his amended sentence was constitutionally and statutorily erroneous under booker because it was enhanced based on facts not found by a jury nor admitted by hadden,and because it was mandatorily entered pursuant to the sentencing guidelines,respectively.in its supplemental brief,the government argued that hadden was not entitled to the benefit of booker because the amended judgment entering his month sentence was part of his part of his criminal because booker is not retroactive to petitions,see united states morris,cir 
as a court of limited jurisdiction,we are obligated to first consider sua sponte whether we have jurisdiction over hadden appeal.see steel citizens for a better env t,d the requirement that jurisdiction be established as a threshold matter springs from the nature and limits of the judicial power of the united states and is inflexible and without exception.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted bender williamsport area sch,d e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction even if the parties are prepared to concede it.internal quotation marks omitted.
a prisoner who seeks to appeal the final order in a proceeding under section,c b,must obtain a coa as a jurisdictional prerequisite to appeal,cockrell,d explaining that state prisoner may not appeal the district court denial of a petition under without first obtaining a coa.a coa will only issue if the prisoner has ma de a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c see also slack mcdaniel,d holding that when the district court denies a petition on procedural grounds,a coa will issue only when petitioner can demonstrate both that the prisoner has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling internal quotation marks omitted hadden has not obtained a coa in this instance 
if,therefore,the amended judgment was the final order in a proceeding under section,see c b,we lack jurisdiction over this appeal.if,on the other hand,the amended judgment was part of hadden criminal case,we have jurisdiction over this appeal because a defendant seeking to appeal his sentence in his criminal case need not obtain a coa to do so under a west providing for appellate jurisdiction over a final sentence entered by the district court without a coa requirement and west providing for appellate jurisdiction over final decisions of the district court.see united states allen,cir holding that jurisdiction exists over defendant appeal of his sentence under a and.our extensive research has discovered no cases directly addressing this issue 
in deciding whether we have jurisdiction over hadden appeal of the amended judgment,we first parse the language of.next,we examine the implications of the supreme court decision in andrews united states,d,on the meaning of.then,interpreting and andrews,we conclude that a district court order that enters either a correct ed sentence or the result of a resentenc ing under is a hybrid order that is both part of the proceeding and part of the petitioners underlying criminal case.finally,we conclude that because the amended judgment here corrected hadden sentence,and because he appeals only the aspect of the amended judgment that is part of his criminal case,we have jurisdiction over his appeal.
section provides federal prisoners a mechanism,beyond a direct appeal,for challenging the legality of their sentence.that section provides,in relevant part 
a prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by act of congress may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate,set aside or correct the sentence.
if the court finds that the judgment was unlawful for various specified reasons,the court shall vacate and set the judgment aside and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.
paragraph omitted 
an appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion as from a final judgment on application for a writ of habeas corpus.
under this section,a district court resolution of a prisoner petition proceeds in two steps.first,the district court must determine whether the prisoner sentence is unlawful on one of the specified grounds.id.at para.if the district court determines that the sentence is lawful,the court must deny the petition.if,by contrast,the court determines that the sentence is unlawful,the court shall vacate and set aside the sentence.id.at para.if the district court determines that the prisoner sentence is unlawful because of some legal defect in his conviction,the court may also vacate the prisoner conviction.see,in re taylor,cir noting that district court vacated petitioner unlawful c conviction.
second,if the prisoner sentence and,depending on the scope of the prisoner challenge,perhaps one or more of his convictions as well is set aside,the district court shall grant the prisoner an appropriate remedy.while t he remedy is broad and flexible,and entrusts to the courts the power to fashion an appropriate remedy,united states garcia,cir,lists the four remedies that are appropriate discharge the prisoner,grant the prisoner a new trial,the prisoner,or correct the prisoner sentence.accordingly,the end result of a successful proceeding must be the vacatur of the prisoner unlawful sentence and perhaps one or more of his convictions and one of the following the prisoner release,the grant of a future new trial to the prisoner,or a new sentence,be it imposed by a a resentencing or b a corrected sentence.id 
for purposes of determining when a proceeding is complete and therefore appealable,it is important to note that treats a district court order granting the prisoner a future new trial differently from a district court order granting the prisoner a future discharge,a future resentencing,or a future proceeding to correct the prisoner sentence.this difference is brought into clear view by the supreme court decision in andrews united states,d,and the consequences that flow from the court interpretation of.
in andrews,the district court granted two prisoners petitions because they had not been afforded the opportunity to allocute at their sentencings and directed that the prisoners be returned to the court for resentencing at some time in the future.id.the government appealed,and the court of appeals reversed on the merits of the allocution issue.id.the supreme court vacated the court of appeals decision,holding that the district court order,which contemplated the petitioners future resentencings but did not actually sentence the petitioners,was a interlocutory order under.id.at.as the supreme court concluded,because a district court order that contemplates a future sentencing is preliminary to one of the remedies authorized under paragraph of resentenc ing of the is therefore not the order entered on the motion under paragraph of.andrews,at.because an appeal may be taken only from the order entered on the motion,the supreme court held that until the district court actually resentenced the petitioners,the proceeding was not complete,and no appeal could be taken from the district court order contemplating,but not accomplishing,the prisoners resentencing.see also united states stitt,cir applying andrews to hold that a district court order that contemplates a future capital resentencing is not immediately appealable.
although andrews held only that a district court order granting a future resentencing is not immediately appealable because it does not complete the proceeding,andrews logic has implications far beyond its actual holding.several of these implications are relevant here.
first,because paragraph of authorizes the district court to correct the prisoner unlawful sentence in the event it grants the petition,a district court order that contemplates the court correction of the prisoner sentence at some time in the an order that contemplates the district court conducting a future resentenc ing does not complete the proceeding and is therefore not immediately appealable.andrews,at.
second,because paragraph of authorizes the district court to grant the prisoner a new trial in the event relief is appropriate,a district court order granting the prisoner a new trial completes the proceeding and is therefore immediately appealable,despite the fact that such an order contemplates further action by the district,conducting the new trial itself.see united states gordon,cir holding that a district court order granting a successful petitioner a new trial is immediately appealable united states allen,cir same united states dunham concrete,cir same andrews,at.
third,because paragraph of authorizes the district court to resentence the prisoner or correct the prisoner unlawful sentence in the event relief is appropriate,a district court order that either enters the result of a resentencing or corrects the prisoner sentence completes the proceeding and is therefore immediately appealable.andrews,at.
based on andrews implications,it is clear that when the district court remedies a successful petitioner unlawful sentence by vacating his conviction and sentence and granting him a new trial,the new trial itself is not part of the proceeding,but is instead part of the prisoner underlying criminal case.if,as discussed,the order granting a new trial completes the proceeding,then the new trial itself must,by process of elimination,occur in the petitioner criminal case.moreover,assuming the prisoner is again convicted,the district court enters an entirely new conviction and sentence.accordingly,we would have jurisdiction under to hear the prisoner appeal of his new conviction,see united states,cir holding that jurisdiction exists under over defendant appeal of his conviction,and we would have jurisdiction under a and to hear the prisoner appeal of his new sentence,allen,at.finally,was designed to afford prisoners a mechanism of collateral review of their conviction and sentence that is,independent review beyond the review authorized on a direct appeal.to hold that the new trial itself was part of the proceeding and therefore subject to coa requirement would prevent the defendant from ever obtaining direct appellate review of his new conviction and sentence.
when,however,the district court remedies a petitioner unlawful sentence by resentencing him or correcting his sentence,it is less clear whether the resentencing or correction itself is part of the prisoner proceeding or part of his criminal case.on the one hand,unlike the situation involving the grant of a new trial,the petition is not complete until the district court actually resentences the prisoner or corrects the prisoner sentence.see andrews,at.on the other hand,like the situation that exists after the new trial is complete,the end result of the resentencing or correction of the prisoner sentence is an entirely new sentence that,arguably,should be appealable under a plain application of a and.to hold otherwise would prevent the defendant from ever obtaining direct appellate review of his new sentence.
because a resentencing or correction of the prisoner sentence thus bears traits of both a proceeding and a criminal action,we conclude that an order entering the result of such a resentencing or an order correcting the prisoner sentence is a hybrid order that is both part of the petitioner proceeding and part of his criminal case.to the extent the order formally completes the prisoner proceeding,it is part of that proceeding,and,accordingly,a prisoner appeal of that aspect of the order is an appeal of a proceeding.for example,if the petitioner seeks to appeal the order by challenging the district court decision not to grant relief on some of the claims in support of his petition,he is appealing the final order in a proceeding under and must obtain a coa under to the extent the order vacates the original sentence and enters a new criminal sentence,by contrast,the order is part of the prisoner criminal case,and,accordingly,a prisoner appeal of that aspect of the order is part of the petitioner criminal case.for example,if the petitioner seeks to appeal the order by challenging the relief,whether the relief was appropriate under,whether the new sentence was in conformity with the constitution or sentencing guidelines,is appealing a new criminal sentence and therefore need not obtain a coa under a and.
this interpretation,while somewhat novel,is supported by the uncontroverted understanding that habeas corpus can be hybrid in nature.moore,cir because habeas actions have both criminal and civil aspects,courts have routinely regarded them as hybrid actions.united states jones,cir noting that habeas actions are a unique hybrid of civil and criminal smith angelone,cir habeas corpus cases are,in effect,hybrid actions whose nature is not adequately captured by the phrase civil action they are independent civil dispositions of completed criminal proceedings,which are intended to punish and require various constitutional guarantees.internal quotation marks omitted sloan pugh,cir concluding that habeas proceedings are unique or hybrid types of cases internal quotation marks omitted united states johnston,cir noting that courts had concluded that a motion is a hybrid,with characteristics indicative of both civil and criminal proceedings thus,although the proceeding is technically civil in nature,see woodford ngo,d habeas corpus is an original civil remedy for the enforcement of the right to personal liberty,rather than a stage of the criminal proceedings.internal quotation marks omitted,the remedy entered pursuant to the proceeding is often technically criminal in nature,as it relates directly to the prisoner criminal punishment,see ex parte tom tong.proceedings to enforce civil rights are civil proceedings,and proceedings for the punishment of crimes are criminal proceedings.
in addition,our interpretation of serves the policies behind and.we have stated that the goal of review is to place the defendant in exactly the same position he would have been had there been no error in the first instance.united states silvers,cir emphasis added see also united states hillary,cir noting that the most appropriate remedy is to put petitioners in the same boat as direct appellants.were we to hold that a successful petitioner who received a corrected sentence or a resentencing had to obtain a coa to appeal matters relating to the propriety of his new sentence,he would be placed in a worse situation than he would have been had there been no error in the first instance.most obviously,because a coa will not issue for allegations of error,he would not be able to obtain appellate review of any purely statutory errors at his sentencing,such as an error in construing the sentencing guidelines.
moreover,one of the central purposes of coa requirement is to prevent the government from having to respond to appeals from the denial of habeas relief.see cockrell,at.davis jacobs,d rehnquist,dissenting from the denial of petitions for certiorari.one reason congress may have sought to discourage meritless appeals in the habeas not the context of direct criminal that habeas review occurs after the prisoner has already had an opportunity on direct appeal to challenge his conviction and sentence.when a prisoner seeks to appeal the order entering the result of a resentencing or a corrected sentence,that order has never been subjected to appellate review.section policy justification would be if we were to interpret the statute to discourage appeals over sentences that had not yet been subject to appellate review 
we therefore hold that an order either correcting the prisoner sentence or entering the result of a resentencing is a hybrid order that is both part of the petitioner proceeding and part of his criminal case.if the petitioner seeks to appeal the order by raising arguments relating to the district court decision whether to grant relief on his petition,he is appealing the final order in a proceeding under and therefore must obtain a coa under.if,on the other hand,the petitioner seeks to appeal matters relating to the propriety of the relief granted,he is appealing a new criminal sentence and therefore need not comply with coa requirement.
applying this rule here,we conclude that hadden appeal of the amended judgment is part of his criminal his,accordingly,that he does not need a coa to pursue this appeal.first,it is clear that the amended judgment neither discharg ed hadden nor grant ed him a new trial under.instead,because the amended judgment gave hadden a new sentence,it either correct ed hadden original sentence or resentence d him under.under our analysis in part,supra,the amended judgment is therefore a hybrid order that is part of both hadden criminal case and his proceeding.
second,in this appeal hadden appeals only that aspect of the amended judgment that is part of his criminal case.hadden arguments on the district court was required to conduct a resentencing hearing under criminal rule and not challenge the district court conclusion that relief was not warranted with respect to his drug convictions,but instead challenge whether the relief that was ordered with respect to his c conviction was an appropriate form of relief.because the district court remedy technically vacated hadden original sentence by entering a new corrected sentence,the remedy was criminal in nature as it related directly to hadden criminal punishment.we therefore conclude that we have jurisdiction over hadden appeal of the amended judgment under a and,and turn to the merits of the appeal 
on the merits,hadden argues that the district court erred by failing to conduct a resentencing hearing once it determined that relief was warranted on his petition and the district court committed constitutional and statutory booker error.we address these arguments in turn.
first,hadden argues that the district court erred under and rules and of the federal rules of criminal procedure by failing to conduct a formal resentencing before entering the amended judgment.we review the form of relief the district court awards to a successful petitioner for abuse of discretion.see united states,cir united states gordon,cir.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to conduct a resentencing hearing.
we turn first to hadden argument that the district court erred under by failing to conduct a formal resentencing hearing.
as previously noted,authorizes the district court to take one of four distinct courses in remedying a successful petitioner unlawful sentence discharge the prisoner,grant the prisoner a new trial,resentence the prisoner,or correct the prisoner sentence.as also noted,it is clear that the amended judgment,which gave hadden a new sentence,must have either correct ed hadden original sentence or entered the result of a resentenc ing.it is equally clear that by using the different terms correct and resentence refers to different concepts.see cunningham scibana,cir the use of different terms within related statutes generally implies that different meanings were intended.quoting norman singer,statutes and statutory construction,at ed.
as a descriptive matter,we think it is more accurate to say that the amended judgment correct ed hadden original sentence rather than that the amended judgment entered the result of a resentenc ing.to correct means to make or set right.merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.this is precisely what the district court did here it removed the error from hadden original thereby made it right by excising the unlawful month term on the c count and hadden original month term on the drug counts.moreover,the district court did not conduct any of the procedures that would have been required at a sentencing.the probation office did not prepare a new psr,the district court did not accept any new evidence or any legal argument,and hadden was not given the opportunity to allocute,all of which would have been required if the entry of the amended judgment were considered a resentencing.see fed.if the phrase correct ing the prisoner unlawful sentence means anything in this context,it must describe what the district court did here.see also,united states erwin,cir concluding that the district court entry of an amended judgment,which a portion of the prisoner sentence,was a correction of the sentence,not a resentencing rust united states,cir noting,where district court had vacated one of petitioner convictions and modified sentence by striking the term of imprisonment on the vacated count,that the trial court was not required to resentence the petitioner.
the fact that it is proper,as a descriptive matter,to call the amended judgment the correct ion of hadden original sentence does not,of course,compel the conclusion that it was proper,as a normative matter,for the district court to correct hadden sentence in lieu of conducting a formal resentenc ing.indeed,hadden argues that our decision in hillary compels us to conclude that the district court erred in failing to conduct such a resentencing.in hillary,the petitioner had been convicted of violating a and c.at.he filed a petition under alleging that his c conviction violated bailey.id.at.the district court agreed and vacated the c conviction and its accompanying term of imprisonment,leaving the sentence on the count intact.id.the government argued to the district court that it should conduct a resentencing to enhance hillary sentence under b,but the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction under to conduct a resentencing.id.at.on the government appeal,we vacated and remanded for resentencing,noting that gives the district courts broad and flexible power to fashion an appropriate remedy,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,and holding that this power included the authority to conduct a resentencing,id.at.
hillary does not help hadden.hillary held only that the district court is authorized to conduct a resentencing in awarding relief pursuant to,not that the district court is required,in resolving every petition,to conduct a resentencing.see id.at concluding that resentencing is permit ted when a c conviction is vacated on collateral review united states smith,cir determining that the district court had jurisdiction to resentence the defendant after a successful collateral attack of his c conviction united states hawthorne,cir noting that the government may pursue resentencing if it elects to forgo a second trial on the c charge.hadden argues,however,that the district court erred in failing to conduct a resentencing here because he,like the government in hillary,requested a resentencing.this argument is based on a misreading of hillary.we did not direct that resentencing take place in hillary because the government requested it.instead,we remanded the case with instructions to conduct a resentencing because the district court refusal to do so in the first instance was based on the erroneous legal conclusion that it lacked the authority to resentence hillary and because the district court generally may not make a prisoner sentence more onerous without conducting a resentencing.see,erwin,at affirming district court decision to modify prisoner sentence to account for vacated conviction without conducting a resentencing because the modification was a downward correction of the prisoner illegal sentence united states moree,cir we have long recognized the distinction between proceedings in the district court that modify an existing sentence and those that impose a new sentence after the original sentence has been set aside.in the former instance,a resentencing with the defendant present usually is not required,unless the modification makes the sentence more onerous.rust,at noting,where district court had vacated one of the petitioner convictions and modified the sentence by striking the term of imprisonment on the vacated count,that the trial court was not required to resentence the petitioner 
here,by contrast,the government did not seek to enhance hadden month sentence on his remaining drug counts,and the district court did not,in fact,increase that portion of his earlier sentence,much less his original month sentence.therefore,just as it is clear,as a descriptive matter,that the district court actually correct ed hadden sentence under,it is also clear,as a normative matter,that the district court properly correct ed hadden sentence under.the text of clearly affords the district courts the authority to correct a prisoner unlawful sentence without conducting a formal resentenc ing hearing,and nothing in hillary suggests otherwise.
hadden further contends that the district court erred by failing to conduct a formal resentencing because we have adopted a theory of sentencing.under this theory,a sentence is not merely the sum of its parts instead,because the district court crafts a sentence by considering all of the relevant factors as a whole,an appellate court that rejects one of the grounds on which the sentence is based unbundles the entire sentence package.if,then,the appellate court vacates and remands a prisoner sentence because of a sentencing error,the district court may not simply the portions of the original sentence,but must conduct a new resentencing hearing to reformulate the entire sentence package.
we do not deny that the theory has support in our case law.the theory,however,does not help hadden.here,appellate not conclude that hadden original sentence was unlawful,vacate that sentence,and remand to the district court instead,the district court striking the c sentence and reentering the remaining that it was satisfied with the resulting sentence.the district court has broad and flexible power under to determine the nature and scope of the remedial proceedings in the first instance,hillary,at internal quotation marks omitted,and nothing in the theory forbids the district courts from doing what the text of clearly permits correct ing a prisoner unlawful sentence without conducting a formal resentenc ing.
hadden also argues that criminal rules and required the district court to conduct a resentencing hearing before imposing his month sentence.this argument is without merit.in relevant part,criminal rule sets forth procedures that must occur at s entencing.for its part,criminal rule provides that a defendant must be present at sentencing.fed.a see also united states lawrence,cir t he plain text of rule mandates that a defendant be physically present at sentencing.for reasons already explained,however,we do not believe that the district court conducted a sentencing,but instead correct ed hadden sentence.criminal rules and are therefore inapplicable.
second,hadden argues that his corrected sentence was statutorily erroneous under booker because the district court mandatorily applied the sentencing guidelines.hadden did not raise his statutory booker argument below,so we review it for plain error.see united states hughes,cir.
under plain error review,the defendant must show that the district court committed error,the error was plain,and the error affected his substantial rights.id.at.if the defendant complains of statutory booker error,he can show that the error affected his substantial rights only if the district court treatm
