harold carter,warden,appeals the district court conditional grant of habeas relief to ezzard harris.the district court granted the petition after concluding that harris was presumptively denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel when the state trial court failed to inquire as to whether his counsel had a conflict of interest after being so advised by counsel,and that harris was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel due to defense counsel actual conflict of interest.for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court decision to grant the writ.
ezzard harris and kevin payton were charged in state court with various offenses arising out of a shooting incident in fremont,ohio.harris and payton were represented by attorney george evans.evans did not foresee a conflict of interest when he undertook the joint representation.harris and payton told evans that neither would accept a plea bargain in exchange for testimony against the other.evans planned a common defense for presentation at what was expected to be a joint trial.on the day that harris and payton were scheduled for trial,the state trial court sua sponte ordered payton to be tried before harris.payton had been convicted,but not sentenced,when harris trial began.
payton invoked his fifth amendment right against when called to testify at harris trial.the prosecution asked the trial court to order payton to testify under a grant of immunity from prosecution for any additional crimes related to the shooting incident,with the exception of perjury and falsification.immediately after the trial court granted the request,the following exchange took place between the trial judge and evans 
evans your honor,may i request that payton,lieu of the fact that he,for all intents and purposes,indigent since he in jail,be assigned appointed counsel for the purpose of representing him during his questioning here 
the court the only thing has immunity,so there really no need for that.
evans right.i understand that,your honor.but he can not be given immunity from falsification.and there no indication,you know,i mean one way or the other,so to speak,put it this way.we know he given a prior statement to the police,and we know that if that prior statement was an attempt to mislead a public official in their duties that he could be subject to criminal liability for that.and i now,i do know if payton is aware of that,so to speak.and i represent him,but clearly if he going to be given immunity i am suggesting that that would cause a problem for me to represent him right now,and harris.
the court because i given him immunity,i do see the problem.bring in the jury.
on direct examination,payton testified that he and harris were the only men in the van identified as being involved in the shooting and that he was the driver.payton also testified that he was in the van when the victims were shot but that he was not the shooter.evans did not payton.the jury found harris guilty as charged.
on direct appeal,harris claimed that t he court of common pleas committed reversible error when it permitted testimony of kevin peyton sic and harris was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel could not effectively represent him while representing peyton sic at the same time.the ohio court of appeals denied the appeal.the ohio supreme court denied leave to appeal.
while harris direct appeal was still pending before the ohio supreme court,he applied to reopen that appeal under ohio rule of appellate procedure b,claiming in relevant part that harris was denied the effective assistance of counsel when defense counsel created a conflict of interest by representing harris and his,knowing that the,like harris,had denied responsibility,but knowing also that the might be called to testify and would implicate harris as the shooter.the ohio court of appeals denied the application,and the ohio supreme court denied leave to appeal.
on june,harris filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that petitioner was denied the effective assistance of counsel due to his lawyer conflict of interest.the district court initially denied harris petition based on its conclusion that the petition was time barred by the limitations period of d because a rule b application was part of ohio collateral review process.harris filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure e to alter or amend the judgment,which the district court granted in light of the rule established in bronaugh ohio,cir holding that a rule b application must be analyzed under d a as part of ohio direct review process.the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether harris trial counsel was ineffective as a result of an actual conflict of interest.after the hearing,the district court granted harris habeas relief,ordering that he be released from custody unless granted a new trial within ninety days.the state filed a timely notice of appeal.
harris claims that he is entitled to habeas relief on the ground that his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated due to his lawyer conflict of interest.this court reviews de novo the district court conclusions of law,including mixed questions of law and fact,and its findings of fact for clear error.moss hofbauer,cir.section d of title of the united states code sets forth the standard for granting a writ of habeas corpus 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
the parties do not dispute the reasonableness of the facts determined in the state court proceedings.thus,to be entitled to relief under d,this court must find that the decision of the ohio court of appeals was either contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,the supreme court clearly established precedents.price vincent,d.
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a state court decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.the supreme court has cautioned that a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.
to show a violation of the sixth amendment right to counsel,clearly established supreme court precedent requires a defendant to demonstrate that his or her attorney made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment,and that the attorney deficient performance was so prejudicial that it deprive d the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.strickland washington,d.in the context of an alleged conflict of interest in representation,the test for a sixth amendment violation has been modified by clearly established supreme court precedent.in cases where a defendant or defense counsel makes a timely objection to joint representation based on an asserted conflict of interests and the trial court fails to inquire as to whether the conflict warrants the appointment of separate counsel,prejudice is presumed and reversal is automatic.holloway arkansas,d
