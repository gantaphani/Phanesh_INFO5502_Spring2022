the facts,as recounted by the supreme court of south carolina in its opinion in williams direct appeal,are as follows 
at approximately on wednesday,june,the bodies of linda williams wife and shawn williams son were discovered inside the family van in a forest in edgefield county,south carolina,approximately six miles from their home near augusta,georgia.the front bumper of the van was against a tree,and fire had partially damaged the vehicle.the investigators detected a strong odor of gasoline and found several metal cans containing gasoline inside the van.wife was discovered in the driver seat,which was positioned so far back that her feet could not reach the pedals,and son was seated in the front passenger seat.blood was found on a piece of pvc pipe on the van floorboard.wife was dressed in a gray,gray sweatpants pulled down to her upper thigh,light pink socks,nylon panties,and she was not wearing a bra or shoes.son was also shoeless and was wearing a and sweatpants.
wife suffered a black eye,a contusion on the bridge of her nose,contusions on her left forearm,and abrasions on her left shoulder.these injuries were consistent with having been caused by a human fist.the autopsy revealed that wife cause of death was blunt head trauma due to a beating.son suffered a bruise to his forehead,as well as abrasions to his chin,back,and right side of his neck.his cause of death was asphyxiation due to manual strangulation.wounds created by the fire were postmortem.although the deaths occurred within the same time frame,a specific time of death was not determined.
at trial,several friends of wife testified that she always dressed neatly and would not go out in public dressed in a without a bra.additionally,they stated that because wife was short in stature,she always positioned the driver seat of the van close to the steering wheel.one friend stated that she last spoke with wife by telephone at on june.a neighbor testified that on june,a car drove into the driveway at williams home between and further testimony established that at approximately on june,wife van was not parked in the driveway.
a bath towel and son tennis shoes with blood stains on them were found at williams home.in addition,williams right hand was severely bruised and injury was consistent with having occurred on june.williams told a friend that on the day of the homicides,wife and son were planning to go shopping at columbia mall in columbia,south carolina.prior to receiving the autopsy results,williams informed the friend that wife had been beaten to death,and son had been strangled with a plastic wire wrap similar to wire wrap son had in his bedroom.when asked if he killed wife and son,williams did not respond.

state williams.
at the conclusion of the state case,williams moved for a directed verdict,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of the murders,that edgefield county,south carolina,was not the proper venue,and that the edgefield county circuit court lacked subject matter and personal jurisdiction.the circuit court denied the motion,and williams thereafter declined to testify or present other evidence.the jury returned a guilty verdict on both charges of murder.in the penalty phase the jury recommended death sentences,finding two statutory aggravating circumstances that williams committed the murders for monetary gain and that he murdered two or more persons by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct.the circuit court followed the jury recommendation and imposed a separate death sentence for each murder.in his direct appeal to the supreme court of south carolina,williams claimed,among other things,that the evidence was insufficient to establish venue and guilt.the state supreme court,in a thorough opinion,affirmed williams convictions and sentences,and the supreme court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari,williams south carolina,d.
williams filed two applications for state relief,the second of which was granted by the circuit court pcr court.the pcr court concluded that williams was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to request a jury instruction that the term life imprisonment should be understood in its ordinary and plain meaning.according to the pcr court,the instruction was necessary to ensure that the jury understood the nature of its life imprisonment option.the pcr court therefore granted williams a new sentencing proceeding.the state then petitioned the supreme court of south carolina for a writ of certiorari,and that court reversed the decision of the pcr court.although the state supreme court concluded that williams counsel was ineffective for failing to request a plain meaning instruction,it ultimately determined that williams was not prejudiced by the deficient performance.specifically,the court found no evidence in the record to support the conclusion that had the jury been given a plain meaning charge there is a reasonable possibility it would have reached a different result and returned two life sentences.
next,williams filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in district court,and that court granted relief.first,the district court agreed with the supreme court of south carolina that williams counsel was ineffective for failing to request a plain meaning instruction.second,the court determined that counsel ineffectiveness was reasonably likely to have affected the outcome of williams capital sentencing hearing because,among other things,williams prior history contained a number of mitigating factors,including no criminal record.the district court rejected williams claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions or south carolina venue.the state appeals the award of the writ on williams ineffective assistance claim,and williams,arguing that the writ should have been awarded on the additional ground that the evidence was not sufficient to establish his guilt or proper venue.
when,as in this case,a district court decision on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is based on a state court record,our review is de novo.frazer south carolina,cir.federal habeas review in this case focuses only on legal determinations made by the supreme court of south carolina in adjudicating the merits of claims raised by williams.accordingly,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,provides that a federal writ may not be issued unless the underlying state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.the supreme court instructs us that u nder d unreasonable application clause a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be objectively unreasonable.williams taylor,d.
williams contends that he was denied his sixth amendment right to assistance of counsel when his lawyer failed to request the south carolina plain meaning instruction in his capital sentencing proceeding.in rejecting williams claim,the supreme court of south carolina applied strickland washington,d,the supreme court case that sets the standards for judging whether a criminal defendant conviction or death sentence must be set aside because counsel rendered ineffective assistance.a conviction or death sentence must be set aside when counsel performance was deficient and the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.id.at.the deficiency inquiry centers on whether counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness as measured by prevailing professional norms.id.at.to avoid the distorting effects of hindsight,however,a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.id.at.the defendant or petitioner bears the burden of overcoming this presumption.id.when counsel assistance in a capital sentencing proceeding was deficient,the prejudice inquiry centers on whether there is a reasonable probability that,absent counsel errors,the sentencer would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.id.at.the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury must be considered in making this determination.id.our review convinces us that the supreme court of south carolina did not engage in an unreasonable application of strickland when it determined that although williams counsel performed in a deficient manner when he failed to request the plain meaning instruction,there was no resulting prejudice.
south carolina law provides a capital defendant with the right,invoked by request,to a jury instruction at sentencing that the term life imprisonment is to be understood in its ordinary and plain meaning.southerland state.the instruction is available even if the defendant might become eligible for parole,and a trial court refusal to grant a request for the instruction is reversible error on direct appeal.id.at.the purpose of the plain meaning instruction is to ensure that the jury understands its sentencing options life imprisonment or death without speculating about the possibility of parole.see state norris.
because a south carolina capital defendant right to the plain meaning instruction is so well entrenched,the state supreme court concluded that williams trial counsel rendered substandard deficient performance when he failed to request the instruction.instead of asking for a plain meaning instruction,counsel initial strategy was to ask for a parole eligibility instruction to advise the jury that,if it opted for a life sentence,williams would be eligible for parole in thirty years.counsel explained at the pcr hearing that he requested the parole eligibility instruction to enable the jury to understand that a life sentence meant more than five or ten or fifteen years.the trial court refused the parole eligibility instruction,which is not required to be given at the defendant request.see mcwee state.williams counsel did not follow up with a request for the plain meaning instruction.as the south carolina supreme court observed,counsel acknowledged that he had no strategic or tactical reason for not requesting the plain meaning instruction.he admitted that he believed the trial court would give the plain meaning instruction as a matter of course and when it was not given,it did not occur to him to raise the issue with the court.
in these circumstances the supreme court of south carolina did not unreasonably apply strickland performance standard.williams counsel was well aware of the plain meaning instruction and of its availability upon request.he surely knew that the instruction would have furthered his goal of making the jury aware that a life sentence would in all events result in a long prison term,and he could not provide a satisfactory explanation for his failure to ask for the instruction.thus,the state supreme court reasonably concluded that the representation provided by williams counsel was deficient under strickland performance standard,that is,it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness as measured by prevailing professional norms.see strickland,at.
after determining that williams counsel was deficient in his performance,the supreme court of south carolina considered whether counsel substandard performance prejudiced the defense.the state supreme court analysis focused first on why the pcr court had erred in concluding that strickland prejudice requirement was satisfied.the pcr court believed that,without the plain meaning instruction,williams defense at the sentencing phase was prejudiced because the state relied largely on its circumstantial proof in the guilt phase to establish the statutory aggravating factors in the sentencing phase williams had no prior criminal record and he was released on bond prior to trial.the state supreme court,after carefully consider ing the trial record,concluded that williams was not prejudiced by the lack of a plain meaning charge.
in the sentencing phase the jury found two statutory aggravating factors that allowed it to recommend that williams be sentenced to death for each murder williams committed each murder for the purpose of receiving money or a thing of monetary value,and he murdered two or more persons by one act or pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct.the supreme court of south carolina concluded that strong evidence,albeit circumstantial,supported the jury finding of the two statutory aggravating factors.the state supreme court recounted this evidence as follows.
williams and his wife had been experiencing significant martial problems,and they were in dire financial straits they had recently declared bankruptcy,and foreclosure proceedings had been initiated against their home.in the month before the murders,williams had substantially increased life insurance coverage on his wife and son,naming himself beneficiary.williams forged his wife signature on forms that added death benefits under family automobile policies.the bodies were found in the family van,which had been partially burned.right after the murders williams displayed injuries to his right hand severe bruising and swelling that were consistent with the beating or blunt head trauma that killed his wife.the son death was due to strangulation.after the murders,but before williams received the autopsy results,he accurately described the causes of the deaths to a friend,stating that his wife had been beaten to death and that his son had been strangled by a plastic wire wrap.from this evidence the supreme court of south carolina concluded that the jury found williams planned in cold blood the deaths of his child and his wife,making arrangements to benefit financially.the gist of the state supreme c
