petitioner allen bridgers,convicted of capital murder in texas and sentenced to death,appeals the denial of federal habeas relief.bridgers contends that the warnings he received prior to his custodial interrogation were inadequate to apprise him of his constitutional rights,and thus,the resulting confession was admitted at trial in violation of the fifth amendment.the district court granted a certificate of appealability coa with respect to this claim.see c.additionally,bridgers requests a coa with respect to his fourth amendment claim.we decide that bridgers has not shown that the state court decision that he was adequately advised of his fifth amendment rights is objectively unreasonable and affirm the district court denial of federal habeas relief.finding his fourth amendment claim barred,we deny the request for a coa.
background 
on may,the body of mary amie was discovered by her niece at her home in tyler,texas that same day bridgers flew from the worth airport to fort lauderdale,florida.three days later on may,detective charles morrow of the fort lauderdale police department received information from crime stoppers regarding a possible suspect wanted in texas for murder.detective morrow had no prior knowledge of the texas murder and did not contact texas authorities.rather,he accompanied the individual who had provided the information to crime stoppers to the holiday park area of fort lauderdale.the confidential informant pointed out bridgers as the person who admitted that he had murdered a woman in texas.
detective morrow waited for additional detectives to arrive and then approached bridgers,who was lying in the grass.detective morrow testified that there were seven plainclothes officers in the vicinity but could not remember how many approached bridgers.morrow testified that his badge,gun,and handcuffs were displayed and that it was obvious he was a police officer.upon approaching bridgers,detective morrow stated that he was conducting an investigation and asked bridgers to accompany him to the police station.at the suppression hearing,detective morrow testified that bridgers was nervous,but cooperative and agreed to go to the police station for questioning,saying okay.that fine.let go.he also testified that if bridgers had refused to accompany him to the station,he would have detained bridgers and questioned bridgers in the park.bridgers was handcuffed and transported to the station in an unmarked car.
upon arrival at the fort lauderdale police station,detective morrow obtained bridgers driver license which identified him as allen bridgers.next,detective morrow took him to the interview room to meet with detectives jack king and jack gee.detective gee had obtained a fax of a warrant for bridgers arrest dated may from the smith county sheriff department.according to detective morrow testimony,it was at this point that bridgers was under arrest.
when the detectives entered the room,they introduced themselves to bridgers,and detective king warned bridgers from a card issued by the fort lauderdale police department.the card read as follows 
you have the right to remain silent.do you understand anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.do you understand 
you have the right to the presence of an prior to any questioning.do you understand 
if you can not afford an,one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you so desire.do you understand 
bridgers responded affirmatively to each question posed to him.he indicated that he was not sure whether he wanted an attorney.he did ask and was permitted to speak to his mother.after he received the warnings,bridgers was asked if he knew why he was there and responded that texas thought he had killed someone.detective king asked,did you and bridgers said,yes,you got the right guy.
after bridgers finished talking with his mother,the detectives activated the tape recorder and administered the warnings a second time.then bridgers gave the audio taped confession at issue in which he admitted murdering mary amie and taking her purse,jewelry,and car.he requested two short stops and both requests were honored.both detectives king and gee testified that bridgers did not appear to be under the influence of any substances and his mental capacity did not seem diminished in any way.they also denied threatening bridgers or promising him anything in return for his statement.
prior to trial,bridgers filed a motion to suppress his confession.the state trial court held a hearing on the motion and denied it.ultimately,bridgers audio taped confession was admitted at trial over objection.the jury convicted bridgers of capital murder,and he was sentenced to death.on his automatic direct appeal,the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence.bridgers state of texas.october,unpublished.
bridgers also filed an application for writ of habeas corpus in state court,and the court of criminal appeals denied relief.ex parte bridgers.may.bridgers now appeals the district court denial of federal habeas relief.
ii.analysis 
fifth.standard of review 
bridgers filed his section petition for a writ of habeas corpus after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.the petition,therefore,is subject to aedpa.see lindh murphy,d.pursuant to the federal habeas statute,as amended by aedpa,d,we defer to a state court adjudication of a petitioner claims on the merits unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.a state court decision is deemed contrary to clearly established federal law if it reaches a legal conclusion in direct conflict with a prior decision of the supreme court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the supreme court based on materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a state court decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it is objectively unreasonable.id.at.at.additionally,pursuant to section e,state court findings of fact are presumed to be correct,and the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.see valdez cockrell,cir.
inadequate warnings 
bridgers argues that the warnings given to him by florida law enforcement officers prior to custodial interrogation were insufficient to protect his fifth amendment rights,rendering his murder confession inadmissible.more specifically,bridgers contends that the warnings he received were inadequate under miranda arizona,d,because although the warnings explained that he had a right to the presence of counsel prior to questioning,they did not explicitly state that he had a right to consult an attorney during questioning.on direct appeal,the texas court of criminal appeals rejected this argument,opining that 
certainly,the right to the presence of an attorney during questioning is a crucial vehicle for safeguarding the privilege against.see miranda,at.however,we do not think that the above warning is susceptible to the interpretation bridgers advances.the detectives did not tell bridgers that he had the right to consult or speak to an attorney before questioning,which might have created the impression that the attorney could not be present during interrogation.they told him that he had the right to the presence of an attorney before any questioning commenced.we think that this conveyed to bridgers that he was entitled to the presence of an attorney before questioning and that this attorney could remain during questioning.
bridgers state of texas,at.october,unpublished emphasis in original.accordingly,the question is whether the court of criminal appeals the warnings adequately advised bridgers of the right to have his attorney present during the contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court.
in miranda,the suprem
