this is an appeal from an order of the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,entered on february,denying donald creighton petition for habeas relief under.after a massachusetts superior court judge declared a mistrial,creighton was retried by a newly impaneled jury and convicted of rape,kidnapping,and assault and battery.he asserts that the second trial and the resulting convictions violated his federal constitutional right against double jeopardy.both the state superior and appellate courts held that the second trial and ultimate convictions were not barred by the double jeopardy clause.applying the highly deferential standard of review prescribed by aedpa,we affirm.
on october,a grand jury indicted creighton for rape,kidnapping,and assault and battery.creighton jury trial began on january.on direct examination,the victim testified that creighton held her against her will in his apartment,beat her with his fists,slapped her repeatedly,and then raped her.on,after the victim denied being under the influence of any substance on the day in question,the court sustained an objection to defense counsel question regarding the last time she had been under the influence of a substance.the victim also testified that the medical examination performed on her the night of her alleged rape indicated that the physician had found no bruises.
creighton testified in his own defense.on direct examination,he testified that he and the victim had engaged in consensual intercourse,after which she demanded.he denied ever holding the victim against her will or abusing her in any way.he also testified that after he refused to pay her,she threatened to accuse him of rape and to return with a male friend presumably to obtain the money.approximately twenty minutes after the victim departed,creighton left his apartment.
on,after the prosecutor asked creighton about why he left his apartment after the incident,the following exchange occurred 
prosecutor were you afraid these people were going to come back and get you,is that why you left 
creighton i had mixed feelings.you know,i felt very felt that i was in the dark.you know,i felt that i was deceived.
prosecutor yes 
creighton you know i did know what her motives were.
prosecutor sure 
creighton i did know,at this time,that she used drugs.she shot heroin and stuff 
prosecutor you did know that,no 
creighton no.
the prosecutor returned to her initial question of whether creighton had left because he was afraid of something.after creighton response,the court sua sponte provided the following curative instruction let me just tell the jury,on that reference,to the use of drugs.there absolutely no evidence that the alleged victim in this case,used or uses drugs,and you are to disregard that,and you not to mention that in your deliberations.go ahead.
the following colloquy then occurred 
prosecutor thank you.
creighton there testimony 
the court hold on.wait a minute,creighton.
creighton there testimony of probable cause 
the court creighton,stop it.stop it 
creighton that she used drugs.
the court okay.bring him out right now and the jury may be excused.
creighton you just do want the jury to know 
the court mistrial.
creighton like she was.
the transcript quoted above fails to fully depict what occurred in the courtroom.an audiotape of the proceedings,which is part of the record,reveals that as creighton continued to speak over the court instructions not to do so,the trial judge voice became progressively louder,and,at one point,she banged her fist on the bench.her last stop it was considerably louder than her previous declarations and voiced in a,excited tone.
after ordering the mistrial and as she headed for chambers,she held creighton in contempt of court.two minutes after departing the courtroom,the judge returned and,in creighton but not the jury presence,stated okay,i said the word mistrial,but i do think the jury knows what i meant by that.i just as soon continue with this case and with this jury,unless there an objection and somebody moves for a mistrial.after conferring with creighton,defense counsel moved for a mistrial,explaining that although he underst ood that the declaration of mistrial was as the result of the conduct of his client,he believed that the declaration coupled with creighton being held in contempt of court in front of the jury prejudiced the jury against creighton and no instruction would remove that prejudice.the trial judge agreed and granted creighton request for a mistrial and admonished creighton not to let it happen again.creighton attempted to respond,but this time he heeded her directive to stop.she then called back the jury and discharged them from the case.
the following monday,creighton moved to dismiss the indictments against him on the ground that a retrial would be barred by the double jeopardy clause,and moved to recuse the judge from presiding over the second trial.the court denied both motions.
seeking review of his motion to dismiss,creighton moved to stay the second trial and filed a petition,under.law ch,along with the audiotape of the relevant portion of the trial proceedings,to the single justice of the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc.after a hearing,the single justice denied the petition.no appeal was taken to the full court.creighton commonwealth.
creighton was subsequently retried by a newly impaneled jury,with the same superior court judge presiding,and convicted of rape,kidnapping,and assault and battery.
reconsideration of first petition to dismiss 
on june,creighton filed a second petition to the single justice of the sjc,seeking reconsideration of the denial of his first petition.the single justice again denied relief.the sjc affirmed that decision on the procedural ground that creighton had failed to appeal the denial of his initial petition.in january,creighton filed a motion for release from illegal incarceration,pursuant to.pro.a,arguing that the second trial was barred by double jeopardy.after a hearing the superior court denied this motion.
direct appeal 
creighton appealed his convictions and the superior court denial of his motion for release from illegal incarceration to the massachusetts appeals court.the appeals court affirmed the underlying convictions and the denial of his motion for a new trial.see commonwealth creighton.unpublished opinion.it held that the manifest necessity test did not apply in these circumstances because although the trial judge first said mistrial,creighton effectively pulled the plug on the first trial by requesting the mistrial.id.at the court rejected creighton claim that the manifest necessity test should apply because he had no opportunity to consent to the trial court sua sponte declaration of mistrial before she rushed from the bench,reasoning that the trial judge was entitled to cool off,and,in any case,the judge returned and gave creighton a full opportunity to be heard.id.at.finally,finding that the trial judge conduct did not evidence any bad faith,the court rejected creighton contention that the record demonstrated that the trial judge had lied to the jury or acted in such a way as to bar a retrial.id.at citing united states dinitz,d.finally,the appeals court rejected creighton challenge to the trial judge sua sponte instruction to the jury regarding the victim alleged drug use,explaining that these inappropriate remarks were made on and that his answers contained information which the judge considered both nonresponsive and inadmissible.id.at citations omitted.his application for further appellate review to the sjc was denied on october.
