this case addresses whether defendant eric glover received constitutionally ineffective assistance of.the district court found that glover had not proven actual prejudice under strickland washington,d.it nevertheless granted a writ of habeas corpus to glover under the prejudice reasoning of united states cronic,d.because strickland washington actual prejudice analysis applies to this case,and because glover can not prove actual prejudice under the strickland test,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
on june,a south carolina jury found eric glover guilty of numerous counts resulting from the january,kidnapping and robbery of wayne cooper.based on cooper description of his assailant as well as other leads,police arrested glover in florida and returned him to south carolina.a grand jury indicted him on five counts stemming from the january larceny,kidnapping,armed robbery,assault and battery with the intent to kill,and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.
gordon jenkinson,the public defender,originally represented glover.jenkinson met briefly with glover at the march,preliminary hearing.glover proclaimed his innocence,and later wrote jenkinson a letter with a list of potential alibi witnesses who would testify that glover was in florida on the date of the crime.following this meeting,however,jenkinson resigned as public defender and his cases were reassigned.
the court ultimately assigned glover case to jerome askins.askins received glover file on june.glover trial was scheduled for the two week term of court beginning june.in addition to glover case,askins was also responsible for fifty or sixty other assigned criminal cases during the term.
askins first met with glover on june.during this first meeting,glover denied having committed the crimes.he again claimed he was in florida during the robbery.glover provided askins with the names of approximately ten individuals whom he claimed would establish his alibi.askins contacted some of these people,but determined that they would not provide any useful testimony.askins said that he did not contact the other witnesses identified by glover.askins also reviewed jenkinson notes and talked to the investigating officer.
glover trial was held on june.after the jury was selected,but before it was sworn and outside its presence,askins moved for a continuance.he advised the court that he had been unable to identify any witness who could establish an alibi defense on behalf of glover.the trial court denied the motion,stating that it could not subpoena witnesses from florida and that it had no assurance that any witnesses would attend the trial if it were rescheduled.in reality,south carolina law does allow criminal defendants to subpoena witnesses.
during the trial,the state presented five witnesses.the first witness,preston wilson,testified that he owned a trailer which he rented to a tenant.on january,he went to the trailer where he conversed with an acquaintance of the tenant,eric glover.on by askins,wilson admitted he had no personal knowledge about whether glover committed any crime.
the next,most important,witness was the victim,wayne cooper.cooper identified glover as the ringleader in his kidnapping and robbery.according to cooper,around on january,he was driving his mother white thunderbird.cooper stopped in a grocery store where he struck up a conversation with a stranger.while on the stand,cooper identified glover as the person with whom he engaged in conversation.
according to cooper testimony,glover and cooper then chatted about a variety of other matters,like the super bowl.glover told cooper that he was from florida,and that he had just arrived in south carolina.glover and cooper continued their conversation over drinks.while paying for the alcohol,cooper opened his wallet.cooper was carrying a little over.cooper testified that glover had an opportunity to observe the cash in cooper wallet because glover was standing beside cooper during the purchase.cooper and glover then decided to visit some female friends of glover.they drove to the women house in cooper thunderbird.glover introduced cooper to the women as his friend.after about twenty minutes at the house,cooper wanted to leave.cooper agreed to drop glover off at the grocery store where they met.
upon arriving,cooper testified that glover pulled a gun and told cooper that this was a stickup.glover forced cooper into the backseat and repeatedly struck him in the face with the gun.at that point,two other people joined glover.they drove off with cooper and glover still in the backseat.during the drive,glover grabbed cooper wallet.glover continued to beat cooper,thus preventing cooper from seeing where he was being taken.glover and his accomplices finally arrived at a dirt road.they pulled the car to the side of the road and checked to see if cooper was still alive.after assuring themselves that he was indeed alive,they stuffed cooper in the trunk and continued to drive.
about five minutes later,the car stopped outside of a trailer.glover and the two others moved cooper from the trunk to the trailer.as glover and his accomplices searched the thunderbird,cooper escaped through the back door.cooper ran to a nearby trailer home,and was eventually taken to a hospital.
askins vigorously cooper,questioning him on the time of the crime,the light outside when he observed glover,the ease with which glover could have killed cooper,what cooper was doing in the area,why cooper could not identify the other two offenders even though he saw them,and other inconsistencies in his testimony.
the state then called betty lou coker,the woman who lived in the other trailer home to which cooper fled after he escaped.coker testified that cooper arrived at her mobile home around.according to coker,cooper said that he had just been beaten up,that his assailants had tried to kill him,and that they had taken his money.during by askins,coker admitted that she had never seen glover.cooper father also testified for the state.he confirmed that cooper was driving the white thunderbird on january.askins cooper father on a variety of matters,including why cooper was in town that night and whether the father had any personal knowledge about the crime itself.
the state finally called officer debra collins.collins testified that she first saw cooper in the hospital the night he was assaulted.according to collins,cooper told her that this guy pulled a gun on him and made him get in the car against his will.cooper could not give the name of his assailant,but did provide a description of him.he said that his attacker was between and,weighed between and pounds,had a light complexion,and walked slightly bowlegged.cooper did not know the location of the trailer,except that it was down a dirt road.
collins then told the jury that soon after conversing with cooper,she received a call from another officer who had found a white thunderbird at a trailer off a dirt road.officer collins went to the location and determined that the car was registered to cooper mother.collins also determined that preston wilson owned the trailer.wilson told collins that nobody was supposed to be in the trailer because the man renting it from him had already left town.collins then entered the trailer,where she found a note written to dear grandmother and signed eric glover.askins collins on a variety of issues.
after the state rested,askins asked the judge for a directed verdict.although the court denied the motion,it granted askins motion to reduce the charge of grand larceny to use of a vehicle without the owner consent.askins also consulted with his client and determined,after a lengthy discussion,that glover did not want to testify.the defense did not call any witnesses.during his closing argument,askins pointed out the inconsistencies in cooper testimony.he also noted that cooper might be out to frame glover.askins argued that the only person who could say that glover actually did anything illegal was cooper himself.askins maintained that cooper might have been intoxicated or otherwise impaired that night.he also asked why cooper could not remember glover name the night of the crime.according to askins,little things did not add up,and if the little things were wrong,the big things could be wrong as well.twice before the verdict,the state offered glover a plea.after consulting with askins,glover decided to reject the plea offer.
the jury found glover guilty on all charges,although it found that glover committed the lesser included offense of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature as opposed to the more serious charge of assault and battery with intent to kill.after the verdict,askins renewed his motion for a directed verdict and appealed to the judge for leniency.askins noted that glover was only at the time of the crime,that he had no prior criminal history,that he maintained his innocence throughout the trial,and that he had even rejected a plea agreement because he was not going to plead guilty to anything he did not do.the judge sentenced glover to life in prison on the kidnapping charge,ten years consecutive on the armed robbery charge,and lesser concurrent sentences on the other charges.
after the south carolina supreme court affirmed his conviction,glover with a new attorney filed a motion for relief in state court.glover contended that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to contact his alibi witnesses.at the hearing,glover stated that he was in florida at the time of the crime.glover told the court that he had consistently maintained that he had been in florida on january,and that he asked his previous attorney,jenkinson,to contact his alibi witnesses.glover stated that willie palmer could testify that he was in florida on the night of january.glover also identified at least eight other witnesses who could place him in florida during the day of january.he testified that he gave all these names to his attorneys.
the only alibi witnesses who appeared in court,however,were sandra jordan and sylvester jordan.sandra jordan,glover aunt,testified that she saw glover in florida at approximately on january.jordan named three other people who allegedly saw glover during the day of the,none of whom were present at the hearing.glover also called sylvester jordan,glover grandfather.jordan was asked on direct examination if glover was in florida when the crime took place.jordan responded by stating,he was in florida when this took place as they say.i do know.and i do think he did what they say he did.when asked by glover lawyer for more information,jordan repeatedly replied,i do know nothing.
the state court granted glover motion for a new trial on ineffective assistance grounds.a divided south carolina supreme court reversed,holding that glover failed to establish a valid alibi defense at his hearing and thus failed to show prejudice under strickland washington.see glover south carolina.
glover then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.the magistrate judge granted summary judgment for the state on three of glover habeas claims,but permitted glover to amend his petition to add a fourth ground for relief regarding sentencing.state law at the time of sentencing set the maximum penalty for kidnapping at thirty years,not life.the state conceded error,and agreed with the limited grant of relief.on october,the district court granted the writ on glover second assistance of counsel.the district court noted but did not address the petition other three grounds for relief.south carolina appeals.
in strickland washington,at,the supreme court set forth a test for deciding ineffective assistance of counsel claims.first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.strickland,at.to prove deficiency,a defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance resulted in actual prejudice to the defendant.a showing of prejudice requires the defendant to prove that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.id.at.
strickland and its companion case united states cronic,at,gave more specific instructions on finding prejudice.the court stated that in certain limited contexts,prejudice is presumed.strickland,at.in cronic,the court identified three distinct situations in which a presumption of prejudice is appropriate.first,prejudice is presumed when the defendant is completely denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial.cronic,at.second,prejudice occurs if there has been a constructive denial of counsel.this happens when a lawyer entirely fails to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing,thus making the adversary process itself presumptively unreliable.id.
third,the court identified certain instances when although counsel is available to assist the accused during trial,the likelihood that any lawyer,even a fully competent one,could provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of the trial.id.citing powell alabama.a finding of prejudice under any of these three prongs is an extremely high showing for a criminal defendant to make.brown french,cir.
absent these narrow circumstances of presumed prejudice under cronic,defendants must show actual prejudice under strickland.see strickland,at.cronic,at and.actual prejudice requires the defendant to show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.
federal courts entertaining collateral attacks on state convictions have only limited powers of judicial review.see williams taylor,d bell jarvis,cir en banc.under d,this court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus when a state court resolved the merits of a claim unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d supp.iv.
in this case,glover argues that the south carolina supreme court decision was contrary to clearly established federal law because it applied the actual prejudice standard of strickland instead of the prejudice analysis of cronic and powell alabama,at.in the alternative,glover maintains that the south carolina supreme court decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law because absent counsel errors,there is a reasonable probability that the jury would not have returned a verdict of guilty.we address each argument in turn.
preliminarily,we may assume that glover has satisfied the first prong of the strickland analysis by showing that counsel performance was deficient.strickland,at.glover south carolina,at assuming that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.in this case,askins performance was not objectively reasonable.he failed to contact certain witnesses even though glover provided him with names of potential alibi witnesses.he did not realize that a south carolina statute allowed criminal defendants to compel the attendance of witnesses necessary for the defense.finally,askins did not even realize that the sentence for kidnapping in south carolina had been amended from a maximum sentence of life in prison to a maximum sentence of thirty years.given these errors,combined with the fact that the state does not contest that askins performance was deficient,we may turn to the issue of prejudice.
glover contends that the south carolina supreme court misapplied clearly established federal law by employing an actual prejudice test instead of a prejudice one.we disagree.
the facts do not come close to fitting within the first of cronic three criteria for prejudice.glover was not completely denied counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings.at all relevant times,he was represented by counsel.jenkinson represented glover at the preliminary hearing.askins represented glover from two days before trial through at least the motions and sentencing.a finding of prejudice for complete denial of counsel requires at a minimum that no lawyer be present at a critical stage of the proceedings.see roe,d citing cronic,at.here,askins presence at counsel table mandates a finding that glover was not actually denied the assistance of counsel.
second,glover was not constructively denied the right to counsel.askins did not entirely fail to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing in such a way as to make the adversary process itself unreliable.cronic,at.askins acted as glover advocate at every step.he contacted some potential witnesses.he asked for a continuance.he vigorously witnesses.he questioned motives.he highlighted testimonial inconsistencies.he advised his client on possible plea deals.he pointed out the flaws of the state case to the jury.he made a vigorous closing statement.he asked the judge for a directed verdict both after the state case and after the jury verdict.
furthermore,askins was able to convince the judge to reduce one charge against glover from grand larceny to possession of a vehicle without the owner consent.and he was able to convince the jury to find a verdict of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature instead of assault and battery with intent to kill.given these facts,we can not say that glover was constructively denied the right to counsel.this case is not one where the lawyer literally sleeps through the state case or otherwise might as well be absent from the proceedings.askins tested the state case at every juncture.he was an active advocate for glover.askins fulfilled his role as defense attorney by subjecting the state case against glover to the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.id.at.
it is true,as we have noted and as the state has conceded,that askins failed strickland test of objectively reasonable performance.but not every case of deficient performance under strickland represents a constructive denial of the right to counsel.in fact,it will be the rare claim of ineffective assistance that is tantamount to a constructive denial of counsel.strickland remains the norm for ineffective assistance claims,and the supreme court has made clear that it will not countenance a prejudice exception which will swallow the actual prejudice strickland rule.see,roe,at.perry leeke,cir en banc.
if we were to broaden the prejudice exception to strickland,we would only add an extra layer of litigiousness to ineffective assistance law.to designate certain categories of cases as cronic constructive denial cases and others as strickland deficient performance cases would promote a new threshold area of debate and complicate the handling of this most common area of contention on collateral review.for that reason perhaps,the supreme court refused to apply a rule of prejudice in cronic itself.ineffective assistance is not the same thing as an absence of assistance.because askins served as an advocate for glover and tested the state case through the adversarial system,glover can not show that he was constructively denied his right to counsel.
the third reason for finding prejudice is if the likelihood that any lawyer,even a fully competent one,could provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of the trial.cronic,at.since,the time the court articulated the tests for actual and prejudice in strickland and cronic,it has never once found prejudice under this third prong of cronic.
in cronic,the supreme court confronted the issue of a young lawyer who was allowed only days of pretrial preparation in a complex mail fraud case.see cronic,at.the court held that despite a limited time to investigate and prepare the case,the limited experience of counsel,the gravity of the charge,the complexity of possible defenses,and the limited accessibility of witnesses to counsel,a rule of prejudice was not appropriate.see id.at.
glover can point to only one case,powell alabama,in which the court has found a presumption of ineffectiveness based on the circumstances surrounding the defendant representation.see powell,at.powell,decided in,involved the infamous trial of several men who faced the death penalty for raping a white woman on a train in alabama.see powell,at.the defendants in powell were not asked whether they had,or were able to employ,counsel,or wished to have counsel appointed.id.at.instead,the court appointed all the members of the bar as counsel for purposes of arraignment.id.at.accord cronic,at.on the day of the trial six days later,a lawyer from another state appeared,but stated that he had not had an opportunity to prepare the case or to familiarize himself with local procedure.cronic,at.the court thus decided that the lawyer would represent the defendants with whatever help the local bar could provide.id.
the powell court recognized that the defendants in that case could not have received the assistance of counsel given the circumstances of the case.the defendants,young,ignorant,illiterate,surrounded by hostile sentiment,haled back and forth under guard of soldiers,charged with an atrocious crime regarded with especial horror in the community where they were to be tried,were thus put in peril of their lives within a few moments after counsel for the first time charged with any degree of responsibility began to represent them.powell,at.
the circumstances of this case are nowhere close to powell.glover attempts to rely on the limited contact that he had with his first attorney,jenkinson,the limited time that askins had to prepare glover case and to investigate the potential alibi witnesses,the fifty or sixty other criminal cases for which askins was responsible,and the severity of the crimes alleged in glover indictment.these facts simply do not strip the trial of all its integrity so that a rule of prejudice is justified without resort to an examination of the actual circumstances of the case.
indeed,this court has already held that in a case involving similar facts,a finding of prejudice was not appropriate.see griffin aiken,cir.in griffin,the defendant argued that several factors justified a presumption of ineffectiveness.these included minimal investigation by counsel,continuous presence of counsel in court on other matters in the period between indictment and trial,limited time to talk with the defendant in the time period between the preliminary hearing and the morning of trial,and the inability of counsel appointed on the day before trial to present constitutional grounds for the suppression of evidence since counsel had no knowledge of the facts of the defendant case.griffin,at.furthermore,the defendant public defender had between and other cases pending at the same time.id.at.nevertheless,this court rejected the claim of prejudice because a review of the circumstances surrounding the defendant representation reveals to us that in the same circumstances it was not unreasonable to expect that a competent lawyer could render effective assistance of counsel.id.at citing cronic,at.
and this court has also held that counsel appointed the day after indictment and the day of trial does not justify a finding of prejudice under cronic.see praylow martin,cir.in praylow,we stated that late appointment of counsel fails to justify a presumption of ineffective assistance of counsel.id.at.
we fail to see any materially distinguishable facts between this case and praylow and griffin.here,askins was not appointed until two days before trial,but he was able to spend some time on the case.in praylow,counsel was appointed on the same day as the trial.here,askins had between fifty and sixty other cases,but counsel in griffin had between and other cases.in griffin,counsel spent hardly any time on the case and was in court on other matters continuously in the period between indictment and trial.this case,like praylow and griffin,more closely resembles the facts of cronic than it does the facts in powell alabama.
indeed,the supreme court has long emphasized that late appointment of counsel does not ipso facto trigger a rule of prejudice.see cronic,at.in chambers maroney,d,the supreme court held that it would not presume prejudice where counsel appeared in the case only a few minutes before trial.the court stated that it was not disposed to fashion a per se rule requiring reversal of every conviction following tardy appointment of counsel.id.at.thus reviewing courts must generally regard trials,especially state trials on federal collateral review,through a particularized and individualized lens rather than through some presumption of prejudice.courts should not presume prejudice where the facts show otherwise,and strickland has the bedrock virtue of looking at prejudice to the defendant in each case.we do not think the south carolina supreme court violated any clearly established law by applying the strickland rule and thereby serving the goal of individualized adjudication.having found that application of a prejudice standard would be improper,we turn to the question of whether glover was actually prejudiced by askins defense.
glover must show that askins errors sufficiently undermined confidence in the jury verdict.see strickland,at.there must be a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.glover maintains that the testimony of sandra jordan and sylvester jordan at the state hearing creates a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.like the district court,we disagree.
to begin with,the state presented strong evidence as to glover guilt.wayne cooper,the victim,testified how he spent over an hour with glover,how they talked about a variety of things,how they went to meet friends of glover,and how glover robbed,beat,and kidnapped him.the state was not presenting a victim who had a fleeting and transient exposure to the defendant.cooper had more than ample opportunity to determine precisely how the defendant looked,and he recounted glover appearance to the police at the first opportunity.furthermore,the state established that cooper car was found in front of the wilson trailer,where glover had recently been seen.the state also presented the testimony of betty lou coker,who stated that a badly beaten cooper did indeed arrive at her trailer,which was located near the wilson trailer,on the night of january.
after the jury verdict against glover and the south carolina supreme court affirmance of it,the state gave glover another opportunity to present evidence of his innocence at the proceeding.at that hearing,glover was ably represented by counsel.without any time constraints to produce witnesses,glover could present only his aunt,sandra jordan,and his grandfather,sylvester jordan.neither could testify that glover was in florida at the time of the crime.sylvester jordan could state only that he was in florida when this took place as they say.i do know.and i do think he did what they say he did.when pressed for more information about glover whereabouts on the night of january,jordan could state only,i do know nothing.
sandra jordan could testify only that glover was in florida around on the morning of january,leaving ample time for glover to arrive in south carolina by that evening.as the south carolina supreme court stated,jordan testimony merely placed glover in florida between and on the date the crimes occurred.however,the crimes occurred in williamsburg county over eleven hours later at approximately glover,at.indeed,jordan estimated that it took her about hours to drive from florida to south carolina.and while both sandra jordan and glover purported to identify other people who could support the claim that glover was in florida on january,none appeared at the hearing.the testimony of glover who chose not to testify at trial,and of and jordan standing alone,does not create a reasonable probability of a different outcome.as the south carolina supreme court noted,t he failure to contact sylvester or sandra jordan did not result in prejudice to glover as neither witness hearing testimony established an alibi defense.glover,at.
moreover,nothing has cast doubt on cooper testimony.none of glover witnesses could testify,for instance,that they saw cooper with a different person on the.and they could not establish any reason why cooper would be fabricating any part of his unfortunate experience that night.in short,the evidence at the hearing failed to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.indeed,although the district court granted the writ on the prejudice rule of cronic,it found that glover could not show actual prejudice under strickland.we agree with the district court on this point.indeed,our fine dissenting brother makes no contention that this defendant is innocent of any of the crimes with which he was charged.the south carolina supreme court finding of no actual prejudice was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
it is a cardinal principle of criminal justice that federal courts must give state court convictions a significant measure of respect.in federal habeas cases,deference to findings is mandated by d.greene georgia,d per curiam see also williams,at.the south carolina supreme court applied the landmark strickland decision to glover ineffective assistance of counsel claim and reasonably found an absence of actual prejudice to the defendant.the state court ruling on this point was a sound one,and a federal court has no basis for upsetting it.for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
reversed and remanded.
eric glover,who was charged with kidnaping and other serious crimes,was denied effective assistance of counsel in the summer of,when the public defender system in williamsburg county,south carolina,broke down completely.nothing was done on glover case until the third in a succession of lawyers was appointed to represent him on june,two days before trial.glover was tried and sentenced to life in prison on june,before his new lawyer had an opportunity to contact several potential alibi witnesses who lived out of state.because no lawyer could have effectively represented glover in the circumstances,i would affirm the district court award of the writ of habeas corpus.i therefore dissent,respectfully.
glover,who could not afford a lawyer,got trapped in the fallout after the public defender in williamsburg county,south carolina,resigned in.glover was arrested in florida on january,pursuant to a south carolina warrant for his arrest on kidnaping and armed robbery charges.he immediately waived extradition,and on february,he was transferred to the jail in williamsburg county,south carolina,to await further proceedings.it was not until three and weeks later,at his preliminary hearing on march,that glover met with the public defender,gordon jenkinson,for the first and only time.jenkinson spent a very short time talking to glover about his case.glover was able to convey to jenkinson his claim of innocence that was based on an alibi defense glover said that he was in florida on january,when the crimes for which he was charged in south carolina were committed.glover told jenkinson about one alibi witness in particular,willie palmer,his,who glover says was with him in florida during the hours of the south carolina crimes.glover,who remained in jail,wrote jenkinson several letters listing other potential alibi witnesses for jenkinson to interview.jenkinson never responded to any of glover letters,and he never contacted glover after the preliminary hearing on march.apart from showing up at glover preliminary hearing,it appears that jenkinson did not do any work on his case.in particular,jenkinson did nothing to investigate glover alibi defense.
although glover was never given any notice of the event,jenkinson resigned as public defender sometime between glover hearing on march and late may of.around the first of june all of the public defender cases,numbering about,were assigned to two williamsburg county lawyers,jerome askins and william pridgen.the case load was to be divided,with each lawyer taking fifty or sixty cases.many of the cases would be called for trial during a term of court set to begin on june.in the meantime,the public defender resignation had led to a huge backlog of preliminary hearings.as a result,askins and pridgen spent the first two weeks of june,from morning until evening each day,representing indigent defendants in preliminary hearings.because the term of court began as soon as the preliminary hearings concluded,askins and pridgen had no time to investigate the cases of other defendants,such as glover,who had their preliminary hearings earlier.
as the defender cases were being divided,glover case was first assigned to pridgen.pridgen,however,discovered that he was already representing one of glover,so he had to decline the representation of glover.it was not until monday,june,the first day of the term,that glover case was finally assigned to askins.on that day glover was brought to the williamsburg county courthouse,presumably to answer his indictment for kidnaping,armed robbery,and related charges.at that time glover believed that jenkinson,the public defender,was still his lawyer and that jenkinson had subpoenaed the necessary witnesses.glover was therefore puzzled when a man he had never seen before askins came into the holding room for prisoners,called his name,and told him that he would be representing him.glover quickly realized that askins,who had just received his file that day,knew nothing about his case.yet glover trial was to start in two days,on june.
at their meeting on june glover said to askins,i got witnesses that can prove i did do this.glover identified ten persons in florida who were potential witnesses,several of whom glover said could provide an alibi.the first witness glover identified was willie palmer,who glover said was with him in florida when the kidnaping and other crimes occurred in south carolina.
sometime on monday,june,askins began trying to contact the potential witnesses in florida,but he was not able to reach anyone that day.askins lack of success is understandable because he was operating under several impediments.first,because the term of court was under way and askins was responsible for about sixty cases,he could not leave the courthouse.askins had to remain at the because,for the most part,he did not know from day to day or from hour to hour which case would be called or in what order.second,askins did not have telephone numbers for most of the witnesses,which,as he acknowledged,impeded his efforts to try to locate some of these people.third,there were no pay telephones or other convenient telephone facilities for lawyers in the williamsburg county courthouse.as a result,askins had to borrow a telephone wherever he could find one,sometimes in the clerk office and sometimes in other offices.when a potential witness was not available to take his call,askins was not able to provide a handy number where he could be reached for a callback.fourth,askins had no assistance in his efforts to contact witnesses or otherwise to investigate glover case.in particular,askins did not have access to an investigator or the funds to hire one.
on june,the day before trial,askins was only able to contact two of the ten persons on the florida list,glover father and stepmother.they,however,were never identified as alibi witnesses.finally,on the morning of trial askins was able to talk to one of the potential alibi witnesses from florida,roy brown,who could not provide any assistance.thus,as trial began askins had not contacted indeed,he was never able to contact seven of the florida alibi witnesses.most notably,he did not contact willie palmer,the main alibi witness identified by glover.
because of his inability in the time available to get in touch with potential alibi witnesses in florida,askins realized that glover would be at a terrible disadvantage if the trial went forward as scheduled.accordingly,askins moved for a continuance.he advised the court that he had not had the opportunity to talk with several florida residents who,according to his client glover,could testify that glover was in florida and was not in south carolina during the times of these alleged offenses.the court denied the motion,noting that it was not going to continue the case based on florida witnesses the court has no jurisdiction over.apparently,neither the court nor askins was aware that a defendant in a criminal case in south carolina could subpoena witnesses under the uniform act to secure the attendance of witnesses from without a state in criminal proceedings.see ann.stat.ann.
