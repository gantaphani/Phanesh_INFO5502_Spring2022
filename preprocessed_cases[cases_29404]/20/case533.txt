johney pham appeals from orders filed on april,october,and november,of the united states district court for the southern district of new york louis stanton,judge denying his habeas corpus petition filed pursuant to.pham claims that his trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance when he failed to convey a plea offer to pham.we have in the record below serial submissions from pham and serial orders from the district court,and this piecemeal litigation has not created a record from which we can determine that denial of pham petition was appropriate.
pham had to show that his attorney performance was unreasonable considering all of the circumstances and caused pham prejudice.see strickland washington,d.by incorrectly determining that pham had suffered no prejudice,the district court did not fully develop its reasoning on the issue of counsel deficient performance,the issue we now see as dispositive.a district court has a wide variety of tools available to it in developing the record during habeas proceedings,yet the district court failed to do so here.see fed.governing section proceedings,and.the district court,having presided over pham trial and sentencing,also had a close familiarity with the background of petitioner claims,yet it failed to draw on this knowledge to make explicit its reasons for finding pham incredible.we remand to allow the district court another opportunity to review the petition.
background 
in october,a trial jury convicted pham of conspiracy to engage in alien smuggling and hostage taking and conspiracy to receive ransom money,in violation of,conspiracy to commit kidnaping,in violation of c,substantive kidnaping,in violation of a,receipt of ransom money in connection with a kidnaping,in violation of,transportation of illegal aliens,in violation of a b,and concealment and harboring of illegal aliens,in violation of a c.the government alleged that pham and multiple participated in a kidnaping and ransom conspiracy beginning in early in which they smuggled undocumented chinese immigrants into the united states and then held them hostage while demanding additional payments from the immigrants families.nine of the defendants pleaded guilty,convictions after trial,and two others remained fugitives.on november,the district court sentenced pham to months imprisonment,three years supervised release and special assessment.on october,we affirmed the conviction and sentence by summary order.united states wei,cir table.
on november,pham filed in district court a pro se habeas corpus petition dated november.the petition raised a number of issues,including a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel based on the lawyer failure to pursue plea negotiations on pham behalf.in an affirmation filed with the petition,pham stated that he asked his attorney,martin siegel,to seek a plea bargain but siegel never communicated to me about whether he sought the plea negotiation,or what the government might have said on that request.pham also stated that he told his lawyer he was willing to plead guilty if he received a sentence of between five and eight years but counsel never gave him an account on whether he approached the government on his request,or whether the government said anything on that request.
the district court summarily denied the petition in a memorandum and order dated april.the district court held that,assuming pham allegations were true,pham nonetheless failed to demonstrate that counsel performance was outside the wide range of reasonable professional judgment or that pham suffered prejudice.on the second point,the district court held that pham claim that he would have taken a plea was frivolous in light of his continued insistence on his innocence.
pham appealed the order and sought a certificate of appealability coa in district court,protesting the court summary dismissal of his facially valid petition.in a supplement to his motion for a coa,pham informed the district court that he just learned through fulfillment of a freedom of information act request that the government offered in his case,including pham,a global plea bargain but that pham lawyer never told pham about the offer.by letter dated october,the government responded to pham supplement and attached an affirmation from pham trial counsel.in the affirmation,attorney siegel stated that he always related plea offers to pham and discussed them with his client,but pham always maintained his innocence.attached to siegel affirmation was a copy of june,correspondence in which siegel sent the government global plea offer to pham at the prison in otisville.in an order dated october,the district court denied pham supplement because the government submission establishes that his lawyer responsibly and timely brought the government plea offer to his attention.
apparently unaware of the district court latest order,pham sent a letter to the court dated october.in the letter,pham claimed that siegel affirmation was false and that pham never received any letters or plea agreements from siegel while pham was in otisville.pham also denied that siegel ever visited him at otisville.according to pham,the prison records would demonstrate that pham never received the letter that siegel claimed to have sent.pham also said that he could prove siegel never visited through prison records and evidence from the interpreter who would have been present during a visit.the district court responded to pham letter by denying him a coa or an evidentiary hearing in a memorandum endorsement dated november.in a letter to the district court dated october,unaware of the court his request for a hearing or coa and attached an unnotarized statement from a vietnamese interpreter who said that she did not accompany pham lawyer or anyone else to fci otisville,new york to translate there,or to take and discuss a plea offer to pham at fci otisville.the district court denied the request on november.
by order filed on march,we granted pham pending motion for a coa on the single issue of whether pham counsel failed to advise him of a plea offer made by the government.our review of the district court denial of a hearing on the habeas petition is for abuse of discretion.chang united states,cir.because it presents a mixed question of law and fact,the issue of whether defendant counsel rendered ineffective assistance warrants de novo review.id.
discussion 
pham on appeal renews his argument that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial lawyer failed to inform him of the government global plea offer.petitioner also contends that he was entitled to a hearing on this issue.the government responds that the district court properly denied the petition on the record before it because pham failed to demonstrate with objective evidence either that his lawyer performance was deficient or that pham suffered prejudice.
the parties agree on the relevant legal standards.defendant suffers a sixth amendment violation when he receives ineffective assistance of counsel.in order to prove ineffective assistance,pham must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.a defendant suffers a sixth amendment injury where his attorney fails to convey a plea offer.defense counsel have a constitutional duty to give their clients professional advice on the crucial decision of whether to accept a plea offer from the government.boria keane,cir.see also united states gordon,cir per curiam.even if there might be circumstances where defense counsel need not render advice as to acceptance of a plea bargain,there can be no doubt that counsel must always communicate to the defendant the terms of any plea bargain offered by the prosecution.cullen united states,cir.
rather than focusing on the first part of the strickland test,the district court held that pham failed to show prejudice as the second part of the test requires.generally,a defendant suffers prejudice if there is a reasonable probability that his reliance on counsel ineffective assistance affected the outcome of the proceedings.gordon,at.the district court in its november order held that pham presented no objective evidence other than his statements that he would have accepted the plea offer.it is true that our precedent requires some objective evidence other than defendant assertions to establish prejudice.gordon,at.however,a significant sentencing disparity in combination with defendant statement of his intention is sufficient to support a prejudice finding.id.at see also mask mcginnis,cir,cert.denied,d.both of these elements are present here.
the district court here never considered the undisputed sentencing disparity of at least months between the high end of the government plea offer and pham sentence after a trial conviction.instead,the court rejected pham statement that he would have accepted a plea offer of five to eight years.the district court held that pham assertion that he would have pled guilty is belied by the fact that in his motion he still claims he is innocent of the charges.in both its april and november orders,the district court quoted parts of pham habeas petition in support of its conclusion.these quotations in context show that while pham consistently denied participating in the actual kidnaping and abuse,he admitted participating in certain acts of the conspiracy such as renting a truck to transport the aliens in exchange for and procuring a handgun.what the district court also failed to acknowledge was pham assertion that he was unaware of vicarious liability theories that would allow him to be found guilty of a kidnaping or smuggling conspiracy even if he did not participate in certain acts as the government alleged.contrary to the district court assertion,pham petition did not present a blanket claim of innocence.
we have held that where the disparity in potential sentences is great,a finder of fact may infer that defendants who profess their innocence still will consider a plea.cullen,at,holding that district court could not overrule magistrate judge factual finding on this point without conducting its own hearing.the disparity here was a plea offer of to months and a sentence after trial of months,which is more than double.our precedent at a minimum indicates that the district court erred in summarily determining the absence of prejudice without even considering the sentence disparity.mask,at cullen,at gordon,at.this evidence,coupled with the district court mischaracterization of pham petition,compels reversal on the prejudice prong.we note that siegel affirmation does not rebut directly pham claims that he was unaware of the sentence disparity or his vulnerability to vicarious liability.additional evidence therefore was required before the district court could find that pham would not have pleaded guilty even if he knew of the government plea offer.
ii.deficient performance 
in its april and november orders,the district court seemed to acknowledge that,taking pham allegations as true,defendant satisfied the first part of the strickland standard because pham lawyer did not communicate the terms of a plea offer to defendant.there is some subtle confusion on this point due to the piecemeal development of the record and the evolution of pham assertions.at the time of the april order,pham only claimed that his lawyer failed to pursue plea negotiations,and the district court held that failing to pursue a plea was not deficient performance.by the time of the november order,pham knew that a plea offer had existed and claimed that his attorney never conveyed the offer to him.if there is any question whether failure to pursue plea negotiations is deficient performance,see brown doe,cir,there is no dispute that failure to convey a plea offer is unreasonable performance.cullen,at.the distinction between failing to pursue and failing to convey plea offers is immaterial here because the district court also found in its october order that the government established,through the affirmation of pham trial counsel,that the lawyer responsibly and timely brought the government plea offer to pham attention.because it found strickland prejudice prong dispositive,the district court findings regarding deficient performance are not fully developed.
the government on appeal contends that pham failed to produce credible,objective evidence in support of his claim.specifically,the government dismisses pham,unnotarized,and in many cases unsworn,statements,credits the affirmation from pham trial lawyer,criticizes pham for failing to produce prison records of incoming mail,and discounts the weight of the interpreter statement because several different interpreters participated in the case.the government arguments only raise issues of fact that should be the subject of additional inquiry in the district court.the government also attempts to foreclose pham arguments by stating that pham could not have benefitted under the global plea offer because one other went to trial.there is evidence,however,that the government did not enforce the global provision of its offer because four defendants named in the offer pleaded guilty.we also view as unfair the government criticism of pham for not producing prison mail records during proceedings below where the burden of doing so would be far less on the government than a pro se incarcerated litigant.
even though pham demands an evidentiary hearing,the government contends that no hearing is required because the paper record contains sufficient material to support the district court denial of the petition.it is within the district court discretion to determine whether a hearing is warranted.chang,at.among the wealth of materials available to the district court at its direction are the trial record,letters,documents,exhibits,affidavits and written interrogatories.fed.governing section proceedings.after expanding the record,the district court then decides if an evidentiary hearing also is required.id.our precedent disapproves of summary dismissal of petitions where factual issues exists,but it permits a middle road of deciding disputed facts on the basis of written submissions.chang,at.
the circumstances surrounding pham claim may make a hearing unnecessary.for example,the report regarding pham,which petitioner stated he read and understood,noted that four defendants with whom pham was indicted pleaded guilty in july.nonetheless,pham waited two years after his sentencing before raising the issue of the unconveyed plea offer.after his conviction,pham in an unsuccessful rule motion challenged his attorney performance only on the ground that his lawyer had advised him not to testify even though he must have known about counsel additional failure in at least pursuing a possible plea.these circumstances,none of which are in the district court decisions,may warrant a finding against pham.
the district court here merely credited the affirmation of pham trial counsel over pham affirmation and drew inferences adverse to pham that the record does not support,such as ignoring the sentencing disparity and pham discussion of vicarious liability.in addition,the fact that pham in his original petition was unaware of the global plea offer lends some weight to his claim of ignorance at the fault of counsel.indeed,the district court decisions suggest that it believed no hearing or even a middle road of record development was necessary.
the ultimate issue here is admittedly close,and it may well be that pham allegations lack merit.nonetheless,the district court abused its discretion in its selective consideration of the record and its failure even to draw upon existing parts of the record to support its conclusions.while the district court has wide discretion in developing the record it will use to determine a habeas petition,that discretion does not extend to summary dismissals of petitions presenting facially valid claims and interactions with trial counsel.see chang,at.the record as it presently exists does not support denial of pham petition.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is vacated and this matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
judge pooler today holds that the district court abused its discretion in its selective consideration of the record and its failure even to draw upon existing parts of the record to support its conclusions,and accordingly determines that the judgment must be vacated and the petition must be remanded.i agree.i further concur substantially with her analysis of pham claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.i write separately,however,to emphasize what i see as a fundamental procedural problem that led to much of the difficulty with this case the district court multiple decisions,responding to piecemeal submissions by the petitioner and the government,illustrate both the risk in summarily adjudicating of claims on an unamplified paper record,and the need to advise pro se petitioners,early in the proceedings,of the factual specificity required to avoid dismissal of their petitions.
recognizing the potentially unfair consequences of summary dismissal of a habeas petition,requires a prompt hearing on the movant claims,except where the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.the statute also provides that the court,after granting a hearing,may decide the motion without requiring the production of the prisoner at the hearing.see also machibroda united states,d observing that the prompt hearing requirement does not imply that a movant must always be allowed to appear in a district court for a full hearing if the record does not conclusively and expressly belie his claim,no matter how vague,conclusory,or palpably incredible his allegations may be.
the variety of approaches taken by expansion of the record by means of affidavits and other written submissions or through discovery,to hearings with live testimony by the movant and other the flexibility of as applied to prisoners habeas motions although this flexibility is consistent with the sound discretion of a district court to determine the kind of evidentiary hearing,if any,to require in a case,sanders united states,d,it also suggests that once the court has determined that the nature of the prisoner allegations precludes summary adjudication,it should ensure that a full record is developed on disputed issues and that a live testimonial hearing be included as part of that process when warranted 
a prisoner not trained in the law or familiar with legal process might reasonably suppose that a heartfelt avowal of his or her veracity,however generalized,is sufficient to secure an evidentiary hearing.the typical prisoner might not infer from or,or from the relevant federal rules or the local rules of the district courts,that more is required for obtaining a hearing than the short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief that is required for initial pleadings under.application for a writ of habeas corpus shall allege the facts concerning the applicant commitment or detention,the name of the person who has custody over him and by virtue of what claim or authority,if known.but see fed.governing cases advisory committee note n otice pleading is not sufficient,for the federal habeas petition is expected to state facts that point to a real possibility of constitutional error.quoting aubut state of maine,cir.
thus,a pro se movant in the context might conclude that he or she need only identify witnesses,affidavits,or other categories of evidence that could be made available at an evidentiary hearing,rather than submit particularized factual allegations in the motion or affidavit itself.in such circumstances,summary disposition of a prisoner claim might work harsh and unfair results.in this case,pham offered to present additional evidence in the form of prison visitation and mail records and the testimony of a vietnamese interpreter to support his claim that he had neither received the government offer nor discussed the offer with his defense counsel,but pham evidentiary submissions and proffers arrived piecemeal and haphazardly,and only after the district court had initially determined his claims to be incredible and frivolous.in consequence,pham was unable to make a full and coherent presentation of his factual claims before the court ruled on his motion.
some of this piecemeal motion practice could be remedied by giving pro se habeas movants time to reply to the government answer and defense counsel,and by informing pro se movants of the importance of factual specificity in any affidavits or other written materials included in their reply.in the roughly analogous context of summary judgment motions,see united states aiello,cir l ike a motion for summary judgment in civil cases,both the movant and government used to determine the existence of genuine issues of material fact,this circuit has adopted the salutary requirement that pro se litigants must understand the nature and consequences of their evidentiary burden as nonmovants under.before such motions can be granted,see mcpherson coombe,cir a bsent a clear indication that the pro se litigant understands the nature and consequences of rule he or she must be so informed by the movant in the notice of motion or,failing that,by the district court.this solicitude for pro se litigants in the rule context offers guidance for treating movants in the context.harris nelson,d w here specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the habeas petitioner may,if the facts are fully developed,be able to demonstrate that he is confined illegally and is therefore entitled to relief,it is the duty of the court to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate inquiry.obviously,in exercising this power,the court may utilize familiar procedures,as appropriate,whether these are found in the civil or criminal rules or elsewhere in the usages and principles of law.quoting.see generally fed.governing proceedings if no procedure is specifically prescribed by these rules,the district court may proceed in any lawful manner not inconsistent with these rules,or any applicable statute,and may apply the federal rules of criminal procedure or the federal rules of civil procedure,whichever it deems most appropriate,to motions filed under these rules.
while the disparities of legal knowledge and skill that exist between trained counsel and pro se litigants can never fully be remedied,courts should strive to level the playing field by rendering the process as fair and reasonable as is practical in the circumstances.whether a district court decides to dispose of a prisoner claims on the motion and trial record or after ordering an expansion of the record or a full testimonial hearing,the process leading up to that determination involves a careful,balanced evaluation by the court.in making this evaluation,the pleading context of the given case,including the difficulties faced by an untutored,pro se movant seeking to obtain a hearing in an unfamiliar medium and forum,should be carefully assessed.had the district court in the present case encouraged pham,either before the court invited a response to the petition from government or after that response was received,to come forward with relevant factual materials,affidavits,and potential after pham had obtained a copy of the global plea offer from the of this saga of piecemeal submissions and serial court rulings could have been avoided.neither the parties nor the court benefitted from the protracted and inefficient process that we see chronicled here and in other cases we have considered 
this appeal,in my view,turns on whether the district court erred in rejecting defendant pham contention that his trial counsel provided inadequate representation because he failed to pursue plea discussions on defendant behalf and to communicate a plea offer.the majority agrees that the district court abused its discretion in its selective consideration of the record and its failure even to draw upon existing parts of the record to support its conclusions,including its conclusion that pham counsel did not provide inadequate representation.judge sotomayor,indeed,regards the current record as inadequate to justify such a conclusion.i regard the record as more than adequate to resolve this matter and find no fault in the district court consideration of the evidence.i concur in the judgment,however,because it is unclear whether the district court finding that pham failed to establish that his counsel representation fell below the constitutionally required minimum was intended to survive the last of pham submissions below.in my view,an explicit finding on this point,without expansion of the record,would be sufficient to warrant affirmance of the judgment.
the detailed procedural history of this case is pivotal to the proper analysis of this appeal,as it is highly relevant to the district court decision not to hold a full evidentiary hearing before denying pham habeas petition.
a.the indictments and trial 
pham and six other defendants were charged on may,with conspiracy and a variety of other offenses in a thirteen count,sixth superceding indictment.pham and three of his were brought before the district judge on may,for a pretrial conference.shortly thereafter,the grand jury returned a seventh superceding indictment naming pham and eight other defendants.pham and four others were arraigned before the district judge on that date.
b.the suppression hearing 
prior to trial,pham moved to suppress evidence of custodial statements,contending that he was unable fully to a understand an english language miranda advice of rights form,and b understand or grasp the contents and nature of the advice of rights which was written in vietnamese.after hearing testimony from an fbi agent who had presented pham with the forms and from pham,the district court made detailed findings to the effect that pham carefully read and understood the vietnamese form and that the english form was read to and understood by him.he specifically found,b ased on my observation of defendant pham,that i do not accept his testimony to the extent that it is to the contrary.
c.the trial 
during the course of july and august,all of the defendants on the sixth and seventh superceding indictments save pham,nhat duc nguyen and two fugitives pleaded guilty.thus,by the time pham went to trial on september,pham knew that all but one of his other than the fugitives were not being tried with him.
d.the new trial motion and hearing 
pham was convicted in october and promptly moved for a new trial,contending that he had been deprived of his right to testify in his own defense by the error or misconduct of the vietnamese interpreter.in his moving affidavit,he contended that he had relied upon the interpreter to aid him in conversing with his trial counsel,siegel,and that he failed to take the stand in his own defense because the interpreter,in relaying remarks the interpreter attributed to siegel,said your attorney does not want you to come out and testify.if you do come out and testify,it would hurt you,it would not be beneficial to you.according to pham,siegel told him in a subsequent conversation that siegel never had said any such thing,a statement corroborated by an affidavit from siegel.
the district judge held an evidentiary hearing on pham claim.the interpreter testified that he never had interpreted any conversation concerning whether pham should testify at trial pham,in contrast,testified that the interpreter in question had translated a conversation between pham and siegel concerning whether pham should take the stand and that the interpreter had told pham that siegel did not want pham to testify because it will be bad for your case.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court found that the interpreter never translated any conversations between pham and siegel,nor said anything at all to pham,about whether pham should testify,and siegel had advised pham that he had a right to testify in his own behalf and gave no recommendation or instruction as to whether he should testify or not.it concluded that so much of the motion which rests on pham affidavit of november,should be denied on the facts and the law 
e.the sentencing 
pham came on for sentencing on november,more than two years after his conviction.the minutes reflect that he had the presentence report and,indeed,that it had been translated into vietnamese and a copy of that version provided to him.pham stated that he had been over the psr with siegel.the psr disclosed that most of his had pleaded guilty and,in some cases,the sentences imposed.yet pham suggested no dissatisfaction with siegel representation,let alone that siegel had failed to pursue a plea bargain on his behalf.
f.the section motion 
pham filed this motion on november.insofar as it is relevant here,the petition and supporting papers asserted that pham f rom the very beginning of the proceedings instructed siegel to seek a plea bargain with the government,but that siegel never told him whether he had done so or what,if any,response the government made.by order dated april,the district court rejected this claim on the alternative grounds that pham had not demonstrated that his counsel performance was outside the wide range of reasonable professional judgment or that he was prejudiced by any failure to seek a plea agreement.it denied the motion and a certificate of appealability.
pham then filed a notice of appeal and a motion for a certificate of appealability.the latter,an unsworn document,reiterated pham contention that his lawyer had not pursued a plea bargain with the government.it asserted also,for the first time,that pham had heard from a reliable source that the government had offered him the opportunity to plead guilty and receive a five year sentence,but counsel never had communicated that offer to him.some time later,pham filed a supplement to the motion for a certificate of appealability to which he attached a copy of a letter,dated june,from the assistant united states attorney to the defendants counsel.the letter offered pham and his an opportunity to plead guilty,conditioned on acceptance by all,under an arrangement pursuant to which pham guideline range would have been to months of imprisonment.
the government responded by submitting,inter alia,a declaration of siegel in which he stated that he and pham had numerous meetings and conversations to discuss trial strategy as well as possible plea offers,that he had advised pham of all plea offers made by the government,that he had sent pham a copy of the written global plea offer that pham had attached to his supplement to his motion for a certificate of appealability,and that pham repeatedly refused to consider pleading guilty.the declaration contained a copy of siegel letter transmitting the government written plea offer to pham.on october,the district court found that pham lawyer responsibly and timely brought the government plea offer to his attention and again denied a certificate of appealability.
meanwhile,pham had prepared a response to the government submission,which arrived following the entry of the october order.in another unsworn letter,he denied that he had received siegel letter transmitting the global plea offer.he asserted that fci otisville required inmates to sign for correspondence from attorneys and thus should have records that would corroborate his denial of receipt.he contended that siegel never had visited him at otisville,as allegedly would have been apparent from a review of the visitors log.finally,he maintained that,were a hearing held,he would call the vietnamese interpreter,who would testify that she never visited me with siegel at fci otisville.he did not,however,deny that he had discussed the possibility of a guilty plea with siegel at other locations.
in a memorandum endorsement dated november,the district court recited the history of pham plea bargaining contention and acknowledged receipt of his letter denying receipt of the global plea offer.rather than again addressing the conflict between the accounts of pham and siegel,however,the district judge assumed arguendo that pham assertions were true,but denied the renewed application on the ground that pham had failed to establish prejudice in that he had not demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would have accepted
