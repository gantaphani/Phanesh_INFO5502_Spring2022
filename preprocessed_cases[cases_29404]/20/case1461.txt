the issue in this case is whether the rule of criminal procedure recently articulated by the supreme court in halbert michigan,d,applies retroactively to cases on collateral habeas corpus review.in halbert,the court held that the equal protection and due process clauses require the appointment of counsel for indigent defendants seeking review of convictions in the michigan court of appeals,even when such appeals are discretionary rather than as of right.id.at.because petitioner patrick simmons state conviction was final when the court decided halbert,halbert applicability to the instant action is governed by teague lane,d.under teague,a new rule of criminal procedure does not apply retroactively to cases proceeding on collateral habeas review unless the rule either decriminalizes a class of conduct or is a watershed rule that implicates the fundamental fairness and accuracy of a criminal proceeding.saffle parks,d citing teague,at.a majority of the original panel in this case concluded that halbert simply involved the application of an existing rule and thus,consistent with teague,halbert has retroactive effect.simmons kapture,cir.we granted rehearing en banc and vacated the prior panel decision.
supreme court precedent compels the conclusion that teague bars the retroactive application of halbert on collateral review.in short,halbert announced a new rule,and that new rule neither decriminalizes a class of conduct nor is a watershed rule.the legal analysis in support of these fully addresses the arguments presented in the en banc thoroughly set forth in the panel dissenting opinion of district judge reeves,sitting by designation,and no purpose would be served by recapitulating it.we incorporate that analysis here.see id.at reeves,dissenting.because halbert is inapplicable to this case under teague,we need not address the warden contention that,in any event,the language of d forbids reliance on a new rule that is sought to be applied retroactively.
the panel did not reach petitioner additional claims that his plea was not knowing and voluntary,and that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance.we return those claims to the panel for review and decision.
the majority adopted opinion finds that the rule announced in halbert michigan,d,does not apply retroactively to simmons case because it is a new rule under the teague analysis.teague lane,d.as i stated in the original majority opinion in this case,retroactivity analysis is an inexact science.apparently the en banc majority thinks that any inexactitude is an opportunity for reversal and has created with its adopted opinion an arbitrary and unfair result that denies a significant group of people the opportunity to vindicate their constitutional rights.the new opinion misstates halbert rule and finds that it turns on the discretionary nature of appeals from convictions.this proposition goes against the plain words of the supreme court,as well as the rationale behind the halbert decision.halbert rule is dictated by,and inextricably linked to,the longstanding rule that a state must provide counsel for indigent defendants in a appeal from a criminal conviction.this rule was established long ago in douglas california,d.the majority reliance on the precedent set by ross moffit is misplaced ross,too,reiterated that a state can not adopt procedures that leave an indigent defendant entirely cut off from any appeal at all by virtue of his indigency,d citing lane brown,d.the rule is thus not new.moreover,even if considered new,it is clearly a watershed rule of criminal procedure because it addresses the fundamental right to counsel,which is necessary to provide the accuracy and fundamental fairness that must underlie a conviction.teague,at.see also gideon wainwright,d.
the majority creates an arbitrary window in time during which acknowledged constitutional rights continue to be denied.a bit of background illuminates the problem.in,michigan amended its constitution to restrict appeals from pleas of guilty or nolo contendere in an effort to reduce the workload of the michigan court of appeals.the purpose of the amendment,however,was never to deny poor defendants the right to counsel.indeed,the michigan state bar task force,which was charged with recommending solutions to the appellate court backlog,stated in its recommendations that the rights to counsel and to a transcript of the proceedings would remain in both guilty plea and nolo contendere appeals.robert webster,introduction to the report of the task force on appellate courts,cited in note,limiting michigan guilty and nolo contendere plea appeals,mercy.recognizing that some trial judges and legislators were reading the amendment as abolishing the right to appointed counsel for defendants who sought to appeal their guilty or nolo contendere pleas,the state appellate defender office director,james neuhard,wrote a letter to chief justice cavanagh on the michigan supreme court stating that the language of the amendment very obviously does not change the language regarding the right to counsel on appeal.letter from the state appellate defender office to chief justice michael cavanagh,at,on file with university of detroit mercy law review,cited in mercy at.the michigan supreme court later reiterated this understanding.people bulger,proposal b did not alter the provision of art,that grants defendants as provided by law,when the trial court so orders,such reasonable assistance as may be necessary to perfect and prosecute an appeal.on december,the michigan supreme court adopted an interim rule,mcr f c,which provided that in a case involving a conviction following a plea of guilty or nolo contendere the court should liberally grant the request for appointed counsel if it is filed within days after sentencing.id.at.the court later extended the rule indefinitely,citing the need to protect an indigent defendant ability to have the assistance of counsel in pursuing appellate remedies,mcr g c.
the unfortunate window opened with the help of a law providing that those who plead guilty generally shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant conviction or sentence.comp.laws ann.a,a law this court found unconstitutional in tesmer granholm,cir en banc,rev on standing,kowalski tesmer,d.the window finally closed with halbert in,which guaranteed the right to counsel on appeals in convictions.for the limited group of people who pleaded while the window was open,however,the majority adopted opinion arbitrarily and unfairly ensures that the unconstitutional law lives on.
in,the supreme court established the rule that a state must provide counsel for indigent defendants in a appeal from a criminal conviction.see douglas california,d.halbert is dictated by,and inextricably linked to,this rule and is thus not new.the supreme court in teague lane explained what amounts to a new rule of criminal procedure as follows a case announces a new rule when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the states or the federal government.to put it differently,a case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant conviction became final.at.internal citations omitted.justice harlan himself noted long before teague that a decision does not announce a new rule where it simply applie s a constitutional principle to govern a case which is closely analogous to those which have been previously considered in the prior case law.mackey united states,d harlan,concurring in part and dissenting in part see also penry lynaugh,d citing with approval justice harlan approach to retroactivity.
under this approach,halbert did not announce a new rule but merely applied the rule from douglas that in a appeal from a criminal conviction,a state must provide appointed counsel for indigent defendants.this conclusion is apparent not only in the language of halbert itself,but also in the rationale behind ross moffit,in the function of the appellate courts in michigan,and in our own court prior treatment of this topic.
i turn first to the language of halbert and the adopted majority contention that the discretionary nature o
