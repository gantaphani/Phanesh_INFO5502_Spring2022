petitioner adremy dennis was convicted by an ohio jury of the aggravated murder of kurt kyle and sentenced to death.after exhausting his direct appeals and state post conviction remedies,dennis sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal court pursuant to.the district court dismissed the petition.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court dismissal of dennis habeas petition.
background 
the ohio supreme court made the following factual findings on direct review 
during the early morning hours of june,adremy dennis,and leroy lavar anderson stopped dean pizer in the highland square area of akron and demanded money.pizer escaped,even though a shotgun blast was fired at him as he fled.shortly thereafter,dennis shot and killed kurt kyle during a robbery in front of kyle home at bloomfield road.dennis later admitted he shot kyle during a robbery,and he was subsequently convicted of aggravated murder,attempted aggravated murder and aggravated robbery,and sentenced to death.
late on saturday,june,and in the early morning hours of sunday,june,dennis and anderson decided to go to a bar and meet some chicks.anderson spoke of robbing somebody,and the pair armed themselves with weapons dennis with a shotgun and anderson with a caliber handgun.as the pair proceeded to the bar,the shotgun,according to dennis,accidently went off.dennis then reloaded the weapon.before arriving at the bar,the two smoked marijuana.
after some drinks,anderson and dennis left the bar and encountered dean pizer in an alley near west market street and south highland avenue.the taller one of the two,whom pizer identified as dennis,was wearing a long black leather coat and told pizer,give me your money.do try and run,do try and run.you are going to die tonight,you are going to die.pizer testified that he went backwards,slid and rolled down a hill,then ran away unharmed.he heard a gunshot just left of me.there was a trash can or something got hit.
that same night,kurt kyle had raced at barberton speedway and afterwards hosted several friends and family members at his home for a cookout and socializing.later,as one of his guests,martin eberhart,was leaving,kyle walked with him to his car where the two continued conversing for a short time.while eberhart was seated in his car talking with kyle,they heard a loud noise,which kyle told eberhart was a gunshot.about three minutes later,two black males approached them in the driveway,out of the view of kyle other guests.the man eberhart identified as anderson was wearing a green and orange miami hurricanes starter jacket,and demanded money while pointing a gun a eberhart neck.eberhart slowly reached under the car seat for his wallet and handed anderson.
at that time,dennis,whom eberhart described as wearing a long,dark coat,asked kyle for money.however,kyle searched through his pockets and told dennis that he had no money with him.dennis then pulled out a shotgun and shot kyle in the head at range.kyle died instantly of hypovolemic shock loss of blood due to a gunshot wound that severed both carotid arteries.according to eberhart,the two assailants ran away together sprinting very fast.
anita foraker,who lived in the neighborhood,was out walking her dog at around that morning and heard a loud pop type of sound.about a minute later,she observed two young black males headed in the opposite direction running by her on the other side of bloomfield road.she heard one say to the other,did you get it 
a few days after the murder,akron police received an anonymous phone call stating that someone at grand avenue knew about the homicide that past weekend.detective donald gaines and another detective went to the address,where they met shirley morgan and told her that a possible suspect was staying at her house.morgan invited the detectives in and gave them permission to look around the house and to speak to her son,lavar anderson.when the detectives went down to the basement,they noticed a miami hurricanes jacket and a long,dark overcoat hanging up in the far corner on a bedrail.at that time,they took anderson into custody,and he provided detectives information about the location of the murder weapon.
after procuring a search warrant,police seized several items from morgan basement,including the two coats,a caliber pearl handle handgun,a gauge shotgun,and seven shotgun shells.
upon completing the search of morgan home,gaines received a call from two officers at burton avenue,which was in the same general neighborhood.the police surrounded the house on burton and thereafter apprehended adremy dennis.
at the police station,dennis was advised of his miranda rights,which he waived.dennis told several versions as to his whereabouts on june,to detectives gaines,lacy,and offret.after dennis second statement,gaines produced a shotgun,which dennis immediately claimed was his own.in his fourth statement to detectives,dennis admitted that he and anderson had planned some robberies that night and admitted holding up pizer,eberhart and kyle.however,while dennis admitted aiming the shotgun at kyle,he also claimed the gun went off accidentally.dennis agreed to allow detectives to tape his statement.
in his taped statement,dennis said that he and anderson had smoked marijuana and then drank at a bar before the robberies and murder.while dennis admitted he fired the shotgun three times that night,he asserted that each shot was accidental and that he could barely focus when they came upon kyle and eberhart.after shooting kyle,dennis claimed he almost fell down and that anderson had to help him flee the scene.
yellow shotgun shell casings were found a few days after the murder.one was found in the area where pizer was accosted,the other was discovered in front of kyle home.nancy bulger,a forensic scientist with the bureau of criminal identification and investigation bci,determined that the two casings were fired from the shotgun that dennis identified as his own.

procedural history 
dennis was charged with one count of aggravated murder,one count of attempted murder,three counts of aggravated robbery,and one count of possession of dangerous ordnance.all of the counts carried a firearms specification,and the dangerous ordnance charge also carried a specification.the aggravated murder count also carried two death specifications murder during an aggravated robbery,where dennis was the principal offender ohio a and murder committed as a course of conduct involving the killing or attempt to kill two or more persons ohio a.id.at.
dennis trial began on december.the jury convicted him of all charges.after a mitigation hearing,the jury recommended the death penalty.on december,the court agreed and sentenced dennis to death.id.
dennis appealed.on may,the ohio court of appeals rejected his claims.see state dennis,wl ohio.may.dennis appealed to the ohio supreme court.on september,that court affirmed dennis conviction and sentence.see state dennis,ohio.the united states supreme court denied certiorari.see dennis ohio,d.
dennis also exhausted his remedies,to no avail.see state dennis,wl ohio affirming denial of relief state dennis,ohio march.

ii.standard of review 
we review a district court legal conclusions in habeas actions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.miller francis,cir.if,however,the district court bases its decision on the state trial court transcript,and makes no findings of fact,we review the district court fact findings de novo as well.id.
dennis petition was filed on june,after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,stat.aedpa.its provisions therefore apply.id.
congress enacted aedpa to reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences,and to further the principles of comity,finality,and federalism.woodford garceau,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted.one of the mechanisms for accomplishing these goals was an amended version of d,which places new constraint s on the power of a federal habeas court to grant a state prisoner application for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to claims adjudicated on the merits in state court.williams taylor,d 
the act provides in relevant part as follows 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.
resulted in a decision that was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
in williams taylor,d,the supreme court explained the meaning of contrary to and unreasonable application.a state court legal decision is contrary to clearly established federal law under d if the state court arrived at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decided a case differently than the supreme court decisions on materially indistinguishable facts.id.at.an unreasonable application occurs when the state court correctly identified the correct legal principle from supreme court precedent but unreasonably applied that principle to the facts of the case before it.id.
c learly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.id.at.the state court decision need not cite supreme court precedent,or even reflect awareness of supreme court cases,so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the decision contradicts them.early packer,d per curiam 
similarly,a federal habeas court may not grant habeas relief under d merely because it disagrees with a state trial court factual determination.rather,the state court factual determination must be objectively unreasonable in light of the evidence presented during the state proceedings.furthermore,a state court factual determinations are presumed correct,and can only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.e.
iv.analysis 
failure to exclude juror harris 
dennis contends that the trial court violated his constitutional right to a fair trial in violation of the sixth and fourteenth amendments because the trial court failed to excuse juror terri harris for cause.during voir dire,potential jurors were asked whether any had been the victim of a crime of violence.harris answered no.after the jury began penalty phase deliberations,a police detective contacted the prosecutor,asking that harris be allowed to take a break from deliberations in order to sign a criminal complaint along with her two sisters.although defense counsel and the prosecutor knew that harris was going to be a witness in a case where the defendant was charged with the crime of gross sexual imposition,they did not know until the penalty phase that she was a victim.upon learning that harris was actually a victim,the prosecutor promptly informed defense counsel and the court.
the trial court called harris into chambers and questioned her.harris explained that,when asked if she had ever been a victim of a violent crime,she in turn asked the judge bailiff,alys,about the definition of violent crime,and decided that what happened to me by your definition of violent would not be violent.she further explained that her answer was based strictly on the definition of murder.the trial court indicated that gross sexual imposition is considered a violent crime,but that it understood how harris had interpreted it,and that it might not have been clear as it probably should have.
the trial court also asked harris if she thought the fact that she was a victim would interfere with her ability to evaluate this case.harris responded 
absolutely not.i feel that i am a professional and i feel that what happened to me has nothing to do with what happened to the kyle family or adremy dennis.
i feel that i can handle it professionally and there is parts to everyone personality and i feel very strongly that i can separate myself from that.
you asked me to do a job and i doing a job.
when asked by the trial court whether she could separate out your experience as a victim from this particular case and not let anything carry over that would cause you to identify more with victims,harris responded that the two cases were not comparable.finally,the court asked harris whether she foresaw any possible problem.she responded that she did not,and stated that she was able to separate her emotions from her duty,just as the trial court had instructed.the trial judge then asked counsel if they had anything.defense counsel responded t hat fine.the prosecutor indicated that he had no questions.at that point the trial judge directed harris to return to the jury room.
after harris returned to the jury room,the trial court asked counsel if they wanted to put anything on the record.defense counsel replied no.the prosecutor informed the trial court that,although they knew prior to trial that harris was a witness,they had just learned that harris was a victim.
the trial court then made the following findings of fact 
i think that she did give it some thought.she was not intentionally trying to conceal anything.she just did not recognize what we recognize,that a sexual abuse victim is to us a violent crime and i gather that is not terribly clear in the way we ask it.
and so she did make that inquiry of alys and alys response was,well,when she says are they talking about murder,violent,she said i would imagine so,that she just dismissed it as not being something that would be covered under violent crime.
i was also satisfied with her answer as to her ability to handle it.
upon this ruling,defense counsel did not ask that harris be removed.however,after the jury returned and recommended to the court that dennis be sentenced to death,dennis moved for a mistrial,claiming that harris was biased.the trial court denied the motion,ruling that harris was voir dired by the court,the prosecutor,and by defense counsel,and thereafter passed to continue on with her service.
the ohio supreme court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion by concluding that harris was impartial and could remain on the jury.
during the jury deliberations,the trial court learned that harris had been a victim of sexual abuse as a child,when a detective asked the court to momentarily excuse harris from deliberations in order to sign a criminal complaint.the court brought harris into chambers before the parties and conducted a examination of her at that time.harris explained that she had decided not to mention the sexual abuse during the original examination because she did not feel it fit the definition of violent crime.she reached this conclusion after asking the trial judge bailiff during jury selection for a definition of violent crime.harris indicated that at that time,she concluded that her experience was not violent when compared to murder,and therefore,did not bring it to the court attention.
the court questioned harris extensively,and she was adamant that her status as a victim of sexual abuse had nothing to do with what happened to the kyle family or dennis,and that she could separate the two experiences and be impartial.the court asked defense counsel if they had anything they wished to put on the record,and defense counsel indicated they did not.after harris returned to the jury room,counsel for both sides informed the court that just prior to trial they became aware of the fact that harris had been a witness to sexual abuse.counsel for both parties agreed that it probably was necessary for them to act upon it.however,at the end of the trial,defense counsel filed a motion for mistrial upon learning that harris was a victim of sexual abuse,and not just a witness.
a trial court enjoys broad discretion in determining a juror ability to be impartial.state williams,ohio,obr.the trial court decision to allow harris to remain on the jury did not amount to an abuse of discretion,especially in light of the court examination of harris conducted in chambers during deliberations.see state maurer,ohio,obr.accordingly,proposition of law is overruled.
state dennis,at.
on habeas review,the district court held that the ohio supreme court opinion was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,namely mcdonough power,greenwood,d.see dennis mitchell,d.
the sixth amendment provides that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,by an impartial jury.const.amend.vi.the right to an impartial jury is applicable to the states via the fourteenth amendment.see turner louisiana,d irvin dowd,d.see also morgan illinois,d discussing irvin and turner.furthermore,due process alone has long demanded that,if a jury is to be provided the defendant,regardless of whether the sixth amendment requires it,the jury must stand impartial and indifferent to the extent commanded by the sixth amendment.morgan,at.the voir dire is designed to protect this right by exposing possible biases,both known and unknown,on the part of potential jurors.mcdonough,at.therefore,t he necessity of truthful answers by prospective jurors if this process is to serve its purpose is obvious.id.
when a juror impartiality is at issue,the relevant question is did a juror swear that he could set aside any opinion he might hold and decide the case on the evidence,and should the juror protestation of impartiality have been believed.patton yount,d.a trial court determination of a juror credibility is entitled to special deference.id.at.wainwright witt,d noting that in determining whether a juror is biased,deference must be paid to the trial judge who sees and hears the juror.as previously noted,a trial court finding that a juror was impartial is entitled to a presumption of correctness,rebuttable only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence.see e patton,at.noting that juror impartiality is a question of historical fact.further,the question for this court is simply whether the state trial court decision was fairly supported by the record,not whether it was right or wrong in its determination of impartiality.witt,at.
the mcdonough test governs cases where it is alleged that a juror intentionally concealed information.zerka green,cir in mcdonough,the supreme court held that,in order to obtain a new trial based on a juror during voir dire,the defendant must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire,and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.id.at.the mcdonough court explained that t he motives for concealing information may vary,but only those reasons that affect a juror impartiality can truly be said to affect the fairness of a trial.id.
in mcdonough,a juror failed to reveal during voir dire in a products liability case that his son had broken his leg as a result of an exploding tire when asked whether anyone in his immediate family had ever sustained a severe injury.mcdonough,at.in holding that the respondents were not entitled to a new trial,the supreme court found that the juror apparently believed that his son broken leg sustained as a result of an exploding tire was not such an injury.id.at.the court noted that jurors may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms which are relatively easily understood by lawyers and judges.id.
we agree with the district court that the ohio supreme court ruling is not contrary to the rule of mcdonough.as the district court noted,harris explained that under the court definition,she believed that she had not been a victim of a violent crime.further,as the district court observed,upon hearing her explanation and observing her demeanor,the trial judge accepted harris explanation,and acknowledged that the court definition of violent crime was not entirely clear.thus,as in mcdonough,juror harris misunderstanding of a legal term did not denote dishonesty.
in short,the ohio supreme court ruling that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in retaining juror harris is not contrary to the foregoing clearly established federal law.see d.consistent with supreme court precedent,the trial judge examined the witness to determine if she was impartial.the trial judge found as a matter of fact that harris had not been intentionally deceitful during the original voir dire,that she could set aside her personal feelings,and that she was impartial.thus,consistent with united states supreme court precedent,the trial judge established harris impartiality,during his voir dire.harris repeatedly indicated that she could be a fair and impartial juror,and the trial judge made a credibility determination that her misunderstanding of the term violence was honest.the trial court fact findings are presumed correct,see e patton.the ohio supreme court decision is also not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented to the state trial court.
finally,it must be remembered that defense counsel was given the opportunity to question harris directly during the voir dire and to place any objections on the record,but failed to do so.apparently,defense counsel did not doubt her veracity at the time either.the district court properly rejected this claim.
improper removal of jurors spence and williams 
dennis contends that the trial court improperly removed two jurors,kathleen spence and ruby williams,for cause based on their views of the death penalty.the ohio supreme court held as follows 
in state frazier,ohio,we reaffirmed the standard in wainwright witt,d,
the proper standard for determining when a prospective juror may be excluded for cause based on his views on capital punishment is whether the juror views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and oath.
prospective juror spencer stated unequivocally during voir dire that she did not feel she could recommend the death sentence.she further stated that she would have a lot of trouble imposing death,even if the court instructed the jury that it was worthy of consideration.spencer also indicated that she did not feel she could put her beliefs aside and follow the law.when asked if she could recommend the death penalty,spencer replied,i do feel i could really do that.
prospective juror williams also indicated that based on religious and moral grounds,she could not follow the law and recommend the death penalty.after further questioning,williams insisted that i t will be a big problem for me to sign and say that,yes,i believe in the death penalty or i believe this person should be given the death penalty.
we have previously stated that where the trial court is left with a definite impression that a prospective juror would be unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law,deference must be given to the trial judge who sees and hears the prospective juror.state beuke,ohio.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excusing the two prospective jurors for cause.both expressed views that would prevent or substantially impair them from fulfilling their duties as jurors.state tyler,ohio.accordingly,we overrule proposition of law.
state dennis,at.
the district court held that the ohio supreme court reasonably applied clearly established federal law.dennis mitchell,d at.the district court noted that the ohio supreme court followed the correct controlling united states supreme court precedent of witt,d,which sets the standard for excusing jurors for cause.witt held that the proper standard for determining when a prospective juror may be excluded for cause because of his or her views on capital punishment is whether the juror views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.witt,at.
based on this standard,the district court concluded that 
here,both spencer and williams stated that they could not follow the law
