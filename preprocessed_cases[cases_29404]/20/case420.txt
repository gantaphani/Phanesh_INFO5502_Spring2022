on february,bell filed a motion to vacate his conviction pursuant to.proc.law.there,for the first time,bell argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for having failed to consult a medical expert regarding the effects of trauma,blood loss and painkillers on moriah memory in support of his motion,bell submitted the affidavit of elkhonon goldberg,a neuropsychologist affiliated with new york university and columbia university,who reviewed the police reports from the case,moriah grand jury and trial testimony,and the trial testimony and affidavit of brewer.goldberg opined that moriah testimony contains unequivocal evidence that he suffered from retrograde amnesia for the events predating the loss of consciousness the retrograde amnesia was exacerbated by such anxiolytic and amnestic medications as brewer attested were likely administered to moriah in the emergency room false memories can be persistent and dominant,overriding true memories and moriah was unlikely to have regained full consciousness when he first named bell.accordingly,goldberg concluded that moriah identification of bell was unreliable.
on october,the state court denied bell motion without a hearing.it applied.proc.law c to bell ineffective assistance claim,citing as unjustifiable bell failure to raise the issue on direct appeal the court added but if the merits were reached,the result would be the same.the state court observed that goldberg affidavit was fraught with hedge words,and questioned whether,at the time of bell trial in,goldberg expert testimony regarding a single witness identification issue would have been admissible in a new york state court.
