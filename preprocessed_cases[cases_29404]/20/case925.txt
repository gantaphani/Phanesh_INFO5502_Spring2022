kevin green,a virginia capital inmate,appeals the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court granted green a certificate of appealability coa on two issues whether he is mentally retarded so that his sentence is unconstitutional under the eighth amendment as interpreted in atkins virginia,d,and whether his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to appeal his convictions after the first of his two trials.in denying relief,the district court concluded that green failed to prove he is mentally retarded under virginia law and that his ineffective assistance of counsel claim is untimely under d.for the following reasons,we affirm.
we begin with a summary of the facts pertaining to the underlying crimes,as articulated by the supreme court of virginia 
the victim,patricia vaughan,and her husband,lawrence vaughan,owned and operated a small grocery store in brunswick county.as part of their grocery store operation,the vaughans regularly cashed checks for employees of several nearby businesses,including a lumber company that paid its employees on friday of each week.consequently,vaughan routinely went to a bank on fridays to obtain sufficient currency to cash payroll checks for the lumber company employees.and,he did so on friday,august.upon returning from the bank on that friday,he placed in a bank bag that he kept in a cabinet underneath the cash register,another elsewhere in the store,and the remaining cash in a safe.
on the day in question,as vaughan was starting to eat lunch and to file an invoice,two men entered the store.vaughan saw them and recognized the taller of the two men as kevin green,the defendant.green had worked for the lumber company for approximately eight to ten weeks during the preceding spring,and had frequented the vaughans grocery store at lunchtime,after work,and on fridays to cash his payroll checks.
when the two men entered the store,vaughan had her back to the door and was standing five or six feet from vaughan.thinking that the shorter man was going over to the drink box,vaughan turned around to finish his filing.as he did so,he heard his wife scream,oh,god.at trial,vaughan described what he then heard 
it was four bangs.bang,bang and i was hit.i did know where i was hit,but i was hurt.i turned a complete turn and fell on the floor,sit sic down on my right foot and broke my right ankle.and about the time i went down,i looked up and i realized it was a gun being fired.i could see him,he shot toward my wife with the fourth shot.i saw his hand with a pistol in it.he was holding it like he was target practicing.
vaughan testified that green,after firing the four shots,walked back to the door and stood there as a lookout while the other man came around behind the counter and tried to open the cash register.when the drawer on the cash register jammed,green directed the shorter man to look under the counter.upon doing so,he found the bank bag containing approximately in cash and vaughan pistol,which he then used to shoot through the key hole in the cash register drawer.taking the bank bag and the pistol,the shorter man exited the store,but green walked a few steps over to where vaughan was lying on the floor and pointed the gun at her again.according to vaughan,the gun misfired,and green ejected a live cartridge onto the floor.green then fired two more shots in the direction of vaughan.lowering his head,vaughan heard the gun snap one more time,but he did not know whether green was pointing the gun at him or his wife.only then,when the gun was empty,did green leave the store.
after green left,vaughan dragged himself approximately five feet across the floor of the store to a telephone and dialed the emergency number,but he was too weak to reach his wife who was still lying on the floor.one of the first police officers to arrive at the scene testified that he observed puddles of blood just pouring out of vaughan nose,her mouth,and her head.a local volunteer medical examiner determined that vaughan had died at the scene of the shooting.
a subsequent autopsy of vaughan body revealed that she sustained four gunshot wounds.one bullet penetrated the left side of her head,passed through the temporal and frontal lobes of her brain,and lodged in the inner frontal sinus of her face.another bullet entered the right side of her chest and went into the upper lobe of her right lung.a third bullet penetrated the left side of her back.this was the only wound.the fourth bullet entered the right side of vaughan back and penetrated two lobes of her right lung.according to the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy,jose abrenio,this wound caused hemorrhaging in her thoracic cavity,which led to difficulty in breathing and had the effect of suffocating her.abrenio also opined that vaughan survived seconds to minutes after she was first shot.
four days after the murder,a warrant was issued to search green,his residence,and automobile.during the search of his home,six bullets were retrieved from the trunk of a tree in his yard.the bullets were found behind a makeshift target hanging on the tree.forensic testing on those six bullets and the four bullets recovered from vaughan body during the autopsy revealed that all ten caliber auto full metal jacketed bullets had been fired from one weapon.about to feet from the tree,empty cartridge casings were also recovered.
after green was arrested,he executed a form waiving his miranda rights and agreed to be questioned by law enforcement officers.during that interrogation,green admitted that he and his cousin,david green,robbed the vaughans grocery store and that he selected their store because he knew the vaughans kept a lot of money there.green and his cousin had originally planned to wear masks to conceal their faces.however,they discarded the masks after they had to wait behind the store in their automobile for about an hour because other people were in the grocery store.green also admitted that he shot both of the vaughans,hitting vaughan four times.green commonwealth,green commonwealth ii.
in june,green was convicted of the capital murder of vaughan during the commission of robbery and of the crimes of robbery,malicious wounding of vaughan,and three counts of illegal use of a firearm.the jury fixed green punishment at death for the capital murder conviction life imprisonment for the robbery conviction years imprisonment for the malicious wounding conviction and three years imprisonment for each of the firearms convictions.on october,the trial judge sentenced green in accord with the jury verdict.green trial counsel appealed his capital murder conviction and death sentence but not his convictions.
in june,the supreme court of virginia reversed green capital murder conviction and death sentence,holding that the trial judge abused his discretion by refusing to remove two potential jurors from the venire based on their lack of impartiality.see green commonwealth,green commonwealth i.the supreme court concluded that one juror had formed a fixed opinion about the punishment green should receive if convicted of the capital murder,and the other juror had formed a fixed opinion about the case based on pretrial publicity.although this decision necessitated a new trial on the capital murder charge,it did not affect green unappealed convictions.see id.at green did not appeal his convictions.therefore,those convictions are not before this court and are not affected by this opinion.
green retrial occurred in the latter part of,and a jury again convicted him of capital murder during the commission of robbery and fixed his punishment at death.green criminal record,including the convictions and sentences he received at the first trial,was presented to the jury during the sentencing phase of the retrial.in january,the trial judge sentenced green in accord with the jury recommendation.in june,the supreme court of virginia affirmed green capital murder conviction and death sentence.see green commonwealth ii.pertinent to this appeal,the supreme court summarized evidence presented during the penalty phase of green second trial 
the jury also heard evidence from scott sautter,an expert in neuropsychology who had tested green on two separate occasions using two different tests,the wechsler abbreviated intelligence scale and the wechsler a dult i ntelligence s cale r evised.sautter testified that,while the formats of the two tests are similar,the two tests are not exactly the same.sautter reported that green had a score of on the wechsler adult intelligence scale and a score of on the abbreviated test 
two clinical psychologists testified for the commonwealth in rebuttal to sautter testimony.lynda hyatt reported that green had an score of on the ammons ammons quick test,which placed green in the category of low average mental functioning.thomas pasquale evaluated green personality as well as his intellectual functioning.pasquale diagnosed depression,alcohol dependency,drug abuse,personality disorder,and malingering.according to pasquale,green had a score of on the wechsler adult intelligence scale,placing him in the borderline range of intellectual functioning.
at alterations in original.on february,the supreme court of the united states denied green petition for a writ of certiorari.see green virginia,d.
green was represented by the same counsel for both of his trials and direct appeals.however,on june,green was appointed new counsel to represent him on his state habeas petition,which was filed april.in that petition,green asserted,inter alia,the two claims now before us he is mentally retarded and,therefore,his sentence violates the eighth amendment as interpreted in atkins,and his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to appeal his convictions after his first trial.
on february,the supreme court of virginia dismissed green state habeas petition.see green warden of sussex i state prison,green warden.the supreme court held that green ineffective assistance claim was untimely under state law 
petitioner is challenging his counsel failure to appeal his convictions that became final on october.the provisions of code state that a petition for writ of habeas corpus shall be filed within two years from the date of final judgment in the trial court or within one year from either final disposition of the direct appeal in state court or the time for filing such appeal has expired,whichever is later.any challenges petitioner wished to make regarding his appellate counsel failure to appeal his convictions needed to be filed no later than october,or two years from the date of final judgment in the trial court on those charges.
green warden,at.the supreme court also held that green failed to prove that his atkins claim was not frivolous for purposes of virginia code,which provides that the supreme court shall consider a claim of mental retardation filed under the statute and if it determines that the claim is not frivolous,it shall remand the claim to the circuit court for a determination of mental retardation otherwise,it shall dismiss the petition.the supreme court explained 
the legislature has defined mental retardation as 
a disability,originating before the age of years,characterized concurrently by i significantly subaverage intellectual functioning as demonstrated by performance on a standardized measure of intellectual functioning administered in conformity with accepted professional practice,that is at least two standard deviations below the mean and ii significant limitations in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual,social and practical adaptive skills.
this court has previously held that the ceiling for a classification of mental retardation is an score of.the record shows that green was administered four standardized tests for measuring intellectual functioning.green scored an on the ammons ammons quick test,a on the wechsler adult intelligence scale,third edition,a on the wechsler adult intelligence scale,revised,and below a on the abbreviated wechsler adult intelligence scale.based on these test scores,green has failed to meet his burden of proving that his claim of mental retardation is not frivolous.
green warden,at internal citation omitted.green thereafter filed a petition for rehearing,which the supreme court denied without comment on april.the supreme court of the united states denied green petition for a writ of certiorari relating to his state habeas case on december.see green true,d.
green filed his federal habeas petition on december,naming virginia department of corrections director gene johnson as the respondent.johnson moved to dismiss the petition,and the case was referred to a magistrate judge for the issuance of a report and recommendation.the magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing and issued a thorough report,in which he recommended that the petition be denied and the motion to dismiss be granted.see green johnson,wl,green johnson i.although the magistrate judge made several important subsidiary rulings in green favor,he ultimately concluded,inter alia,that green failed to prove that he is mentally retarded under virginia code a and green ineffective assistance of counsel claim is untimely under d.both parties filed objections to the report.with one minor,irrelevant exception,the district court adopted the recommendation and dismissed the petition.see green johnson,wl,green johnson ii.
the district court granted green a coa on his atkins and ineffective assistance of counsel claims,and although green agrees with much of the district court reasoning,he challenges the ultimate dismissal of his claims.conversely,johnson agrees with the ultimate dismissal of green claims,but he disagrees with some of the district court reasoning,and he presents several alternate bases to support their dismissal.
we begin with green atkins claim.we affirm the dismissal of this claim on two separate grounds.
the supreme court held in atkins that the eighth amendment prohibits the execution of the mentally retarded.the court concluded that a national legislative consensus against the execution of mentally retarded offenders had developed,and it identified two reasons consistent with that consensus to justify a categorical exclusion of the mentally retarded from execution the justifications for recognizing the death penalty,retribution and deterrence do not apply to mentally retarded offenders and the diminished capacity of mentally retarded offenders places them at greater risk of wrongful execution.at.the court noted that t o the extent there is serious disagreement about the execution of mentally retarded offenders,it is in determining which offenders are in fact retarded.id.at.continuing,the court observed that n ot all people who claim to be mentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom there is a national consensus however,instead of defining that range,the court expressly left to the states the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences.id.quoting ford wainwright,d.
the virginia general assembly responded to atkins by enacting a statutory scheme to determine capital defendants claims of mental retardation.pertinent to this case,the general assembly mandated that a capital defendant has the burden of proving mental retardation by a preponderance of the evidence,c,and it defined the term mentally retarded as 
a disability,originating before the age of years,characterized concurrently by i significantly subaverage intellectual functioning as demonstrated by performance on a standardized measure of intellectual functioning administered in conformity with accepted professional practice,that is at least two standard deviations below the mean and ii significant limitations in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual,social and practical adaptive skills.
a.moreover,for persons such as green who were sentenced to death before april,and who had not yet completed both their direct appeal and state habeas proceeding,the general assembly directed the state supreme court to consider a claim of mental retardation and if it determines that the claim is not frivolous,it shall remand the claim to the circuit court for a determination of mental retardation otherwise,it shall dismiss the petition.
interpreting these state statutory provisions,the supreme court of virginia has held that a person is not mentally retarded,within the meaning of code,unless that person meets the comprehensive definition of this statutory term,lewis warden of the fluvanna correctional center,and that an intelligence quotient iq score of is the maximum score for a classification of mental retardation under the first prong of the statutory definition,johnson commonwealth,vacated on other grounds,d see also winston warden of sussex i state prison,wl,at,this court has previously held that the maximum score for a classification of mental retardation is an score of.furthermore,for purposes of,a criminal defendant who seeks to demonstrate that his claim of mental retardation is not frivolous must be able to point to credible evidence in the record supporting the requirements set forth in the statutory test.johnson commonwealth,at.
the district court dismissed green atkins claim on the merits,concluding on a de novo review that although he met his burden of proof on the first prong of virginia statutory definition for mental retardation,he failed to meet his burden of proof on the second prong.johnson contends that the district court should have deferred to the supreme court decision under d and e and dismissed this claim without conducting a de novo review.we agree.
the federal habeas statute dictates a highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings,which demands that decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.the required deference encompasses both the state court legal conclusions and its factual findings.lenz washington,cir,cert.denied,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the question is not whether a federal court believes the state court determination was incorrect but whether that determination was substantially higher threshold.schriro landrigan,d.thus,where the state court has adjudicated a claim on the merits,federal habeas relief is appropriate only if the state court judgment resulted in a decision that is contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d 
a decision is contrary to the supreme court clearly established precedents if the state court applied a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the court cases,or if it confronted a set of facts that is materially indistinguishable from a decision of the court but reached a different result.brown payton,d.a decision constitutes an unreasonable application of the court clearly established precedents if the state court applied the court precedents to the facts in an objectively unreasonable manner.id.in reviewing a habeas petition,federal courts must presume the correctness of a state court factual determinations unless the habeas petitioner rebuts the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e.
the supreme court of virginia adjudicated green atkins claim during his state habeas proceeding.the record presented to the supreme court included,inter alia,expert testimony from green two criminal trials concerning his pasquale,who was an expert witness for the commonwealth,testified that he administered the wechsler adult intelligence scale,edition test to green,who scored.hyatt,who was also a commonwealth expert witness,testified that she administered the ammons and ammons quick test to green,who scored.both of these witnesses testified that green is not mentally retarded and that although it is possible for a person to fake a lower score,it is not possible to fake a higher score.sautter,who was an expert witness for green,testified that he administered two tests to green green scored on the wechsler abbreviated scale of intelligence wasi and on the wechsler adult intelligence.additionally,sautter testified that green is mentally retarded.based on this evidence,the supreme court concluded for purposes of that green had failed to meet his burden of proving that his claim of mental retardation is not frivolous.green warden,at.
the magistrate judge concluded that the virginia supreme court correctly identified atkins as the controlling opinion by the united states supreme court,but unreasonably applied atkins to green case.green johnson i,wl,at.after noting that green had scored below on the wasi and that sautter testified that green is mentally retarded,the magistrate to johnson 
because green pointed to credible evidence supporting the requirements set forth in virginia code a,including the result of at least one iq test that is two standard deviations below the mean,expert testimony that he is mentally retarded,and evidence of significant limitations in adaptive behavior,it was objectively unreasonable for the virginia supreme court to find green claim of mental retardation to be frivolous under atkins,and this court will address the merits of green claim.
wl,at.the district court agreed,stating that the magistrate judge correctly concluded that the supreme court of virginia unreasonably held that petitioner claim of mental retardation was frivolous,which allowed the magistrate judge to conduct a de novo review of this claim.green johnson ii,wl,at 
applying the standard mandated by d,we conclude that the supreme court decision is entitled to deference.the supreme court correctly applied atkins as the controlling precedent,and green did not present a set of facts that is materially indistinguishable from a united states supreme court decision.thus,the supreme court decision is not contrary to clearly established federal law.moreover,the pertinent underlying facts identified by the supreme court,green scores are not disputed.we are thus left with the question of whether the supreme court applied atkins in an objectively unreasonable manner.
stated succinctly the supreme court found that three of green four test scores exceed the maximum score of,and evidence in the state habeas record established that although a person can fake a lower score,a higher score can not be faked based on this record,we do not believe that the supreme court applied atkins in an objectively unreasonable manner by discrediting,as it implicitly did,green wasi score of along with sautter opinion and then concluding under state law that green failed to present sufficient credible evidence supporting the requirement in the first prong of the commonwealth statutory test for mental retardation.see woods quarterman,cir holding that where the petitioner had four scores above and one score below,the state court was not unreasonable in concluding that the petitioner failed to prove that he suffered from subaverage intellectual functioning.for this reason,green is not entitled to relief under,and we affirm the dismissal of this claim 
as noted,the district court did not defer to the supreme court decision.instead,the district court conducted a de novo review of green atkins claim and concluded,inter alia,that he failed to meet his burden of proof on the second prong of virginia statutory definition of mental,that he has significant limitations in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual,social and practical adaptive skills.because green must prove both prongs of virginia statutory definition for mental retardation in order to establish that he is mentally retarded,lewis,at,the district court dismissed this claim.we affirm the dismissal of green atkins claim on this basis as well 
in considering the district court de novo determination on the second prong,we review its legal conclusions de novo,monroe angelone,cir,and its factual findings under the highly deferential clearly erroneous standard set forth in rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,walton,at.where,as here,the magistrate judge conducted the evidentiary hearing,we review the district court findings,rather than the magistrate judge recommendations.monroe,at.in this case,these are essentially one and the same because the district court adopted the magistrate judge pertinent findings and recommendation.see green johnson ii,wl,at after reviewing the entire record,examining all of the objections filed by respondent and petitioner,and making de novo findings with respect to the portions objected to,this court finds no error in law or fact in the magistrate judge thorough analysis of the mental retardation claim.
the magistrate judge correctly recognized that a ssessment of adaptive behavior shall be based on multiple sources of information,including clinical interview,psychological testing and educational,correctional and vocational records,b,and he utilized the american association of mental retardation aamr standards for measuring adaptive skills.the magistrate judge set forth in detail the expert testimony presented by both sides at the evidentiary hearing and explained his findings and conclusions with respect to green adaptive skills.green johnson i,wl,at.we briefly summarize these findings and conclusions.
the magistrate judge noted that according to the aamr,conceptual adaptive skills involve skills pertaining to language,reading and writing,money concepts,and,and he concluded that although the evidence suggested that green conceptual adaptive skills are below average,green failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he has significant limitations.the magistrate judge based this determination on evidence that green had conversed freely while being interviewed and shared his opinion about his mental health diagnosis and his understanding of the status of his case requested sophisticated books from the prison library and completed a form on which he effectively explained a mistake with the prison commissary displayed an understanding of money concepts by handling his own money,having a savings account,paying his own rent,engaging in transactions with money orders,and profiting from dealing drugs and engaged in by doing such things as obtaining a driver license,concealing much of his criminal activity from his family,and requesting a copy of his release of medical records which is indicative of independent participation in the direction of his case.id.at.
the magistrate judge then noted that according to the aamr,social adaptive skills are measured by interpersonal skills and responsibility,gullibility and naivete,and ability to follow rules and obey laws.the magistrate judge concluded that green was unable to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,significant limitations in his social adaptive skills because green although socially awkward,was nonetheless regarded as a good guy who liked to joke around had girlfriends was regularly employed and was often regarded as a good employee who showed a level of responsibility beyond that expected of someone with significant limitations displayed personal responsibility for his financial needs by profitably distributing drugs and was manipulative.the magistrate judge also considered green propensity for ignoring rules and the law,but found the extent to which his behavior is attributable to his intellectual deficits to be unclear.id.at.
finally,the magistrate judge noted that according to the aamr,practical adaptive skills involve activities relevant to daily living,occupational skills,and maintenance of a safe environment and he concluded that green failed to meet his burden of proving significant limitations in these skills by a preponderance of the evidence.the magistrate judge explained 
green evidence portrayed him as having mobility issues and difficulty dressing himself appropriately,cleaning his house,and cooking for himself.much of this evidence was contested,however.for instance,it is uncontroverted that green was able to acquire a driver license and navigate public transportation systems.also,green mother and sister,who both stated in their declarations that green had difficulty caring for himself,previously testified at trial that he could care for himself.finally,green employment experiences in restaurants show that he was able to cook and use the telephone.
with respect to his occupational skills,green showed that his various jobs always required skills and low education and that he was usually hired with help from family and friends.he was also shown to have difficulty retaining jobs.three former employers,however,described green as an average to above average employee.in fact,he received a promotion at one job,an accomplishment that does not suggest significant limitations in occupational skills.
id internal citations omitted.
in light of these findings and conclusions,the magistrate judge recommended denial of green atkins claim.the district court accepted this recommendation,explaining 
despite presenting evidence that he displays some limitations in adaptive behavior,including having below average mental intelligence,struggling to perform some basic activities,and exhibiting behavior,petitioner has failed to demonstrate,within the three subsets of adaptive behavior,that he suffers significant limitations.the magistrate judge thoroughly considered the limitations of petitioner adaptive behavior,as presented by expert testimony and evidence,yet persuasively and correctly concluded that petitioner simply failed to establish significant limitations,based upon evidence,in part,of petitioner employment history,use of language,understanding of money concepts,and relationships with others.
green johnson ii,wl,at internal citation omitted emphasis in original.having carefully considered the parties arguments and the district court ruling under the aforementioned standard of review,we find no error in the district court findings and conclusions.indeed,we believe that the district court and magistrate judge consideration of the evidence was thorough,its findings are amply supported by the evidence,and green challenges to the district court rulings are without merit.accordingly,we affirm the denial of green atkins claim for this reason as well.
we now turn to green ineffective assistance of counsel claim,which is premised on his trial counsel failure to appeal the convictions after his first trial.that trial concluded in october green filed his petition on december.accepting the magistrate judge recommendation,the district court held that this claim is under d,which establishes a limitation period for an inmate to file a petition.we agree with this conclusion 
under d a d,the limitation period begins to run from the latest of several potential starting dates 
a the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review 
b the date on which the impediment to filing an application created by state action in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states is removed,if the applicant was prevented from filing by such state action 
c the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court,if the right has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review or 
d the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
although green convictions became final on or about november,the district court found that green faced an impediment to filing his petition until june,when the commonwealth appointed new counsel to represent him in his state habeas impediment being green ongoing representation by his allegedly ineffective trial counsel.accordingly,the district court concluded under d b that the starting date for the limitation period is june.green johnson ii,wl,at.
the district court next considered whether,under d,the limitation period must be tolled for the period of april,to april,when green state habeas proceeding was pending.section d provides that the limitation period is tolled while a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.the district court determined that statutory tolling for this period is inappropriate because d permits tolling only when a properly filed application for state habeas relief is filed,a
