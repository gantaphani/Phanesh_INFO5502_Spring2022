in,thomas davis and john wilder were in a car attempting to purchase drugs from troy prewitt when one of them shot and killed prewitt.davis,the habeas petitioner here,was charged with murder in michigan state court and convicted by a jury.the main factual question at trial was whether davis or wilder was the shooter.wilder was a key witness against davis at trial and testified that wilder was merely driving davis to buy drugs and had no intention of killing prewitt.davis claimed that their roles were reversed.
the main questions now before us,decided in davis favor by the district court below,are does davis have any significant evidence that a potential,uncalled witness,todd selma,would have testified that wilder confessed to the shooting,and did the prosecutor improperly vouch for wilder credibility by noting that wilder had been charged only as an accessory after the fact and not as an accomplice to the murder.with regard to the first question,we find that the only significant evidence in the record showing what selma would have testified,if produced,is a letter that actually implicates davis,not wilder,for the shooting.hence,we conclude that it is clear from the record that davis was not prejudiced by his lawyers failures to locate and call selma.with regard to the second question,we conclude that the prosecutor statements did not constitute improper vouching because wilder charge was in the record and his personal interest in the case was obvious to the jury.
we,therefore,reverse the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus by the district court.
the testimony at trial showed that wilder and davis drove to a parking lot to purchase drugs,with wilder driving and davis in the passenger seat.they attempted to buy drugs from derrick glaze on credit,but glaze refused.troy prewitt,another dealer,entered the parking lot and also refused to sell them drugs on credit.as prewitt stood next to the passenger side of the vehicle,davis grabbed the drugs.wilder slowly drove away as prewitt ran alongside the car to retrieve his drugs.davis then shot and killed prewitt.these facts are not in dispute except insofar as davis claims that his role and wilder were reversed.
the prosecution evidence at trial consisted primarily of testimony from wilder and glaze and two other eyewitnesses,wendell wilson and dean rochelle.credibility was an issue with each of these witnesses.wilder was in the car with davis for the purpose of buying drugs and later gave a questionable story to police.he pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact and was sentenced to probation.glaze was an admitted drug dealer and gave questionable testimony,including that he observed a black woman in the car.he also did not tell police that he saw who fired the gun or that he saw davis with a gun.wilson could not tell whether the driver or passenger fired or even how many people were in the car.rochelle was a drug dealer.during,rochelle admitted that,on the day he gave a statement to police regarding this case,he also gave a statement regarding another murder case.he also stated that the information he gave regarding the other murder case was fabricated because he was pressured by police.
after a trial,davis was convicted by a jury of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.he was sentenced as a habitual offender to to years imprisonment for the murder conviction,to be served consecutively to two years imprisonment for the conviction.his conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal.
davis initial petition for habeas corpus relief was denied for failure to exhaust his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims in state court.davis returned to federal court after the state court denied these claims.in response to davis eight habeas claims,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing and ultimately granted relief on the grounds that davis was deprived of his right to the effective assistance of trial and appellate counsel and because the prosecutor committed misconduct.davis booker,d.in granting habeas relief,the district court specifically found that davis trial counsel was ineffective for failing to locate and interview selma davis appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to locate and interview selma davis trial counsel was ineffective in failing to meet privately with davis until eight days before trial,and so failing to learn about selma allegedly critical comments davis trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request criminal histories for prosecution witnesses and failing to impeach wilder with evidence of a prior conviction for retail fraud and the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by improperly vouching for wilder credibility.id.at.
the central issue respecting the failure to call the witness,todd selma,arises because davis claims that he,wilder and selma were in jail together where wilder confessed to the murder to selma.the district court believed that the writ of habeas corpus must issue because of the following circumstances described in the district court opinion 
the record shows that the information regarding selma potential testimony was supplied to and available to counsel at least several months prior to trial in the form of petitioner verbal statements to counsel and the pro se motion filed in the trial court regarding representation by petitioner first attorney.yet,counsel waited until eight days prior to trial to try to locate this witness.he relied upon a police investigator to locate selma without tapping a resource at his disposal,an investigator already approved by the court.
the michigan court of appeals held that petitioner failed to show that counsel was ineffective in failing to locate selma or that petitioner was prejudiced by this failure.the state court rested its conclusion on the absence of any testimony at the ginther hearing that i selma would have been available to testify,ii the prosecutor and police failed to use due diligence to locate selma.the state court did not address counsel failure to utilize the investigator,counsel general obligation to investigate and prepare a defense,or the fact that selma was on probation at the time trial counsel admitted to first hearing his name.
in this case,an attorney acting competently,would have attempted to locate and interview todd selma when initially made aware of his potential testimony.in addition,an attorney acting competently would have discovered that the trial court had approved a private investigator and would have utilized that investigator to attempt to locate selma rather than relying on police,and would have attempted to ascertain the identity of any additional potential witnesses to the shooting.the requirement that an attorney conduct a reasonable investigation requires that an attorney commence investigation far enough in advance of trial to allow for time to pursue leads,interview witnesses and develop a defense strategy.while defense counsel in this case developed a defense strategy,attempting to inculpate wilder as the shooter,he failed to investigate and develop any facts which would have supported that theory.in addition,at the state court evidentiary hearing,the trial court judge noted that selma was on probation through june.thus,if trial counsel had undertaken prompt and diligent efforts,selma could have been easily located while either incarcerated or serving a term of probation.
respondent argues that petitioner fails to establish prejudice in counsel failure to call selma as a witness for two reasons because a letter purportedly written by selma in incriminates petitioner and because petitioner has presented no evidence to show how selma would have testified at trial.
first,petitioner has produced a copy of a march,letter purportedly written by todd selma to petitioner.the substance of the letter is confused.selma appears to simultaneously profess petitioner innocence while placing blame for the shooting on someone from new york.considerable testimony was presented at the evidentiary hearing to show that petitioner was called new york by several fellow prisoners.in the letter,selma admits that he does not fully remember the d
