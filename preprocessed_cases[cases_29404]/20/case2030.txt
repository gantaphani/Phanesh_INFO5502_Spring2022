in kevin rice was convicted in the circuit court of cook county of possession of heroin with intent to deliver and sentenced to years imprisonment.his state court remedies exhausted,rice petitioned the federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus under.he now appeals the court denial of his habeas petition,arguing that he is entitled to relief based on the illinois supreme court unreasonable application of chambers mississippi,d,to his case.we affirm.
background 
in two chicago police officers,robert drozd and michael cronin,observed a car with tinted windows drive by their unmarked police car traveling in a speed zone.the officers pulled the speeding car over,and drozd approached the vehicle on the driver side.through the car open window,officer drozd saw the driver,petitioner rice,hand a brown paper bag to the passenger,raymond pugh drozd then watched pugh stuff the bag down the front of his pants.believing the bag to contain a weapon,drozd ordered pugh out of the car and conducted a search.drozd recovered the bag and found what appeared to be an illegal substance inside lab tests later showed that the bag contained grams of heroin.drozd placed pugh under arrest and told officer cronin about the transfer of the bag cronin then arrested rice.
before rice and pugh were tried,pugh moved to quash his arrest and suppress evidence obtained from drozd search.at the suppression hearing,pugh testified that he had placed the paper bag containing the heroin down his pants two hours before he and rice were stopped by officers drozd and cronin.pugh also stated that he had kept the bag in his pants at all times until drozd discovered it during the search.at rice and pugh trial,officer drozd testified that as he approached the stopped car he saw rice hand pugh the paper bag and watched pugh put the bag down his pants.rice denied handling the bag or the heroin and called pugh to testify that he put the bag down his pants two hours earlier.when pugh asserted his fifth amendment privilege,rice moved to admit pugh statements from the suppression hearing.the trial judge denied the motion,ruling that pugh paper bag testimony was inadmissible hearsay because the issues presented at the suppression hearing were not similar enough to the ones at trial to ensure that the state had a meaningful opportunity to pugh.
the jury ultimately convicted rice of possession with intent to deliver heroin,and the court sentenced him to a prison term.rice appealed his conviction,arguing that the court committed prejudicial error by refusing to admit pugh suppression hearing testimony at trial.rice won an initial victory in the illinois appellate court,people rice,d,but a divided illinois supreme court reinstated his conviction,people rice.
the illinois appellate court held that pugh statements at the suppression hearing were statements against his penal interest and should have been admitted as an exception to hearsay.rice,at.the appellate court examined pugh prior statements for indicia of reliability using the framework set forth in chambers mississippi,d,and decided that pugh testimony satisfied three of the four requirements for admission.rice,at finding that pugh former testimony was corroborated by other evidence,against his penal interests,and subject to,but was not made to a close acquaintance shortly after the crime.
the illinois high court disagreed,holding that the trial court exclusion of pugh former testimony was proper under the state evidentiary rules and did not deny rice a fair trial under the rule announced in chambers.rice,at.a majority of the supreme court of illinois found that pugh statements may have been against his penal interests,but were not made spontaneously to an acquaintance,were not corroborated by any other evidence,and were not subject to adequate because the issues at stake in the suppression hearing were limited and the state was not permitted to fully test the testimony reliability.rice,at.
rice timely filed his application for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court pursuant to,tendering six separate grounds for relief.see rice bowen,c,wl.the district court rejected all of his reasons and denied his habeas petition.on appeal rice makes only one argument that the illinois supreme court unreasonably applied chambers,and violated his constitutional right to due process,in deciding that the trial court had properly excluded pugh suppression hearing testimony at rice trial.
ii.discussion 
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,a habeas petitioner like rice whose claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court is not entitled to relief unless he can demonstrate that the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d price vincent,d.the supreme court also warns that under aedpa we are not at liberty to issue a writ of habeas corpus based on our independent judgment that the relevant state court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.williams taylor,d morgan krenke,cir.for our purposes here,that means we must uphold the illinois supreme court application of chambers for there is no dispute that this is the correct governing legal principle to rice case unless it was objectively unreasonable.d edmunds deppisch,cir williams,at.we have said in other habeas proceedings that a state court application of federal law is reasonable where it is at least minimally consistent with the facts and circumstances of the case.sanchez gilmore,cir.williams,at.acknowledging that unreasonable is difficult to define,but noting that it is a common term in the legal world and,accordingly,federal judges are familiar with its meaning.
before we decide the reasonableness of the illinois supreme court decision in this case,we note that we will not decide whether pugh suppression hearing testimony was in fact reliable enough to be admitted into evidence at rice trial.our doing so would usurp the role of the state courts in determining the admissibility of evidence at trial under state law,which we are not permitted to do under aedpa.see krenke,at.instead,we may only consider whether it was unreasonable of the illinois supreme court to hold,in light of chambers,that the exclusion of pugh suppression hearing testimony did not violate rice due process right to present a defense and receive a fair trial.krenke,at.
chambers informs us that where constitutional rights directly affecting the ascertainment of guilt are implicated,the hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice,at.the chambers court provided four factors to consider in determining whether sufficient indicia of reliability exist to admit exculpatory hearsay into evidence whether the statement was made shortly after the crime to a close acquaintance,whether other evidence or circumstances corroborate the statement,whether the statement was and against the declarant penal interests,and whether the declarant was subject to adequate,at.rice contends that the illinois supreme court unreasonably applied chambers because pugh suppression hearing testimony bore persuasive assurances of trustworthiness and thus was well within the rationale of the exception for declarations against interest.chambers,at.see also people rice,d,finding pugh prior statement trustworthy as it satisfies three of four chambers factors.the state maintains there was nothing unreasonable about the illinois supreme court decision the court identified chambers as the correct governing principle of law,considered pugh prior statements in light of the reliability factors identified in chambers,and logically concluded that pugh suppression hearing testimony was properly excluded at trial because it was untrustworthy and did not qualify under any hearsay exception.the federal district court considered these conflicting interpretations in reviewing rice ha
