in this habeas corpus proceeding we consider whether the district court erred in granting relief to texas prisoner keith jordan on the basis of pretrial ineffective assistance of counsel.concluding that the district court was in error,we reverse the grant of habeas corpus relief and remand so the balance of jordan claims can be considered.
jordan was indicted in november for aggravated sexual assault of a child.the state offered a plea bargain of ten years deferred adjudication probation and a fine of.for reasons we will discuss,jordan failed to enter a timely plea,and the state ultimately withdrew the plea offer in september.a month later jordan was indicted for aggravated kidnaping arising from the same incident as the aggravated sexual assault charge.
jordan pleaded not guilty on both counts and was convicted by a jury,which assessed thirty years imprisonment for aggravated sexual assault of a child and twenty years for aggravated kidnaping.both convictions were affirmed on direct appeal,see jordan state,wl,no pet.
jordan filed two petitions for habeas corpus relief in state court,one challenging the legality of his conviction for aggravated sexual assault of a child the other challenging his custody under his conviction of aggravated kidnaping.both petitions contained the same substantive claims,which center on the contention that jordan counsel provided ineffective assistance under the sixth amendment during the plea bargaining process and at trial.jordan alleged that counsel representation was constitutionally deficient in five respects,the first being the failure to inform him that the state plea bargain offer on the aggravated sexual assault charge would be withdrawn if he did not complete a investigation and formally enter his plea by the state deadline.
jordan also maintained that counsel had erroneously advised him and argued to the jury that under texas law his alleged mistake of fact concerning the complaining witness age,that she was years old was a valid defense to aggravated sexual assault of a child failed to challenge either the factual basis or reliability of expert testimony of a police officer presented by the state did not object to allegedly improper bolstering of the complaining witness testimony at trial and failed to object to allegedly prejudicial jury instructions at the punishment phase regarding the amount of time jordan would have to serve before being eligible for release.jordan further claimed that the state had withheld impeachment evidence in contravention of its due process obligation under brady maryland,d,and its progeny.
after an evidentiary hearing before the same judge who had presided over the trial,the state habeas trial court entered two separate orders containing identical findings of fact and conclusions of law,see ex parte jordan,no.a dist,dallas county,june,aggravated sexual assault of a child ex parte jordan,no.a dist,dallas county,june,aggravated kidnaping.the court made the following findings regarding the process the prosecutor initially responsible for handling the aggravated sexual assault of a child charge against jordan had made a plea offer of ten years deferred adjudication probation in exchange for a guilty plea.when a new prosecutor was assigned to the case in may,this plea offer had been on the table for more than three months.defense counsel told the new prosecutor that jordan would accept the plea but did not want to register as a sex offender the prosecutor agreed that they could leave that condition for the court to decide.
the offer then remained on the table for another four months,but jordan failed to complete the necessary investigation required by the probation department.at that point,the prosecutor informed counsel that jordan had three weeks to accept the plea,and thus complete the requisite investigatory report,or the offer would be withdrawn.counsel did not communicate to jordan that there was a deadline within which he had to complete the investigation and enter his plea jordan failed to complete the report and enter a plea,and the prosecutor withdrew the offer the prosecutor later obtained an additional indictment for aggravated kidnaping arising from the same episode as the aggravated sexual assault charge.
based on these facts,the state habeas trial court determined that counsel was ineffective for failing to fully communicate the limits of the plea bargain agreement with jordan and due to her actions,the state withdrew the favorable plea offer and indicted jordan for an additional offense.in addition,the court sustained each of jordan other specific ineffective assistance claims and his brady claim concerning the criminal history of the complaining witness.as a result,the court recommended to the texas court of criminal appeals that jordan be granted habeas relief on his convictions of aggravated sexual assault of a child and aggravated kidnaping.
the court of criminal appeals accepted the state habeas trial court recommendation that jordan was entitled to habeas relief on his conviction of aggravated sexual assault of a child on the basis of ineffective assistance during the plea process.the court stated 
applicant contends,inter alia,that his attorney failed to inform him of the deadline for accepting the state plea offer of ten years deferred adjudication probation,and a fine.
in the instant cause,the record reflects that the state made an offer of ten years deferred adjudication probation,in return for a plea of guilty to aggravated sexual assault.the trial court found that applicant accepted the plea offer,but counsel failed to inform applicant that he needed to complete the psi by the state deadline,or the offer would be withdrawn.the trial court has recommended that relief be granted.we agree with this recommendation.
ex parte jordan,per curiam unpublished.accordingly,the court granted habeas relief and vacated jordan conviction of aggravated sexual assault of a child the court did not,however,accept the habeas trial court recommendation as to the aggravated kidnaping conviction the same day it issued its opinion granting relief on the aggravated sexual assault conviction,it denied without written order habeas relief on the conviction of aggravated kidnaping 
jordan then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,pursuant to,challenging the legality of his custody under the conviction of aggravated kidnaping.he sought relief on each of the ineffective assistance grounds and the brady claim raised in his state writ.relying on the facts as found by the state habeas trial court,the magistrate judge determined that but for counsel ineffective pretrial performance,petitioner would have accepted the plea bargain,would have received only a ten year probated sentence and would not have been charged with,or convicted of,aggravated kidnaping.
convinced of this causal link,the magistrate judge determined that jordan had proven,by a preponderance of the evidence,deficient performance and prejudice related to counsel pretrial representation.the magistrate judge thus concluded that the court of criminal appeals denial of habeas relief on jordan aggravated kidnaping conviction was factually unreasonable,as well as directly contrary to and an unreasonable application of strickland washington,d.accordingly,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant habeas relief on the conviction of aggravated kidnaping 
the state filed written objections to the magistrate judge report,central among them being the contention that the state habeas record does not support the finding that had jordan timely accepted the plea bargain offer on the aggravated sexual assault charge,he would not have been charged with aggravated kidnaping.the federal district court overruled the state objections and adopted the findings and conclusions of the magistrate judge report.in doing so,the court acknowledged that no direct evidence on this issue was presented at the state habeas hearing but nevertheless found that the record as a whole supported the conclusion that the aggravated kidnaping charge was itself part of the prejudice flowing from counsel ineff
