on march,byram was convicted by a jury in columbia,south carolina of murder,burglary,attempted armed robbery,and grand larceny of a motor vehicle.during the sentencing phase of the trial,the defense presented mitigating evidence.trial counsel retained forensic psychiatrist donald morgan and forensic psychologist geoff mckee to evaluate byram and to determine if byram possibly suffered from any brain damage.evelyn califf,a social worker,and investigator patti rickborn also assisted coggiola in preparing the mitigation evidence.califf testified that she met with byram five times and that she reviewed byram school records and a summary of his foster care placements.rickborn contacted several of byram natural and adoptive family members and helped strickler obtain records pertaining to byram adoption in alabama.
the trial court qualified califf as an expert in the area of adoptions and learning disabilities.during the sentencing phase of the trial,califf testified about byram troubled childhood and adolescence.she related details of his early family life in an abusive home and the fact that he was slow to develop as a young child.califf also reported that byram had difficulties in school and that his intelligence was in the dull normal range.
despite the mitigation evidence presented by defense counsel,the jury recommended imposition of the death penalty.the trial judge reviewed this recommendation and determined that the evidence justified the punishment in this case and that the recommendation was not the result of prejudice,passion or any other arbitrary factor.the trial court therefore sentenced byram to death.
the south carolina supreme court affirmed byram conviction and sentence on april.state byram,rehearing denied may.byram then filed for state relief.after a hearing,the south carolina circuit court denied byram request for relief.byram then filed a petition with the south carolina supreme court,which the court denied on january.byram next filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the united states district court for the district of south carolina.respondents filed a motion for summary judgment on march,and the matter was referred to a united states magistrate judge.the magistrate judge recommended dismissal.on october,the district court entered an order granting summary judgement in favor of the state,but the district court issued a certificate of appealability concerning his claims on january.byram now appeals the district court decision.
if a state court has already resolved the merits of a claim for relief,a federal court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases.williams taylor,d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from that precedent.id.at.lastly,a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case.id.at.

byram argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his own defense counsel improperly selected jurors in violation of the fourteenth amendment.at trial,defense counsel exercised nine out of ten peremptory strikes to exclude white jurors from the venire and an additional four challenges to remove white jury alternates.byram contends that these strikes were based on the improper consideration of race in jury selection.
in batson kentucky,d,and georgia mccollum,d,the supreme court held that it was constitutionally impermissible for either the prosecution or the defense to use peremptory strikes.the court set out a three step framework for determining when a batson violation has occurred.first,the opponent of the strike must make a prima facie showing that a strike was exercised on the basis of a juror race.at.once this threshold showing has been made,the burden shifts to the proponent of the strike to articulate a explanation for removing the juror in question.id.if such a reason is articulated,the trial court must then determine whether the opponent of the strike has sufficiently rebutted this explanation and proven purposeful discrimination on the part of the individual exercising the peremptory strike.id.
