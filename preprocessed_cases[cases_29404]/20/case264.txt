this is the latest in a steady stream of cases involving the complex procedural requirements that govern habeas corpus petitions filed under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.this case differs from the norm,however,because the petition before us does not suffer from any procedural flaw.it was filed within aedpa statute of limitations,see id.d,and it contains only claims,see id.b and c.nevertheless,the district court refused to address the merits of those claims and dismissed the petition without prejudice because the petitioner,steven nowaczyk,was in the process of adjudicating an additional he had not presented in his habeas state court.aedpa statute of limitations has now run its course,meaning that nowaczyk will be barred from filing a new petition if he can not proceed on the petition dismissed by the district court.although we conclude that the district court was not required to adjudicate nowaczyk claims immediately,we hold that it abused its discretion in dismissing his petition rather than retaining jurisdiction and entering a stay pending the outcome of the state proceedings.
in december,nowaczyk was convicted in new hampshire state court on charges of arson,conspiracy to commit arson,and witness tampering.the new hampshire supreme court affirmed his conviction on direct appeal,entering its final judgment on january.nowaczyk did not seek further review from the united states supreme court.
under aedpa,nowaczyk had one year from the date on which his conviction became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review in which to pursue federal habeas relief under.d a.the parties agree that the limitations period began on april,which marks the end of the period for filing a petition for writ of certiorari from the united states supreme court.see donovan maine,cir s ection d provides for tolling during the period in which the petitioner would have been allowed to ask the united states supreme court to grant certiorari to review the state court denial of his direct appeal the fact that the petitioner did not seek certiorari is immaterial.
the statute of limitations is tolled whenever a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.d.we have held that an application for state relief is pending and,thus,the statute of limitations is only when the application actually is being considered by the trial or appellate court,but also during the gap between the trial court initial disposition and the petitioner timely filing of a petition for review at the next level.currie matesanz,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also carey saffold,d confirming the prevailing view that an application remains pending between a lower state court decision and the filing of a notice of appeal to a higher state court.such tolling enables state prisoners to comply with aedpa exhaustion provisions,b and c,which require them to give state courts a full opportunity to address constitutional claims before presenting those claims to a federal court,boerckel,d.
here,nowaczyk filed his petition in federal district court on june,roughly two months after the statute of limitations began to run.the petition stated four claims that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction that the jury was permitted to consider prejudicial evidence that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and that he was denied the right to a neutral judge both at trial and on appeal.unlike the first three claims,nowaczyk had not raised the issue of judicial bias on direct appeal from his state conviction.in aedpa parlance,therefore,that claim was unexhausted.perhaps anticipating that problem,nowaczyk filed an application for state review on october,in which he presented his claim of judicial bias.he filed a second such application on may,raising a claim of double jeopardy that was not included in his petition.
on july,the district court dismissed nowaczyk petition without prejudice.the court noted that nowaczyk first application for state review was then pending before the new hampshire supreme court.it concluded,therefore,that nowaczyk had failed to exhaust all available state remedies as to his claim of judicial bias,and dismissed the petition on that ground.
nowaczyk filed a notice of appeal from the district court decision on july.approximately one week later,on july,the new hampshire supreme court entered its final decision rejecting nowaczyk judicial bias claim.citing that decision,nowaczyk asked the federal district court to reconsider its judgment.he argued that dismissal no longer was appropriate now that all of the claims presented in his petition were fully exhausted.the district court denied the motion by margin order,reasoning that nowaczyk pending appeal before us rendered his motion for reconsideration moot.
nowaczyk then filed a motion in this court for summary reversal.we granted the motion,explaining that,e ven though nowaczyk appeal had been noticed when the motion for reconsideration was filed,the motion was not entirely moot.the district court still had authority to review the motion and to notify this court if it was inclined to grant relief.accordingly,we remanded to the district court so that it could address the merits of nowaczyk motion for reconsideration.we emphasized that the court should consider whether,given the time limitations imposed by aedpa,dismissal still was appropriate in nowaczyk case.
on remand,the matter was referred to a magistrate judge,see b b,who recommended that nowaczyk motion for reconsideration be granted the magistrate judge reasoned that,since nowaczyk petition was no longer mixed,but presented only exhausted claims,it was not subject to dismissal.he rejected the state argument that dismissal was warranted because nowaczyk second application for state review raising the double jeopardy claim still was pending before the state courts.although principles of comity and judicial economy mandate dismissal of any unexhausted claims,see rose lundy,d,the magistrate judge found those principles inapplicable in nowaczyk case,since the state courts have already had an opportunity to consider each of the issues raised in the federal petition.because the claims presented in nowaczyk petition were fully exhausted and properly before the district court,the magistrate judge concluded that dismissal would be inconsistent with the imperative that underscores all habeas corpus proceedings ensuring that federal constitutional claims may be reviewed promptly in a federal forum if state remedies have been exhausted.see braden judicial cir,d explaining that the exhaustion doctrine reflects a careful balance between important interests of federalism and the need to preserve the writ of habeas corpus as a swift and imperative remedy in all cases of illegal restraint or confinement internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court rejected the magistrate judge recommendation and dismissed nowaczyk petition without prejudice.the court agreed that nowaczyk petition presented only exhausted claims.however,it concluded that dismissal was appropriate because of the pendency of nowaczyk second application for state review.that application contained a challenge to the same conviction nowaczyk sought to overturn through the federal habeas proceedings,and nowaczyk did not raise any unusual circumstances about the state court actions,such as extraordinary delay,that would justify concurrent actions.in the district court view,the principles of comity discussed in rose counseled in favor of defer ring to the state court action in such a case.
the court then turned to the question of aedpa statute of limitations.it assumed,without deciding,that since nowaczyk had not attempted to appeal his conviction to the united states supreme court,he was not entitled to the benefit of the period for seeking a writ of certiorari.accordingly,the court concluded that the statute of limitations began to run on january,date of the new hampshire supreme court final decision in nowaczyk direct appeal.
the next question was the extent to which the statute of limitations was tolled by nowaczyk various filings.the district court determined that nowaczyk dismissed without prejudice on the ground of not itself toll the limitations period for any petition.however,under aedpa,the statute of limitations would be tolled whenever a challenge to the pertinent judgment or claim was pending.d.the parties agreed that the statute was tolled during the pendency of nowaczyk first application for state review,which raised the judicial bias claim presented in his petition.the more difficult question was whether his second application had a tolling effect even though it concerned a claim that was not included in the petition.the district court answered that question in the affirmative,reasoning that the second application challenged nowaczyk conviction the pertinent judgment for purposes of his therefore satisfied aedpa tolling provision.
thus,the court found that the statute of limitations had run between january,and october,when nowaczyk filed his first application for state review,and then was tolled by the still pending state proceedings.because nowaczyk would have some time,but not the full year,to refile his petition at the conclusion of the state proceedings,the district court concluded that dismissal still was appropriate.nevertheless,it ended its opinion with a warning once nowaczyk pertinent state court proceedings are concluded,the limitations period will again begin to run until it quickly expires.therefore,if issues remain at the conclusion of the state court proceedings that are appropriate for habeas relief,nowaczyk should be mindful of the diminished limitation period that remains.
the district court entered judgment dismissing nowaczyk petition without prejudice on march.nowaczyk promptly appealed to this court.on march,the new hampshire supreme court rejected nowaczyk double jeopardy claim.that decision marked the end of nowaczyk second application for state review,and therefore started aedpa statute of limitations running once again.the same day,nowaczyk filed a motion asking permission to supplement the record on appeal to reflect the fact that he no longer had any claims pending before the state courts.we granted that motion by order dated april.
after an initial round of briefing by the nowaczyk still proceeding pro was apparent that one of the issues on appeal was whether the district court erred in concluding that nowaczyk petition did not operate to toll aedpa statute of limitations.the supreme court had granted certiorari to address that question in duncan walker,and we decided to stay consideration of nowaczyk appeal until the court issued its opinion.
the supreme court decided duncan in june of,holding that the statute of limitations is tolled only by applications for state review,and that federal habeas petitions do not have any tolling effect,d.the upshot of that decision for nowaczyk was clear if we affirmed the dismissal of his petition by the district court in march of,the fact that it had been pending before the federal courts for roughly four years would have no impact on the statute of limitations.absent equitable tolling,the aedpa limitations period would have expired for nowaczyk in september of,and any subsequent petition would be time barred.
following the supreme court decision in duncan,we appointed counsel for nowaczyk,ordered supplemental briefing,and scheduled oral argument.we instructed counsel to focus on three questions whether the district court erred in holding that nowaczyk second application for state review tolled aedpa statute of limitations whether the district court abused its discretion in dismissing,rather than staying,nowaczyk petition,given the statute of limitations concerns and whether,if we concluded that dismissal was appropriate,nowaczyk would be entitled to equitable tolling when he attempted to refile his habeas petition.
in its supplemental brief and again at oral argument,the state conceded that nowaczyk second application for state review tolled the limitations period.see tillema long,cir holding that aedpa period of limitation is tolled during the pendency of a state application challenging the pertinent judgment,even if the particular application does not include a claim later asserted in the federal habeas petition accord carter litscher,cir same.but see austin mitchell,cir adopting contrary view.accordingly,we focus on the question whether the district court should have stayed the federal proceedings rather than dismissing nowaczyk petition outright.we conclude that,under the circumstances of this case,the district court abused its discretion in dismissing nowaczyk petition.accordingly,we need not decide whether the doctrine of equitable tolling is available under aedpa generally,see,donovan,at reserving the question,and,if so,whether it would apply in this case.
before we can reach the issue of stay versus dismissal,we first must address a threshold question did the district court err in delaying its decision through either means put differently,was the court obligated to adjudicate nowaczyk claims immediately we turn to that question.
delay immediate adjudication 
in rose lundy,d,the supreme court held that mixed is,those containing both exhausted and unexhausted be dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies.the court reasoned that such a rule would further the policy of comity underlying the exhaustion doctrine.id.at.requiring total exhaustion would encourage state prisoners to seek full relief first from the state courts,thus giving those courts the first opportunity to review all claims of constitutional error.id.at.moreover,federal claims that have been fully exhausted in state courts will more often be accompanied by a complete factual record to aid the federal courts in their review.id.at.
the district court relied on that same policy of comity as a basis for dismissing nowaczyk petition.it reasoned that,although the claims presented in the petition had been fully exhausted,the fact that nowaczyk still was challenging his conviction in state court brought his case within rose purview.the court observed that the comity doctrine not only protect s the state court concurrent jurisdiction to enforce federal law it also prevent s disruption of state judicial proceedings by teaching that one court should defer action on causes properly within its jurisdiction until the courts of another sovereignty with concurrent powers,and already cognizant of the litigation,have had an opportunity to pass on the matter.quoting rose,at quoting darr burford.because the state courts had not yet had a full opportunity to pass on one of nowaczyk challenges to his double jeopardy district court felt itself bound to defer action on the related challenges contained in the petition.
nowaczyk argues that rose does not support the district court decision to dismiss his petition.he maintains that the rule of total exhaustion is not based on avoiding parallel proceedings.rather,nowaczyk argues,rose core holding was that federal courts should not grant relief on claims that have not yet been presented to the state courts.consistent with that view,rose directed district courts to offer a choice to state prisoners with mixed petitions they could either accept dismissal without prejudice and return to state court to exhaust the claims presented in their petitions,or they could amend those petitions to remove any unexhausted claims.see rose,at.if the prisoner chose the latter option,the district court would adjudicate the remaining exhausted claims immediately,notwithstanding the fact that the other unexhausted claims might be pending before the state courts at the same time.
we agree that rose does not require the district court to withhold decision in cases such as nowaczyk.see hurd mondragon,cir concluding that rose is not controlling where the state prisoner has exhausted his state remedies on the claims presented in his petition,but he has other claims that have not been exhausted jones parke,cir same.if anything,it points in the opposite direction.rose held that a state prisoner who has both exhausted and unexhausted claims can obtain prompt federal review of the exhausted claims if he files a mixed petition and then amends it to remove the unexhausted claims.see at lacy gabriel,cir emphasizing that,under rose,the petitioner was entitled all along to present only a part of the claims available to him.we see no reason why a prisoner with a mixed petition should be better off than one whose petition contains only exhausted claims.but that is the oddity implicit in the district court reasoning.under rose,the state prisoner with a mixed petition is entitled to proceed with his exhausted claims if he agrees to amend his petition.under the district court approach,however,the state prisoner with a petition containing only exhausted claims is forbidden to proceed with those claims until he adjudicates any unexhausted claims in state court.that distinction makes little sense,and we do not believe rose compels it.
in addition to rose,the district court also relied on cases such as sherwood tomkins,cir.there,the petitioner had been convicted of manslaughter in state court and,in the course of appealing that conviction,lodged several requests for appointed counsel and a free transcript.the state courts denied his requests and,while his state appeal still was pending,sherwood filed a petition challenging those denials.the ninth circuit held that sherwood had failed to exhaust his state remedies with respect to his claim of indigency,and affirmed the dismissal of the petition on that ground.see id.at.the court went on to note,in dicta,that w hen,as in the present case,an appeal of a state criminal conviction is pending,a habeas corpus petitioner must await the outcome of his appeal before his state remedies are exhausted,even where the issue to be challenged in the writ of habeas corpus has been finally settled in the state courts.id.at.
the ninth circuit reached a similar time not in edelbacher calderon,cir,another case cited by the district court.edelbacher state conviction was affirmed on direct appeal,but his death sentence was vacated.before the retrial had begun,edelbacher filed a petition challenging his conviction.the ninth circuit concluded that the petition was premature,holding that the district court should not entertain a federal habeas proceeding in the absence of a penalty phase judgment or until the existence of extremely unusual circumstances warrant s an exception.id.at.
we are not persuaded that sherwood and edelbacher support the district court conclusion that dismissal was required in nowaczyk case.the dicta in sherwood suggests that a state prisoner has not exhausted state remedies until he completes his direct appeal from his conviction and sentence.it therefore has little relevance here nowaczyk completed his direct appeal before he filed his petition,and the district court did not suggest that dismissal was warranted because of any failure to exhaust state remedies.
nor do we believe that edelbacher stands for the broad rule that federal courts must dismiss petitions whenever the petitioner is in the process of adjudicating other,related claims in the state courts.as we explained above,such a rule would be inconsistent with rose,and we doubt the ninth circuit intended to adopt it sub silentio the better view is that edelbacher held precisely what it said that,in the absence of unusual circumstances,a state prisoner can not proceed with his petition when the state trial court has not yet rendered a decision as to the proper penalty obviously,that rule is not implicated here.
in any the district court circuits have rejected the broad rule that a state prisoner can not adjudicate his claims under when other claims have not yet been decided by the state courts.see,pringle court of common pleas,cir holding that the district court erred in concluding that the state prisoner could not proceed under on exhausted claims regarding her conviction until she exhausted other claims regarding her sentence lacy,at holding that the district court can not transform a fully exhausted petition into a mixed one by raising an unexhausted claim sua sponte williams maggio,cir similar butler rose,cir similar.thus,we adhere to our initial view that the district court was not required to delay its decision on nowaczyk claims until the conclusion of the state proceedings.see jones wainwright,cir holding that petition need not be dismissed when the petitioner does not urge unexhausted grounds for relief but the state claims that such grounds may be asserted in the future united states ex rel.boyance myers,cir it is no bar to federal adjudication of the merits of the present claim that a separate claim for relief on a different ground is pending in a state court.
the question remains,however,whether such a delay was permitted.we hold that it was.see calderon united states dist,cir t he fact that the district court was not required to hold the state prisoner exhausted petition in abeyance does not necessarily imply that the district court was without discretion to do so.as the district court pointed out,if nowaczyk had prevailed on his double jeopardy claim,there likely would have been no need to continue with the federal habeas proceedings.considerations of judicial economy support the district court decision to withhold decision on claims that could have been mooted by the pending state proceedings.moreover,although rose policy of comity did not require the district court to defer action until the conclusion of the state proceedings,at,such a delay certainly is consistent with that policy 
not surprisingly,therefore,other courts to consider the question have held that rose does not foreclose the option of delaying consideration of exhausted claims pending resolution of other,unexhausted claims.in thompson wainwright,cir,for example,the eleventh circuit held that the district court acted within its discretion in staying decision on the state prisoner contained only exhausted the petitioner presented an additional,unexhausted claim to the state courts.the court rejected as patently without merit the state argument that the district court was obligated by rose to decide the unexhausted claims immediately.id.at.the district court has the power to control its docket.so long as it abides by the limits of discretion,it can leave a habeas petition dormant on its docket while the petitioner presents to the state court unexhausted claims.id.
similarly,in calderon,the ninth circuit reasoned that a district court has discretion to stay a petition which it may validly consider on the merits.at quoting greenawalt stewart,cir.it rejected the view that rose stood in the way of such a stay,explaining that the court in rose did not intimate that those petitioners who opted for amendment were required to proceed posthaste on their remaining claims.id.at see also burris farley,cir indicating that district court can stay decision on exhausted claims until state prisoner exhausts any remaining issues fetterly paskett,cir holding that district court abused its discretion in denying the state prisoner request that it stay decision on his petition so that he could exhaust a claim in the state courts.
these cases support the district court decision to delay adjudication of nowaczyk claims until the resolution of the related state proceedings.we conclude that such delay was permissible here.we turn,therefore,to the question of what form the delay should have taken.
stay dismissal 
it appears that the question of stay versus dismissal in cases involving only claims is one of first impression.however,several courts have addressed a related question the propriety of dismissal in cases involving mixed petitions.those cases are instructive here.
when rose was decided,there was no time limit on petitions filed under.thus,there was little cost to a dismissal without state prisoner could refile the petition at any time following exhaustion of his federal claims.aedpa changed matters.its statute of limitations has rendered outright dismissal perilous to some litigants,because petitioners may find themselves when they attempt to resubmit their exhausted claims to the district court.anthony cambra,cir.recognizing the risks attendant to dismissal in the world,several courts have concluded that a stay is the right step to take in cases involving mixed petitions.newell hanks,cir zarvela artuz,cir concluding that the enactment of aedpa warrants some adjustment in the requirement of rose lundy that mixed petitions be dismissed in their entirety,and that,i n many cases,a stay will be preferable see also duncan,at stevens,concurring i n our world there is no reason why a district court should not retain jurisdiction over a meritorious claim and stay further proceedings pending the complete exhaustion of state remedies.but see graham johnson,cir disapproving of stays of mixed petitions.indeed,there is a growing consensus that a stay is required when dismissal could jeopardize the petitioner ability to obtain federal review.see,zarvela,at holding that a stay will be the only appropriate course where outright dismissal could jeopardize the timeliness of any subsequent petition freeman page,cir d ismissal is not appropriate when that step could jeopardize the timeliness of a collateral attack.see also palmer carlton,cir noting that the second circuit approach in zarvela is eminently reasonable.
although none of our cases has turned on the question of stay versus dismissal,we have indicated that district courts presented with mixed petitions should take seriously any request for a stay.in neverson bissonnette,cir,we noted that the petitioner could have improved his position by requesting that the district court stay,rather than dismiss,petition,this will be the preferable course in many cases involving mixed it may be the only appropriate course in cases in which an outright dismissal threatens to imperil the timeliness of a collateral attack.we reiterated that view in delaney matesanz,cir,where we especially commend ed the use of stays in instances in which the original habeas petition,though unexhausted,is timely filed,but there is a realistic danger that a second petition,filed after exhaustion has occurred,will be untimely.
the state points out that neither neverson nor delaney compels a stay in the circumstances of this case.when the district court entered judgment in march of,the statute of limitations was still being tolled by nowaczyk second application for state review,and several months would remain in the limitations period when the clock started running again moreover,the district court warned nowaczyk that he would need to return promptly to federal court as soon as the state courts decided the double jeopardy claims presented in his second application for review.accordingly,if nowaczyk petition still had been mixed,neverson and delaney probably would not have prevented the district court from dismissing it.
but therein lies the problem.in both neverson and delaney,the district court was presented with a petition that contained unexhausted claims.thus,it did not have the option of adjudicating the petition immediately.unless the petitioner agreed to amend the petition to drop the unexhausted claims,the district court had no choice but to delay decision until the prisoner completed the process of exhaustion.
the situation here is critically different.nowaczyk petition contained only exhausted claims.nothing prevented the district court from adjudicating those claims immediately indeed,nowaczyk urged it to do so.although we have determined that the district court did not abuse its discretion in withholding decision while nowaczyk second application for state relief was pending,it bears emphasis cases involving mixed delay was not required here.it is one thing to say that a district court may choose between a stay and dismissal when a flaw in the petition makes it necessary to delay decision through some means.it is quite another to say that the court may dismiss a petition that is properly before it and ready for decision.
the state has not even attempted to defend that proposition.instead,relying on cases such as sherwood,it seeks to show that nowaczyk petition was not,in fact,ready for decision.we rejected that view above.we explained that the district court decision to delay action on nowaczyk petition was not compelled by rose or by the principles of comity on which the total exhaustion rule is based.that decision was permissible,however,as an exercise of the district court power to control its docket,thompson,at,and in the interest of comity.the question here is whether that power to delay embraces the discretion to dismiss an action properly before the court and within its statutory jurisdiction.we think not.
we conclude that w hen unusual circumstances rather than a flaw in the petition itself make it imprudent to address the petition immediately,the collateral attack should be stayed rather than dismissed.post gilmore,cir.this case is unusual because nowaczyk was in the process of adjudicating his double jeopardy claim in the state courts,yet made no effort to include that claim in his petition.he expressed no interest in delaying the federal proceedings until the resolution of his second application for state review nor did he seek to amend his petition to include the claim of double jeopardy.rather,he was ready and willing to adjudicate the claims presented in that petition immediately.
thus,nowaczyk case differs from those discussed in the previous section,which affirm the district court discretion to delay resolution of a petition so that the petitioner can exhaust other claims in state court and,if necessary,amend his federal petition to include them.it is notable that none of those cases so much as suggested that dismissal was a viable option.rather,the courts clearly understood the choice to be between immediate adjudication or a stay.see,anthony,at our precedent unequivocally authorizes district courts to stay fully exhausted federal petitions emphasis added thompson,at affirming district court decision to stay decision on exhausted claims although the district court also could have denied a delay and decided the issues that were alleged in the petition.if outright dismissal of a petition is disfavored even when the petitioner asked the court to withhold decision on his claims,it is even more inappropriate where,as here,the petitioner resisted any such delay.see jones,at holding that district court erred in dismissing a petition on the ground that other,unexhausted,claims might be asserted in the future myers,at holding that district court erred in dismissing,rather than adjudicating,a claim where another claim was still pending before the state courts.
the reason for such a rule is fairly simple.although habeas relief is an equitable remedy,a district judge may not remit petitioners to their other remedies,the way a judge may decline to issue declaratory relief.post,at.rather,like other civil actions,petitions are governed by the norm that a district court must exercise its full statutory jurisdiction.see also colorado river water conservation dist.united states,d noting the virtually unflagging obligation of the federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction given them.that norm is violated when the district court dismisses a petition that is properly before it and within its jurisdiction under aedpa.a stay does not suffer from the same infirmity.because the district court retains jurisdiction over the petition during the course of a stay,that procedure does not involve the abdication of federal jurisdiction,but only the postponement of its exercise.harrison naacp,d discussing a form of abstention under which the district court retains jurisdiction over the federal action pending proceedings in state court 
of course,the norm that a district court must exercise its full jurisdiction is just can give way in the face of countervailing demands.see,colorado river,at explaining that exceptional circumstances may permit abstention from the duty of a district court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it.thus,we do not adopt a rule that a district court may never dismiss a petition.however,in order to justify a departure from the heavy obligation to exercise jurisdiction,id.at,there must be some compelling reason to pref
