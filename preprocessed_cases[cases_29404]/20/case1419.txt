this case presents the federal courts of appeals with an issue of first impression.can the united states parole commission commission use videoconferencing to conduct parole determination proceedings habeas petitioner sammy terrell challenged this practice as a violation of e and his due process rights under the fifth amendment,and he prevailed in the district court on due process grounds.we conclude that the statute requires parole determination proceedings to be held in person,and so for the following reasons,affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
sammy terrell is a federal prisoner who was,at the time of his petition,serving his life sentence in marquette,michigan terrell robbed eleven banks.in,he pleaded guilty to three bank robberies and was incarcerated.from to,while in prison,terrell committed misconducts,one of which was the murder of a fellow inmate in.his conviction for first degree murder resulted in a life sentence.since that time,terrell has maintained clear conduct,received favorable performance evaluations for his job assignments,and written a book on resolving drug and gang violence.
in,terrell was given his initial parole determination proceeding the commission continued him to a reconsideration hearing in june.interim parole hearings which did not change his reconsideration hearing place in,and he waived his interim hearing scheduled for september of.terrell was scheduled for an interim hearing by video conference on june.he requested a continuance,which the commission granted.
terrell and prisoner richard thompson filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus in the eastern district of michigan on june,asking the court to order parole determination hearings.on february,a magistrate judge recommended that the court deny terrell petition.terrell was given an interim hearing by video conference on may.on september,the district court rejected the recommendation of the magistrate judge and held that videoconferencing violated the prisoner due process rights.the district court then ordered an parole determination hearing for terrell.the government moved for a stay to ensure appellate review,and the district court denied the motion.on september,this court granted a stay of the district court order to give terrell an hearing to ensure appellate review of the matter.
the parole commission reorganization act of,stat,enacted into law,which includes e and the requirement that t he prisoner shall be allowed to appear and testify on his own behalf at the parole determination hearing.the sentencing reform act of,stat,replaced parole with supervised release.however,prisoners who committed offenses prior to november,remained eligible for parole according to the reform act system.see vershish parole comm n,cir.congress has repeatedly passed legislation to keep the reform act parole system alive for those prisoners who committed crimes prior to november.the latest is the united states parole commission extension act of,stat,which extended the life of the parole system until november.in between and,no amendments were made to the text of or any related statute in a way that might affect its meaning.
until,the commission conducted all parole determination hearings in person at the institutions where the prisoners were incarcerated.in early,the commission began a pilot project to conduct parole release hearings by video conference at a few institutions.the commission published notice of the project in the federal register under the title,paroling,recommitting,and supervising federal prisoners prisoners serving sentences under the united states and district of columbia codes.the commission also promulgated rules allowing for videoconferencing,and eliminated the in person requirement for hearings by amending a.the proffered reason was to reduce travel costs and conserve the time of its hearing examiners without diminishing the prisoner ability to effectively participate in the hearing.
in april of,the commission announced that the pilot program was a success.paroling,recommitting,and supervising federal prisoners prisoners serving sentences under the united states and district of columbia codes.april.the commission concluded that the prisoner ability to effectively participate in the hearing ha d not been diminished by videoconferencing.id.video and audio transmissions were clear and the hearings were seldom interrupted by technical difficulties.id.the commission then extended the use of videoconferencing to parole revocation hearings and amended accordingly.id.the question before this court is the validity of using videoconferencing in parole determination hearings in light of the statutory requirement of e and fifth amendment due process.
jurisdiction 
before we address the habeas petition on its merits,we must first conclude that we have jurisdiction to entertain the petition.neither of the parties addressed the jurisdiction of the court,presumably because they both sought to have the substantive issue decided.the district court did not address jurisdiction.however,we have an obligation to raise issues of jurisdiction sua sponte.smith ohio dep t of rehab.and,cir.
terrell commenced his claim by petitioning the district court to enter an order,pursuant to,to require the commission to give him a live parole hearing.terrell contends that the commission violated statutory law and his constitutional right to due process when it denied his request for an hearing.he does not contend that remedying the commission procedural violation will necessarily entitle him to an earlier release from custody.release on parole is discretionary.in,in wright bd.of parole,cir,we held that a federal prisoner could challenge the process used to make his denial of parole determination as part of a habeas petition.id.at see also kellogg shoemaker,cir noting that,in the future,any remedy a member of the class has for the unconstitutional application of the old parole procedures must be obtained through habeas corpus.the petitioner argued that the proceeding denying release on parole was flawed in its use of guidelines and the lack of a sufficient explanation.id.he requested a new hearing,or in the alternative,release on parole.id.we held that such a challenge was cognizable under as a challenge to the execution of his sentence.id.at.thus,our holding in wright indicates that terrell can proceed under.
before and since that time,the supreme court has made a number of decisions regarding the relationship between habeas and,starting in with preiser rodriguez,d,and continuing with wolff mcdonnell,d,heck humphrey,d,edwards balisok,d,and wilkinson dotson,d,aff g,cir en banc.the court in preiser,heck,and balisok held that a challenge,respectively,of a prisoner underlying conviction or sentence,that necessarily demonstrated the invalidity of the confinement legality,or that would result in the restoration of credits which necessarily shortens the duration of confinement,can only be brought under habeas.dotson,at.in wolff and dotson,the court held that challenges by state prisoners to procedures that would only lead to new proceedings,discretionary and not necessarily spelling immediate release or a shorter duration of confinement,may be brought under.dotson,at.
a question that arises from this line of cases is whether habeas and or the equivalent for a federal prisoner are mutually exclusive actions.the circuits appear to be in conflict on this question.in wright,we held that the claim before us could be brought as a habeas action.in dotson,the supreme court held that a claim,a constitutional challenge to parole procedures that would at most order a new discretionary hearing,akin to the claim before us,was properly brought under.if the preiser line of cases,decided since wright,also indicated that the actions are mutually exclusive,then we must conclude that we lack jurisdiction to entertain terrell habeas petition.
other courts of appeals have suggested that habeas and claims and the equivalent for a federal prisoner are mutually exclusive the seventh circuit has held that a federal prisoner claiming a right to release on parole must use or for a state prisoner but a prisoner claiming that parole officials are apt to use incorrect rules when resolving a future application must use the administrative procedure act apa or for a state prisoner.richmond scibana,cir.the supreme court decision in dotson suggests that terrell claim falls on the apa side of the line,assuming such a line,which would preclude a challenge under the seventh circuit holdings that those actions are mutually exclusive.
the ninth circuit rejects the mutual exclusivity of such claims.see docken chase,cir.the court in docken pointed out that the question of the relationship between habeas and relief has only explicitly come up before in converse form whether claims are not cognizable under because their resolution will necessarily impact the fact and duration of confinement.id.the court conclusion after looking at the preiser line of cases and its own precedents.section intrudes into the more specific realm of habeas,not the other way around.id.at.therefore,only for claims falling in the core of necessarily implicating the fact or duration of confinement as delineated by preiser and its habeas provide the exclusive action otherwise,there exist claims that can both be brought under habeas and or an equivalent civil action.
to understand the reasoning of the seventh and ninth circuits,we must first examine the various claims that can be brought under a habeas petition.sections and provide the habeas statutory scheme for federal prisoners.wright,at.section provides the primary avenue of relief for federal prisoners claiming the right to release as a result of an unlawful sentence.a.the savings clause of allows for a action if is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of the detention.witham united states,cir quoting e.construing the savings clause,courts have uniformly held that claims asserted by federal prisoners that seek to challenge their convictions or imposition of their sentence shall be filed in the jurisdiction of the sentencing court under,and that claims seeking to challenge the execution or manner in which the sentence is served shall be filed in the court having jurisdiction over the prisoner custodian under.charles chandler,cir per curiam internal citations omitted see also doganiere united states,cir action challenging the parole commission discretionary decision in setting petitioner term of parole should have been brought under hajduk united states,cir holding that challenge to the lawfulness of the federal parole commission actions in retroactively applying parole guidelines must be brought under and not.section also exists to provide a remedy to test the legality of detention where is otherwise inadequate.see,witham,at.
because state prisoners contest the fact or duration of custody when they challenge their convictions,their sentences,or administrative orders revoking credits or equivalent devices,they must seek habeas corpus according to the seventh circuit analysis distinguishing those mutually exclusive domains of habeas and.moran sondalle,cir per curiam.indeed,the seventh circuit must be correct that such claims can be brought only under habeas as determined by the preiser line of cases.dotson,at.in that respect,the seventh and ninth circuits agree.however,the ninth circuit envisions a class of suits outside of the core habeas claims identified in preiser.docken,at.of course,such claims would be claims challenging the execution of the prisoner sentence,not claims challenging the imposition or duration of the prisoner sentence.that captures the dispute between the seventh circuit and the ninth circuit.the seventh circuit considers the claims the supreme court held must be brought as habeas actions pursuant to the preiser line of under or coextensive with the claims that can be brought under habeas in its totality.in other words,there are no suits outside of the core habeas claims identified in preiser,docken,at,for which jurisdiction might overlap with or the apa.
the supreme court opinion affirming our en banc decision in dotson captures this debate.the majority held that challenges to parole procedures that would not necessarily spell speedier release and claimed future relief which,if successful,would not necessarily imply the invalidity of confinement or shorten its duration were yet more distant from the core of habeas within which habeas is the exclusive available action.at.therefore,the challenge could be brought under.id.justice scalia joined by justice thomas,concurring,wrote separately to emphasize that he believed that such claims could be brought under but could not be brought under habeas.id.at.scalia,concurring.he quoted the seventh circuit for the proposition that permissible habeas relief authorizes a quantum change in the level of custody.id.at.quoting graham broglin,cir.t he mandating of a new parole hearing that may or may not result in release with the specification of the procedures to be followed can not be brought under a habeas proceeding because it neither terminates custody,accelerates the future date of release from custody,nor reduces the level of custody.id.under the view justice scalia shares with the seventh circuit,habeas is the exclusive available action for the domain over which habeas is available,which is for claims that would change the level of custody,shorten its duration,or terminate it completely.the majority left open the question we have here of whether the procedural challenge could be brought under both and habeas.
our cases have held that the action before us can both be brought under habeas and the equivalent civil action.the upshot of this is that neither the seventh circuit reasoning nor justice scalia reasoning concurring in dotson applies here because both would deny the existence of the situation before us where a challenge to procedures used in the administration of discretionary parole falls under habeas.assuming such a situation,the ninth circuit is correct that nothing in the preiser line of cases suggests that wright has been overruled for the mere reason that the court has decided that the claim before us also falls under the equivalent of for federal prisoners.thus,we conclude we have jurisdiction to entertain terrell habeas petition.
ii.statutory interpretation 
terrell has raised both statutory and constitutional challenges to the commission procedures.we address the statutory challenge first.lyng nw.indian cemetery protective ass n,d a fundamental and longstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.
the district court granted summary judgment to terrell after concluding that appear in e unambiguously required an hearing.the government argues on appeal that appear is ambiguous,and therefore,the commission should receive deference as to its interpretation of the statute that videoconferencing is permissible.the inquiry we must conduct is governed by chevron,natural res.def.council,d.if the statute is unambiguous,the unambiguous meaning controls.waterways alliance johnson,cir citing christensen harris county,d.if the statute is ambiguous,then we defer to the agency interpretation of the statute if it is permissible.id.in this case,if we were to conclude that the statute is unambiguous,an hearing would be required otherwise,we would defer to the agency interpretation that videoconferencing satisfies the appear requirement.therefore,whether the statute is ambiguous or unambiguous drives the outcome of this case.
the government acknowledges that when congress enacted the parole commission reorganization act and e more than years ago in,it assumed that parole release hearings would be conducted with hearing examiners and prisoners present together at correctional institutions as part of hearings.that,however,should not preclude the commission from being able to adapt to subsequent technological developments such as videoconferencing,the government argues.
in other words,at the time congress enacted e,the meaning of appear was unambiguous.subsequent technological developments made appear ambiguous because videoconferencing offered an alternative to hearings in which all participating persons would still be visible to and be able to interact with each other.the problem with this argument is that statutory ambiguity must be determined at the time the language was enacted into law.see carcieri salazar,d citing director,office of workers comp.programs greenwich collieries,d we begin with the ordinary meaning of the word now,as understood when the indian reorganization act was enacted,in,for the purposes of chevron.mci telecomm.v.at t,d citing perrin united states,d the most relevant time for determining a statutory term meaning is when the statute in which the term appears became law.at the time appear pursuant to e was enacted into law,videoconferencing did not exist and,unambiguously,appear required an hearing no subsequent technological development can change that fact see also texas united states,cir holding that court decisions subsequent to the enactment of a statute can not have an effect on statutory ambiguity a statute ambiguity is set when it is enacted and when statutes are subsequently added or amended,altering the statutory scheme in which the statute at issue sits.
the split of the chevron is meant to determine those aspects of an agency authority in which it has discretion to carry out policy as it sees fit.smiley citibank south dakota,d citing chevron,at.where congress has unambiguously made clear what it requires,an agency does not have any discretion.id.this makes clear that ambiguity for the purposes of the chevron can not emerge over time subsequent to the enactment of the relevant language because delegated authority can not emerge out of authority that congress did not delegate in the first instance.
fashioning policies in response to events that were unforeseeable when the legislation was written is one of the primary functions of executive agencies,independent bankers ass marine midland bank,cir citing am.trucking ass ns united states,but that statement only applies to delegated authority.put differently,the above statement militates in favor of deference to an agency interpretation as part of chevron step two it does not help us choose between deciding the case based on chevron step one or step two.id.at determining that the language of the statute is ambiguous and so turning to the question of whether the court should defer to the agency interpretation of the statute.when the statute is unambiguous,there has been no delegation to the agency to interpret the statute and therefore the agency interpretation deserves no consideration at all,much less deference.united states mead,d quoting chevron,at.w hen congress has explicitly left a gap for an agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation internal quotation marks omitted.if unforeseeable events change an area in which congress has not delegated authority to the agency,only congress can amend the statute to respond to those unforeseen events.see bd.of governors of the fed.reserve dimension fin,d.
to determine the unambiguously expressed intent of congress at the time of enactment in,we look to the plain meaning of the statute.k mart cartier,d.in ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.id.citing bethesda hosp.ass bowen,d.as did the court in carcieri,we first look to the ordinary meaning of the word at issue,and then we read the word in the context of the statutory scheme at issue.at.
a word ordinary meaning is often determined by reference to dictionaries.see mci,at.passenger boston maine,d.the government argues that t he primary definition of appear is to become or be visible.see the american heritage dictionary of the english language ed the oxford dictionary and thesaurus.at the time the statute was enacted,this unambiguously meant that the prisoner appeared in person in front of the hearing examiner because no technology existed to project the prisoner visage into the room with the hearing examiner.the only way for a prisoner to be visible to the hearing examiner was by sharing the same physical presence the fourth definition of appear is to present oneself formally before an authority or tribunal the oxford dictionary and thesaurus see also the american heritage dictionary of the english language ed including t o present oneself formally before a court as defendant,plaintiff,or counsel among the definitions of appear.in,to appear meant to be physically present.
the government argues that the district court erred in analogizing appear and testify with formal trial proceedings.citing legislative history,it points out that a prisoner procedural rights at a parole determination proceeding should not be construed as analogous to formal judicial process.see,cong.at.analogizing appear as it is used in e with other uses of appear as they appear in the united states code might fail for this reason.but the lack of a desire for formal judicial processes for parole determination proceedings does not then mean that congress could not include some elements of a formal judicial process into a parole determination hearing,nor does it contradict that the plain meaning of appear in e requires the prisoner to be physically present at a live hearing.furthermore,the house conference report focused on its rejection of a parole determination process akin to a formal judicial proceeding specifically with respect to representation of the prisoner and testimony at the hearing.through the crafting of the statute text,congress dictates the elements of a formal judicial process that it will include in the parole determination proceeding,that which it might exclude,and that which it might leave up to the agency to decide.
the statutory scheme supports this interpretation ambiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context,brown gardner,d,even where courts have emphasized dictionary definitions to discern a word plain meaning,appoloni united states,cir.e states that a prisoner shall be allowed to appear and testify on his own behalf at the parole determination proceeding.the prisoner is not just to appear,he is to appear at the proceeding.this disposes of the government argument that a secondary meaning of appear is to present oneself formally before a court or body such that an attorney makes an appearance in this court by signed document listing her address,stating that she is a member of the bar,and asserting that she represents a party in a particular case,all of which occur without the attorney appearing in person.the statute does not simply provide for a prisoner to appear,he is allowed to appear and testify at the proceeding.
b states that at least thirty days prior to any parole determination proceeding,the prisoner shall be provided with written notice of the time and place of the proceeding emphasis added.this provides for one place for all persons participating in the proceeding at which the persons are to appear,rather than allowing persons to be physically present at multiple different places but connected by videoconferencing.video conferences are held at a particular time,not at a particular time and place.this is not a mere linguistic trick to be in one place as contemplated by the statute means to share the same physical presence.therefore,all of the parties are to appear at the place where the proceeding will be held as contemplated by the statute in.
the power of the commission to delegate to hearing examiners any powers necessary to conduct hearings and proceedings,c,does not suggest that the commission can allow videoconferencing where parole hearings are required by the statutory scheme.in other words,the commission can delegate powers to hearing examiners that it can exercise itself.this provision only describes the relationship between the commission and the hearing examiners,not the extent to the commission power writ large.c does not facilitate the interpretation that the commission can prescribe videoconferencing for parole determination hearings.
assuming con
