petitioner,elvis martinez,was convicted of two state drug offenses for distribution of a small quantity of marihuana the question before us is whether,under lopez gonzales,d,these state convictions are aggravated felonies under the ina.to determine whether the state convictions count as aggravated felonies,we must decide whether they are the equivalent of federal felony drug trafficking,under the controlled substances act csa,see a,b d,or rather are the equivalent of a federal misdemeanor in light of the csa mitigating exception that punishes distribution of a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration as a misdemeanor,see b.because the state conviction could have been for nonremunerative transfer of as little as two grams of marihuana,we hold that under our categorical approach,petitioner conviction is the equivalent of a federal misdemeanor under the csa and not an aggravated felony.
factual and procedural background 
prior criminal convictions 
elvis martinez is a native of the dominican republic.he has been a lawful permanent resident of the united states since.on march,martinez was convicted following a guilty plea of criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree,a misdemeanor,in violation of penal law.on april,he again pled guilty and was convicted of the same offense.
initial round of removal proceedings 
the government began removal proceedings against martinez by serving him with a notice to appear on june.the government initially charged two grounds of removability based solely on the march conviction.the first was for conviction of a controlled substance violation,pursuant to ina a b i,a b i.the second ground was for conviction of an aggravated felony,as defined in ina a b,pursuant to ina a a iii,a a iii.
a hearing was held before an immigration judge ij on september.martinez admitted committing a controlled substance violation but denied that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony.he,therefore,conceded removability under ina a b i,but sought cancellation of removal,for which he was eligible so long as he was not found to have committed an aggravated felony.
at the same hearing,martinez relied on a third circuit case,steele blackman,cir,which held that a conviction under new york penal law did not constitute an aggravated felony.martinez further argued that our decision in united states simpson,cir,which seemingly cut against him,was limited to the sentencing context only and did not cover removability.
after considering whether martinez had been convicted of an aggravated felony within the meaning of the ina,the ij ruled on october,that martinez drug convictions were aggravated felonies,thereby precluding his eligibility for cancellation of removal under ina a.the ij characterized the question as troubling.he said that the bia had held in in re elgendi,bia,that a state drug offense was only an aggravated felony if it was a felony in the state in which it was committed,but that the second circuit had held in aguirre ins,cir,and simpson,at,that a state drug offense was an aggravated felony if it would be a felony under federal law.declaring himself bound by the second circuit,the ij held that martinez convictions were aggravated felonies.the bia summarily affirmed.
martinez filed a habeas petition in the eastern district of new york on april.it was transferred to the western district of new york and then,after full briefing to the district court,transferred to the second circuit on june,pursuant to the real id act.
the case was argued before our court on may.the panel initially waited to make a decision until the supreme court had ruled in lopez gonzales,d.after the supreme court decided lopez,we requested supplemental briefing on the impact of that decision.on may,we remanded the case to the bia for reconsideration in light of lopez.
remand to the bia 
on remand,the bia did not request briefing.rather,the board simply rendered a new decision ordering that martinez should be removed as an aggravated felon who is thus ineligible for relief.the board observed that under lopez,the question of whether martinez state conviction was an aggravated felony under the ina rested upon whether that crime would have been punishable as a felony under the csa,et.the board reasoned that the new york crime of sale of marihuana is comparable to the federal crime of marihuana distribution,a,which pursuant to b d,is punishable by up to five years in prison and is therefore a felony.
in so doing,the bia held that although the distribution of a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration is punished as a misdemeanor under b,that misdemeanor provision is a mitigating exception in a sentencing statute in which a federal defendant bears the burden of showing that he falls into the lower misdemeanor category.the board held,therefore,a that martinez bore the burden of showing that his state crime was the equivalent of a federal misdemeanor and b that he had not met this burden.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
whether a conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony is a question of law,dhs,cir,which we review de novo,a d.
legal framework 
a permanent resident alien is eligible to apply for cancellation of removal if the alien has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,has resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.a.only the third of these conditions is in dispute in this case.
in pertinent part,the ina defines the term aggravated felony to include illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in section of the controlled substances act including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title,united states code.ina a b,as added by,stat,and as amended by a,stat,a b,a.under the csa,a controlled substance is a drug or other substance,or immediate precursor,included in schedule i,ii,iii,iv,or v of part b of.marihuana is a schedule i drug under the csa.
the general phrase illicit trafficking is left undefined,but c identifies the subcategory by stating that a drug trafficking crime is any felony punishable under the controlled substances act or under either of two other federal statutes having no bearing on this case.following the listing,a of the ina provides in its penultimate sentence that t he term aggravated felony applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of federal or state law or,in certain circumstances,the law of a foreign country.a.the united states supreme court has held that a state offense constitutes a felony punishable under the controlled substances act only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law.lopez.at.thus,for a state drug offense to qualify as a drug trafficking crime and,by extension,an aggravated felony,it must correspond to an offense that carries a maximum term of imprisonment exceeding one year under the csa.see id.at.
in deciding whether a conviction fits within the definition of aggravated felony in a,we have followed the supreme court in adopting a categorical approach.gertsenshteyn mukasey,cir.under this approach,which is sometimes called the approach,after taylor united states,d,and shepard united states,d,the singular circumstances of an individual petitioner crimes should not be considered,and only the minimum criminal conduct necessary to sustain a conviction under a given statute is relevant.gertsenshteyn,at quoting dalton ashcroft,cir alteration in original we thus look to the elements and the nature of the offense of conviction,rather than to the particular facts relating to petitioner crime,at quoting canada gonzales,cir 
the outcome of such a categorical inquiry,moreover,may be different when defining aggravated felonies in the immigration context than in the sentencing context.this is the result of our bifurcated approach to defining aggravated felonies.see united states,cir aguirre ins,cir.in,we considered the narrow issue of whether this court construction of the phrase aggravated felony in a deportation statute applies to the same phrase used in the sentencing guidelines for purp
