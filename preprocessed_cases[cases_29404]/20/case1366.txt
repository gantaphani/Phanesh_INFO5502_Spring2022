john eley was convicted in ohio of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery and sentenced to death.he now appeals the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,challenging the state trial court failure to conduct a competency hearing,his trial counsel effectiveness in developing mitigation evidence,and the trial panel consideration of mitigation proof.for the reasons set forth below,we now affirm the district court decision and dismiss eley habeas petition.
the ohio supreme court summarized the facts of the case as follows 
during the early afternoon of august,eley was visiting melvin green at the home of green girlfriend in youngstown.according to eley,he and green were just sitting around when green suggested that they go down to the arab store.eley and green left the house and proceeded down a path through the woods leading to the sinjil market.along the way,green showed eley a black snub nose gun,and told eley he was going to take the arab off.since the proprietor of the store,ihsan aydah,knew green face,eley agreed to go in alone and rob the store while green waited outside.
eley entered the store and told aydah to put his hands up and to turn and face the wall.green had told eley that aydah had a gun under the store counter,so when aydah lowered his hands and went under the counter,eley fired a shot.eley claimed that he aimed at aydah shoulder.however,the shot hit aydah on the right side of his head,approximately four inches above the earlobe.aydah died the next day of shock and hemorrhage due to a gunshot wound to the head.
just before eley fired the gun,green entered the store.after the shot,green ran behind the counter and got into the cash register.he took aydah wallet while aydah lay wounded on the floor.as the two left the store,green gave eley a brown paper bag with the money and wallet.according to eley,they went up the street,got to the path and run up the woods.
several days after the murder,eley was arrested by youngstown police at the residence of his cousin girlfriend,carlotta skinner.after his arrest,eley told police that he and green had split the money taken in the robbery,which was around.however,eley later gave the money back to green because he said it was all on him and he had to get out.
after being arrested,i n his voluntary statement eley admitted that he and green had robbed the sinjil market,and that he shot aydah.the arresting officer testified that eley did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the interview and was very calm and passive.
the grand jury indicted eley on one count of aggravated murder with a specification that the murder was committed during,or immediately after,the commission of an aggravated robbery a,and that eley was the principal offender.this count also carried a firearm specification.in addition,eley was indicted on one count of aggravated robbery a and and one count of conspiracy a.each count carried a firearm specification.
in may,eley waived his right to a jury trial and opted for a trial before a panel.eley pled not guilty to the charges against him,thereby withdrawing a prior plea of not guilty by reason of insanity 
trial was held before a panel on may,but the defense chose not to present any evidence.the panel found eley guilty of aggravated murder,aggravated robbery,the capital specification,and two of the three firearm specifications,but not guilty of conspiracy.
during the mitigation hearing,several family members testified on eley behalf.eley mother,cecilia joseph,divorced eley father when eley was seven or eight years old,and stated that eley had not much of a relationship with his father.joseph testified that on christmas night,her second husband had been drinking and began choking her and her daughter.at that time,eley stabbed the second husband with a knife in order to stop him.joseph testified that eley dropped out of high school in the ninth grade,but later entered the job corps and learned to be a welder.eley sent money home to his mother during this time,and gave her money to help her finish paying for nursing school.joseph stated that while eley has had problems with drugs and alcohol,he is a better person when he is not under the influence.she characterized eley as church oriented,and believed he had been born again.
eley sister,susan laury,testified that eley had helped the family financially while he was in the job corps,and that eley is normally a quiet,sweet,gentle person that would hurt anybody.
douglas darnall,a clinical psychologist,found eley to be of borderline intelligence,and ranked him in the twelfth percentile on the wechsler adult intelligence test.according to darnall,eley has a history of chronic alcohol and polysubstance abuse,but exhibited no evidence of psychosis or major defective disorder.in addition,darnall testified that eley understands the difference between right and wrong.darnall found eley to be remorseful,but eley never mentioned that he felt remorse for the victim.however,two police officers who witnessed eley confession testified that eley was remorseful before he made that statement.eley made a short unsworn statement at the mitigation phase that consisted of several biblical quotations from the book of romans.
after deliberation,the panel unanimously found that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt,and sentenced eley to death.upon appeal,the court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentence of death.
state eley,ohio.after considering the eighteen issues eley raised on appeal,the ohio supreme court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals.id.at.eley petition for a writ of certiorari to the supreme court was denied.eley ohio.
eley filed a petition for relief under ohio revised code on september.the state court conducted an evidentiary hearing on eley competency but denied eley motion for a competency determination on the ground that he had no right to be competent in a proceeding.the court then denied relief on april.state eley,ohio.eley timely appealed,but the seventh district court of appeals affirmed the trial court dismissal of the petition on november.state eley,wl ohio.the ohio supreme court declined to exercise jurisdiction over eley petition.state eley,table ohio.
on july,eley sister,susan laury,filed a notice of intent to file the present petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,along with motions to stay eley execution,to appoint counsel,and for a competency evaluation to determine if eley was competent to waive any further appeals.the district court entered a stay,but while the parties were briefing the last two motions,eley filed a notice of intent to file a habeas petition himself.eley filed the petition on march,raising fourteen grounds for relief.see eley bagley,wl,at.in november,eley filed a motion to stay the habeas proceeding so that he could file a mental retardation claim in state court pursuant to atkins virginia.this claim was later denied.on october,the district court denied his habeas petition on all fourteen grounds.eley,wl.
eley timely appealed and now raises three issues.the district court granted a certificate of appealability coa as to the first two whether the trial court violated eley due process rights by failing to hold a competency hearing and whether eley trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective by failing to investigate or prepare mitigating evidence for the penalty phase.we expanded the coa to include whether the trial panel failed to consider and give effect to valid mitigation evidence at sentencing.
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,governs all habeas petitions filed after april.see lindh murphy.aedpa provides 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
a state court adjudication is contrary to supreme court precedent under d if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law,or if the state court confronts facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrives at an opposite result.williams taylor.a state court makes an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent under d if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from the supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular case,or if the court unreasonably extends or refuses to extend existing supreme court precedent to new factual situations where it should apply.id.at.under aedpa,the question for this court to answer is not whether a federal court believes the state court determination was incorrect but whether that determination was substantially higher threshold.schriro landrigan.factual findings made by the state courts based on the trial record are entitled to a presumption of correctness that may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.e warren smith,cir.
however,federal courts need not review every point of error raised by a habeas petitioner.when a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule,federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman thompson.in this circuit,to determine whether a federal claim has been procedurally defaulted,we apply a test laid out in maupin smith,cir 
first,the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner claim and that the petitioner failed to comply with the rule second,the court must decide whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction third,the court must decide whether the state procedural forfeiture is an adequate and independent state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim 
jacobs mohr,cir quoting maupin,at.if the state procedural rule was not complied with and that rule was an adequate and independent ground for default,we may still excuse the default if the petitioner can demonstrate that there was cause for him not to follow the procedural rule and that he was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.maupin,at.in state cole,ohio,the ohio supreme court held that res judicata is a proper basis upon which to dismiss an claim in a petition for relief where a defendant who is represented by new counsel on direct appeal fails to raise that claim and the basis for that claim could be fairly determined without examining evidence outside the record.fautenberry mitchell,cir,cert.denied.in fautenberry,we held that ohio application of res judicata pursuant to cole is an actually enforced,adequate and independent state ground upon which the ohio state courts consistently refuse to review the merits of a defendant claims.id.
we first address eley claim of deprivation of due process by the state trial panel failure to conduct a competency hearing.the right to a fair trial is violated by a court failure to hold a proper competency hearing where there is substantial evidence that a defendant is incompetent.filiaggi bagley,cir citing pate robinson.a defendant can be adjudged competent to stand trial if he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.dusky united states,per curiam.e vidence of a defendant irrational behavior,his demeanor at trial,and any prior medical opinion on competence to stand trial are all relevant in determining whether further inquiry is required,but even one of these factors standing alone may,in some circumstances,be sufficient.drope missouri.
eley argues that there was significant evidence of his incompetency at trial and therefore the trial panel should have held an evidentiary hearing on his competency,even after his counsel withdrew a request for one.eley points to various facts in the record to support this assertion.in depositions and affidavits taken to support his state petition,eley trial counsel reported that eley often rambled about abstract religious ideas instead of cooperating with forming a defense.they further stated that eley often had difficulty communicating with counsel because of his intelligence and education.at the penalty phase of trial,eley unsworn statement to the court was a series of biblical quotations from the book of romans.eley contends that his mental incompetence directly resulted in his refusal to accept a plea offer that would have resulted in his serving six years in prison.during his proceedings,the ohio trial court held a competency hearing,at which jeffrey smalldon,a clinical psychologist,testified that eley was inclined to make pseudophilosophical statements that were often couched in religious terms,often very difficult to understand.smalldon also suspected that eley may have suffered from brain due to having had a forceps delivery,to his abusive upbringing,or boxing as an due to eley failure to cooperate,smalldon could not confirm any of his suspicions.eley contends now that there was sufficient evidence to give the trial judges cause to suspect that he was incompetent to stand trial.
the ohio supreme court considered and rejected this argument.the court first held that eley had waived his right to a competency hearing knowingly and intelligently after having requested one.eley,at.this holding is problematic.as the supreme court warned in pate robinson,i t is contradictory to argue that a defendant may be incompetent,and yet knowingly or intelligently waive his right to have the court determine his capacity to stand trial.at.however,in the alternative,the ohio supreme court held that even if the waiver were invalid,any error by the trial court in not conducting a hearing was harmless,since the record fails to reveal sufficient indicia of incompetency.eley,at.according to the court,eley had failed to cite any portion of the record that revealed any suggestion of incompetency.id.
because evidence at trial did not suggest that eley was incompetent,we can not find that the ohio supreme court decision on this issue was unreasonable.the test for whether the trial court erred in not holding a proper hearing is whether a reasonable judge in that position would have experienced doubt with respect to competency to stand trial.filiaggi,at.the state trial record reveals the following.during a suppression hearing held less than a week before trial,eley testified to his recollection of the confession he gave police.his answers on both direct and were cogent and show that he had an understanding of his objective at the hearing.nothing in the record suggests eley was incompetent during the guilt phase of trial.at the penalty phase,eley gave a brief,unsworn statement that consisted of nothing but bible verses.while the statement was perhaps unusual,it does not suggest a lack of competency.nor does the penalty phase testimony about eley limited education and low intelligence suggest that eley was incompetent.moreover,the state trial court was aware of darnall opinion that eley was competent to stand trial.
much of the evidence that eley provides to suggest his lack of competency was generated nearly a decade after his trial.for example,in preparation for his state action,smalldon reported that eley may have had brain damage due to head injuries suffered during eley youth.further,smalldon reported that he was unable to obtain hard test data to corroborate various opinions he had formed because eley was uncooperative during his examination.smalldon report was not made until,and he did not testify at a hearing until january,roughly a decade after the trial.although smalldon believed that many of the factors that led him to his conclusions perhaps would have affected eley in the same way at the time of trial,he was only able to conclude that there were serious questions about eley competency at present,meaning in.smalldon assessments did not speak to eley competency at the time of trial,which is the relevant legal inquiry.for similar reasons,depositions from eley trial counsel during proceedings indicating counsel frustration with eley uncooperative nature and religious beliefs during trial do not satisfy the test laid out in filiaggi.
retroactive determinations of competency are difficult,and any such determination must be based on evidence derived from knowledge contemporaneous to trial.bowers battles,cir quoting connor wingo,cir.the evidence proffered by eley from the state proceedings has virtually no probative value.the psychological evaluation of eley performed by darnall just before eley sentencing hearing,which concluded he was sane and competent,is far more probative of his competency at trial than examinations conducted nearly ten years later.although the ohio supreme court holding was that the failure to conduct a competency hearing was harmless,the decision was still based on the critical finding that the record fails to reveal sufficient indicia of incompetency.eley,at.this finding did not involve an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent,and we therefore affirm the district court on this issue.
eley second claim is that his counsel performed ineffectively by failing to investigate and present adequate mitigating evidence at the penalty phase.he argues that his counsel relied too heavily on the presentence investigation report psr and therefore decided not to interview much of eley family.eley also argues that counsel failed to present important social history evidence,such as his difficult upbringing,history of alcohol and drug abuse,and employment background.further,eley contends that his defense was further undermined by counsel failure to request an independent psychological evaluation by a qualified mitigation psychologist.according to eley,counsel failures resulted in the state courts not fully considering potentially mitigating factors such as his true remorse for his actions or possible mental defects.
the district court found that eley had not raised any of these arguments until his state petition,where the ohio court held that the claims were barred by res judiciata.eley,wl,at.therefore,the district court held that this claim was procedurally defaulted.id.a review of the state court opinions reveals this is only partially true.the state court found that only a portion of eley counsel was ineffective for not hiring a toxicologist or barred by res judicata because it was not based on evidence outside the record and therefore could have been raised on direct appeal.eley,wl,at.however,the court of appeals did reach the rest of eley ineffective assistance claim on the merits and found that he had not shown that any evidence uncovered by further investigation would have not been cumulative to the evidence disclosed in the psr.id.at.therefore,we review the rest of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the merits 
the supreme court set forth the test for ineffective assistance of counsel in strickland washington.to establish this claim,eley must show that his counsel performance was deficient,and that the deficiency prejudiced his defense.id.at.to prove deficiency,eley must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.prejudice can be shown by proving that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.counsel failure to reasonably investigate a defendant background or present mitigating evidence to the jury at sentencing can constitute ineffective assistance.wiggins smith,williams,at.
when assessing whether an attorney mitigation investigation was deficient,we consider not only the quantum of evidence already known to counsel,but also whether that evidence should have led a reasonable attorney to investigate further.wiggins,at.to demonstrate prejudice,eley must show that any new evidence differs in a substantial strength and subject the evidence actually presented at sentencing.fautenberry,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.t he failure to present additional mitigating evidence that is merely cumulative of that already presented does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.nields bradshaw,cir quoting broom mitchell,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the ohio court of appeals treatment of this claim hinged on this last court found that eley could not show the new evidence he proffered was more than merely cumulative of what was presented at mitigation.ohio lists the history,character,and background of the offender as a statutory mitigating factor.ohio ann.b therefore,the facts eley claims counsel should have presented could be probative of further mitigation.
at the mitigation hearing,eley first offered the testimony of several law enforcement officials.a sergeant with the mahoning county jail testified that eley had not violated any rules or regulations before or during trial.two officers with the youngstown police department testified that eley appeared remorseful at the time he admitted responsibility for his actions.eley mother,cecilia joseph,and sister,susan laury,testified that eley had difficulty with school and dropped out when he was sixteen years old.eley then enlisted in the job corps and received training to be a welder,and joseph and laury testified that eley sent his mother money to support her training for a nursing degree.joseph testified that eley was and often attended church near her home.joseph and laury both testified to eley poor relationship with his father and.once eley father and mother divorced,when eley was around fourteen,eley father stopped seeing him.one christmas,joseph second violent with joseph and laury.eley attempted to stop his from strangling his mother by stabbing him.joseph and laury testified that although eley was typically a quiet,sweet,and gentle person,his habitual use of drugs and alcohol often led to his becoming a different person when he was impaired.darnall,a state psychologist and witness,testified that eley had a chronic history of both alcohol and polysubstance abuse.
in the state proceeding,eley presented additional mitigating evidence that counsel had failed to uncover at his sentencing hearing.joseph testified that eley underwent a forceps delivery at birth.a former girlfriend testified that eley was addicted to heroin in the and had been a binge drinker.eley testified she knew eley had been eating aspirin as early as the second or third grade.eley younger sister testified that the family rarely ate nutritional meals when eley was growing up,which she believed may have affected him later in life.several witnesses testified that eley became violent or belligerent when he was drinking.
the ohio court of appeals recounted the applicable standard under strickland.it wrote that although i t is the obligation of counsel to make reasonable investigations a particular decision not to investigate must be examined for reasonableness under the circumstances with strong measures of deference to counsel judgments.eley,wl,at.after reviewing the evidence presented at the sentencing phase of trial,the court concluded that a quantum of information contained in the affidavits appears to be repetitive of evidence presented by trial counsel at the mitigation stage.id.as for the evidence of a forceps delivery,the court found this evidence to be of the type that would normally be rejected by three judge panels when weighing mitigating factors.id.therefore,the court concluded that eley had shown no prejudice.id.later,when discussing trial counsel alleged overreliance on the psr,the court repeated its prior conclusion that counsel behavior was not unreasonable considering the fact that the psr uncovered similar evidence that would have been uncovered had a specific investigation been conducted.id.at.
we can not find that this conclusion was an unreasonable application of federal law.the record shows that counsel prepared and questioned several witnesses,including both law enforcement and family.the question of whether counsel conducted an adequate investigation is governed by a presumption of reasonableness imposed by strickland and is hard to overcome.beuke houk,cir quoting campbell coyle,cir.to the extent that trial counsel failed to further investigate eley upbringing or history of drug and alcohol is,to the extent counsel performance was can not show that this failure prejudiced his ability to prove mitigating circumstances.although the evidence presented at the hearing did go into more depth than the evidence presented by trial counsel at sentencing,it did not cover any new subject matter and was not substantially more persuasive than the trial evidence.much of what eley claims should have been presented at the sentencing hearing was,in fact,presented,as counsel elicited testimony regarding eley difficult upbringing,employment history,drug and alcohol addictions,and good behavior in prison.therefore,we find that eley second claim is without merit,and we affirm the judgment of the district court on this issue.
finally,eley claims that his eighth and fourteenth amendment rights were violated by the trial panel failure to properly consider valid mitigation evidence at sentencing.he maintains that the panel did not consider the evidence he presented regarding his difficult upbringing,his history of drug and alcohol abuse,his low intelligence level,and his remorse for the crime eley supports this claim by noting that the panel discussion of mitigating factors in its sentencing opinion is devoid of any mention of this evidence.he argues that t he fact that the panel did not mention any of the previously noted evidence in mitigation is strong evidence that such factors were not properly considered.therefore,according to eley,when the trial judges excluded the evidence from their consideration,they violated the supreme court ruling in eddings oklahoma.further,eley argues that the omission of reference to the evidence violates ohio ann.f which sets forth the content required in a sentencing opinion,thus violating his due process rights under hicks oklahoma.
in lockett ohio,the supreme court held that the eighth and fourteenth amendments require that the sentencer,in all but the rarest kind of capital case,not be precluded from considering,as a mitigating factor,any aspect of a defendant character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.in that case,the ohio death penalty statute did not permit the sentencing judge to consider factors such as the defendant character,prior record,and age.see id.at.the court extended this holding in eddings just as the statute may not restrict certain factors from being considered as mitigation,the sentencing judge can not,as a matter of law,refuse to consider appropriate evidence either.at.the sentencer s may determine the weight to be given relevant mitigating evidence.but they may not give it no weight by excluding such evidence from their consideration.id.at.
if a trial court considers unconstitutional aggravating factors,the supreme court has held that this error can be cured by the state appellate court by independently reweighing aggravating and mitigating factors and reaching a sentence without the consideration of the factors found impermissible at the trial level.see lundgren mitchell,cir citing clemons mississippi.
in this case,eley is correct that the trial court sentencing opinion is somewhat sparse in its analysis of the mitigation evidence however,eley conclusion that the court lack of detail amounts to a refusal,as a matter of law,to consider any of his mitigating evidence is not logical.although the trial court did not elaborate on the precise evidence it had considered,its opinion does state that it gave careful and complete scrutiny of all the mitigating factors,which implies at least that it did not explicitly refuse to consider relevant evidence.as the ohio court of appeals noted,and as recounted above,the trial court heard evidence on all of the mitigating factors that eley claims were absent from its consideration.see state eley,ca,wl,at ohio.
moreover,even if the trial court did err in its weighing of the aggravating and mitigating factors or by not following ohio statutory procedural requirements,both the ohio court of appeals and the ohio supreme court cured the error by carefully and independently reweighing the evidence.the court of appeals considered not only the mitigation evidence eley claims was ignored,but it also considered additional evidence of eley head injuries,the possibility of residual doubt,the fact that eley went unpunished,whether the prosecution committed misconduct,and whether the trial court improperly admitted gruesome photographs.id.at.the court of appeals concluded that the aggravating circumstance eley was found guilty of committing outweighs the mitigating factors in this case.id.at.the ohio supreme court did the same thing.it found nothing in the nature and circumstances of the offense to be mitigating because eley participated in a robbery where,under the circumstances,a murder was likely to occur.eley,at.it found eley history,character,and background to be entitled to only modest weight.id.the court gave some weight to eley longstanding devotion and care for his family and the fact that eley has shown remorse.id.at.nonetheless,the ohio supreme court also concluded that the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
because,under baston bagley,cir,any defect in the trial court sentencing was cured by the appellate courts reweighing of the evidence presented on direct appeal,we affirm the district court on this issue.
for the reasons set forth above,we affirm the judgment of the district court and dismiss eley petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
petitioner counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment by failing to adequately investigate and prepare mitigating evidence for the penalty phase of petitioner trial.i would therefore vacate petitioner sentence and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion 
to establish that counsel was ineffective at the penalty phase under strickland washington,petitioner must show that counsel performance was deficient,and the deficiency prejudiced his defense.
trial counsel deficient 
because the ohio court of appeals analyzed petitioner ineffective assistance claim only under the prejudice prong of strickland and did not determine whether petitioner counsel investigation constituted deficient performance,this court examines this element of petitioner claim de novo.rompilla beard.to demonstrate that counsel was deficient,petitioner must establish that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,measured against prevailing professional norms.strickland,at.
with respect to representation at the penalty phase of capital cases,the supreme court has referred to the american bar association aba guidelines concerning death penalty cases as guides to determining what is reasonable.rompilla,at quoting wiggins smith,quoting strickland,at.see also bobby van hook,noting that r estatements of professional standards such as the aba guidelines can be useful as guides to what reasonableness entails to the extent they describe the professional norms prevailing when the representation took place hamblin mitchell,cir noting that the supreme court has held that the aba standards for counsel in death penalty cases provide the guiding rules and standards to be used in defining the prevailing professional norms in ineffective assistance cases.according to the aba guidelines,in capital cases,investigations into mitigating evidence should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor.wiggins,at citing aba guidelines for the appointment and performance of counsel in death penalty cases c,emphasis in original.the court has further noted that among the topics counsel should consider presenting are medical history,educational history,employment and training history,family and social history,prior adult and juvenile correctional experience,and religious and cultural influences.id.emphasis omitted.
although decisions regarding the investigation of mitigating evidence often involve strategic choices,counsel strategic decisions must be supported by a thorough investigation.strickland,at.when counsel decides to limit their mitigation investigation,their strategic choices made after this limited investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.id.at.accordingly,the deference owed to counsel strategic judgments about mitigation is directly proportional to the adequacy of the investigations supporting such judgments.jells mitchell,cir citing wiggins,at.in assessing the reasonableness of attorneys investigation,however,a court must consider not only the quantum of evidence already known to counsel,but also whether the known evidence would lead reasonable attorney s to investigate further.wiggins,at.however,the supreme court has also instructed that hindsight is discounted by pegging adequacy to counsel perspective at the time investigative decisions are made,and by giving a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgments.rompilla,at quoting strickland,at,citations omitted.
on appeal,petitioner argues that his trial counsel were ineffective during the penalty phase of his trial in several ways.first,petitioner maintains that counsel were ineffective in their mitigation investigation in that they did not talk to most of petitioner family.pet.br.at.with respect to those family members with whom counsel spoke,petitioner argues that trial counsel failed to adequately investigate and prepare them prior to the mitigation hearing.id.petitioner also faults trial counsel for relying on a investigation report without performing further investigation.
the record,including the testimony of witnesses during mitigation and the deposition of john schultz,one of petitioner trial attorneys,shows that petitioner attorneys consulted petitioner family,darnall,and another mental health expert,morrison.they also reviewed the adult parole authority investigation report and requested a psychological examination,although they did not review any of petitioner medical or school records.schultz testified that,in hindsight,he probably would have hired a mitigation expert to assist him,at,but noted that mitigation was relatively new and not many lawyers were experienced in it at the time of petitioner trial.at.
from these sources,counsel knew the following petitioner had a history of difficulty in school and was a slow learner with a low and at times had trouble communicating with people petitioner was generally a nice and person who helped family around the house and got along well with children petitioner had a poor relationship with his and had at one point stabbed him when his stepfather attempted to choke both his mother and sister in a drunken rage petitioner had several juvenile incidents,including a knife fight and,as an adult,had numerous convictions for theft,assault,breaking and entering,and drunk and disturbance and petitioner had a history of serious drug and alcohol abuse.
at mitigation,petitioner counsel presented six witnesses,including two detectives who indicated that petitioner was remorseful and one correctional facility officer who testified regarding petitioner good behavior while incarcerated.each of these witness testimony takes up less than three pages in the sentencing transcript.although it appears counsel may have spoken to at least two additional family members,counsel indicated that their testimony was largely indicative of the testimony already offered.at.
based on the affidavits submitted by petitioner other family members and acquaintances,however,it appears that trial counsel failed to contact several family members and friends.see johnson bagley,cir concluding that counsel failure to interview the petitioner mother constituted deficient performance because the interview could have provided further information as to how her own drug addiction affected the petitioner childhood.the record fails to indicate that petitioner counsel asked for additional names from petitioner mother,sister,and,or from state officials who were familiar with petitioner as a result of petitioner contact with the criminal justice system.see id.highlighting counsel failure to ask witnesses who were interviewed for additional sources of mitigation witnesses in finding that counsel was deficient.nor did counsel seek to contact officers who were involved in the preparation of petitioner report or his case more generally.
counsel also did not seek the court permission to retain a mitigation expert.while counsel failure to use a mitigation expert itself does not constitute deficient performance,their failure to obtain the information that a mitigation expert would regarding petitioner childhood,early school years,substance abuse,interactions with family,and contact with the criminal justice the deficiency of counsel performance.see jells,at citing williams taylor,concluding that counsel had an obligation to fully investigate the possible mitigation evidence available.counsel decision not to expand their investigation and to rely on the investigation report to fulfill this obligation to investigate was objectively unreasonable.wiggins,at.
trial counsel chose not to conduct an independent investigation into petitioner medical and academic background,instead choosing to rely on the report.counsel own observations of petitioner and their knowledge of his significant alcohol and drug abuse,however,should have prompted them to investigate his medical records.like the information presented in the records provided to counsel in wiggins,the report of darnall and counsel own knowledge should have prompted them to further investigate petitioner medical records and history of drug use,particularly since their mitigation strategy was to show the profound influence drug and alcohol abuse played in petitioner life see wiggins,at.in light of the broad spectrum of mitigation evidence ohio law permits a defendant to present,the fact that counsel focused only on petitioner family members in locating potential mitigating evidence constitutes an abject failure to fully investigate the possible mitigation evidence available.see id.
accordingly,trial counsel performance during the mitigation phase fell below prevailing professional norms and constituted deficient performance under strickland.
ii.prejudice prong of strickland 
because the ohio court of appeals reached the merits of the prejudice prong of petitioner ineffectiveness claim,we review this prong under the deferential standards of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa to determine whether the state court unreasonably applied strickland and related cases to petitioner claim.under strickland,petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.thus,counsel ineffective performance does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.id.at.in the specific context of a capital case,a petitioner establishes prejudice when there is a reasonable probability that,absent the errors,the an appellate court,to the extent it independently reweighs the have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating factors did not warrant death.id.at.the supreme court has directed courts to evaluate the totali
