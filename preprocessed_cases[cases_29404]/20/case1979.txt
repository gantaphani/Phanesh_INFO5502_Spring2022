in february,harrison franklin was convicted by a wisconsin court of armed robbery,reckless endangerment,and bail jumping.to make matters worse,at the time he committed these crimes he was a repeat offender and free on bond pending his appeal of a prior battery conviction.after exhausting his remedies in the state courts,franklin filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.the district court denied the petition but granted a certificate of appealability on the issues of bias and ineffective assistance of counsel.on appeal,franklin alleges that the state court judge was actually biased and that the wisconsin court of appeals rejection of this point was contrary to,and constituted an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states.although the burden is high on habeas corpus petitioners,we conclude that franklin has met these demanding standards here we therefore vacate and remand for issuance of the writ.
in franklin was charged with armed robbery,reckless endangerment,and bail jumping.his case was assigned to judge bruce schroeder,of the circuit court of kenosha county,wisconsin.at the time,judge schroeder was presiding over another case,state taylor,cm.in taylor,judge schroeder had denied taylor release without bail and set an appeal bond.taylor sought relief from the wisconsin court of appeals,alleging that the appeal bond was contrary to the rule established in state lipke.in lipke,the court held that a defendant can not be denied the right to release pending an appeal solely on the ground of indigence.lipke,at.
in april,judge schroeder took the highly unusual step of filing a memorandum with the state court of appeals in support of his decision to deny taylor request for release without bail.in that memorandum,he asserted that the remarks in lipke regarding the subject of bail were dicta and therefore not binding precedent.he further opined that lipke would result in absurd and unreasonable outcomes because the same indigent defendant who is held pretrial for failure to post bail is entitled to immediate release without cash bail upon establishment of his guilt.
to illustrate his point,judge schroeder pointed to franklin case.he began by stating,i have also now pending before me the case of state harrison franklin,cf.the judge then gave a detailed account of franklin five previous convictions,relying on information that he had gleaned from a report in one of franklin earlier cases.the last conviction,in,resulted in a sentence,but franklin was released without posting bail pursuant to lipke.judge schroeder concluded his point with the following statement 
although the court of appeals accepted his attorney no merit report on december,he was not reincarcerated until february,when he was taken into custody in a tavern where it is alleged,according to the current file,that he stabbed one man four times and another twice,during an armed robbery.
franklin was convicted in may.in july,before sentencing,an article appeared in the kenosha news titled,legislators oppose freeing indigent without bail.the article referred to two cases,franklin and taylor.the article further reported that both judge schroeder and assistant district attorney dooley the attorney who prosecuted franklin case had sent their written challenges to the wisconsin court of appeals.
prompted by the article,franklin moved to recuse judge schroeder from further proceedings in the case based on the appearance of partiality and impropriety arising from the judge opinion of a defendant release pending appeal.judge schroeder heard the motion to recuse prior to sentencing.while franklin was presenting his recusal motion,judge schroeder interrupted franklin and asked,what did i have to do with the article after franklin explained that the article had mentioned and quoted him,judge schroeder changed tacks and asked,what did i do that suggests some lack of impartiality towards your client 
judge schroeder continued to deny that his impartiality was in doubt,making this statement on the record 
i am want,so the record is clear,because i refuse to accept responsibility for what a reporter wrote in the newspaper unless you are claiming that i said this to this reporter or that i in some way acted in a manner which suggests lack of impartiality towards the case of franklin.i am not clear on what you are claiming i said or did and under what circumstances that give rise to your claims.
he then asked franklin,did you call this reporter and ask the reporter where did you get the quotes that you attribute to judge schroeder franklin stated that he had,but the reporter had not returned his call.after franklin said that his motion relied on the newspaper article,judge schroeder finally admitted his role in the article and stated,
all right.well,for the record a reporter did seek me out with respect to this issue and i declined to discuss it.when i say this issue,i am talking about the rule of the court of appeals in state lipke.i have no idea why the reporter had an interest in the lipke issue.
i did absolutely nothing to stoke the fire with respect to that decision.in the course of the written memorandum,which i filed in this case,i did make reference to this case as it was then pending in writing.and when i was approached by krekowicz from the newspaper,i did tell him that i had issued a written memorandum and when he asked to interview me,i declined an interview and told him that what i had to say was already of record in the memorandum which was in the file,which was.now,in that memorandum there is reference to franklin case.
at this point in the hearing,judge schroeder read aloud the paragraphs of the taylor memorandum that referred to franklin.this was the first time franklin learned about the memorandum.
following judge schroeder reading of the memorandum,franklin commented that the court had included information in the memorandum that was not in the record of the present case.franklin argued that by reading the memorandum into the record,the information judge schroeder had independently obtained was now a part of the record in this case.furthermore,franklin pointed out that he could not be certain about what information the court would be relying on to determine the appropriate sentence in the case at hand.
judge schroeder denied the motion to recuse,stating that he was not biased against franklin and that the memorandum contained only factually accurate information.additionally,judge schroeder emphasized that he had used the word allegations in his references to franklin pending case 
and i agree with you that it would have been improper had i said he was taken into custody in a tavern where he had stabbed two people in the course of an armed robbery.that would have been improper because it would have suggested that i had already made a conclusion about his guilt.but i do not feel that was done.
judge schroeder agreed,however,that franklin was entitled to respond to the additional information and offered the parties a chance to examine the record in the earlier case.the parties chose to proceed.
franklin was sentenced to years incarceration,the maximum sentence for both the armed robbery and the bail jumping counts.he also received years,the maximum sentence,for the weapon charges,but the sentence was stayed in favor of probation.if probation is revoked,the two terms must be served consecutively.
franklin appealed his conviction and sentence on due process grounds.he argued that the constitution guarantees a defendant right to be tried by an impartial judge,and that his trial before judge schroeder violated that right because the judge demonstrated bias when he referred to franklin case in the taylor memorandum.franklin argued that judge schroeder targeted him and used him as an example while his case was pending before him.franklin then requested that the court vacate his conviction and sentence.
the wisconsin court of appeals affirmed franklin conviction.in addressing the recusal issue,the court examined only whether judge schroeder should have recused himself at sentencing it never discussed franklin
