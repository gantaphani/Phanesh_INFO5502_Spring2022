benjamin henderson jones filed a notice of appeal from the district court dismissal of his section petition as an unauthorized successive petition.because we conclude that a certificate of appealability is required in order to appeal from the dismissal of a petition as unauthorized and successive,and because jones has failed to make the requisite showing for a certificate of appealability,we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.
jones was convicted by a virginia court in of the murders of his mother and and sentenced to life imprisonment plus twenty years.see jones angelone,cir.subsequently,he has brought three habeas actions in federal court to challenge his virginia confinement.his original petition,filed in,was considered on the merits and dismissed,and we affirmed that dismissal on appeal.id.his second petition,filed in,was dismissed by the district court for failure to exhaust state remedies,but on appeal,we determined that it was an unauthorized successive petition and affirmed the dismissal on those grounds.see jones deeds,cir unpublished.
in may,jones filed his third federal habeas petition.noting that jones had failed to provide any evidence of the authorization from this court required by,the district court filed the petition for administrative purposes only and dismissed it without prejudice as an unauthorized successive petition.jones filed a timely notice of appeal,and a pro se brief in support of his appeal.we requested briefing on the issue of whether jones must obtain a certificate of appealability,as provided by,before appealing from the district court dismissal of his habeas petition as successive and unauthorized.
the question whether a certificate of appealability is required in this case turns on the interpretation of c a,which provides as follows 
unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability,an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court 
c a emphasis added internal division omitted.jones argues that section c does not apply in this case,because the district court dismissal of his petition as an unauthorized successive petition was neither a final order,nor an order in a habeas corpus proceeding.we are not persuaded by either argument.
first,jones argues that the district court dismissal was not the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding.we disagree.at oral argument,jones counsel conceded that our interpretation of final order in section c a should be guided by the meaning of final decision in,and in particular,by this court construction of that phrase in domino sugar sugar workers local union,cir.in domino sugar,the district court dismissed the plaintiff complaint without prejudice for failure to exhaust contractual grievance and arbitration remedies,and the plaintiff appealed.in holding that section permitted that appeal,we ruled that the district court dismissal of a complaint without prejudice could be treated as a final order under section only if the grounds for dismissal clearly indicate that no amendment in the complaint could cure the defects in the plaintiff case.id.at alteration and quotation marks omitted quoting coniston village of hoffman estates,cir.on the particular facts,we reasoned that the district court had essentially made a final ruling that the plaintiff had to proceed to arbitration before seeking judicial relief,and that the grounds of the dismissal made clear that no amendment could cure the defects in the company case.id.alterations omitted quoting coniston,at.
in this case,the district court dismissal without prejudice is likewise a final order under the domino sugar test.as in domino sugar,the district court here did not identify any defect that could possibly be cured by mere amendment of the petition rather,the district court held that no such petition could proceed without prior authorization from this court.accordingly,we conclude that the dismissal without prejudice of jones petition was a final order within the meaning of section c a.
jones contends that the dismissal was not a final order but,instead,a collateral order,and thus that the certificate of appealability requirement of section c should not apply.this characterization is intuitively implausible dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction terminated all proceedings in the district court,so the order was plainly not collateral to any pending proceedings.more basically,however,jones argument rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of the collateral order doctrine.that doctrine treats certain interlocutory orders as final for purposes of appeal,on the grounds that such collateral orders present issues that are independently ripe for immediate appellate review,despite the pendency of further proceedings in the district court.see,coopers lybrand livesay,d describing a collateral order as one that must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment cohen beneficial industrial loan.in other words,collateral orders are final orders they are final decisions within the meaning of section.see cohen,at.we hold this order appealable under because it is a final disposition of a claimed right emphasis added.to characterize the district court order in this case as a collateral order even if such a characterization were but confirm our conclusion that it is a final order within the meaning of section c.
jones contends that,even if the dismissal of his petition was a final order,it was not an order in a habeas corpus proceeding under section c a.he points out that the supreme court has held that a habeas corpus case is not pending until a habeas corpus application is filed a case does not become pending until an actual application for habeas corpus relief is filed in federal court.woodford garceau,d.because no successive habeas petition could be filed without prior authorization from this court under section b a,jones contends that his attempt to file a successive petition failed to initiate a federal habeas case.therefore,he argues,the order dismissing his petition was not an order in a habeas corpus proceeding.in support of this conclusion,he points out that,because the district court deemed his habeas petition to be plainly unauthorized and successive,the district court filed his petition for administrative purposes only.he thus contends that the district court did not file the petition in the proper,legally effective sense of that word.see b a before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court,the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.emphases added.rather than a habeas corpus proceeding,jones argues that the attempted filing of his petition in the district court initiated merely an unsuccessful preliminary proceeding to a habeas corpus proceeding.
although jones argument has some superficial appeal,we do not believe that his distinction between administrative filing and legally effective filing of the habeas application can bear the weight he places on it.it seems much more natural to interpret woodford to hold that a habeas corpus case does not become pending until an actual application for habeas corpus relief is filed in federal court by the petitioner,at,regardless of whether the district court files that application for administrative purposes only.see artuz bennett,d a habeas application is filed,as that term is commonly understood,when it is delivered to,and accepted by,the appropriate court officer for placement into the official record.and an application is properly filed when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings.citations omitted emphasis in original identifying the coa requirement of section as a precondition to proper filing.
however,we need not reach the issue of whether woodford includes applica
