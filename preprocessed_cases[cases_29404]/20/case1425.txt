kevin keith moves this court for an order authorizing the district court to consider a second or successive habeas corpus petition under.because keith motion does not make a prima facie showing that no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense,b b ii,we deny the motion.
keith was convicted in an ohio court for a triple murder and sentenced to death.the state alleged that keith had been a local drug dealer indicted in connection with a police raid and had killed two women and a child as retaliation against rudel chatman,the man suspected of the cooperation that facilitated the raid.two victims of the shooting,one child and one adult,survived and both testified at keith trial.keith was also connected to the crime by another eyewitness and by circumstantial physical evidence regarding a car he was known to drive and spent gun casings.
after exhausting his appeals in the ohio courts and unsuccessfully moving for relief,keith filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal district court in september,alleging nine grounds for relief.the district court denied relief on all grounds.a certificate of appealability was issued on three questions,each involving the penalty phase.this court affirmed the denial of relief.keith mitchell,cir.
keith filed his current motion on august,asserting that newly discovered evidence reveals violations of brady maryland,d,and napue illinois,d.first,keith argues that there was exculpatory evidence uncovered during the pharmacy board investigation of a string of pharmacy robberies that occurred contemporaneously with the murders.the board files included a statement from rodney witness at keith a confidential informant that melton had been paid to cripple the man who was responsible for the raids in crestline,ohio last week.the files also contained notes from an interview with melton accomplice who corroborated the confidential informant report that melton claimed to have been offered payment to murder rudel chatman.second,keith claims that the nurse who did not testify at trial who told the police that a survivor,richard warren,identified keith as the shooter was incorrectly named during police testimony.the detective testified that amy gimmets called him about warren statement when in fact no person at the time or ever with that name worked at the hospital.instead,keith claims that the nurse on duty who called the detective was actually amy wishman.now that her true identity has been discovered,wishman claims in an affidavit that she never heard a name from warren nor did she tell the detective that she did.keith alleges that these new facts cast sufficient doubt on his conviction that,if proven,no reasonable juror could have found him guilty of the murders.
keith filed his habeas corpus petition in september,after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa and therefore the provisions of that act apply to this case.see keith,at.in order to obtain our permission to file a second or successive petition under that statute,a movant must overcome its provisions and make a prima facie showing that his application presents a claim that relies on a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive by the supreme court or presents facts that could not have been discovered previously and tend to show actual innocence.b.because keith does not make an argument relying on a new rule of law,he must demonstrate that 
b i the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence and 
ii the facts underlying the claim,if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.
b.the court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second or successive application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of b.b c.prima facie in this context means simply sufficient allegations of fact together with some documentation that would warrant a fuller exploration in the district court.in re lott,cir.accordingly,we do not need to find that keith claim compels relief as written,but we still must determine whether his allegations require a district court to engage in additional analysis in order to ascertain whether but for the constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty.in re mcdonald,cir.if,viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,b b ii,keith motion does not make such a showing,we may not authorize the district court to hear the habeas application.b c.
keith two claims of constitutional without deciding that the evidence could not have been previously discovered and would,in fact,demonstrate constitutional involve relevant facts,but ones which do not go to the ultimate question of guilt.this showing alone is insufficient to overcome aedpa presumption against repeat federal relitigation of state convictions.see in re williams,cir denying a motion for a successive application because e vidence of pending charges against a government witness could be used for impeachment,but that alone does not satisfy williams burden.and,while a recantation supports williams assertion of innocence,it does not clearly and convincingly outweigh unimpeached eyewitness testimony.
taken at full face value,the evidence that keith says was not previously discoverable tends to establish two separate propositions.the first is straightforward.the evidence from the pharmacy board shows that rodney melton contemporaneously claimed that he had a possible motive to commit the murders.he had told several people that he had agreed to cripple rudel chatman for his suspected participation in providing information that led to the police raid earlier that month.thus,this could imply a motive to kill people close to chatman.
understanding the second proposition requires greater familiarity with the record.keith evidence shows that the detective testifying to warren initial identification in the hospital gave a garbled version of the name amy wishman as the person who originally heard warren mention kevin keith as the killer.because wishman now denies hearing keith name,keith evidence undermines the credibility of this police testimony and,therefore,its ability to corroborate the eyewitness account provided by warren himself.
even taken without reference to the rest of the record,it is a stretch to say that the fact that another person had a motive and that an eyewitness original identification may have occurred during a police interview and not independent of it could constitute clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable fact finder could have returned a guilty verdict.our other cases,to be sure,have described the prima facie requirement as lenient,lott,at,or not a difficult showing,in re bowling,cir,but those cases have involved new evidence that went to the heart of a guilt determination or directly contradicted the government.see,mcdonald,at key prosecution witness recanted lott,at prosecutor withheld evidence that victim,prior to dying,identified a person of different skin color than defendant.keith allegations do not rise to this level and warrant no additional analysis to determine whether he meets the statutory requirements.mcdonald,at.the difference between those cases and this one is critical to why keith has not made a sufficient showing.notwithstanding the dissent assertion that the new evidence attacks the strongest evidence presented against keith,it does not contradict any evidence that directly proves guilt.melton may have had a motive and a stated intention to carry it out and the police witness may have testified incorrectly and so would not be able to corroborate warren testimony,but those propositions,taken at full value,do not mean that no reasonable fact finder would find keith guilty.
moreover,when viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,b b ii,keith new evidence is particularly lacking.the core of the case,as recounted by this court,against keith included 
eyewitness testimony of the survivor warren identifying keith 
a partial imprint of the license plate made from the snowbank where the getaway car crashed matched the license plate of a car he was known to have access to 
eyewitness identification of him as the man driving the getaway car when it crashed 
a spent bullet cartridge casing matching the ones recovered from the scene of the murders was found where keith later picked up his girlfriend and 
testimony that keith had been indicted as a result of the drug raid precipitated by the victims relative.
see keith,at.
keith new evidence does not contradict any of this case.combined with other facts known about melton at the time of his car is similar to the getaway car,that his build is similar to the killer,that the victim daughter identified melton brother as the shooter,and that melton told chatman when they met at the hospital after the shootings that the killings were motivated by unspecified argues that the evidence of melton motive casts doubt on the jury verdict.but keith had the same revenge motive as melton and it was he,not melton,who was identified by two witnesses as being involved in the crime.indeed,fully crediting all the allegations against melton at best introduces doubt but it can not,after any amount of district court analysis,demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable juror could find keith guilty.
similarly,the attack on the credibility of the identification at best introduces doubt but does not foreclose keith guilt.sawyer whitley,d t his sort of evidence brought to impeach a prosecution witness will seldom,if ever,make a clear and convincing showing that no reasonable juror would have believed the heart of the witness account of petitioner actions.and even where a witness initial identification is impliedly suspect,as keith alleges here,our system of adjudication permits subsequent identifications on the strength of the witness ability to observe the criminal independent of the circumstances of the first identification.see neil biggers,d.here,notwithstanding keith evidence,warren still would have testified to his identification based on his experience as a victim.the dissent emphasizes that this new evidence strengthens the case that warren was improperly influenced.we agree that this makes warren testimony marginally less credible,but disagree that it is a fatal blow.it attacks only a corroborating witness.even if the implication of keith evidence is accepted,warren eyewitness testimony still strongly supports keith guilt.
and it bears repeating,neither proposition,if proven by keith,demonstrates that no reasonable fact finder could find keith guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.in light of the balance of evidence left uncontroverted by these eyewitness placing him at the scene the partial match of the license plate and the matching gun has not made the prima facie showing that permits us,under aedpa,to authorize a second or successive habeas corpus application.accordingly,we deny keith motion.
keith moves this court for an order directing the district court to consider his application for a second or successive habeas petition pursuant to b.we are not being asked to rule on the merits of the habeas corpus petition,and instead are asked to determine whether keith has made sufficient allegations of fact together with some documentation that would warrant a fuller exploration of the new evidence in the district court.in re lott,cir.considering,as we are required to do,keith substantial new evidence together with the lack of physical evidence against keith,and the weakness of the eyewitness testimony presented at trial,we can and should conclude that the new evidence warrants further exploration.consequently,i respectfully dissent.
we can authorize the filing of keith application if we determine that keith has made a prima facie showing that the facts underlying the claim,if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.b b ii,b c.
this court has explained that a prima facie showing is not a difficult standard to meet.in re mcdonald,cir.prima facie in this context means simply sufficient allegations of fact together with some documentation that would warrant a fuller exploration in the district court.lott,at quoting bennett united states,cir.
because the facts underlying keith claim must be viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,the evidence supporting keith conviction warrants further discussion.keith was convicted of a triple homicide that took place in and was sentenced to death.the prosecution theory of the case was that keith murdered family members of rudel chatman to exact revenge for chatman assistance in an investigation that led to a drug trafficking raid and indictments against keith and members of his family.two victims survived the shooting.
the prosecution star witness at trial was richard warren,an adult surviving victim,who selected keith from a photo lineup and reiterated the identification at trial.the prosecution also presented nancy smathers,who testified that on the night of the murders,she heard shots,looked outside her window,observed a large stocky man jump into a car,and observed the car crash into a snow bank.in her first two statements to the police smathers was unable to identify the assailant,but in her third statement,made after seeing keith on a television news story,she identified the assailant as keith.there was also eyewitness testimony from quanita reeves,a surviving victim,but reeves told police that she was shot at by her daddy friend,bruce and excluded the picture of keith from a photo lineup.
keith was also connected to the crime by circumstantial physical evidence.investigators made a cast of a tire tread and a cast of a partial license plate indentation from the snow bank identified by smathers.the partial license plate number,matched the last three numbers of a car to which keith was known to have access.the prosecution presented evidence that prior to the shooting,the car owner had purchased tires that were similar in tread design to the tread in the snow bank.investigators testified that they had collected spent gun casings from the crime scene,and found a matching casing at the entrance to a general electric plant where keith picked up his girlfriend from work on the night of the murders.
the defense challenged the identification made by warren,presenting evidence that warren had been improperly influenced and that the identification was inconsistent with other statements he had made.the defense also presented an alibi for keith and attempted to cast suspicion on the melton brothers,who had been arrested in a string of pharmacy burglaries and who had told rudel chatman that his family had been shot because of chatman snitching.finally,the defense challenged the testimony of smathers,arguing that her description of the assailant was consistent with rodney melton,and submitting evidence that the license plate matched the first three numbers of a license plate registered to melton.at the conclusion of the jury trial,keith was convicted of the murders and sentenced to death.
as the basis for his application,keith submits new evidence that he alleges was withheld by the prosecution in violation of brady maryland,d.this evidence falls into two categories new evidence that supports a contention that rodney melton committed the murders,and new evidence that relates to the identification made by eyewitness richard warren.
first,keith presents new evidence that implicates rodney melton in the murders.although the majority dismisses keith submissions as evidence that could imply that melton had a motive to kill people close to chatman,slip op.at,the evidence goes well beyond this.the new evidence includes evidence from a file in another investigation in which an informant told police that,two weeks before the shooting,rodney melton stated that he had been paid to cripple the man who was
