in this appeal,petitioner donald ray robertson,a prisoner of the state of louisiana,seeks review of a district court order denying his petition for federal habeas relief.specifically,robertson contends that an erroneous jury instruction deprived him of his fourteenth amendment due process rights.the state of louisiana admits that the jury instruction was contrary to clearly established federal law,but it argues that robertson is not entitled to federal habeas relief because the error was harmless.
in order to resolve this appeal,we must decide whether the standard for harmless error analysis articulated in brecht abrahamson,d,remains viable precedent after the enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.we hold that aedpa restrictions on federal review of state habeas decisions do not alter brecht mandate for harmless error analysis by federal courts when state courts have failed to address the question of harmless error.we further hold that the specific jury instruction on the law of principals given in this case violated clearly established federal law by improperly relieving the prosecution of the burden of proving an essential element of the crime namely,the defendant specific intent to kill.see sandstrom montana,d flowers blackburn,cir state west,so d.finally,applying the brecht standard to the record in this case,we conclude that the state trial court erroneous jury instruction did have a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brecht abrahamson,at.accordingly,we reverse the district court judgment denying federal habeas relief and remand.
petitioner donald ray robertson is currently serving a life sentence in the louisiana state penitentiary.in january,robertson was convicted in state court on two counts of murder in the first degree for his role in the murders of clayton jones and curtis hardy on direct appeal,robertson challenged his conviction on account of several evidentiary errors at trial and the insufficiency of the evidence against him,and robertson conviction was affirmed by the louisiana court of appeal for the fourth circuit.see state robertson,so d.
robertson did not seek direct review of his conviction by the louisiana supreme court,but he did file three applications for relief in louisiana state court.robertson filed his first application for relief with the state trial court in august.in that first application,robertson raised three claims,including ineffective assistance of counsel,erroneous introduction of hearsay evidence,and denial of constitutional due process based on an improper jury instruction on the law of principals.the trial court denied robertson application without written comment,and the louisiana court of appeal for the fourth circuit affirmed this decision,finding each of robertson claims to be without merit.see state robertson,slip op.at.with respect to robertson due process claim,the louisiana fourth circuit specifically held that the jury instruction on the law of principals was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the relator had the requisite specific intent,slip op.at.robertson sought review of this decision in the louisiana supreme court,but it declined robertson writ application.see state robertson,so d.
in june,robertson filed a second application for relief,arguing that his conviction was unconstitutional and that his sentence was,therefore,illegal.this second request was also denied by the state trial court,by the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal,and ultimately by the louisiana supreme court.see state ex rel.robertson whitley,so d.
in october,in his third and final application in state court,robertson reiterated his due process objection to the jury instruction on the law of principals that was given in his murder trial.this time,the state trial court agreed with robertson claim and granted robertson a new trial based on sandstrom montana,d flowers blackburn,cir and state west,so d.however,the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal granted the state application for a supervisory writ and reversed the trial court determination,holding robertson application by article of the louisiana code of criminal procedure.see state robertson,slip op.at.the louisiana supreme court also denied robertson writ application,citing article.see state ex rel.robertson state,so d citing crim.proc.
robertson then filed his instant pro se petition for relief under in the eastern district of louisiana.once again,robertson argued that the state trial court jury instruction on the law of principals violated the due process holdings of sandstrom montana,flowers blackburn,and state west by relieving the prosecution of its burden of proving that robertson had a specific intent to kill.the district court initially dismissed robertson petition with prejudice on the grounds that the petition was untimely under d a,but a panel of this court reversed that ruling and remanded robertson case with instructions to the district court to consider the merits of robertson petition.see robertson cain,cir,unpublished granting robertson request for a certificate of appealability and reversing the district court dismissal with prejudice based on smith ward,cir.
on remand,a magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant habeas relief on account of the erroneous jury instruction.in response,the respondent filed a formal objection to the magistrate report and recommendation,arguing first that the jury instruction was not as prejudicial as the constitutionally defective instructions in flowers and west and second that any error in the jury instruction was harmless.the district court sustained the respondent objections and denied robertson petition.the district court recognized that the state court jury instruction was contrary to clearly established federal law nevertheless,the district court concluded that it should deny robertson petition for federal habeas relief because robertson failed to show that the state court constitutionally erroneous jury instruction was also an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.in addition,the district court held that the erroneous jury instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,applying the harmless error standard in chapman california,d.
we granted robertson a certificate of appealability on march.
on appeal from the denial of a petition,this court reviews a district court findings of fact for clear error,and it reviews a district court conclusions of law de novo,applying the same standard of review to the state court decision as the district court.donahue cain,cir.mixed questions of law and fact,such as the district court assessment of harmless error,are also reviewed de novo.jones cain,cir.
because robertson filed his petition for federal habeas relief in april,our review is under,as amended by aedpa.see lindh murphy,d.under aedpa,a federal court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a state prisoner unless the adjudication of the petitioner claim in state court resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.a state court decision will be contrary to clearly established federal law when it reaches a legal conclusion in direct opposition to a prior decision of the united states supreme court or when it reaches a different conclusion than the united states supreme court on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.kutzner johnson,cir.moreover,a state court decision will be an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law whenever the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case in an objectively unreasonable manner.id.citing williams taylor,d,writing for the court.
the district court read d to impose a requirement on robertson to show that the state court adjudication of his jury instruction claim was both contrary to clearly established federal law and an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.it,therefore,held simultaneously that the state court decision was contrary to but not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.the district court reading of d is wrong as a matter of law as decided by the united states supreme court.the plain language of d is unmistakably disjunctive,and the supreme court has held that independent meaning must be given to both the statute contrary to clause and its unreasonable application of clause.see williams taylor,at,for the court noting that the writ of habeas corpus may issue only if one of the two conditions in d is satisfied emphasis added.thus,under d,robertson should be entitled to federal habeas relief if he can show that the state court adjudication of his claim was either contrary to clearly established federal law or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the united states supreme court.see d emphasis added.
robertson argues that the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal habeas decision upholding the state trial court jury instruction on the law of principals was contrary to the fourteenth amendment due process guarantees clearly established in in re winship,d,and sandstrom montana,d.in winship and sandstrom,the supreme court clearly declared unconstitutional any jury instruction that relieved the state of its fourteenth amendment burden of proving every element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt.see sandstrom,at.citing winship,at.at the close of robertson trial for first degree murder,the state court gave the jury an instruction on the law of principals that falls short on one of the elements of first degree,specific intent to kill 
next ladies and gentlemen of the jury,the court will charge you as to the law as it pertains to principles sic.our law provides as follows all persons concerned in the commission of a crime whether present or absent and whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense aid and abet in its commission or directly or indirectly counsel or procure another to commit the crime,are principles sic.
in other words to be concerned in the commission of a crime it must be shown that the person or persons charged did something knowingly and intentionally in furtherance of a common design or to put it another way that they or he aided,abetted and assisted in the perpetuation of the offense.all persons knowing the unlawful intent of the person committing the crime who are present and consented thereto in aiding and abetting either by furnishing the weapons of the attack,encouraging by words or gestures,or endeavoring at the time of the commission of the offense to secure the safety or the concealment of the offender,are principals and are equal offenders and are subject to the same punishment.
to render one guilty as a principle sic he must have committed the offense himself or in some way participated in the commission of the crime,or he must have aided,assisted or abetted the actual perpetratro sic of the deed before it might be said that he was concerned in the commission of the crime.
state record.this jury instruction is virtually identical to the one that this court found to be unconstitutional in flowers blackburn,at decided nine days before robertson first degree murder convictions,and it violates winship and sandstrom for essentially the same reasons stated in flowers.as this court explained in flowers,under louisiana state law,the prosecution must show that a defendant had the specific intent to kill in order to prove murder in the first degree.see flowers,at quoting state holmes,so d.the jury instruction in robertson murder trial,like the jury instruction in flowers,plainly relieve d the state of the burden of proof enunciated in winship on the critical question of state of mind by telling the jury that the jury could convict a ll persons knowing the unlawful intent of the person committing the crime who were present as equal offenders subject to the same punishment.see flowers,at quoting sandstrom,at.in effect,the jury instruction relieved the state of the burden of proving robertson specific intent to kill.see id.considering the charge as a whole,a reasonable juror could have concluded that the state needed to show only that one of the other persons implicated in the crime had the specific intent to kill in order to convict robertson of first degree murder.see id.this result is contrary to the governing rule established in winship and its progeny,including sandstrom.
in its habeas decision upholding robertson erroneous jury instruction,the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal did not refer to the supreme court decisions in sandstrom or to this court decision in flowers blackburn,but,because robertson specifically relied on these decisions in his first petition for state habeas relief,we assume that the state court was aware of these decisions.see catalan cockrell,cir.however,even if we assume that the state court identified the correct constitutional principles governing this case,see williams taylor,at,we must conclude that the louisiana fourth circuit either disregarded those principles or applied those principles unreasonably to the jury instruction at hand.the holding of the louisiana fourth the jury instruction on the law of principals was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the relator had the requisite specific intent can not be squared with the constitutional principles articulated in winship or sandstrom for the reasons articulated by this court in flowers,at,and by the louisiana supreme court in state west,so d,the louisiana fourth circuit should have recognized that the jury instruction allowed the jury to convict robertson of first degree murder based on much less than what was required by louisiana law and,therefore,violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.the fourth circuit failure to recognize this constitutional failing makes its decision contrary to sandstrom.robertson,therefore,has clearly satisfied the requirements of d in this case.
the respondent does not dispute that robertson jury instruction violated the constitutional due process holdings of winship and sandstrom nor does he seriously defend the louisiana court of appeal erroneous ruling upholding the constitutionality of that jury instruction.the respondent argues only that federal habeas relief is unwarranted because the erroneous jury instruction was a harmless error 
on direct appeal,when faced with a constitutional violation,a court must reverse the judgment of the court below unless the constitutional error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see chapman california,d.however,in brecht abrahamson,d,the supreme court articulated a less onerous standard for assessing the impact of a state court constitutional error on collateral review.under brecht,a federal court may grant habeas relief on account of constitutional error only if it determines that the constitutional error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.see id.at.quoting kotteakos united states.under this standard,however,the petitioner should prevail whenever the record is so evenly balanced that a conscientious judge is in grave doubt as to the harmlessness of the error.mcaninch,d.as this court has explained,if our minds are in virtual equipoise as to the harmlessness under the brecht standard,of the error,then we must conclude that it was harmful.woods johnson,cir quoting,at.
in this appeal,however,robertson argues that,under aedpa,the brecht is,a separate standard for harmless error in federal habeas no longer applicable to constitutional errors arising in state habeas cases.robertson argues that,under aedpa restrictive review of state court decisions,the federal habeas court is required to review only whether the state court decision is contrary to or an unreasonable application of chapman and grant relief accordingly.robertson argues that where,as in this case,the state court has failed to apply chapman at all,then the federal courts should do what the state court was required to do,but failed to do,that is,apply chapman to determine whether the constitutional error is harmless.
in past cases under aedpa,this court has recognized that there has been some doubt among the federal circuit courts about whether the brecht standard for harmless error remains applicable after aedpa.see,tucker johnson,cir citing cases hernandez johnson,cir dennis,dissenting citing cases.in whitmore kemna,cir,the eighth circuit suggested that aedpa might be interpreted to limit the scope of collateral federal review of harmless error and thereby abrogate the requirement that federal courts conduct an independent harmless error analysis under brecht,at least in cases where the state court has already conducted a harmless error review of the alleged constitutional trial error.see whitmore,at suggesting in dicta that a state court assessment of harmless error is entitled to the same deference under as any other state court determination of fact or law.similarly,in noble kelly,cir per curiam,the second circuit noted an open question about whether federal courts should now apply a mixed standard and examine whether the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of chapman.see noble,at.since kemna and noble,however,the supreme court has implicitly acknowledged the vitality of brecht independent harmless error analysis in federal habeas cases brought under aedpa.see penry johnson,d noting that even if the petitioner could satisfy the requirements of d,the petitioner would still have to show that the alleged error had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict quoting brecht,at.internal quotations and citations omitted.moreover,all of the courts of appeals that have squarely decided the question have concluded that brecht independent standard for harmless error continues to be appropriate in federal habeas cases,even after the enactment of aedpa.see herrera lemaster,cir en banc sanna dipaolo,cir nevers killinger,cir abrogated on other grounds by harris stovall,cir.see also little kern county superior court,cir applying brecht,in addition to the requirements of aedpa,without comment.
our own consideration of brecht and of aedpa also persuades us that brecht survives aedpa enactment.as other courts have recognized,brecht sets forth a standard for harmless error analysis that was intended to apply to all federal habeas cases involving constitutional trial error.see,herrera,at citing brecht,at.rehnquist,writing for the court and at.stevens,concurring we can assume that congress was aware of brecht when it enacted aedpa,yet nothing in the text or the legislative history of aedpa specifically or generally alludes to an alteration in the application of federal harmless error doctrine to a state court decision.in fact,the plain language of aedpa says only that habeas relief shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim is either contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as defined by the supreme court,or based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.see d.the statutory language itself does not require federal habeas courts to grant relief reflexively.the words of the statute simply can not be read to bar federal courts from further examination and review of state habeas claims based on additional standards established by supreme court precedent,especially when those standards are not inconsistent with the language and purpose of aedpa.it is clear to us that the principles embodied in aedpa are fully consistent with brecht standard for harmless error and with brecht observations concerning the limited role of the federal courts in habeas cases.in brecht the supreme court adopted a more lenient harmless error standard in federal review of habeas cases out of respect for the sovereign states interests in the integrity of their own judicial processes and the finality of convictions that have survived direct review within the state court systems.see brecht,at.noting that liberal allowance of the writ degrades the prominence of the trial itself and encourages petitioners to relitigate their claims on collateral review citations and quotations omitted.in a similar vein,aedpa was enacted,at least in part,to ensure comity,finality,and deference to state court habeas determinations by limiting the scope of collateral review and raising the standard for federal habeas relief,see d calderon thompson,d noting that judicial limits on habeas relief generally comport with the purpose of aedpa williams taylor,d noting that congress indubitably intended aedpa to further the principles of comity,finality,and federalism,and application of the brecht standard to state court decisions parallels this congressional intent.
thus,we hold that,in cases governed by aedpa,federal habeas courts should continue to analyze the harmlessness of all state court decisions involving a constitutional trial error according to the brecht standard.we therefore proceed with a brecht analysis of the harmlessness of the sandstrom error in this case 
in this case,a jury found robertson guilty of the first degree murder of curtis hardy and clayton jones.the question before us is whether the state trial court erroneous jury instruction had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.brecht abrahamson,at.
the state established that hardy and jones were each shot in the head at close range and killed sometime late at night on may or early in the morning on may.the victims bodies were discovered by officers of the new orleans police department in an abandoned brown chevy malibu on the morning of may the victims were apparently last seen alive at robertson house between and on the night of may.robertson girlfriend,consuela marie washington,testified that,on the evening in question,she arrived home to learn that robertson was apparently meeting with curtis hardy in a back room of the house washington testified that,about an hour later,she saw hardy outside her house being led with his hands behind his back from her yard to a blue car by two men,whom she later identified as david west and gerald gerrell.washington testified that,at the time she saw hardy being taken away,she called hardy girlfriend,lola king,and told king what she had seen about an hour later,around or midnight,robertson left the house,telling washington that he was going to the liquor store.
a voluntary statement that robertson made to police shortly after being charged with first degree murder provided the jury with further evidence about the night in question.in this statement robertson said that,on the night in question,he had received an electronic page from hardy and that they agreed that hardy would come to robertson house to buy drugs.while robertson was waiting for hardy,david west and gerald gerrell arrived.although robertson did not know gerrell,robertson agreed to give gerrell drugs in exchange for a tape player.eventually,hardy arrived with curtis jones.hardy went inside the house to meet with robertson,while jones stayed outside with west and gerrell.according to robertson statement,robertson sold hardy drugs and the two discussed possible future drug deals.then,hardy left the house.robertson said that,a short while later,he opened his front door and was surprised to see west and gerrell still standing on his front porch talking.robertson said that he subsequently left the house around midnight to go to the liquor store to buy beer.on his way back from the liquor store,west and gerrell pulled up alongside robertson in a blue plymouth valiant,and the two men offered to give robertson a ride home.robertson said that when he got into the front passenger seat of the car,he felt that the seat was wet.reaching behind him,in the seat,robertson discovered a bloody towel and a bloody shirt and saw that he had blood on his own hands and clothes.robertson said h
