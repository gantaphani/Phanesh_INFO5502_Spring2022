petitioners appeal from the district court denial of habeas corpus relief.they contend that,at their sentencing for armed robbery of the sunday worship services at a north carolina church,the state trial judge impermissibly made references to religion,thereby violating their rights to due process.but the defendants choice to target a church during weekly services imbued their crime with an undeniably religious character.crimes of this nature carry special hazards for the freedom of all faiths to worship undisturbed.far from being an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,d,the trial judge comments reflected the distinctive harms to the community of the particular crime that the defendants chose to commit.we therefore affirm the denial of the petition.
petitioners josiah deyton,his coworker jonathan koniak,and his brother andrew deyton formulated a plan to rob sunday services at a church in mitchell county,north carolina.on april,the conspirators met and cased possible churches to target,ultimately choosing to rob the ridgeview presbyterian church in the belief that it would provide the greatest chance both of success and of escape.
wearing ski masks and gloves,the defendants barged into the sunday morning worship service,carrying firearms to intimidate the congregation and duct tape to secure submission.the men seized the parish weekly collection,and used the offertory plate to amass money,keys,and other valuables from the worshipers,amounting to.koniak bound one parishioner with the tape,and josiah deyton gun discharged while he was stealing a cell phone.the men threatened the assembled congregation,warning that they would come back to kill the churchgoers if they tried to call the police.the three then absconded in their getaway car.
undeterred,congregation members called the police,reported the robbery,and provided a description of the car.shortly thereafter,police apprehended the robbers,finding in their car the guns,masks,and gloves used in the crime.police recovered from the car a large quantity of cash and some personal property taken from members of the congregation.the three men were arrested and subsequently confessed to robbing the church and its members.
on july,josiah and andrew deyton pleaded guilty to eleven counts of armed robbery and one count of conspiracy to commit armed robbery in the superior court of mitchell county.koniak pleaded guilty to the same charges a month later.after koniak guilty plea,judge james baker,held a consolidated sentencing hearing for all three defendants.during the lengthy proceeding,judge baker heard from the state,from defense counsel,from members of the congregation who had been robbed by the defendants,and from witnesses attesting to the defendants good character.judge baker also reviewed victim impact statements that had been provided by other members of the church not present at the hearing.before imposing sentence,judge baker spoke at length about the severity of the defendants crime and related directly the words and feelings of those who were affected by it 
i was interested in reading what the church members might have thought that should be done to you and the church members after describing what they went through have indicated that the experience was a horrible experience for them.i mean even more so than being robbed in a store or being robbed on a street or a highway or even worse than being broken in in their home.i mean if there one place in the whole world that you ought to have the right to feel like that for just a few minutes for just a few minutes you can put the dangers of the world away and that you can step to some degree of peace and solitude and serenity with some degree of safety it would be in a church.
i think it was very appropriate what one person wrote that coming in god house using god as a curse and to make people give up their possessions and taking god money and threatening god people,i ca imagine how evil these men are to have done this.that is the feeling of one person and i hope you realize that an opinion that is or a feeling that is justified.i mean you did just steal money from people.you took god money.you took the lord money and those of us that believe that there is an almighty and that there is a being that created this world to go in and then steal money that is being tendered by people for the furtherance of an earthly kingdom is just outrageous 
gentlemen,this is just something that ca be tolerated and your attorneys have all asked for leniency and mercy but there are times when you have to kind of draw the line and you have to say that there are some things that just ca be tolerated by society.i mean you ca just go in a church armed and tie people up or hold them at gunpoint,threaten to kill them and rob the collection plate and rob them while they are in the worship service and expect that the law is not going to come down just about as strongly as it can on you.there is scripture that says vengeance is mine sayeth the lord but every now and then i think the judicial system has to contribute what it can.
judge baker then sentenced all three defendants to ten consecutive sentences of to months on the armed robbery counts,and a suspended sentence of to months on the conspiracy charge.petitioners took no direct appeal of that sentence.
on august,following the north carolina state procedure for collateral attacks on criminal convictions,petitioners filed motions for appropriate relief in the superior court of mitchell county,alleging,as they do here,that judge baker comments reflected an impermissible religious bias that infected the sentencing procedure in violation of due process.on may,the state mar court denied the petitioners motion,concluding that nothing motivated the sentencing judge,except for the atrocious conduct of the defendant and his cohorts in accomplishing the crimes they committed.on june,the petitioners sought certiorari from the north carolina court of appeals,which was denied on june.on june,petitioners simultaneously filed a petition for certiorari with the north carolina supreme court and a petition for habeas corpus in the western district of north carolina.the federal magistrate judge held the habeas corpus petition in abeyance pending the resolution of the state certiorari petition,which was denied on august.on november,the magistrate judge recommended that the habeas corpus petition be denied.on september,the district court adopted the magistrate report and recommendation and issued its own memorandum and order denying the petition.this appeal followed.
we review the district court denial of a petition for habeas corpus de novo.lewis wheeler,cir.because the petitioners challenge stems from comments made by the trial judge at a state sentencing proceeding,however,we must show the traditional deference afforded to sentencing courts before concluding that there was constitutional error warranting habeas relief.
federal courts have long respected the latitude allowed by state law to state judges at sentencing.see williams new york.perhaps more than in any other proceeding,the court has considerable leeway and discretion in governing the conduct of a sentencing.state smith.
the north carolina courts have been unequivocal in their support of this tradition,especially in a context such as that before us here.for example,in state sullivan,the north carolina supreme court held that it would not restrict informal remarks made by a judge at the time of pronouncing judgment,particularly when,as in this case,the undisputed facts,plus the defendant plea of guilty,justified a substantial sentence.id.at.north carolina has been clear that whether or not a reviewing court approve s of the judge extended remarks,reversal is not warranted so long as the evidence in th e case justified the sentence imposed.state bright.
north carolina view is typical of sentencing practice generally.comments on the severity of a crime have long been integral to the imposition of punishment.courts have always taken into consideration the harm done by the defendant in imposing sentence.payne tennessee,d.a sentencing judge need not merely
