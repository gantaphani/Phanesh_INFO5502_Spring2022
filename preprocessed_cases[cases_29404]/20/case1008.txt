appellant joseph earl bates was sentenced to death for the murder of charles edwin jenkins.bates does not contest the fact that he committed the murder.after exhausting state challenges to the sentence imposed by the state courts,bates petitioned the united states district court for the middle district of north carolina for a writ of habeas corpus under.the district court found no merit in his claims and dismissed the petition.we now affirm.
on august,two fishermen discovered charles jenkins body floating in the yadkin river,in yadkin county,north carolina.the victim ankles and wrists were bound by rope,his legs and arms were,and a rope was tied around his neck.while investigating the murder,two police officers went to bates house to speak with him.at that time,the officers obtained a piece of paper and some molding from bates home having what appeared to be bloodstains on it.the following day,bates gave a confession,in which he admitted to beating,kidnapping,and then shooting the victim in the neck.bates was indicted for kidnapping and murder.
the facts surrounding the crime are undisputed.some time in late july or early august,someone broke into and fired gunshots into bates home,causing bates to set up a temporary campsite on his employer hal eddleman property.around this same time bates told his friend,gary shaver,that he could kill someone.
on august,bates called eddleman and told eddleman to meet him at the bridge later that evening because something was going down.eddleman went to the bridge as instructed,but bates never came to meet him.the next evening bates and shaver went to a night club.at approximately,bates instructed a waitress to ask billy grimes,another friend,to telephone eddleman.bates told her that grimes and eddleman would know what was going on.
at approximately,jenkins asked bates and shaver for a ride home.during the ride,bates asked jenkins if he knew bates and her new boyfriend,and jenkins replied that he did.bates stopped twice during the ride.during the second stop,bates struck jenkins three times on the back of the head with a shovel,appearing to knock him unconscious.when jenkins began to moan,bates struck him again,him,and then placed him in the vehicle.
on the way back to his campsite,bates stopped at eddleman house and told eddleman that he got one of the mf.he then told grimes,i got one of the guys that been messing with me.do you want to watch or help grimes declined to help,as did shaver and eddleman.bates drove jenkins back to his campsite around 
at the campsite,bates loosened the ropes on jenkins and began asking jenkins who had shot into his home.jenkins mentioned two people who were involved,but did not say anything else.unsatisfied with jenkins response,bates then tied jenkins to a tree and went to his tent to retrieve a gun that he had borrowed from eddleman.bates put the gun up to jenkins throat,but jenkins repeated that he did not know for sure who had shot into bates home.bates then untied jenkins,took him to the back of the truck,and shot him in the neck.jenkins was lying near the back of the truck when bates shot him.in his confession,bates said he shot him because he acted like he knew who had shot into my house,he spit on me and told me to go to hell,and this made me mad and i shot him.
after rummaging through jenkins pockets,bates retied jenkins hands and feet and loaded him into the jeep.bates drove back to eddleman house,returned eddleman gun,and asked,w hat do you think i should do with the body.bates then left and threw the body into the yadkin river.
later that day bates discussed the murder with both eddleman and grimes.bates told eddleman,w ell,it do bother me all that bad.bates told grimes that he killed the victim because he would get no more time for murder than for kidnapping.
bates was indicted for kidnapping and murder.the state sought the death penalty.a jury found bates guilty of one count of first degree murder and one count of first degree kidnapping.he was sentenced to death for the first degree murder conviction.on appeal,the north carolina supreme court awarded bates a new trial based on an improper denial of bates motion for an ex parte hearing regarding his request for funds to employ a forensic psychologist.state bates.bates was retried,and a second jury found bates guilty of one count of first degree kidnapping and one count of first degree murder on the basis of both the felony murder rule and premeditation and deliberation.
during the closing argument of the penalty phase of the second trial,the prosecutor pointed out that jenkins mother,bates mother,and bates sister each cried while on the stand.the prosecutor then asked whether the jurors saw bates cry during the trial,or whether bates had presented any evidence of remorse.the prosecutor also commented that bates had been given the benefit of a lengthy trial and two good lawyers who would stand up and ask the jurors not to return the death penalty,because it was a lawyer job to do so.
the jury recommended the death sentence on the basis of the kidnapping and the especially heinous,atrocious,or cruel nature of the crime.on november,judge julius rousseau sentenced bates to death for the first degree murder conviction and to an additional forty years in prison for the kidnapping conviction.the supreme court of north carolina affirmed the conviction and sentence,state bates,and the united states supreme court denied certiorari,bates north carolina,d.
bates then filed a motion for appropriate relief.the north carolina superior court entered an order denying bates claims,and the supreme court of north carolina affirmed.state bates.
next,bates filed a petition for habeas corpus in the united states district court for the middle district of north carolina.on february,the district court adopted the magistrate recommendation to dismiss bates petition.bates lee.finding no substantial issue presented,the district court also declined to issue a certificate of appealability.id.bates now appeals.
federal courts entertaining collateral attacks on state convictions have only limited powers of judicial review.see williams taylor,d.under d,federal courts may not grant a writ of habeas corpus when a state court has already resolved the merits of a claim unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the court cases or confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from its precedent.williams,at.
a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case,id.at,or was unreasonable in refusing to extend the governing legal principle to a context in which the principle should have controlled.ramdass angelone,d opinion of kennedy.the supreme court has stressed the importance of the word unreasonable in the standard of review.under d unreasonable application clause a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.williams,at.
in this case,bates argues that the north carolina supreme court decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law because the trial court erroneously failed to instruct the jury on second degree murder the prosecutor closing comments during the penalty phase violated the defendant fifth amendment right to remain silent and his due process rights and the jury instructions on the heinous,atrocious or cruel aggravating circumstance were vague and overbroad in violation of the fifth,eighth and fourteenth amendments.we address each argument in turn.
first,bates contends that the north carolina courts unreasonably applied federal law by failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of second degree murder.bates argues that jenkins provoked him to commit the murder.this,in combination with other circumstances in his life at the time,constituted enough evidence to negate deliberation,and the trial court should have therefore instructed the jury on second degree murder.
in capital cases,due process requires the court to give an instruction on any lesser included offense when the evidence warrants such an instruction.beck alabama,d.but a defendant is not entitled to have the jury instructed as to lesser degrees of the crime simply because the crime charged is murder.briley bass,cir.instead,due process requires that a lesser included offense instruction be given only when the evidence warrants such an instruction.hopper evans,d.the decision of whether there is enough evidence to justify a lesser included offense charge rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge.united states chapman,cir.further,w here the highest court of a state has reviewed a defendant request for a lesser included offense instruction and concluded that it is not warranted by the evidence elicited at trial,that conclusion is axiomatically correct,as a matter of state law.accordingly,the circumstances that would induce a federal court to overturn the state court determination would need to be extraordinary,indeed.bagby sowders,cir.because federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law,lewis jeffers,d,our only question here is whether the north carolina courts finding that there was insufficient evidence to support a second degree murder instruction was so wrong as to amount to a fundamental miscarriage of justice,nichols gagnon,cir.
north carolina law recognizes three degrees of homicide,two of which are relevant here.murder in the first degree is the unlawful killing of another human being with malice and with premeditation and deliberation.state watson.murder in the second degree is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice,but without premeditation and deliberation.state duboise.
premeditation means that defendant formed the specific intent to kill the victim for some period of time,however short,before the actual killing.deliberation means that the intent to kill was formed while defendant was in a cool state of blood and not under the influence of a violent passion suddenly aroused by sufficient provocation.state misenheimer,citations omitted.north carolina courts consider several factors in determining the existence of premeditation and deliberation,including provocation by the deceased the defendant conduct and statements before and after the killing threats and declarations of the defendant before and during the course of the occurrence giving rise to the death of the deceased or previous difficulty between the parties the dealing of lethal blows after the deceased has been felled and rendered helpless and evidence that the killing was done in a brutal manner.state fisher.provocation by the deceased can negate deliberation,so long as it is strong enough to arouse a sudden and sufficient passion in the perpetrator state salmon.however,i f the state evidence establishes each and every element of murder and there is no evidence to negate these elements,it is proper for the trial court to exclude murder from the jury consideration.state flowers.
bates argues that two circumstances negate the element of premeditation and deliberation.first,he contends that the circumstances of his life at the time of the murder demonstrate that he was distressed and thus unable to form the mental state to commit first degree murder.bates points out that he had been recently estranged from his wife,that someone had broken into and shot at his home,and that he believed jenkins was setting him up.second,bates argues that his confession,where he stated that jenkins made him mad by spitting on and cursing at him,in combination with the circumstances of his life at the time,negates deliberation.bates,however,misinterprets the quantum of evidence necessary to negate this element.
under north carolina law,a showing of mere anger is not sufficient to prove that a defendant lost his ability to reason and thus to negate deliberation.anger and emotion frequently coincide with murder,but a court should instruct on murder in the second degree only when the evidence would permit a reasonable finding that the defendant anger and emotion were strong enough to disturb the defendant ability to reason.state perry.bates introduced evidence that he was angry and distressed before the killing occurred.he did not,however,introduce any evidence tending to show that his ability to reason had been disturbed.in fact,bates confession tends to contradict that inference.bates clearly states in his confession that when he brought jenkins back to his campsite he was not drunk or doing drugs at the tim e.i knew what was going on.nothing in his confession suggests that bates lost the ability to formulate rational thought.
furthermore,the uncontroverted evidence at trial demonstrates premeditation and deliberation.the factors that north carolina courts use in evaluating the existence of premeditation and deliberation strongly suggest their existence here.bates relies on the first factor,provocation by the deceased,to negate deliberation.he ignores,however,the evidence demonstrating that before jenkins spat on and cursed at him,bates had already kidnapped,hogtied,and then beat and questioned jenkins for a period of several hours.furthermore,bates conduct prior to and after the killing overwhelmingly supports the existence of premeditation and deliberation.prior to the killing bates told shaver that he could kill someone,and then repeatedly told his friends that something would be going down.after the murder,bates told grimes that he killed jenkins because bates could let jenkins live after bates tortured him,and that he would get no more time for murder than for kidnapping.these statements contradict any suggestion that bates shot jenkins because jenkins made him so angry that he lost the ability to reason.in fact,they suggest just the the murder was a calculated act,however twisted that calculus might be.
we acknowledge that under north carolina law provocation by the deceased can suffice to negate deliberation.see state watson.the north carolina courts found that it did not,however,suffice in this case.the sole evidence bates offers to support a second degree murder instruction is his statement that the victim spat on and cursed at him which made him mad.that evidence does not tend to establish that his ability to reason had been disturbed.furthermore,bates confession,where bates states that the victim was lying on his back when he shot him,suggests that there was some period of time between the alleged provocation and the actual murder.
nothing in the north carolina jury instructions approached a due process violation.and while the parties argue extensively over state law,i t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine determinations on questions.estelle mcguire,d.beck requires a trial court to give a lesser included offense instruction when the evidence so warrants.the north carolina trial court,in the face of overwhelming evidence of premeditation and deliberation,reasonably determined that under north carolina law the evidence did not warrant such an instruction.thus,we must reject bates argument and hold that the north carolina supreme court did not unreasonably apply the relevant supreme court precedent to the facts of this case.
next,bates argues that the prosecutor closing arguments at sentencing violated his fifth amendment right to remain silent and his due process rights.we also review these claims for whether the north carolina supreme court decision was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.see williams taylor,d.
bates made no objection at any time to the prosecution sentencing argument.he contends,however,that the trial court erred by failing to intervene ex
