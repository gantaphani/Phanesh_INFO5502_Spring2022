joseph eckstein solicited a woman to murder his wife,and he taped two of the conversations in which he did so.as did the police.unsurprisingly,after a bench trial in brown county circuit court in wisconsin,eckstein was convicted of conspiracy to commit homicide and solicitation to commit homicide.he was sentenced to years in prison on the conspiracy charge and to years for the solicitation charge,to be served concurrently.
in a federal habeas corpus petition,eckstein is now trying to convince us that the wisconsin court of appeals was unreasonable in its determination that he did not receive constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel,as defined by the supreme court in strickland washington,d.because the wisconsin court of appeals decision was reasonable maybe even inevitable,we affirm the magistrate judge judgment dismissing eckstein petition.
eckstein was convicted of conspiring to kill his wife,annamaria,who had filed for divorce,and soliciting a woman named crystal graham to do the dirty work.unfortunately for eckstein,though thankfully for annamaria,graham lost her nerve and decided to cooperate with the police.even more unfortunate for eckstein was the fact that both he and the police,using a wire with graham consent,taped the final two planning conversations between eckstein and graham.eckstein was arrested after the second taped meeting on september,his own tape of the two conversations was seized from his truck later that day.
during eckstein trial,graham was the key witness.according to graham,she met with eckstein several times in the spring and summer of for the purpose of arranging for her to kill his wife.she testified that the subject first arose in april when eckstein told her that he wished he knew someone who could get rid of his wife or bump her off.graham responded that her son could find someone to do it.at their second meeting,they negotiated a price of.eckstein also provided graham with information about his wife,including the type of car she drove.at their third meeting,eckstein told graham that he wanted his wife bumped off while he was out of town for a wedding,but graham told eckstein that they were going to plant drugs on annamaria and send her to prison rather than kill her because graham son deemed the latter plan too risky.in preparation,eckstein gave graham keys to annamaria car,a business card with her photograph,and information about her,including her work and home addresses and the identities of her friends.he also gave graham to procure the necessary drugs the plan foundered,however,when graham could not obtain the drugs.at that point,she returned the as well as annamaria car keys to eckstein.graham left town for a month,but when she returned she talked again with eckstein and indicated she was still on board with the plan to get rid of annamaria.in fact,this was not true.on august,graham went to the police,told them about the plan,and agreed to wear a wire at her next meeting with eckstein.
when the two met again on september,both the police and eckstein taped the encounter.eckstein told graham that he would need a n exact plan and time first because the last time i do feel you had a plan.graham suggested using a molotov cocktail,as eckstein had suggested at an earlier meeting,but eckstein was concerned about her lack of experience.graham responded,well i f i lose my life,i lose it,to which eckstein replied 
no,no,no.there a chance of the bottle not hitting hard enough,not breaking or whatever of course,there other things to do y ou know the other thing is what that one lady does with that cleaner,oven cleaner.i mean,if somebody i think got that all over their body and in their mouth and in their lungs or knocked out and virtually i mean sprayed their mouth and lungs full of that as well as the whole body i think they gon na be gone.
when graham responded that she would do whatever eckstein wanted,he replied,i t up to you w hat i want to do is know nothing about it and i want to be gone.eckstein repeated that he could pay immediately,immediately after the job,and as soon as he was cleared.he worried that he would be blamed and then repeated,
i wan na be gone so if somebody asks me if i know,i might say something that would,ya know,conflict or affect you cause if,ya know,i know you gon na shoot her,i might goof up i f they question me about the shooting,question you about the shooting,ah,we not gon na say the same thing if i do know anything about something and something happens and i gone someplace else,i have an alibi.
eckstein also expressed concern that the last plan he and graham had made had failed,and then he asked how and when graham would act.graham indicated that she plan ned on doing it hopefully this weekend if it looks good.later,graham said she can hit her one way or the other,and eckstein responded,one of the best ways,ya know if i was gon na do it,i go for her garage.at the same meeting,in addition to suggesting the use of oven cleaner,eckstein also indicated by hand gestures that graham should slash annamaria throat or stab her in the stomach.the two agreed that the event would occur the next weekend while eckstein was out of town.
the next day,on september,the two met again,and again both eckstein and the police recorded their conversation.eckstein gave graham,a business card with annamaria photo,keys to her car,and information about where to find her.according to the transcript of the police tape,eckstein said,
you do this right,ya know,like say in the garage or something.ya know,murder her in the garage or do it in the garage or something.load her in the car.bury her in the cornfield or something between the rows of corn.nobody will ever know it.
eckstein then suggested that graham should steal annamaria car and alter the vin number to disguise the theft,before continuing,put the person in the car,take the car and the person,get rid of the person,get rid of the license plate.once again,eckstein reassured graham that he did care what you wan na do to keep track of me,be with me all the time or whatever you want to do until the smoke clears and then you get the ten grand.eckstein then told graham that he wanted a guarantee that the job would be done by october.graham responded,you either get the money or you get the job and i planning on killing annamaria this weekend.eckstein signed off with a yeah.okay.
at trial,the prosecution played the police recording of the september,conversation and submitted a transcript of it.the september,conversation was handled differently.unaware that he had been successful at recording the september,conversation,eckstein initially planned to attempt to keep the police recording out on the grounds of poor quality,thereby eliminating any record of that conversation.but when the police discovered eckstein recording of the september,conversation on the flip side of the tape from the day before,eckstein waived his objection because he believed that his recording would be admitted anyway.in the end,the court admitted both recordings for that day,but only eckstein was played at trial.the transcript for september that was admitted,however,was from the police recording,which eckstein now claims inaccurately reflects his use of the word murder.the magistrate judge presiding over the habeas corpus proceeding rejected eckstein motion seeking to supplement the record in the district court with the tapes themselves.
eckstein testified at trial and offered an account of the events that was different,although not entirely exculpatory.he stated that it was graham who initially came up with the idea of tak ing care of his problems with annamaria,that graham suggested three drugs on annamaria,take her out of the country,or kill that he only agreed to pay to plant drugs.eckstein admitted paying graham to obtain the drugs and demanding the money return when the plan stalled.the next time graham told him that she was working on a plan for annamaria,eckstein testified,he did not believe her because he knew better from all the experience and the stories he heard before.he testified that he called graham then because he wanted her to serve as a witness in his divorce,and that he taped their conversations to protect himself because he thought graham was acting strangely.eckstein claimed that he believed that graham was still talking about a plan to plant drugs on annamaria.he nixed the molotov cocktail idea,he said,because he did not want annamaria to get hurt.it was graham,not he,who had first suggested oven cleaner at an earlier unrecorded meeting as a means of.he testified that he was just being agreeable when he said yeah.okay.to her statement about killing annamaria that weekend because w hatever she would say,i would believe anyway.he also testified that it was his understanding that references to hurting or getting rid of annamaria involved planting drugs on her,not killing her,and that he knew that graham was mentally unstable and incapable of killing annamaria.
the judge did not buy eckstein story and found him guilty.following his conviction,he engaged in two full rounds of appeals and review in the state courts.in the second,he raised the same two arguments he now his counsel was ineffective for failing to suppress the recording of his september,meeting with graham and for failing to use graham mental illness to discredit her.the circuit court and wisconsin court of appeals both rejected these arguments,and the wisconsin supreme court denied review.eckstein filed a petition for habeas corpus in federal court,and the parties consented to jurisdiction before a magistrate judge pursuant to c.the district court found that the state court had not applied federal law unreasonably,but it granted a certificate of appealability coa on the question whether eckstein was denied effective assistance of counsel either through the failure to graham on her mental state or the failure to seek suppression of eckstein tape of the september,conversation.
our review in this case is constrained by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,which provides that habeas corpus relief may not be granted unless the state court proceeding resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.d see brown payton,d.it is not enough for the state court to be wrong or incorrect the state court must be unreasonable.see danks davis,cir.we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see charlton davis,cir.
the legal rules governing eckstein claim that his trial counsel was ineffective were established in strickland washington,d.under strickland,a defendant must show that her counsel performance was objectively unreasonable or deficient and that she was prejudiced as a result.id.at.t here is a strong presumption that an attorney performed effectively.berkey united states,cir.furthermore,t he reasonableness of counsel performance is to be evaluated from counsel perspective at the time of the alleged error and in light of all the circumstances.kimmelman morrison,d.even if counsel performance was deficient,a petitioner must also show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,meaning a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.in weighing the effect of counsel errors,the court must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge a verdict or conclusion that is overwhelmingly supported by the record is less likely to have been affected by errors than one that is only weakly supported by the record.hough anderson,cir.
eckstein complains about two aspects of his lawyer performance,which we review below.it is important to recall,however,that it is not enough to criticize counsel for failing to take particular steps.instead,one must also address what action counsel did take,and then evaluate her performance as a whole.see ex rel.hampton leibach,cir.with that in mind,we turn to eckstein first point that counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue and use available evidence of graham mental illness to impeach her.no one familiar with her mental state,he asserts,would believe that eckstein intended to hire graham to kill his wife.
a fair amount of evidence about graham mental state emerged,both during pretrial proceedings and at trial.during at a preliminary hearing,graham admitted that she was very low,very depressed.her father was terminally ill,her daughter and grandchild had moved to california,her son was in prison,and she had financial problems.graham testified that she was under a doctor care for manic depression and stress syndrome,and that in september she was taking medications including prozac and lithium.she admitted that she had difficulty remembering things in stressful situations.at trial,graham repeated some of this information,disclosing that she suffered from clinical depression and had been medicated for that condition for a decade and that her son was in a mental hospital.eckstein lawyer did not use any of this evidence to graham at trial instead,he tailored his to showcase the holes in graham memory as they related to earlier conversations and to corroborate eckstein account of events.in essence,the trial counsel chose to use graham lack of credibility to attempt to defeat the finding of an agreement necessary for the conspiracy charge,rather than to suggest that eckstein lacked intent because he knew that she would not follow through.
at the hearing,eckstein counsel indicated that he had reviewed the preliminary hearing transcript and was aware of graham mental health problems,but that he chose not to focus on them because of the tapes that corroborated graham account.inquiries about her mental stability,he concluded,would not have made a difference.in evaluating the record,the wisconsin court of appeals concluded that this decision was a strategic one that it saw no reason to.it is apparent that the court knew that the governing supreme court precedent was strickland,and therefore we evaluate only whether the state court applied strickland unreasonably.this occurs when the state court application of the established federal law yields a conclusion lying well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinions.hardaway young,cir.we see no need to belabor the point here.it would have been pointless for counsel to harp on graham mental problems when her testimony was entirely corroborated by the tapes that eckstein himself and the police had made.our review of counsel performance as a whole shows that he did a thorough job of raising serious doubts about her credibility.
furthermore,even if the trial counsel failure to impeach graham with evidence of her mental illness amounted to deficient performance,it is plain that there was no prejudice.the trial court emphasized that the tapes erased whatever doubt might have lingered because of the inherent strangeness of the situation,commenting that i concluded that graham testimony is true because of the clear and overwhelming evidence corroborating it,both in the forms of the physical evidence that w as retrieved,as well as the tape recordings of the conversations that form the basis of the charges.the wisconsin court of appeals added that there was no prejudice because a dditional testimony regarding her psychological problems would not likely have led the court to reach a different conclusion.it based that conclusion both on the damning recordings and on graham testimony on direct examination that she suffered from clinical depression,took medication,and could not remember some conversations due to stress.that testimony left no doubt that the trial court was well aware of graham mental illness it was also aware,thanks to the of trial counsel,of the holes in her memory and her testimony.
eckstein finally suggests that there is a reasonable probability that a fuller exploration of graham mental state would have changed the outcome because it would have demonstrated that he was never serious about killing his wife precisely because he knew that graham could not and would not murder annamaria.this argument is speculative at best it is certainly not one that the state court wa
