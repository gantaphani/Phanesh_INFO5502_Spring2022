opinion of the court 
appellant zachary wilson holds the remarkable distinction of having received writs of habeas corpus vacating not one,but two murder convictions.these victories have been pyrrhic,however,as wilson has remained incarcerated since the commonwealth of pennsylvania decided to prosecute him anew for both crimes.after his rearraignment in state court,wilson promptly returned to federal court and filed motions seeking to bar a retrial.the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania denied wilson motions and he filed this appeal.
the facts underlying wilson convictions have no bearing here,but the unusual procedural posture of the case requires us to describe in some detail what transpired in the state courts and in the district court.
wilson was convicted in by a jury in the philadelphia county court of common pleas of murdering david swift and was sentenced to life in prison.four years later,a different philadelphia jury convicted him of an unrelated crime the murder of jamie lamb.wilson was sentenced to death for that offense,in part because of his previous conviction for murdering swift.
after wilson exhausted his direct and collateral appeals in state court,he filed a federal habeas petition under claiming that his conviction in the swift case was unconstitutional because the jury was empaneled in violation of batson kentucky,d.on april,the district court granted the writ,stating 
it is hereby ordered that the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is granted.it is further ordered that wilson convictions of may,for first degree murder and possessing an instrument of crime are vacated.the commonwealth of pennsylvania may retry wilson on these charges within days of the date of this order.
wilson beard,d.the district court opinion in support of its order noted that wilson was on death row for his conviction in the lamb murder.id.at.the commonwealth appealed the order of the district court and we affirmed.wilson beard,cir.
at no point during the federal court proceedings in the swift case did the commonwealth ask the district court to stay its order pending appeal or for an extension of the day period established by the district court.yet wilson was neither retried nor released because he was on death row for the lamb murder.between november,and february,there was no activity in the case.
after the district court vacated wilson conviction for the swift murder and while that order was under review by our court,he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus seeking to invalidate his conviction for the lamb murder.this time,wilson claimed the commonwealth violated brady maryland,d,by withholding exculpatory information that would have allowed him to impeach the three main witnesses against him.the district court conditionally issued a writ in august,stating that the commonwealth may retry wilson on these charges within days of the date of this order,wilson beard,wl,at.once again,the commonwealth appealed and we affirmed the order of the district court.wilson beard,cir.
soon after we affirmed the district court order granting wilson habeas relief in the lamb case,the commonwealth moved to retry him for the swift murder,nearly five and a half years after the district court had vacated that conviction.on january,the philadelphia county court of common pleas appointed counsel for wilson in connection with the swift retrial,and on february,he was arraigned 
two days later,wilson filed a motion to enforce writ of habeas corpus in the district court,seeking to prevent the commonwealth from retrying him because it waited more than days to do so.the district court held argument on the motion to enforce and scheduled an evidentiary hearing.prior to the scheduled hearing,wilson filed a motion seeking relief under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure as with his motion to enforce,wilson contended the commonwealth should be barred from retrying him because it had failed to do so within the days required by the district court order.in the alternative that is,if the court interpreted may retry within days as retry within days or else release him wilson requested an unconditional writ barring any retrial for the swift murder.app.
the district court held four evidentiary hearings on the motions,after which the parties filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.the district court heard final argument on april.
nine days later,judge padova issued a thorough opinion denying wilson motions.wilson beard,wl.april.he observed that wilson cite d no authority for the proposition that we may bar his retrial based solely on the commonwealth failure to retry him within days,and he opined that wilson arguments evidence d a misunderstanding of the nature of a conditional writ of habeas corpus.id.at.according to the district court,the commonwealth failure to retry wilson within days automatically converted the conditional writ to an absolute writ,which meant that after the deadline passed,the commonwealth could no longer imprison wilson based on the swift murder conviction.id.this was unavailing to wilson,however,because he was not held in custody in connection with his conviction for the swift murder at any time after the w rit became absolute in this case.id.at.in the district court view between january,and june,he was held as a convicted prisoner awaiting execution for the murder of jamie lamb.since june,wilson has been held as a pretrial murder defendant in connection with his retrials for both the swift and lamb murders.id.accordingly,the district court held that its order granting the writ simply returned wilson to the position he was in before his incarceration under indictment for the crime.id.thus,even though the commonwealth failed to commence proceedings related to the retrial within the day time period,it did not violate the terms of the writ.id.
the district court then denied wilson rule b motion,which had sought essentially the same relief as the motion to enforce,but on more complex grounds.there,wilson argued that he should not suffer a retrial because the commonwealth delay in commencing the proceedings related to his retrial created extraordinary circumstances which may be remedied only by such relief.id.
wilson claimed extraordinary circumstances for three principal reasons.first,the commonwealth delayed commencing his reprosecution for the swift murder for more than five years after the district court granted the w rit.id.at.second,during the time in which the commonwealth delayed his retrial,his mental condition deteriorated to such an extent that he is no longer competent to stand trial.id.finally,his attorneys recently discovered that the prosecution committed a brady violation at his trial with respect to a key prosecution witness,whose mental condition has deteriorated so dramatically since that he would not be competent to testify at wilson retrial or to be about the alleged brady issue.id.the commonwealth opposed these claims on the merits,but also argued that they constituted a sixth amendment speedy trial claim that had to be exhausted in state court.id.
the district court agreed with the commonwealth,both procedurally and substantively,observing that t he prejudice wilson claims he will suffer as the result of the delay is clearly the kind of prejudice the speedy trial right was designed to protect against.id.at.because wilson claims of delay were new claims that arose after the district court issued the writ in and were unrelated to the batson claim that formed the basis for his petition,they had to be exhausted in state court.id.at.the district court also rejected wilson arguments that he was not required to exhaust his rule b claims and that there was no remedy available to him in state court.id.at.alternatively,the district court held that even if wilson claims did not have to be exhausted,he had not established extraordinary circumstances.id.at.
after wilson appealed only the district court denial of his rule b motion,we asked counsel to brief the following issues presented by this appeal unique procedural posture whether a certificate of appealability is required and whether harbison bell,d
