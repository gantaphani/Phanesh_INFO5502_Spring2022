arnold prieto appeals the district court dismissal of his petition for relief.for the following reasons,we reverse the district court ruling that prieto petition was untimely,as well as the district court sua sponte application of the rule to prieto claim.we therefore remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background and proceedings 
prieto was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in march.he appealed both his conviction and sentence,and on december,the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed both.prieto declined to seek review from the united states supreme court,and his conviction and sentence became final ninety days later,on march,
prieto filed an application for state relief on october,asserting grounds for relief.in july,the state court issued its findings of fact,conclusions of law,and recommendation that prieto application be denied.on november,the texas court of criminal appeals denied prieto petition.
prieto then sought habeas corpus relief in federal court.the district court issued an order appointing counsel for prieto and setting filing deadlines.under the court scheduling order,prieto habeas petition was due by may.on april prieto moved for,and the district court granted,an extension of time to file his habeas petition.under the district court order,prieto petition was due by september.on august,more than a month before that deadline,prieto filed his habeas petition.the state responded with a motion to dismiss on the ground that prieto petition was untimely because he filed it after the applicable limitations period expired.
following extensive additional briefing,the district court dismissed prieto habeas petition as untimely.ruling in the alternative,the district court dismissed prieto petition on various substantive grounds.the court then granted prieto a certificate of appealability coa on two issues first,whether the court erred in dismissing prieto petition as untimely and second,whether prieto procedurally defaulted on his claim of jury misconduct.the district court denied prieto coas on his other claims,and we affirmed the district court decision to deny those coas in an unpublished opinion.
ii.timeliness 
statutory tolling 
the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa provides a limitations period for the filing of a federal petition for relief specifically,a petitioner must file his petition within one year from the date that his conviction becomes final.the statute of limitations,however,is not absolute.aedpa provides that the limitations period is tolled while a application for state relief is pending we review a district court decision on statutory tolling de novo 
as noted,prieto conviction and sentence became final on march.prieto filed his state habeas petition days later,thus tolling the aedpa limitations period.this tolling ceased on november,when the texas court of criminal appeals denied his application.at that time,prieto had days remaining in which to file his federal habeas petition.therefore,to be timely,prieto had until approximately the end of april to file for federal relief.instead,prieto filed his habeas petition almost days late,on august.the district court opinion addresses and properly rejects prieto claims that he is entitled to additional statutory tolling.accordingly,we adopt the district court opinion with respect to statutory tolling.
equitable tolling 
in addition to statutory tolling,we have recognized that the aedpa limitations period is subject to equitable tolling in rare and exceptional circumstances.we review a district court decision on equitable tolling for abuse of discretion,remaining ever mindful,however,that w e must be cautious not to apply the statute of limitations too harshly.dismissing a habeas petition is a particularly serious matter.this is why we look to the facts and circumstances of each case to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in declining to apply equitable tolling 
although prieto is not entitled to additional statutory tolling,we conclude that his circumstances are sufficiently rare and exceptional to warrant equitable tolling.in,prieto filed a motion in the district court for an extension of time to file his petition at a later date.the district court granted prieto motion,stating b efore the court is petitioner motion for extension of time to file writ of habeas corpus.the court finds that the motion is meritorious and it is granted.petitioner writ of habeas corpus shall be filed no later than september.under this order,prieto petition appears to have been due long after his time to file expired under aedpa.although aedpa applied to prieto application,the district court order granting him additional time for the express purpose of filing his petition at a later date was crucially misleading.prieto relied on the district court order in good faith and to his detriment when he filed his petition.as prieto submitted his petition within the time expressly allowed him by the district court,he is entitled to equitable tolling.
this case is an almost perfect analog to davis johnson like prieto,the petitioner in davis was sentenced to death and,like prieto,moved for and was granted extensions of time that set the deadline for filing his habeas petition beyond the aedpa limitations period we recognized that a district court grant of motions for extensions of time beyond aedpa limitations period is likely a rare and exceptional circumstance that justifies equitable tolling we therefore assumed without deciding that the district court erred in declining to grant equitable tolling of the aedpa limitations period a decision directly on the merits of the issue was unnecessary because we then determined that davis was not entitled to a coa on any of his substantive claims.
on the facts of this case,prieto is even more deserving of equitable tolling than was davis.prieto was much more diligent in securing his extension of time.specifically,prieto requested and received his extension of time before the deadline to file his habeas petition passed.in contrast,davis failed to move for an extension of time until more than seven months after his petition was due 
in united states patterson,we equitably tolled the limitations period for a petitioner because he,too,relied on the actions of the district court when he filed his habeas petition after the aedpa limitations period had expired specifically,patterson had moved the district court to dismiss his petition so that he could obtain professional legal aid and his case to the court ironically,the day that the court granted patterson motion to dismiss was the final day of the aedpa limitations period after that date,any future filings were untimely as patterson relied to his detriment on the district court granting of his motion to dismiss we were persuaded that these circumstances are sufficiently rare and extraordinary to warrant equitable tolling.
the government only response to prieto contention that he is entitled to equitable tolling on these facts is its discussion of fierro cockrell in fierro,the district court issued a scheduling order at the government request,and the order set the deadline for fierro habeas petition outside the aedpa limitations period thus,fierro argued that the scheduling order induced him to file late the scheduling order,however,was issued three weeks after the aedpa limitations period expired accordingly,we declined to apply equitable tolling because the state request and the district court order could not have contributed to fierro failure to comply with the statute of limitations.
the likelihood that a district court order will actually mislead a petitioner into believing that his petition is due beyond the aedpa limitations period is the critical distinction between fierro and patterson.there was evidence in patterson that the district court order led the petitioner to believe that the court would entertain his petition at a later date,a date that was necessarily beyond aedpa limitations period.this is why,in fierro,we recognized the propriety of granting equitable tolling when the prisoner relied to his detriment on the district
