petitioner russell horton,a massachusetts state prisoner convicted of two murders,appeals from the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.we affirm.
factual background 
in june,a jury convicted horton of committing two murders and an assault with the intent to murder.we provide a summary of the evidence introduced at horton trial.see commonwealth horton.
on may,the three victims,carlos and manuel araujo and kepler desir drove together from boston to brockton,massachusetts.during the drive,desir instructed manuel to pick up horton and frederick christian on owens street in brockton.desir knew these two men,but the araujos did not.christian and horton got into the back seat of the car with carlos,and the five men drove off together.
during the drive,horton announced that he wanted to rob some dominican drug dealers and instructed manuel to drive to a certain location where he could carry out his plan.along the way,horton exposed a gun and asked the others if they had weapons.they claimed that they did not.upon arriving at the site,horton and christian left the car but returned shortly,claiming that they were unable to complete the robbery.after reentering the car,horton instructed manuel to drive to a nearby parking lot.
in the parking lot,while staring out the window,carlos was shot in the head.he immediately slumped forward,pretending to be dead.after two more shots were fired,carlos heard horton say,go through their pockets.carlos then sensed christian move from his seat and heard him ask horton,did you do him several minutes later,christian and horton departed the scene.
after laying still for a few more moments,carlos saw the bodies of manuel and desir and ran to the nearest house for help.carlos told the people in the house that russell had shot him.later,at the hospital,carlos repeated that russell had shot him.
barry stephens lived near the parking lot where the murders occurred and knew horton and christian.he testified that horton had sold drugs for desir but,because of a recent falling out,horton was no longer working for desir.he also testified that,on the night of the murders,he had heard gun shots,and that five minutes later,horton and christian had arrived at his house.according to stephens,horton was foaming at the mouth and looking wild.horton told him that,he smoked him he smoked all three of them.in particular,horton said that he had smoked quarter,which was desir nickname.stephens told horton and christian to leave immediately.
at the time of the murders,christian was in financial trouble.on the day of the shootings,christian stated that he needed money and asked desir for drugs on credit,a request which desir refused.horton and christian believed that desir was carrying a large amount of cash on the night of the murders because he was planning to travel to new york later that night to buy several thousand dollars worth of drugs.
horton gave inconsistent statements concerning his whereabouts on the night of the murders.he first told the police that he had met up with christian,that they had gone for a walk with another friend,and had gone home at approximately.after the police indicated that they intended to search the car for fingerprints and talk to christian,horton changed his story.he stated that he and christian were with desir and two other men,and that they had driven to fuller avenue,where he and christian left to buy drugs.he told the police that he expected desir to return to pick him up,but desir never did.
ii.procedural background 
the trial court sentenced horton to concurrent life terms of imprisonment for the murders and a year term for the assault.horton subsequently filed a motion for new trial,see,which was denied by the trial court.thereafter,the supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc rejected horton direct appeal and his appeal from the denial of his new trial motion.see horton,at.
horton then filed a timely petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.see d.in his petition,horton claimed that his right to a public trial was violated his right to confront witnesses was violated the jury instructions were incorrect and his trial counsel was ineffective.in an unpublished memorandum and order,the district court rejected the petition.see horton maloney.horton obtained certificates of appealability for each of the claims,except the jury instruction issue.see.
iii.discussion 
horton appeal raises three claims.first,he argues that the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to a public trial by holding the individual voir dire of potential jurors in an anteroom rather than the courtroom.second,he contends that the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to confront witnesses by admitting certain hearsay testimony.third,he asserts that his sixth amendment right to effective counsel was violated because defense counsel did not call certain alibi witnesses and failed to interview certain potential character witnesses.
horton habeas corpus petition is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.see.under the aedpa,a federal court may grant a habeas petition if it finds that the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.d.
under the contrary to prong of d,the petition may be granted if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.under the unreasonable application prong of d,the petition may be granted if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.to be an unreasonable application of governing law,the state court determination must not only be incorrect but also be objectively unreasonable.id.at.in other words,if the petition presents a close call,it must be rejected,even if the state court was wrong.see nom spencer,cir.if,however,the petition presents a federal claim that was raised before the state court but was left unresolved,the aedpa strict standards do not apply.see fortini murphy,cir.in such a circumstance,we review the claim de novo.see norton spencer,cir.
public trial 
horton and the prosecution jointly requested that the trial court conduct an individual voir dire of prospective jurors to ask them about the effect that racial prejudice and pretrial publicity could have on their ability to decide the case impartially massachusetts law requires that an individual voir dire be conducted outside the presence of other persons about to be called as jurors or already called.ch.to comply with this statute,the court conducted the individual voir dire in an anteroom,while the other potential jurors waited in the courtroom.horton and his counsel were present for the entire proceeding,and horton was able to aid his counsel throughout defense counsel did not object to conducting the individual voir dire in the anteroom.accordingly,the sjc held that the issue was not preserved for appellate review and considered it only for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.horton,at.the sjc rejected the claim because horton did not suffer prejudice from the voir dire procedure.id.at.
citing superior court,d,horton argued in the district court that this voir dire procedure violated his right to a public trial because the public was excluded from attending the individual juror questioning.the district court rejected this claim on procedural default grounds because defense counsel did not object at trial.
generally,habeas review is precluded when a state court reaches its decision on an independent and adequate state law ground.see coleman thompson,d.a state court decision to find a forfeiture,based on the defendant failure to object at trial,is an independent and adequate ground for decision so long as the state court consistently applies its contemporaneous objection rule and has not waived it in the particular case by basing the decision on some other ground.see burks dubois,cir.that is the situation here.the sjc consistently enforces the rule that unpreserved claims are forfeited,see gunter maloney,cir,and enforced the rule in the instant case,see horton,at.the sjc did review the claim for a substantial miscarriage of justice,but this sort of limited review does not work a waiver of the contemporaneous objection requirement.see gunter,at dubois,at tart massachusetts,cir puleio vose,cir.
because the sjc resolved horton claim on state law grounds,the habeas court may consider the claim if horton establishes cause and prejudice with respect to the procedural default see dretke haley,d coleman,at.to satisfy the cause portion of the test,horton must show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel efforts to comply with the state procedural rule.murray carrier,d.one way to establish cause is to demonstrate that defense counsel inaction constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.see coleman,at.carrier,at.gunter,at.horton takes this tack in an effort to establish cause.
under strickland washington,d,counsel performance is ineffective only if it was objectively unreasonable under prevailing professional norms to prevail on his claim,horton must overcome the strong presumption that the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.tejeda dubois,cir quoting strickland,at.horton contends that his counsel was ineffective by failing to object to the voir dire procedure because the public trial right of a criminal defendant was clearly established by the time of trial.the trial court rejected this claim,finding that horton counsel welcomed the individual voir dire procedure because it was most conducive to eliciting candid responses by the jurors on possible prejudice.the sjc agreed,noting that the less public setting for the voir dire in all likelihood helped rather than harmed horton.horton,at 
in some circumstances,defense counsel interest in protecting the accused right to a completely public trial may give way to other concerns,such as maximizing the accused chance of obtaining a favorable jury composition.for this reason,the defendant may have an interest in protecting juror privacy in order to encourage honest answers to the voir dire questions,at.blackmun,concurring.in particular,defense counsel may wish to shield jurors from public questioning when the objective is to identify possible racial biases in the venire because the prospects of a potential juror publically admitting such bias are slim.as one court noted,it is no doubt a difficult thing for any person to admit to any degree of racial bias,but to do so publically might well require what the theologians used to call heroic virtue.united states king,aff cir see also in re carolina press ass n,cir f ear of publicity that might be given to answers of venirepersons during voir dire may so inhibit or chill truthful responses that an accused is denied the fair trial to which he is entitled under the fourteenth amendment united states colabella,cir it is too much to expect of human nature that a juror would volunteer in open court,before his fellow jurors,that he would be influenced in his verdict by a newspaper story of the trial.not only so,but had one or more of them said they would be so influenced,and especially if they had then explained why,the damage to the defendant would have been spread to the listening other jurors.internal quotations and citations omitted united states koubriti,d,the potential jurors will be more candid in their responses if they do not have to worry about what the public opinion of those responses might be.internal quotations and citations omitted kimba wood,reexamining the access doctrine,cal,when jurors are reticent,the parties are denied the opportunity to probe meaningfully for bias.the more intimate setting of the robing room is far more conducive for probing bias.
while horton may have had a right to insist that the entire voir dire be conducted publically,see state torres,the strategic advantage that he received from the individual voir dire taking place in private can not be ignored defense counsel decision to agree to a closed individual voir dire was an objectively reasonable strategy designed to elicit forthcoming responses from the jurors about racial bias.accordingly,we can not conclude that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the voir dire procedure.because horton has failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel,he has not established cause for the procedural default.the district court therefore correctly declined to reach the merits of the public trial claim.see dubois,at.
confrontation clause 
over horton objection,the trial court admitted testimony from one henry garcia that,on the day of the murders,christian had stated that he needed money and that desir had refused to give him drugs on credit.the sjc affirmed the admission of this testimony under the exception to the hearsay rule.see horton,at.the sjc analysis was based exclusively on massachusetts evidence law and did not reference horton confrontation clause claim.id.because the sjc did not resolve the constitutional issue,we consider it de novo.see fortini,at.
after this appeal was briefed,the supreme court decided crawford washington,d,which changed the legal landscape for determining whether the admission of certain hearsay statements violates the accused right to confront witnesses.in crawford,the court held that the confrontation clause bars the admission of testimonial hearsay unless the declarant is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to the declarant.id.at.this holding abrogated,in part,the prior rule that the admission of hearsay did not violate the confrontation clause if the declarant was unavailable and the statement fell under a firmly rooted hearsay exception or otherwise bore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.ohio roberts,d.
at oral argument,the parties disagreed over crawford application to horton petition.the debate is important because new rules of criminal procedure do not apply in habeas proceedings unless they fall within either of two exceptions the rule places a class of private conduct beyond the power of the state to proscribe,or the rule is a watershed rule of criminal procedure,implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the proceeding.see teague lane,d curtis duval,cir.while the question of the retroactive effect of crawford,if any,is an important one,we bypass the question here because,as explained below,crawford does not apply to this case.see campiti matesanz,cir stating that court need not resolve a teague issue that was susceptible of resolution on narrower or easier grounds.
crawford draws a distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial hearsay and applies only to the former category of statements.see.at.as the court explained,where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue,it is wholly consistent with the framers design to afford the states flexibility in their development of hearsay does roberts,and as would an approach that exempted such statements from confrontation clause scrutiny altogether.id.thus,unless christian statements qualify as testimonial,crawford is inapplicable and roberts continues to apply.
the crawford court declined to provide a comprehensive definition of testimonial statements.id.at.it did,however,provide three formulations of the core class of testimonial statements.id.at.in the first,testimonial statements consist of ex parte testimony or its functional is,material such as affidavits,custodial examinations,prior testimony that the defendant was unable to or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially.id.the second formulation described testimonial statements as consisting of extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials,such as affidavits,depositions,prior testimony,or confessions.id.quoting white illinois,d.finally,the third explained that testimonial statements are those made under circumstances which would
