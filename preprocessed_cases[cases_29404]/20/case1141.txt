keith michael aubin contests the denial of habeas relief for his conviction of,inter alia,murder,for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment.pursuant to our highly deferential standard of review under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,at issue is whether the following decision is unreasonable aubin lead trial counsel was not ineffective at the trial punishment phase,for either his investigation of,or decision not to present,mitigating evidence concerning aubin history.affirmed.
in february,aubin,then years old and armed with a loaded handgun,attended a street festival in galveston,texas.juan garcia,who was attending the festival with friends,felt someone push him and turned around to see aubin.a heated verbal argument and scuffle ensued between aubin and garcia and his friends,ending with aubin shooting the handgun into the crowd,killing one person and injuring four.witnesses testified they did not observe garcia or anyone with him possessing or reaching for a weapon.
after the shooting,aubin offered to pay two men to give him a ride.aubin told them he had just shot several people,never mentioning that he feared for his life or that garcia and his friends had weapons.for safety reasons,the driver took the clip from aubin handgun while they were in the vehicle.on the way to the destination,the vehicle became stuck the driver sought the assistance of police officers in the area.when the police found the clip in the driver pocket,aubin assaulted one of the officers.
at the trial phase,aubin claimed he shot the victims in,after they surrounded him to attack him.although aubin had an extensive history of problems,his lead trial counsel ltc did not include them as part of the defense.a jury convicted aubin of one count of murder,four counts of attempted capital murder,and two counts of assault on a public servant.
at the trial punishment phase,the state presented evidence of aubin bad reputation and character,including deputies testified about threats aubin made in jail toward them and his alleged suicide attempts a fellow inmate testified aubin offered him money to help him execute an escape plan and aubin high school coach testified aubin did not have a reputation as a peaceful,citizen.aubin ltc did not call any witnesses.he maintained the shootings were not premeditated but rather the panicked,impulsive reaction of a frightened.in closing,the state argued aubin failure to present rebuttal witnesses confirmed his malicious character.aubin was sentenced to life for the murder and convictions and ten years confinement for the conviction.
on appeal,aubin claimed his ltc had been ineffective at the trial guilt and punishment phases,by failing to develop and present evidence of aubin psychiatric conditions,which would have both been relevant to his defense and mitigated his punishment.in rejecting these claims and affirming aubin conviction and sentence,the intermediate court of appeals held nothing in the record shows counsel reasons for not offering the medical records,which also exposed multiple serious extraneous bad acts.we will not speculate on those reasons.aubin state,wl,at may.aubin did not file a petition for discretionary review with the texas court of criminal appeals tcca.
aubin filed numerous applications.attached to those applications were aubin medical records from the galveston county jail,west oaks psychiatric hospital,and ronald garb,his treating psychiatrist,and affidavits by the following garb seth silverman,a forensic psychiatrist who examined and evaluated aubin richard burr,a lawyer and claimed expert in representation and aubin mother.the medical records showed hospitalization on two occasions for psychiatric reasons and prescriptions for a number of medications.evidence of aubin mental illness,aggression,isolated acts of violence,and other incidences of behavior also were discussed in the records,many of which aubin mother had provided his ltc prior to trial.the trial court,without an evidentiary hearing,recommended denial of relief.
the tcca,however,concluded additional fact finding was required to resolve the claimed iac.therefore,it remanded the proceeding to the trial court in order to have ltc explain why aubin mental health,and its impact on his reaction to stress,had not been presented at the trial punishment phase.
on remand,the trial court ordered aubin ltc to address the iac claim,including explaining why he did not introduce evidence at the punishment phase showing aubin had prior mental problems that caused him to react in certain ways to stress.in response,aubin ltc submitted an affidavit in which he described his extensive meetings with aubin and his parents,discussing all aspects of aubin life,background,and family history stated he was unaware of any prior mental problems that would cause aubin to react to stress in ways that might explain the shootings noted the nature of evidence,in that it might diminish aubin blameworthiness but also indicate future dangerousness described his strategic decision not to call any witnesses at the punishment phase and stated that decision was made in consultation with aubin and his family.
the trial court again recommended the denial of habeas relief and made the following factual findings ltc made a strategic decision not to call any witnesses at the punishment phase to avoid opening the door to prior bad acts and unadjudicated extraneous offenses although witnesses were available to testify,after consultation with aubin and his family,ltc made a strategic decision not to call witnesses ltc was unaware of any evidence of prior mental problems causing aubin to react in certain ways to stress and such evidence was not made known to counsel after extensive consultation with aubin and his family and if credible,meaningful evidence had existed,ltc would nevertheless have struggled with the strategic decision whether to present the evidence in mitigation of punishment,for fear it would have been outweighed by the danger of the state introducing evidence of bad acts and extraneous offenses not previously introduced.
aubin objected to the trial court findings and attached affidavits refuting ltc.pursuant to the trial court findings,the tcca denied aubin habeas application without written order.
under,aubin sought federal habeas relief,with two of his claims being for iac.the magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing to determine the extent to which ltc investigated aubin history and reasons for not introducing evidence at the punishment phase,including testimony by ltc clarifying his affidavit.ltc testified that affidavit was intended to convey that,while he was aware of aubin issues,he did not view any of it as mitigating,instead viewing it all as aggravating.other evidence introduced at the hearing included an audiotaped portion of ltc conversation with garb during the period that contradicted garb affidavit that he never discussed aubin psychiatric history with ltc.garb had advised ltc that aubin psychiatric problems were insufficient to raise an insanity defense because aubin understood the difference between right and wrong.
the magistrate judge extremely comprehensive report and recommendation stated,inter alia aubin had not made the necessary showing for habeas relief on his a proper investigation would have he pointed only to information with which ltc was already familiar and,similarly,ltc decision not to call witnesses at the punishment phase was not unreasonable,and,even if it were,aubin had failed to show the requisite prejudice.
in the light of aubin objections to that report and recommendation,the district court conducted a de novo review.pursuant to a detailed analysis of the record,it overruled the objections,accepted the report and recommendation,and denied habeas relief.aubin dretke,no.shortly thereafter,by separate order and pursuant to c,it granted a certificate of appealability on the issues of whether aubin received iac based on ltc investigation of his history and decision not to present evidence of that history at the trial punishment phase.
as noted,aedpa governs aubin habeas petition.aedpa purpose is to further the
