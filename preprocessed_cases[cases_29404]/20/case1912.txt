john carraway appeals pro se from the district court decision to dismiss,for want of jurisdiction,his motion seeking relief from his conviction and sentence and the denial of his request for reconsideration.we conclude that the district court correctly treated carraway motion as a second or successive request for relief pursuant to and,because carraway had not first sought this court leave to pursue such a request,properly dismissed the motion for want of jurisdiction.because this was a final order for purposes of c b,carraway must obtain a certificate of appealability in order to obtain appellate review of the district court decision.we deny him such a certificate and dismiss his appeal.
thirteen years ago,a jury convicted carraway of conspiring to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base,in violation of.the district court ordered him to serve a prison term of months,to be followed by a period of supervised relief.on direct appeal,this court affirmed his conviction and sentence.united states carraway,cir per curiam.
in,carraway filed a collateral attack on his conviction pursuant to.the district court denied his request for relief in october.carraway appealed,but in an order dated april,a panel of this court denied his request for a certificate of appealability,concluding on review of the district court order and the record that there was no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.see c.one month later,the court denied carraway motion for reconsideration.
on january,carraway commenced a new challenge to his sentence in the district court.under the docket number assigned to the original criminal proceeding,carraway filed a pro se motion that he styled as a request for relief under federal rule of civil procedure b.that civil rule grants a district court discretion to relieve a party from a final judgment when the judgment has been satisfied,released,or discharged,or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated,or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.carraway motion attacked his conviction and sentence on a variety of grounds,but the first and principal argument advanced in his motion was that in view of the supreme court decisions in blakely washington,d,and united states booker,d,his sentence was invalid because its length was determined in part by adverse factual findings rendered by the sentencing judge rather than a jury.
the district court dismissed carraway motion for lack of jurisdiction.although carraway had labeled his motion as a request for relief under rule b,the court concluded that the motion was properly understood as one seeking to vacate,set aside,or correct carraway sentence pursuant to section.because carraway had already pursued one collateral attack on his conviction and sentence,he was precluded from pursuing a second or successive challenge unless authorized to do so by this court.see b.carraway had not sought this court leave to file another section petition.in view of that omission,the district court concluded that it was without jurisdiction to entertain his motion and dismissed it on that basis.carraway moved for reconsideration of the dismissal,but the court denied his motion.
after filing a timely notice of appeal,carraway filed a motion asking the district court to allow him to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis.the district court granted that request.the court also treated his motion as an implicit request for a certificate of appealability pursuant to section c.the court denied that request,concluding that carraway had not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.
on appeal,carraway largely reiterates that effected such a significant change in sentencing law that he should be permitted to seek relief from his sentence notwithstanding his previous section petition.however,the threshold question that we must confront is whether the district court properly understood carraway rule b motion as an unauthorized second or successive request for relief under section.if so,then the dismissal of the motion for want of jurisdiction qualifies as a final order for purposes of section c b,such that carraway ability to appeal is conditioned on his receipt of a certificate of appealability.see sveum smith,cir.per curiam,cert.denied,d.
the district court correctly characterized carraway motion as a request for relief under section.the fact that carraway labeled his motion as a request for relief under civil rule b rather than section is immaterial it is the substance of the petitioner motion that controls how his request for relief shall be treated,united states lloyd,cir quoting melton united states,cir as we stated in united states evans,cir,any motion in a criminal proceeding that fits the description of a motion to vacate,set aside,or correct a sentence set forth in the first paragraph of section should be treated as a section motion.see also lloyd,at.the statute opening paragraph permits a federal prisoner to file a motion to have his sentence vacated,set aside,or corrected upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states,or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence,or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law,or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.carraway seeks relief from his sentence on the very types of grounds identified in section.principally carraway is contending that in light of booker,his sentence is constitutionally defective.likewise,the other errors raised in carraway motion are essentially challenges to the lawfulness of his confinement.thus,although styled as a motion invoking rule b,carraway motion is properly understood as a request for relief pursuant to section.see gonzalez crosby,d united states scott,cir dunlap litscher,cir.
understood as a request for section relief,carraway motion is subject to the requirement that second or successive motions under this statute must be authorized by the court of appeals.unless and until the movant seeks and obtains permission from the court of appeals to file such a motion,the district court is without jurisdiction to entertain his request.nu√±ez united states,cir.it is undisputed that carraway did not seek such authorization.the district court thus had no option other than to dismiss his motion.id.
the district court lack of jurisdiction does not deprive this court of jurisdiction to review the dismissal of carraway motion,lloyd,at.however,the jurisdictional dismissal does constitute a final order in a proceeding under section.see c b sveum,at.consequently,carraway may only appeal if he obtains a certificate of appealability.c b fed.b sveum,at.as we have noted,the district court denied him such a certificate.we too are empowered to issue such a certificate,c,and carraway has indeed asked us to do so.
having reviewed the appellate briefing and the record,we conclude as the district court did that carraway is not entitled to a certificate of appealability because he has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.see c.although carraway request for relief invokes various constitutional rights including,as relevant to his booker claim,the sixth amendment right to trial by a jury,he has not demonstrated that he possesses a potentially valid basis for asserting such rights now but not at the time that he pursued his first section motion.carraway lead argument,that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of the supreme court opinion in booker,obviously relies on new precedent,but the argument could properly be pursued in a second or successive section motion only if it relied on a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court.see.yet,the supreme court has not yet made booker retroactive to cases on collateral review,and this court itself concluded in mcreynolds united states,cir,cert.denied,d,that the booker holding does not apply retroactively to criminal cases which became final before booker was decided in janua
