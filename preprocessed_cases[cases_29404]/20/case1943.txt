the prosecution next called detective kirsten webb,a nine year veteran of the milwaukee police department,to the witness stand.webb,the lead detective on the robbery investigation,recounted that when she arrived at the lees apartment on august,she observed that the living room and the two bedrooms had been ransacked with clothes and other belongings strewn about the floor.after assessing the crime scene,she obtained a statement from steven,who told her that several of whom he entered their apartment and repeatedly made clear that they were looking for money.detective webb then asked steven if he knew the names of any of the men that took part in the robbery.he replied that he did,telling her that one of the men was named andre hull and the other was known to him only as jarod.detective webb also recalled steven informing her that two of the perpetrators had been armed during the robbery.while steven was giving his statement,detective webb observed that he had an abrasion on the left side of his face,which he stated was caused by his having been struck with a gun by one of the robbers.
following detective webb initial conversation with steven,during which he identified hull by name as being one of the perpetrators,she procured a picture of hull.after viewing the picture,steven confirmed that hull was indeed one of the men that he had previously identified as having taken part in the armed robbery.on august,the day after the armed robbery,detective webb displayed a photographic array to rena lee including a picture of hull,and she too identified him as one of the robbers based on this information police prepared a warrant for hull arrest,but while that warrant was being processed he was arrested and detained on an unrelated offense.while in police custody,hull was questioned about the lee robbery,and during the course of an interview with detective webb,he gave her the name of his cousin,davinne jarod taylor,as having been involved.based on hull statement,webb secured a second group of mug shots from the police department files which included a picture of taylor.on september,she displayed the second array to the lees,and,according to detective webb,each of them positively identified taylor as one of the robbers.

at the completion of thomas testimony,defense counsel informed the court that taylor wished to testify.thereafter,taylor took the stand and his counsel asked him if he remembered what he was doing on august.when taylor replied that he did,defense counsel asked him why he recalled that date.taylor responded that the date was familiar to him because he had been released from jail just two days earlier.he went on to testify that on august,he spent the evening with sharlisha thomas and their son.according to the defendant,he went to thomas house to drop off some clothes for their son and stayed there from approximately until after midnight,when she drove him home.when taylor was asked by defense counsel if he took part in the armed robbery,he replied,no,i did not.defense counsel then asked taylor if he had ever been convicted of a crime.taylor answered that he had been convicted,once as an adult and twice as a juvenile during the prosecution brief,taylor admitted that he knew steven lee prior to the robbery and acknowledged that steven would recognize him if they were to encounter one another.
at the conclusion of taylor testimony,the prosecution recalled detective webb as a rebuttal witness.detective webb testified that,during the investigation,she received a notice of alibi investigation request from officers investigating taylor involvement in the armed robbery.taylor proffered alibi was that,on the night of august,he was with sharlisha thomas and could not have possibly taken part in the armed robbery.on january,detective webb interviewed thomas,who disclosed that she had received a phone call from taylor while he was confined in the milwaukee county jail.according to thomas,taylor told her that the police would be contacting her and that she should tell them that he was with her on the night of august,and thus could have participated in the robbery.detective webb also stated that thomas did tell her that taylor had been with her some night in early august,but that thomas could not remember if he was with her on the night of august,or some other night.

a no,because he did ask me that.he just asked me did i have anything to do with the robbery.that was his question.i said,no.he said,okay.
taylor testimony concluded the presentation of evidence.
on june,the jury found taylor guilty of armed robbery as charged.the trial judge entered a judgment of conviction and sentenced him to a term of years.
represented by another attorney,taylor filed a motion requesting a new trial.taylor alleged that the prosecutor questions concerning his silence violated his right to due process and further that he was denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel because his trial attorney failed to object to the prosecutor questions about his silence failed to impeach the lees testimony with their police statements failed to object to impermissible hearsay and opinion testimony from detective webb committed a serious error by telling the jury during voir dire that taylor was a convicted felon and failed to adequately prepare taylor to testify.the trial court denied taylor motion on each of the issues and he appealed.on appeal,the wisconsin court of appeals affirmed the decision addressing only the prejudice prong of taylor ineffective assistance of counsel claim.specifically,the court held that any alleged errors by taylor trial counsel would not have undermine d confidence in the outcome due to the overwhelming amount of evidence produced against him.state taylor,wi app.lexis at,cert.denied,wi,quoting strickland washington,d.taylor thereafter petitioned the wisconsin supreme court for review,but the court refused to hear the matter.see id.
having exhausted his state court remedies,taylor filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court.see.taylor argued that his trial counsel ineffective assistance was prejudicial to his case.see taylor bradley.the district court denied taylor petition,finding that any alleged ineffective assistance taylor trial counsel might have exhibited did not rise to the level of prejudice.id.at.taylor next requested that the district court issue a certificate of appealability,which the court granted on the limited question of whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor questions concerning taylor,silence 
ii.discussion 
taylor claims that his trial counsel assistance was ineffective because he failed to object when the prosecutor questioned him about why he had not informed officers of his proffered alibi at the time of his initial interrogation.taylor argues that his trial counsel should have objected because these questions violated the rule announced in doyle ohio,d,that a prosecutor can not use a defendant silence to impeach a defendant exculpatory statements,and that counsel failure to object prejudiced taylor case.to prevail on his ineffective assistance claim,taylor must demonstrate that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and that the alleged deficient performance prejudiced the defense.strickland,at.in order to satisfy the prejudice prong,taylor must establish that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.
