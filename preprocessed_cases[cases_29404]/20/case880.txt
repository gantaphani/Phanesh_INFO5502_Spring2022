in,troy powell was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least kilograms of cocaine and at least grams of crack cocaine,in violation of,and he was sentenced to months imprisonment.the sentence imposed was an enhanced mandatory minimum sentence based on powell prior north carolina drug conviction.the maximum sentence that could have been imposed for the violation,regardless of the enhancement for the prior offense,was life imprisonment.see id.b a.
almost six years later,powell filed this motion under,seeking to vacate his sentence in light of the supreme court decision in carachuri rosendo holder,d,which held that the question of whether a prior conviction is an aggravated felony as used in the immigration and nationality act ina must be resolved by looking at the offense for which the defendant was actually convicted,not the offense for which he could have been convicted in view of his conduct.powell argues that carachuri should be applied retroactively as a new substantive rule to invalidate the use of his prior north carolina conviction,which the district court found was a felony conviction and thus could be used to enhance his sentence under b.he explains that carachuri should be applied in the manner that we applied it in united states simmons,cir en banc applying carachuri to invalidate a sentence enhanced under the controlled substance act based on a prior conviction punished under north carolina structured sentencing scheme.powell contends that his motion is timely based on f,which authorizes the filing of a motion within one year after the supreme court recognizes a new right that has been made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.
the district court denied powell motion,holding,among other things,that no court had held that carachuri applied retroactively to cases on collateral review.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
powell pleaded guilty in to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least kilograms of cocaine and at least grams of crack cocaine,subjecting him to a mandatory minimum sentence of years imprisonment and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.in sentencing powell,the district court calculated his guidelines range to be a sentence between and months imprisonment.considering,however,powell conviction in north carolina state court for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and concluding that it was a felony drug offense one that potentially subjected powell to a sentence exceeding one year the court enhanced powell sentence to the mandatory minimum term of years imprisonment,as provided by b a.while the record shows with respect to powell prior conviction that north carolina had sentenced powell to a term of six to eight months imprisonment,it does not reveal what the maximum sentence could have been inasmuch as there is no evidence in the record that demonstrates whether powell offense was an aggravated one or whether he had a criminal history,at least one of which would have been necessary to subject powell to the possibility of a sentence exceeding one year.see.c.
after the supreme court decided carachuri,our court decided simmons,where we overruled prior decisions and held that,in deciding whether to enhance federal sentences based on prior north carolina convictions,we look not to the maximum sentence that north carolina courts could have imposed for a hypothetical defendant who was guilty of an aggravated offense or had a prior criminal record,but rather to the maximum sentence that could have been imposed on a person with the defendant actual level of aggravation and criminal history.see simmons,at.
within one year after carachuri was decided,powell filed this motion to vacate his sentence,contending that in light of carachuri and simmons,the district court had erroneously enhanced his sentence under b a,based on its finding that his prior north carolina drug offense qualified as a felony drug offense.
the district court dismissed powell motion as untimely.noting that his motion must be filed within one year after the supreme court has recognized a new right that has been made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review,the district court concluded that powell could not show that any court had held that carachuri is retroactive on collateral review.
from the district court january,order dismissing his motion,powell filed this appeal.
section of title authorizes motions based on a defendant claim that,among other things,the defendant sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states or was in excess of the maximum authorized by law.such motions must be filed within one year of the defendant judgment of conviction or,as applicable here,within one year of 
the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court,if that right has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.
powell contends that his motion satisfies the conditions of f because carachuri recognized a new substantive right,which should be retroactively applied to his motion.he argues that carachuri recognized a new right that prohibits use of his north carolina conviction to enhance his sentence and that,because he received a punishment in that the law could not impose on him,the rule in carachuri is substantive.see schriro summerlin,d noting that a rule is substantive rather than procedural if it alters the class of persons that the law punishes.
the government contends that carachuri is a civil case construing the ina and that its holding is not a rule of criminal law that narrowed the class of persons who can be punished by the criminal law.moreover,according to the government,if carachuri did create a new rule,it was merely a procedural rule indicating the process by which lower courts should determine whether a prior conviction constituted an aggravated felony for the purposes of the ina.it argues that carachuri did not narrow the construction of a criminal statute,but rather,at most,made clear what must be evident on the face of the record before considering a prior conviction to have been a recidivist conviction.the government maintains that while our decision in simmons,which applied the interpretive principles applied in carachuri,may have announced a new substantive rule of criminal law,carachuri itself did not.finally,it asserts that in this case,even simmons does not indicate that in powell face d a punishment that the law could not impose,schriro,at,because regardless of whether the prior north carolina conviction qualified as an enhancing conviction under b a,powell faced the same maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
the principles governing whether a new right is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review are well settled.the chief objective of federal collateral review is to ensure that trial and appellate courts throughout the land conduct their proceedings in a manner consistent with established legal standards.teague lane,plurality opinion quoting desist united states,harlan,dissenting.consistent with this goal,collateral review is ordinarily available to correct violations of rights,but not to overturn the outcome in cases where the trial judge and jury faithfully appl ied existing law.engle isaac,d.stated differently,legal rules old rules are applicable on collateral review,while new rules generally are not.whorton bockting,d.
nonetheless,teague and its progeny have identified two exceptional situations in which new legal rules ought to be applied retroactively.lambrix singletary,d.the first allows for the retroactive application of new substantive rules.see schriro,at explaining that new substantive rules,unlike new procedural rules,generally apply retroactively on collateral review.a rule is substantive rather than procedural if it alters the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes.id.at.by contrast,a rule is procedural if it merely regulates the manner of determining the defendant culpability.id.and such procedural rules do not generally apply retroactively.
the second exception provides a narrow possibility of retroactivity for new procedural rules,but its scope is far more restricted than the exception for substantive rules.new procedural rules may be applied retroactively if they are watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.saffle parks,d internal quotation marks omitted.since teague,the supreme court has reviewed numerous claims that various new rights fall within this exception,and it has rejected every single one of them.see whorton,at collecting cases.in doing so,the court has repeatedly implied that the only procedural rules deserving of retroactive application are those that are comparable in importance to gideon wainwright,d,which incorporated the sixth amendment right to counsel against the states.see,beard banks,d.
applying these formulations,we conclude that carachuri is best understood as articulating a procedural rule rather than a substantive one.the case prescribed the manner in which to construe an ina condition that prohibits discretionary cancellation of an order of removal,the condition that inquires whether the defendant had been convicted of any aggravated felony.a.the carachuri court held that in determining whether the condition is satisfied,a court must look to the defendant record of conviction,not to a hypothetical conviction which could have been prosecuted in the circumstances.see carachuri.at.
the issue in carachuri was whether a second texas state conviction for drug possession,prosecuted as simple drug possession rather than as recidivist drug possession,qualified as an aggravated felony,as that term is used in the ina.for a state drug offense to qualify as an aggravated felony under the ina,the state offense would have to be punishable as a felony punishable for more than one year of imprisonment if prosecuted under the federal controlled substances act csa.under the csa,a conviction for simple drug possession is generally not punishable by more than one year of imprisonment and therefore would typically not count as an aggravated felony under the ina.see a.but a conviction for drug possession by a recidivist would be punishable by imprisonment for more than one year and therefore would count as an aggravated felony.see id.
the defendant in carachuri had been convicted twice in texas for simple drug possession,but his second offense was not prosecuted as a recidivist offense.nonetheless,the government argued that because the second offense could have been prosecuted in federal court as a recidivist offense under a,which would have potentially subjected the defendant to a sentence of more than one year,his second conviction qualified as an aggravated felony under the ina.the supreme court rejected this hypothetical approach,explaining that carachuri record of conviction in the state court contains no finding of the fact of his prior drug offense.carachuri.at.the court observed that regardless of whether the defendant could have been charged in state or federal court as a recidivist,he was not in fact so charged.it therefore concluded that the defendant was not actually convicted of any aggravated felony within the meaning of the ina.see id.at.
the supreme court holding in carachuri altered neither the range of conduct nor the class of persons that could be punished under any criminal statute.see schriro,at.both before and after carachuri,the range of conduct prohibited by a,the federal analogue of the applicable texas statute,is simple drug possession likewise,before and after the decision in carachuri,the class of persons subject to punishment under a and the corresponding texas statute remains the same nonrecidivists drug possessors can receive up to one year imprisonment and recidivist drug possessors can receive up to two years imprisonment.the only novelty introduced by carachuri is the procedure for determining whether a defendant prior conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony.the court held that a defendant can be found to have had a prior conviction for recidivist drug possession and thus for an aggravated felony if the record of conviction includes a finding that the defendant was in fact a recidivist.see carachuri.at.because the sole innovation of carachuri relates to the manner of determining the potential punishment for an offense based on the facts disclosed by the judicial record,it is a quintessential procedural rule.schriro,at see also united states sanders,cir holding that apprendi new jersey,d,constitutes a procedural rule because it dictates what procedure must be employed emphasis added.
our decision in simmons reinforces this reading of carachuri.we summed up the ultimate question in carachuri as whether carachuri had been convicted of a crime punishable as a federal felony under the csa.at quoting carachuri.at.we explained that the supreme court answered that question by holding that carachuri was not actually convicted of an offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year because the record of conviction for his second drug offense contained no finding of the fact of his prior drug offense.id.at quoting carachuri.at emphasis added see also,id.at in carachuri,the court construed one of its prior opinions as holding that a recidivist finding could set the maximum term of imprisonment,but only when the finding is a part of the record of conviction internal quotation marks omitted.we then extracted the interpretive principles and procedural requirements outlined in carachuri from the statutory context in which they initially arose and applied them to and the north carolina sentencing scheme.in doing so,we held that because no findings of recidivism or aggravation appear ed in simmons state record of conviction,those enhancements could not be considered in determining whether simmons offense constitutes a felony drug offense under the csa.id.emphasis added.
because the supreme court decision in carachuri at most altered the procedural requirements that must be followed in applying recidivist enhancements and did not alter the range of conduct or the class of persons subject to criminal punishment,we hold that carachuri is a procedural rule.it is,therefore,not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.see saffle,at noting that procedural rules apply retroactively only when they are watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding internal quotation marks omitted.thus,powell motion must be dismissed as untimely pursuant to f.
the district court order of dismissal is 
under the panel majority blanket ruling,relief is unattainable under f even by a movant who as we now know from the supreme court decision in carachuri rosendo holder,d was wrongfully convicted of being an g felon in possession of a firearm.the majority so decides by construing carachuri to announce a mere procedural,rather than a substantive,rule.because i strongly disagree with the majority analysis,i am compelled to dissent.but because this is not a case in which relief is otherwise available,i concur in the judgment affirming the district court denial of appellant troy powell motion.
critically,the carachuri rule has numerous applications,including usages that narrow the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms,and thereby alter the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes.see schriro summerlin,d.for example,applying the carachuri rule,the enhanced b penalties premised on prior felony drug offense convictions are imposable only on defendants whose previous convictions actually exposed them to imprisonment for more than one year.see united states simmons,cir en banc.and,solely those prior offenders who actually faced sentences are prosecutable under g for being felons in possession of a firearm.see,united states parker,app x,cir citing simmons,at.until carachuri,however,enhanced b penalties and g criminal liability were afforded a much broader sweep,extending to prior offenders whose convictions would have qualified a hypothetical defendant with the worst possible criminal history for a sentence above one year.see united states harp,cir.
as such,carachuri revealed that many defendants whose cases were adjudicated under the old harp regime were convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal or received a punishment that the law can not impose upon them.see schriro,at internal quotation marks omitted.the only proper conclusion for our court to reach,then,is that carachuri resulted in a n ew substantive rule retroactively applicable to qualifying cases on collateral review.see id.at see also united states thomas,cir recognizing that f does not require that the initial retroactivity question be decided in the affirmative only by the supreme court.
the substantive nature of the carachuri rule is perhaps most readily apparent in the context of g criminalizing firearm possession by a convicted felon,any person who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.because it narrows the definition of a convicted felon under g from harp any prior offender whose conviction would have qualified a hypothetical recidivist for more than one year of imprisonment,to only those prior offenders who actually faced such a sentence carachuri proclaimed a new substantive right which must be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review for purposes of f.see thomas,at relying on schriro summerlin,at saffle parks,d.
our thomas decision is illustrative.there,we were called on to decide the retroactivity of the rule announced in watson united states,d holding that a person does not use a firearm under c a when he receives it in trade for drugs.in deeming the watson rule to be substantive and thus retroactive,chief judge traxler explained that 
the supreme court in watson plainly interpreted the term use in such a way as to narrow its scope and,in doing so,place d particular conduct beyond the government power to punish under c a.schriro,at.thus,the rule announced by the watson court effectively decriminalize d,for purposes of the use prong of c,a class of conduct.saffle,at.a defendant may not be convicted of using a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense under c if he merely receives the gun in exchange for drugs.see watson,at.and,because this conduct is beyond the scope of c a,a defendant convicted under such facts would stand convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal and serve a punishment that the law can not impose upon him.schriro,at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we hold that the right announced in watson is a new substantive right which must be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review.
thomas,at alterations in original.
here,quite similarly,the carachuri court definition of a convicted felon served to narrow its scope and place d particular conduct or persons covered by the statute beyond the government power to punish under g.see schriro,at.as such,the carachuri rule effectively decriminalize d a class of conduct or prohibit ed the imposition of certain punishment on a particular class of persons.see safle,at.under the carachuri rule,a prior offender who was never exposed to a sentence is not a convicted felon barred by g from possessing a firearm.thus,any such prior offender subjected to criminal liability under g would stand convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal and serve a punishment that the law can not impose upon him.see schriro,at internal quotation marks omitted.in these circumstances,as in thomas,we are obliged to recognize the new rule as substantive and give it retroactive effect.accord bousley united states,d recognizing substantive nature and retroactivity of rule announced in bailey united states,d,that c use prong required the government to show active employment of the firearm.
the retroactivity analysis in the context of enhanced b sentences is a bit more complex,but,at least in part,reaches the same result.significantly,b contains multiple provisions mandating an enhanced sentence for a defendant with a previous felony drug offense conviction.subsection b a,under which appellant powell was sentenced,increases the mandatory minimum sentence from ten to twenty years,but retains the same maximum sentence of life.all enhanced b a sentences are therefore within the unenhanced statutory maximum 
the same can not be said,however,for other enhanced b sentences.aside from that found in subsection b a,every subsection b enhancement for a prior felony drug offense conviction allows for a sentence greater than the unenhanced statutory maximum.see b b specifying unenhanced range of five to forty years and enhanced range of ten years to life b c authorizing unenhanced sentence up to twenty years and enhanced sentence up to thirty years b d unenhanced sentence up to five years and enhanced sentence up to ten years b e i ii unenhanced sentence up to ten years and enhanced sentence up to twenty years b unenhanced sentence up to five years and enhanced sentence up to ten years b unenhanced sentence up to one year and enhanced sentence up to four years.
for those defendants who,pursuant to our harp decision,were inevitably meted out enhanced b sentences exceeding the unenhanced statutory maximum,carachuri constitutes a retroactively applicable substantive rule.to understand why,it is helpful to look to the cogent analysis of welch united states,cir.there,the seventh circuit had to decide the retroactivity of the rule announced in begay united states,d,delineating what it means to have a prior violent felony conviction for purposes of an enhanced sentence under the armed career criminal act,e the acca.
the welch court depicted the question before it in words that could be used to describe the b issue here as being whether a statutory rule defining the scope of a sentencing enhancement that increases the maximum allowable statutory sentence on the basis of a prior conviction is properly classified as substantive.at.easily answering in the affirmative,and invoking supreme court precedent such as schriro,the court explained 
in essence,begay narrowed substantially welch exposure to a sentence of imprisonment.without the acca enhancement,welch faced a statutory maximum of years imprisonment.with the acca enhancement,welch faced a statutory minimum of years imprisonment.in short,the application of the acca imposed,at a minimum,five years of imprisonment that the law otherwise could not impose upon him under his statute of conviction.such an increase in punishment is certainly a substantive liability.
welch,at.the welch court noted that the begay rule is not the same as a new rule narrowing the elements of a crime,in that the latter prohibit s any punishment for the conduct,while the former prohibits some of that punishment.id.the court nevertheless deemed this distinction to be one of degree,not one of kind.id.accordingly,the court recognized the begay rule to be retroactively applicable on collateral review.id.
the seventh circuit decided welch in the wake of the equally instructive united states shipp,cir,wherein the tenth circuit assessed the retroactivity of the supreme court acca interpretation in chambers united states,d.observing that chambers construction of the acca overrules our prior jurisprudence giving broader application to the statute,the shipp court placed chambers in the category of substantive decisions that prohibit a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense.shipp,at quoting netherland,d.and,because shipp was sentenced as an armed career criminal to a term of incarceration that exceeds the statutory maximum for the underlying offense of conviction and thus received a punishment that the law can not impose upon him the court h e ld that the supreme court construction of the acca in chambers applies retroactively to shipp on collateral review.id.at,quoting schriro,at.
consistent with welch and shipp,a movant would be entitled to retroactive application of the carachuri rule if,for example,he received an enhanced b c sentence of thirty years ten years more than the unenhanced maximum premised on a prior state drug conviction that had exposed him to just six
