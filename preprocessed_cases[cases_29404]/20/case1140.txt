smith was tried and convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in august.the texas court of criminal appeals reversed his conviction and sentence in december,holding that the trial court had abused its discretion by denying smith challenge for cause to strike a biased juror.smith state.december,unpublished.he was retried and convicted in june.the trial court submitted only two special issues to the jury whether there was a probability that smith would commit criminal acts of violence constituting a continuing threat to society and whether there were any mitigating circumstances that warranted a sentence of life imprisonment.the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed the conviction,but remanded the case for a new sentencing hearing because the trial court did not instruct the jury and submit a special issue on whether smith acted deliberately.smith state.at his third punishment trial in november,the jury found that smith had acted deliberately,that he would constitute a danger to society in the future,and that there were no mitigating circumstances that would warrant a sentence of life imprisonment rather than the death penalty.the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed the sentence on direct appeal in may.smith state.
smith was represented by attorney martin underwood at all three of his trials.
in october,the texas court of criminal appeals adopted the state habeas trial court findings of fact and conclusions of law and denied relief.ex parte smith.october,unpublished.
smith filed a petition for federal habeas relief in october.in september,the district court granted the state motion for summary judgment and denied relief.smith dretke,no.september,unpublished.
the district court granted a certificate of appealability authorizing smith to appeal the denial of habeas relief as to the following issues 
whether smith was denied effective assistance of counsel in his punishment trial when his trial counsel failed to present any mitigation evidence to the punishment jury 
whether smith in his punishment trial was denied effective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to offer any rebuttal evidence on the issue of future dangerousness 
whether smith was denied effective assistance of counsel at his punishment trial when his trial counsel failed to investigate mitigation evidence adequately thereby wrongfully deciding not to present mitigation evidence to the jury considering punishment 
whether smith eigh th amendment rights were violated when the jury heard no evidence from petitioner on mitigating factors.
the parties did not brief these issues separately,but instead grouped them together in the same discussion 
smith is not entitled to federal habeas relief on his claims unless the state court adjudication of the claims 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the state court factual determinations shall be presumed correct,and the petitioner shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.e.
smith claims that his counsel at the third punishment trial in rendered ineffective assistance by failing to present any mitigating evidence,by failing to present any rebuttal evidence on the issue of future dangerousness,and by failing adequately to investigate mitigating evidence.we review these claims under the clearly established law of strickland washington,d to prevail,smith must show that his counsel rendered deficient performance,and that his defense was prejudiced by the deficiencies.id.at.counsel performance was deficient if it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.the proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.id.
s trategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.in other words,counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.in any ineffectiveness case,a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances,applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgments.
id.at.o ur principal concern in deciding whether smith counsel exercised reasonable professional judgment is not whether counsel should have presented a mitigation case.rather,we focus on whether the investigation supporting counsel decision not to introduce mitigating evidence of smith background was itself reasonable.wiggins smith,d internal quotations and brackets omitted emphasis in original.in assessing counsel investigation,we must conduct an objective review of their performance,measured for reasonableness under prevailing professional norms,which includes a consideration of the challenged conduct as seen from counsel perspective at the time.id.at.internal quotations omitted.there is a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,and we may not find ineffective assistance of counsel merely because we disagree with counsel trial strategy.bell cone,d strickland,at.
the american bar association guidelines for representation of defendants at capital sentencing proceedings state 
counsel should present to the sentencing entity all reasonably available evidence in mitigation unless there are strong strategic reasons to forego some portion of such evidence.
among the topics counsel should consider presenting are 
medical history including mental and physical illness or injury,alcohol and drug use,birth trauma and development delays 
educational history including achievement,performance and behavior,special educational needs including cognitive limitations and learning disabilities,an opportunity or lack thereof 
family and social history 
rehabilitative potential of client 
record of prior offenses,adult and juvenile,especially where there is no record,a short record,or a record of offenses 
expert testimony concerning any of the above and the resulting impact on the client relating to the offense and to the client potential at the time of sentencing.
see strickland,at.referring to bar association standards as guides wiggins.at same.strickland does not require counsel to investigate every conceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely the effort would be to assist the defendant at sentencing.wiggins,at.nor does strickland require defense counsel to present mitigating evidence at sentencing in every case.id.
we now turn to consider the evidence presented at the punishment trial,the evidence that smith contends his counsel should have presented,counsel explanation of why he decided not to present that evidence,and the state court decision.
at the third punishment trial in,the state presented testimony relating to the crime the theft of gas,the pursuit by deputy hudson and other law enforcement officers,the murder of deputy hudson,and the subsequent chase leading to smith capture.smith videotaped confessions were also played for the jury.
in addition,the state presented evidence regarding the crimes for which smith was incarcerated in kansas before his escape.in,smith pleaded guilty to felony burglary and felony theft,admitting that he and a companion,jeff miers,had broken into a house and stolen a rifle.smith conviction for aiding a felon stemmed from his presence on january,when miers used that gun to kill martin esquivel and wound his brother,fernando esquivel,in garden city,kansas.one witness testified that smith urged miers to shoot the ing mexicans.
john nondorf,the kansas probation officer who prepared the presentence investigation report for the burglary and theft convictions,testified that smith told him that he was riding a bicycle and was hit by a car when he was years old that he went to the hospital for one day,but had no serious complications from the accident and that he had no drug problems and only drank alcohol on a social basis.sally ann ochoa,the probation officer who prepared the presentence investigation report for smith conviction for aiding a felon relating to smith involvement in the esquivel murder,testified that smith did not express any remorse and seemed unconcerned.both probation officers concluded that smith was not a suitable candidate for probation and recommended that he be sentenced to prison.
norma jean jackson,a correctional officer in kansas,testified that while smith was incarcerated in the facility where she was employed,he violated the facility rules by shoving her as she stood in a doorway.joyce whitt,another correctional officer from kansas,testified that smith escaped from the kansas facility when he had approximately a month left to serve before being eligible for parole,and that he could have faced two years in prison if he had been captured.
mark yates,who was incarcerated in a cell adjoining smith cell in the pecos county jail,testified that smith showed no remorse for the murder of deputy hudson and stated that he smith had slept like a baby the first night in jail.yates also testified that smith told him that,by killing a police officer,he had fulfilled one of the goals of his life.
cliff harris,who supervised the jailers in pecos county,testified about contraband found in smith cell and in the maximum security area where he was housed.he testified that they had numerous problems with smith he set his blankets on fire once he fought with other inmates he had a very short temper and when he lost his temper,he tore things up he intimidated other inmates and dominated the maximum security cellblock and he was a danger to other inmates and the jailers.sam esparza testified that while he was assisting with visitation at the pecos county jail,he broke up a fight between smith and another inmate.perkins,another jailer at the pecos county jail,testified that smith grabbed him through the bars and that he felt that his life was in danger.he also testified that he heard smith singing a song i shot the sheriff,but in my case it was the deputy.
carol barnett,a pecos county jailer,testified that a razor blade that had been removed from its plastic holder was taken from the sink in smith cell.she also testified that after a strip search of the inmates and a shakedown of the maximum security cells,smith got angry because his cell had been searched.he tore up light fixtures and a television set and threw the pieces through the bars at the deputies,and then started a fire with a blanket.she testified that smith was more aggressive than most of the other inmates.
darlene archer,another jailer,testified that she saw smith hitting another inmate in the face with his fist and that she heard smith singing,in a cheery manner,i shot the sheriff,but in my case i shot the deputy.in her opinion,smith had no good points and no redeeming virtues.
bruce wilson,sheriff of pecos county,testified that he came to the jail the night smith started the fire and heard smith say,the first son of a bitch through that door i going to kill.he testified that smith was moody and one day could be docile and the next day he can be a raging,crazy human being.he testified that smith is very dangerous and was the dominating force in the maximum security area of the pecos county jail.
several other witnesses testified that smith had a bad reputation for being a peaceful and citizen.
smith rested without presenting any evidence at the trial.in of the state witnesses and in closing argument,smith counsel attempted to show that smith shot at officer hudson car to try to avoid capture rather than to deliberately take his life.he also argued that smith had changed in the twelve years since the murder,and stressed the fact,brought out on,that smith had not used any of the weapons described by the state witnesses against jailers or other inmates.
in his affidavit presented in the state and federal habeas proceedings,smith counsel explained his decision not to present any evidence at the trial as follows 
i,after discussing the matter with charles smith,decided upon the strategy of reducing the quantity of damaging evidence both as to future dangerousness and mitigation by resting with the state.this was the third time through the punishment phase,and there was a wealth of bad information which i knew the state would present to this third jury either through cross examination of defense witnesses or in rebuttal.comparing the predictive beneficial effect of our presentation with the damaging effect of the state evidence,i was convinced th at we would come closer to avoiding the death penalty by that strategy than any other.this really was just had seen the evidence weighed before,twice.i believed then and i believe now,that there was no way our evidence would benefit our changes enough to anywhere offset the additional damaging state evidence that would follow via cross examination and rebuttal.
smith acknowledges that underwood is an experienced criminal defense attorney,well qualified to represent persons accused of capital offenses.he contends,however,that underwood decision to forego further investigation and to present no evidence at the punishment phase of the third trial is a flawed strategy representing a serious departure from professional norms.smith contends that counsel representation was constitutionally ineffective because he failed to present expert testimony from windel dickerson,james marquart,and walter quijano the testimony of smith mother,aunt,and cousin smith testimony and juvenile offense and jail records.
dickerson,a psychologist,was called as an expert witness for the defense at the punishment phases of smith first and second trials in and.he testified that he p
