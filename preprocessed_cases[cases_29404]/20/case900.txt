in,appellant timothy rice was convicted in the district of south carolina of using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense,in contravention of c.in,rice sought habeas corpus relief,maintaining that his c conviction had been rendered illegal by the supreme court decision in bailey united states,which circumscribed what it means to use a firearm in violation of c.in the district court,the government agreed with rice bailey contention,explaining in its answer to his habeas corpus motion that the conduct underlying his c conviction failed to satisfy bailey definition of that offense.independently of its answer to the habeas motion,the government moved the court to vacate rice c conviction.the district court,however,declined to award any relief to rice.see rice rivera,the district court opinion rice has appealed the denial of both motions.as explained below,we conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction over rice habeas corpus motion,decline to authorize the filing of a second or successive habeas motion,reverse the denial of the government motion to vacate the c conviction,and remand for the conviction to be vacated.
on july,a federal grand jury in south carolina indicted rice on five offenses,including the c offense underlying these proceedings.the evidence concerning rice c charge is easily summarized.upon the execution of a search warrant at rice home in spartanburg,south carolina,on may,the police found rice in his bedroom.the officer who testified on the c charge in the trial related that,when the police entered the bedroom,rice was lying on the bed and reached over to a table over next to his bed and there was a nine millimeter handgun laying on the table.the officer advised rice that he would kill him if he did reach back from the gun.id.in response,rice rolled back in the bed and laid down,submitting to arrest without further incident.id.rice also testified,denying that he had reached for the gun.
the district court instructed the jury on the c offense in a manner consistent with this court precedent that constructive possession of a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking offense was sufficient to establish use.in re jones,cir.specifically,the court instructed that t he phrase used a firearm means having a firearm available to aid in the commission of the drug trafficking crimes.the instructions also explained that a firearm can be considered used in relation to a felony involving drug trafficking if the person possessing it intended to use the gun as a contingency arose f or example,to protect himself or to make escape possible.id.on october,the jury found rice guilty of the c offense,as well as the four other charges 
in,three years after rice convictions and sentence were affirmed on direct review by this court,the supreme court decided bailey united states,which narrowed the meaning of use in c.the bailey decision rejected our previous conclusion that mere possession of a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking offense could constitute use.see at.instead,the court held that the government must prove active employment of a firearm in order to convict under the use prong of c.jones,at emphasis added citing bailey,at.
on july,more than five years after bailey was decided,rice filed a pro se habeas motion under.the district court dismissed the did not challenge rice c under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act.rice then sought but was denied a certificate of appealability.
on april,rice filed in the district court the pro se habeas motion at issue in this appeal the habeas motion,asserting that the bailey decision rendered his c conviction illegal.the habeas motion was filed pursuant to,even though t hose convicted in federal court are required to bring collateral attacks challenging the validity of their judgment and sentence by filing a motion to vacate sentence pursuant to.in re vial,cir en banc.
on july,the government filed its answer to the habeas motion the answer.despite noting a potential jurisdictional challenge to rice use of,the answer acknowledged that the habeas motion was properly brought.it also agreed with rice that relief should be granted on the merits,specifying that the c conviction must be vacated because the conduct that was used as a basis for such conviction does not meet the definition of the offense as set forth in bailey.id.at.
two days later,on july,the government went one step further on rice behalf,independently moving the district court to vacate rice c conviction the motion to vacate.incorporating the analysis of the answer,the motion to vacate informed the court that t he united states agrees that petitioner is entitled to have his conviction vacated.accordingly,the government moved the district court to vacate the conviction of timothy rice as to count five of indictment number,which count charges a violation of c.id.at.the motion to vacate was filed by the united states attorney and signed by the same assistant united states attorney who had successfully prosecuted rice in.
rice habeas motion and the government motion to vacate were submitted to a magistrate judge,who issued a report and recommendation to the district court.explaining that the parties agreed that the facts and evidence do not support a conviction under c,the magistrate judge recommended awarding relief on the habeas motion,and did not address the separate motion to vacate.internal quotation marks omitted.on september,the court declined to adopt the magistrate judge recommendation and denied both the habeas motion and the motion to vacate.see district court opinion.although the court believed that it possessed jurisdiction to consider the habeas motion under,it disagreed with both rice and the government on the application of bailey to the c conviction.as a result,the court ruled that there is a factual basis for which to sustain the conviction,and denied the habeas motion.id.at.additionally,the court summarily denied the motion to vacate,stating only that the facts and evidence are sufficient to sustain a conviction.see id.at.
thereafter,rice filed a timely notice of appeal.on appeal,the government has become somewhat of a moving target,altering its earlier position in two important respects.first,the government now asserts that there is no jurisdictional basis for the habeas motion,contending that it is simply an unauthorized second or successive motion.second,contradicting the position espoused in its answer and subsequent motion to vacate,the government now agrees with the district court on the merits of the bailey issue.it has not,however,reneged on or sought to withdraw its motion to vacate.
in resolving this appeal,we first assess the habeas corpus aspect of these proceedings,including whether jurisdiction exists over the habeas motion.as noted,the government now challenges rice ability to seek habeas corpus relief under,contending that jurisdiction was lacking in the district court and that the habeas motion should have been dismissed as a second or successive motion under.although such reversals of position are distasteful occurrences,and the government change of position is not to be encouraged,its is irrelevant to our resolution of the jurisdictional issue.in short,e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review.united states poole,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
as a threshold matter,it is well established that defendants convicted in federal court are obliged to seek habeas relief from their convictions and sentences through.see in re vial,cir en banc.it is only when proves inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of detention,that a federal prisoner may pursue habeas relief under.see id.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.importantly,the remedy afforded by is not rendered inadequate or ineffective merely because an individual is procedurally barred from filing a motion.id.at.
rice maintains on appeal that is the appropriate vehicle for habeas relief because he is actually innocent of the c offense yet procedurally barred from filing a motion.our in re jones also concerned an innocence claim under bailey united states,delineates the circumstances in which may be used to pursue such a habeas claim.see in re jones,cir.more specifically,is inadequate and may be 
at the time of conviction,settled law of this circuit or the supreme court established the legality of the conviction subsequent to the prisoner direct appeal and first motion,the substantive law changed such that the conduct of which the prisoner was convicted is deemed not to be criminal and the prisoner can not satisfy the gatekeeping provisions of because the new rule is not one of constitutional law.
id.at.in short,under the jones rule a federal prisoner is entitled to pursue a motion only when he had no opportunity to utilize a motion to take advantage of a change in the applicable law.if,conversely,the prisoner had an unobstructed procedural shot at filing a motion to take advantage of such a change,a motion is unavailable to him,and any otherwise unauthorized habeas motion must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
in these circumstances,the district court lacked jurisdiction over the habeas motion because rice is unable to satisfy the second prong of the jones rule.under jones,can be deemed inadequate or ineffective only if,subsequent to the prisoner first motion,the substantive law changed such that the conduct of which the prisoner was convicted is deemed not to be criminal.jones,at emphasis added.here,the supreme court issued its bailey decision in,at a point in time when rice had not yet filed a motion thus,bailey was not decided subsequent to rice first motion,as required by jones.as a result,rice can not now establish that is ineffective or inadequate to test the legality of his c conviction.
put simply,rice is not entitled to pursue habeas corpus relief under.because the district court should have dismissed the habeas motion for lack of jurisdiction,we reverse on the habeas motion and remand.under these circumstances,however,we are also obliged to construe rice appeal as a request for leave to file a second or successive motion.see united states winestock,cir.and,because bailey did not establish a new rule of constitutional law,we are constrained to deny that request.see vial,at.
having disposed of the habeas corpus aspect of this appeal,we turn to an assessment of the district court denial of the motion to vacate.although the motion to vacate does not identify the authority under which it is made,the government represented at oral argument that its sole source of authority is federal rule of criminal procedure a,which provides that t he government may,with leave of court,dismiss an indictment,information,or complaint.in evaluating the district court treatment of the motion to vacate,we again begin with the question of whether the court possessed jurisdiction.we then consider whether rule authorized the government to utilize the motion to vacate in these circumstances,after conviction and direct appeal.finally,we assess whether the court properly evaluated and disposed of the motion to vacate 
first,we assess whether the district court possessed jurisdiction to entertain the motion to vacate.in a recent decision on point,the circuit evaluated and explained the jurisdictional predicate for a rule motion made by the prosecution in strikingly similar circumstances,namely,following a c conviction and an unsuccessful direct appeal.see united states smith.like that court of appeals,we are persuaded that a district court jurisdiction over a rule motion in such circumstances stems from,which provides the district courts of the united states with original jurisdiction of all offenses against the laws of the united states.see also hugi united states,cir jurisdiction in every federal criminal prosecution comes from.although the federal courts have rarely been asked to confront the issue,we are constrained to agree that some measure of jurisdiction over a criminal prosecution remains with the sentencing court even after conviction and appeal.see smith,at d istrict courts retain some reservoir of from the rules of criminal procedure entertain motions after final judgment.
like the smith court,we are guided by the supreme court decision in eberhart united states,per curiam.in eberhart,the supreme court assessed federal rule of criminal procedure,which authorizes a district court to vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires,but prescribes rigid deadlines within which new trial motions may be filed.see at.the issue was whether rule was jurisdictional or,on the other hand,merely an inflexible claimprocessing rule.id.internal quotation marks omitted the seventh circuit had construed rule time limitations as jurisdictional,permitting the government to raise noncompliance with those limitations for the first time on appeal.id.the supreme court disagreed,however,concluding instead that rule is a nonjurisdictional rule,which assure s relief to a party properly raising it,but do es not compel the same result if the party forfeits it.id.at.thus,the court explained,where the government failed to raise a defense of untimeliness until after the district court had reached the merits,it forfeited that defense.id.
the eberhart decision is significant for its implicit approval of a district court jurisdiction to entertain an untimely rule motion,even after a conviction has become final.if rule is merely a rule,which can neither create nor expand a federal court jurisdiction,see kontrick ryan,then a district court jurisdiction over an untimely rule for years after the adjudication of arise from some other source,such as.see eberhart,at distinguishing between lack of jurisdiction and courts obligation to observe the clear limits of the rules of criminal procedure when they are properly invoked.thus,the question we must answer is whether,under eberhart,a district court may entertain a rule motion.as the circuit explained in its smith case,rule explicitly addresses a court ability to vacate any judgment,rendering it analogous to the power conferred on the district courts by rule.smith,at.and,practically speaking,the government in this lieu of making the motion to have made an unopposed motion for retrial under rule,and then moved to dismiss the new indictment under rule.id.at.if that course would be free of jurisdictional error under the approach outlined in eberhart,we are confident that,in this situation,the district court possessed jurisdiction to entertain the motion to vacate.
because the district court possessed jurisdiction over the motion to vacate,we must decide whether rule could be used in these circumstances.despite the fact that the text of rule speaks only of the dismissal of an indictment,information,or complaint,neither rice nor the government has asserted that application of the rule is inappropriate after his conviction and unsuccessful direct appeal.as explained below,however,we need not resolve whether rule contains some limitations that could preclude its use in this context.instead,guided by the supreme court eberhart decision,we agree with the circuit that rule is a rule,which had to be invoked by a litigant in the district court in order to avoid forfeiture.see smith,at.thus,the government which made the motion to vacate and rice who urged the court to grant it have each forfeited any right to contend that rule could not be used in this context.
recently,the supreme court has undertaken to clarify the distinction between rules and jurisdictional rules.bowles russell.indeed,the court has taken the lower courts and litigants to task for loosely using the jurisdictional label,which is properly limited to prescriptions delineating the classes of cases jurisdiction and the persons personal jurisdiction falling within a court adjudicatory authority.kontrick,at internal quotation marks omitted.by contrast,as rules of practice and procedure merely prescribe the method by which the jurisdiction granted the courts by congress is to be exercised.united states hartwell,cir internal quotation marks omitted.maintaining the distinction between jurisdictional rules and rul
