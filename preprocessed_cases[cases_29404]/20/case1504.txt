on july,the district court granted carol ege petition for a conditional writ of habeas corpus on grounds that admission of evidence at ege state trial violated her right under the due process clause to a fair trial,and the performance of ege state trial counsel was unconstitutionally deficient and caused her actual prejudice.the state appeals the district court judgment on both grounds,and argues additionally that ege habeas petition is under the limitations period of d.for the following reasons,we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the district court.
this is a troubling case.the crime is horrific.the initial investigation was deficient.defendant was not charged until nine years after the murder.there are others who are logical suspects.no one saw defendant at the scene the evening of the murder.no physical evidence links defendant to the crime except testimony that a mark on the victim cheek is a bite mark that is highly consistent with defendant dentition.
people ege,wl,at.such was the description of carol ege case by the michigan court of appeals,which heard her direct appeal following a jury trial and conviction for murder for the killing of cindy thompson.
ege and thompson had both been romantically involved with mark davis,whose child thompson allegedly was carrying.davis testified that he found thompson in her upstairs bedroom some time before on february,bludgeoned and stabbed to death,her organs laying beside her.there was no sign of forced entry at thompson home,and the back door was found unlocked.the phone cords had been cut.thompson was last seen alive on the evening of february,sometime between and.the initial police investigation,concluded in april,yielded no definitive evidence.eight years later,however,the investigation was reopened as a result of persons coming forward with evidence allegedly incriminating ege.during the course of this reopened investigation,in,evidence that had been collected at the murder scene in february was submitted to the michigan state crime lab for the first time.none of the evidence submitted to the crime lab connected ege to the crime.the lab results yielded fingerprints of davis and thompson and hairs of thompson and others,but no similar trace evidence connected to ege.thompson body was exhumed in,apparently to investigate a mark on her left cheek visible in photographs taken at the murder scene.the initial autopsy report had concluded that the mark was livor mortis ege was tried for murder following the investigation.
at trial,the prosecution attempted to show that ege was obsessed with davis and was therefore furiously jealous of thompson and the child thompson was carrying.the prosecution presented witnesses who testified that ege and thompson had argued several years prior to thompson death,when ege entered thompson house to destroy a watch case and that thompson had bought for davis.further evidence was presented that ege and thompson engaged in a physical struggle at thompson sister house,when thompson was five months pregnant.witnesses also testified that ege had attempted to hire two different men to kill thompson,and that about one week before thompson death,ege had asked her roommate,carol parker,to provide her with an alibi in exchange for free rent.finally,several witnesses testified that ege had expressed to them a desire to see thompson killed.one witness testified that after thompson became pregnant,ege said to her,cindy thompson was not going to have the baby that she did know how or why,and she did want to get me involved,but that she was going to have the baby.another witness testified that ege told her she could stomp the baby out of her,slit her throat,rip her up in little pieces and think nothing of it.yet another witness testified that ege told him she wanted thompson really hurt bad,either beat her up bad or kill her.
ege denied virtually all of the allegations made by prosecution witnesses,and much of their testimony was called into serious question on,either through impeachment or showing of bias.the defense theory of the case was that ege could not have been at the crime scene on the evening of the murder because she was at home all evening,and that although there was perhaps some evidence pointing to her,a more compelling circumstantial case could in fact be made against several of the prosecution witnesses,including davis.davis admitted that he had been drinking most of the day and night prior to thompson murder,and that by the time he decided to go to thompson house on the morning of february,he had consumed approximately five bottles of wine.davis presence at thompson house coincided approximately with the time she died.his alibi that he was drinking at a friend house up until the time that he found thompson body was largely undermined by the friend subsequent testimony that he and davis were not in fact together that night.also on,davis testified that he never believed that ege had killed thompson,and affirmed that ege had in fact been home all night.
the prosecution expert witness,alan warnick,opined that the mark found on thompson cheek,which the original autopsy report had concluded was liver mortis,was actually a bite mark.warnick was unable to examine the actual injury,because thompson body was too badly decomposed upon exhumation nine years after the murder.thus,warnick relied on photographs of the mark which had been taken at the time of the initial autopsy,in.warnick compared dentitions of several suspects raised by the defense and found that none of them could have made the bite mark.he also checked ege dentition and concluded that it was highly consistent with the bite mark.warnick was asked by the prosecution,let say you have the detroit metropolitan area,three,three and a half million people.would anybody else within that kind of number match like she did he responded,no,in my expert opinion,nobody else would match up.ege defense counsel did not object to warnick testimony,but rather called two expert witnesses in rebuttal.the first,a pathology professor at wayne state university,concluded that the mark on thompson cheek was liver mortis,and not a bite mark.the second,a dentist and medical doctor,provided similar testimony,and added that even if it were a bite mark,the pattern did not align with ege dentition.
a jury found ege guilty of murder.on january,she was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.ege direct appeal was rejected by the michigan court of appeals on september.ege conviction became final on march,ninety days after the michigan supreme court denied her application for leave to appeal.
on july,almost sixteen months after her conviction became final,ege filed a motion for relief in michigan circuit court.she argued that her due process right to a fair trial was violated by the admission of warnick bite mark testimony,both because the evidence itself was scientifically and probabilistically unsound and because warnick had a demonstrated record of unreliability.ege also raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,on grounds that her trial attorney had failed to object to the introduction of the bite mark evidence,as well as to the introduction of evidence concerning ege prior sexual history.the circuit court concluded on january,that ege due process evidentiary challenge to the prosecution bite mark evidence,particularly the testimony concerning the mathematical probability of an alternate random match,lacked a proper foundation and should have been excluded had an objection been raised.however,the circuit court denied relief because a trial counsel had failed to object to the evidence,and b the opportunity to present evidence challenging warnick methodology removed any prejudice resulting from receipt of the inadmissible evidence.the court weighed the improper evidence against the strength of the untainted evidence and found that a new trial was not required.as to ege ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the circuit court denied relief as well,finding that trial counsel performance was not substandard.the circuit court denied a motion for reconsideration on february.the michigan court of appeals denied ege appeal as to the motion on august,and the michigan supreme court did likewise on april.
on august,ege presented in federal district court the following claims in a petition for writ of habeas corpus 
petitioner was denied a fundamentally fair trial in violation of due process of law through the admission of an erroneous expert opinion that there was a million to one chance that a bite mark on the victim body was made by anyone other than the petitioner,where this opinion was without scientific foundation and where subsequent cases have shown this particular expert to be completely unreliable with a series of demonstrably erroneous bite mark identifications in capital cases.
ii.petitioner was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel where counsel failed to object to a series of obviously inadmissible and inflammatory prosecutorial questions posed to the testifying defendant about her sexual history,and her history of multiple abortions,and where counsel failed to demand a hearing as to expert testimony given by warnick and denied the effective assistance of appellate counsel where counsel,who represented petitioner both at trial and on appeal,failed to raise the issue of his own ineffectiveness at trial on appeal.
iii.petitioner constitutional rights were violated where she was confronted by the prosecution at trial with questions regarding her sexual history and the fact that she had two abortions.
the state moved to dismiss the habeas petition on summary judgment,arguing that it was under the statute of limitations established by d.the district court denied the state motion because it was satisfied that discovery of facts relating to the reliability of the state witness did not occur and could not have occurred until after the expiration of the habeas filing deadline,even as tolled by ege state motion,july,at quoting the court june,opinion.in particular,the district court found that it was some time after april when ege counsel was first made aware of a letter from the wayne county michigan prosecutor office concerning the unreliability of warnick as an expert witness in two previous murder trials,june,at.the letter indicated that the office of the wayne county prosecuting attorney will not approve warrants where the main evidence as to the identity of a potential defendant is the opinion of warnick that is the source of the bite marks.only after receiving this letter,and researching warnick record of testimony in other michigan counties including the one in which ege was tried,oakland county,did ege counsel pursue her july state collateral appeal.because this factual predicate for ege claim could not have been discovered until april,even through the exercise of due diligence,the district court concluded that ege section d clock only began to run as of april.the clock was then tolled after approximately four months,as of the filing of her july petition for state collateral relief.see d.as a result of this tolling,the district court did not consider ege august habeas claim,filed approximately four months after her avenues for state relief had been exhausted,to be under d.
in a separate,subsequent opinion,the district court reached the merits of ege habeas petition,concluding that the evidence,already found by the state trial judge to be improperly admitted,had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict,july,at quoting brecht abrahamson,d.the district judge further noted 
there can be no question that the bite mark evidence together with warnick odds making was powerful evidence against the petitioner.it also contradicted her claim that other logical suspects committed the crime.the evidence plainly was material in the sense of a crucial,critical highly significant factor.there was evidence presented at the trial that the petitioner harbored intense animosity against the victim and expressed a desire to see her killed.that evidence was also challenged and many of the witnesses who gave that testimony were impeached.some even were the logical suspects themselves,as the state court of appeals observed.however,without the bite mark and opinion testimony,the nature of the state proofs would have been altogether different and a weaker case necessarily would have resulted with no physical evidence connecting the petitioner to the crime.warnick evidence was unreliable and grossly misleading.the evidence was so extremely unfair that its admission violates fundamental concepts of justice.
id.at internal citations and quotations omitted.
the district court also granted ege ineffective assistance of counsel claim,finding a reasonable probability that but for the defective performance of counsel,which resulted in the receipt of the bite mark evidence and the statistical probability testimony,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at citing strickland washington,d.as to ege third claim and those portions of her second claim relating to the admission of evidence at trial of her prior sexual history,the district court denied relief.ege does not appeal these denials.
the state appeals the district court july,ruling on the merits of counts i and ii of ege habeas petition,as well as the district court june,ruling that ege state petition was not.

under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,a federal court may not grant habeas relief unless the state court adjudication of the claim either

resulted in a decision that was based upon an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.

a.the limitations period under d 
a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.d.the limitation period runs from the latest of several possible occurrences,including 
a the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review or 
d the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
id.emphasis added.furthermore,the limitation period is tolled for the time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.d.
if the district court was correct that the factual,that warnick was a sham ege due process habeas claims could not have been discovered until some time after april,then the d limitations period would not begin to run from the date on which her conviction became final march,but rather from ege discovery of the letter in april.the limitations period would then have been tolled in july,approximately four months after it began to run,upon ege proper filing of a claim for state relief.running of the statute would have recommenced on april,when the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal ege denial of relief.ege federal habeas petition was then filed on august,approximately four months after this denial.thus,if the district court was correct in its factual finding,then ege federal claims are not,because they were submitted well within the limitations months initially,plus four months after tolling had ended.
in support of the district court factual finding,ege draws our attention to a letter,dated june,which was signed by the chief of operations of the wayne county prosecutor office the letter concerns two cases in which warnick provided expert testimony regarding the identity of persons suspected of leaving bite marks on murder victims.in noting that warnick testimony was totally one case,because dna evidence later excluded the defendant as a possible suspect in the other,because a second expert undermined warnick probability wayne county prosecutor office concluded that it will not approve warrants where the main evidence as to the identity of a potential defendant is the opinion of warnick that is the source of the bite marks.ege notes that while the letter dates from,it was not a public document,and thus she could not have known that warnick had been thrown into disrepute until her receipt of the letter in.ege further argues that prior to april there existed no published or unpublished michigan appellate decisions relating to warnick,and thus the fact that defense counsel learned of the wayne county letter at all can only be characterized as fortuitous.appellee br.at.in fact,two other cases in which warnick bite mark testimony was questioned were only published around the same time that ege counsel received the letter.see amolsch warnick,wl,people wright,wl.
the state strongest argument in support of the d time bar is that nothing in the wayne county prosecutor letter provides a new factual basis for ege claim that warnick probability determination was clearly objectionable at trial.the state argues that bite mark evidence,while admissible in michigan unlike in some other states,is nevertheless controversial.accordingly,the state contends,warnick testimony could easily have been flagged by ege counsel at trial,and the new fact that warnick was no longer being relied on by other michigan county prosecutors was irrelevant.see souter jones,cir noting that evidence merely cumulative to the evidence already presented by the defense at trial can not form the newly discovered factual predicate.this would appear to jibe with the district court finding,in assessing ege ineffective assistance of counsel claim,that t he flaw in warnick statistical opinion should have been obvious and its admissibility readily assailable,july,at.
we must analyze ege two habeas claims separately with regard to the state argument and the section d bar.on the one hand,the strength of ege ineffective assistance her counsel blundered in not objecting to warnick bite mark evidence and that the state trial court failure to recognize the impact of this was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal does not rest on ege counsel only having been made aware of the wayne county letter in.if it should have been obvious to trial counsel to object to warnick testimony,and trial counsel did not have the benefit of the wayne county letter,then so too should it have been obvious to ege or to her appellate counsel that she should promptly file for habeas relief under strickland.in other words,as styled by the district court,it would seem that ege otherwise meritorious ineffective assistance claim in no way rests on the april discovery of the wayne county prosecutor letter.the letter,which only points to the unreliability of warnick,can not logically constitute a factual predicate for ege ineffective assistance claim.her ineffective assistance claim is therefore barred under d,and we reverse the district court as to this point.
on the other hand,the strength of ege due process claim does not rest solely on her trial counsel inadequate performance.rather,it rests on the adequacy of the physical evidence presented against her at trial.while it should have been obvious to ege trial attorney that the manner in which this physical evidence was presented was objectionable,that warnick probability determination was entirely without foundation,we can not say that it should have been similarly obvious to ege that the substance of the physical least as presented by complete bunk.thus,it is reasonable to assume that ege did not fully appreciate the strength of her due process claim until she found out,entirely fortuitously,that the man who provided critical,physical trial testimony against her was now considered to be a charlatan by a sister office of the very state prosecutors who had chosen to put him on the witness stand.this is especially true because ege due process claim was hybrid in is,ege identified both warnick probability determination in her particular case,as well as his general record of unreliability,as flaws denying her right to a fair trial.
furthermore,the district court conclusion that the wayne county letter provided the factual predicate for ege claims,and thus tolled the running of section d,was a factual finding that this court reviews for clear error.bugh,at.and while the district court misapplication of section d with respect to ege ineffective assistance claim constitutes clear error,the same can not be said for ege due process claim.ege could not be expected to know,in advance,how strong or weak that claim might be prior to receipt of the wayne county letter,she likely felt that she did not have a basis for pursuing her due process claim,as she was yet unaware of the extent to which warnick reputation had been thrown into disrepute.it was therefore not clear error for the district court to find that the wayne county letter provided ege with the factual predicate for her due process habeas claim.accordingly,we agree with the district court that ege due process claim is not by d,and thus will consider it on the merits.
ege due process claim 
ege asserts she was deprived of her due process right to a fair trial because of the trial court improper admission of warnick testimony,which she claims was both substantively and probabilistically unsound.both parties,as well as the district court,have correctly highlighted the critical portion of warnick trial testimony 
q now,doctor,with regard to your testimony,you indicated that it highly consistent with the dentition of defendant carol ege is that correct 
q okay.with regard me ask you a question.let say you have the detroit metropolitan area,three,three and a half million people.would anybody else within that kind of number match like she did 
a no,in my expert opinion,nobody else would match up.
tr.vol.viii,at.also critical is the judgment of the state court which considered ege claims on collateral review 
this court agrees that the testimony regarding the probability that the bite matched the defendant lacked a proper foundation.expert forensic testimony regarding identification of the defendant based upon a statistical analysis requires a proper foundation.to make a statistical evaluation it is necessary to know the frequency of a particular characteristic in the population.the probability of any combination of known characteristics is equal to the product of the frequency of each.in this case there was no evidence offered to support the expert conclusion regarding the probability that the defendant made the mark.in other words,the expert did not testify that he had identified particular features of the bite mark that had a known rate of occurrence.neither did the expert did sic testify that he had multiplied these values to reach his conclusion.
people ege,oakland circuit case,january,at internal citation omitted emphasis added.thus,the state habeas court found it highly problematic not that the prosecution had used warnick to introduce bite mark evidence in the first place,but that warnick had tied his observations to a statement about probabilities that was wholly without foundation.we agree.the prosecution failed to lay any foundation whatsoever,either for warnick connection of the bite mark to ege dentition in general,or for warnick assertion that the two were connected by a probability of million to one.
but the state habeas court then ruled that any possible prejudice that could have resulted from improper admission of warnick testimony was negated by the fact that ege had been permitted to present her own experts in opposition to warnick,both of whom rejected warnick conclusion that the mark on thompson cheek was a bite mark and not simply livor mortis.id.at.furthermore,the state habeas court noted that 
this was not a case where the guilt or innocence of the defendant hinged on an unchallenged and suspect expert opinion.numerous independent witnesses testified to the efforts which the defendant made to secure help in killing the victim,to the steps which she took in one attempt to kill the victim,and to her statements before the murder which accurately predicted the manner in which the victim was ultimately murdered.
id.at.following michigan supreme court precedent,see people mateo,the state habeas court inquired into the nature of the evidentiary error and assesse d its effect in light of the weight and strength of the untainted evidence.the court concluded that t he untainted evidence in this case overwhelmingly pointed to the guilt of ege.people ege,at.
the lack of prejudice notwithstanding,the state habeas court also ruled that ege claim was barred by michigan contemporaneous objection rule,because her trial counsel failed to object to admission of warnick testimony at any point in the proceedings.
the state habeas court application of prejudice under chambers 
any review of habeas due process claims based on improper admission of evidence must be cognizant of the supreme court mandate that it is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine determinations on questions.estelle mcguire,d.under this very deferential standard,due process is violated,and thus habeas relief warranted,only if an evidentiary ruling is so egregious that it results in a denial of fundamental fairness.bugh,at cir.whether the admission of prejudicial evidence constitutes a denial of fundamental fairness turns upon whether the evidence is material in the sense of a crucial,critical highly significant factor.brown,cir.
these principles have their roots in the supreme court decision of chambers mississippi,d,which held that trial errors can not defeat the ends of justice or otherwise deprive a defendant of her right to a fair trial.in chambers,the court was looking at a state trial court improper exclusion of certain evidence that would potentially have assisted the defendant,but its tenets are equally applicable to situations involving a state trial court improper admission of certain evidence injurious to the defendant.the ultimate question is therefore whether the state habeas court,in finding that admission of warnick testimony was not prejudicial to the ultimate outcome of ege case,unreasonably applied chambers 
in the instant case,hindsight assessment of the impact of warnick testimony requires two intertwined assessments of the evidence against ege the first,taken in the context of defense counsel rebuttal experts,and the second,taken in the context of the prosecution other evidence,all of which was only circumstantial.as to the first assessment,the effectiveness of ege rebuttal experts must be viewed in comparison to the substance of the rebutted testimony.we agree with the district court that warnick opinion that the petitioner was the only person in the entire detroit metropolitan area who could have made the mark on the corpse carried an aura of mathematical precision pointing overwhelmingly to the statistical probability of guilt,when the evidence deserved no such credence,july,at.bite mark evidence may by its very nature be overly prejudicial and unreliable but it may nevertheless be admitted under michigan evidence law,and we do not question the michigan courts judgment with respect to admission of the bite mark evidence standing alone.see people marsh.however,warnick statement that among the million residents of the detroit metropolitan area,ege teeth,and only ege teeth,could have made the mark on thompson cheek,was without doubt highly prejudicial.it strains credulity to think that a jury hearing warnick testimony would not immediately place ege at the scene of thompson violent murder,if only her teeth,and not those of other detroit residents,were linked to a bite mark on thompson cheek.such testimony expressing opinions or conclusions in terms of statistical probabilities can make the uncertain seem all but proven,and suggest,by quantification,satisfaction of the requirement that guilt be established beyond a reasonable doubt.people carlson,see also generally lawrence tribe,trial by mathematics,harv.furthermore,the injurious effect of warnick probability testimony was not in any way diffused by the experts put on by ege counsel.both of these experts opined that the mark on thompson cheek was livor mortis,and not a bite mark,but neither directly refuted warnick methods in coming to his probability determination.thus,even if a majority of jurors did not believe warnick testimony that the mark was a bite mark,the minority who did would have been inclined to think that such a mark could only have come from ege.
as to the second prejudice inquiry,we must assess the relative influence of the prosecution evidence,all of which was circumstantial and none of which placed ege at the scene of thompson murder.we recognize that presentation of physical evidence is not a necessary condition to support a guilty verdict.obviously,many cases are tried on nonphysical circumstantial evidence alone,and in many cases this circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly points toward the defendant guilt.and in this case,it is undeniable that some of the circumstantial evidence against example,one witness testimony that ege told her she could stomp the baby out of thompson,slit her throat,rip her up in little pieces and think nothing of it was strong on its face,even if the witness was later significantly,if not completely,discredited on.this case differs from other circumstantial evidence cases,however,in that it appears the prosecution was not willing to try ege until it had warnick bite mark testimony,indicating its desire to have in hand the one piece of physical evidence potentially linking ege to the crime.after all,nothing in the record suggests that a single one of the compelling circumstantial proofs offered by the prosecution at trial in could not also have been offered nine years earlier in,far closer in time to when the murder was actually committed.we are thus led to believe that while the state may have had a good circumstantial case against ege in,it was not until,when the state finally obtained expert physical evidence connecting ege to the murder victim,that it felt comfortable moving forward with ege prosecution.if the prosecution felt that the bite mark evidence was so important,it does not take much of a cognitive leap to believe that the jury viewed it as important as well.
it is not unreasonable to conclude,therefore,that this single piece of physical evidence substantially prejudiced the outcome of ege trial,even in light of other circumstantial evidence against her.furthermore,any argument by the state that its evidence against ege was overwhelming simply flies in the face of the findings of its own state court of appeals,which noted on direct review how troubling ege conviction was,and how many other logical suspects still exist.see people ege,wl,at,noting also that while the volume of circumstantial evidence concerning ege animosity towards thompson was considerable,t he credibility of much of this evidence was called into question.this finding by a state court that ege conviction was troubling is quite different from the situation in brown,in which a state court twice concluded that the evidence against the defendant was sufficient to justify his conviction,and thus this court held it was not objectively unreasonable for the state court to have determined that such evidence did not rise to the level of a crucial or critical factor in the jury decision to convict.at.
in ege case,once the state habeas court had concluded that the admission of warnick testimony was error,it was objectively unreasonable,under the tenets espoused by the supreme court in chambers,for the state court to have concluded that this testimony was not prejudicial.it seems clear to us that the evidence was a crucial,critical highly significant factor,brown,at,in the jury determination of ege guilt.
procedural counsel failure to contemporaneously object 
even though the state habeas court reached the question of whether admission of warnick testimony unfairly prejudiced her trial concluding,unreasonably,that it did not,the state court ruled that ege due process complaint could be disposed of prior to reaching this question.specifically,the state habeas court ruled that because ege trial counsel had failed contemporaneously to object to warnick testimony,any subsequent federal habeas claims raising the evidentiary issue were barred under of the doctrine of procedural default.
ege does not dispute that michigan contemporaneous objection rule is a valid state procedural rule.she therefore must confront a hurdle inherent to our federalist system,namely,that a habeas petitioner who has failed to meet the state procedural requirements for presenting her federal claims has deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address those claims in the first instance.coleman thompson,d.in such case,a habeas petitioner is required to demonstrate cause for her default of any federal claim,and prejudice therefrom,before the federal habeas court will consider the merits of that claim.edwards carpenter,d emphasis added.thus,in order to overcome the state procedural default defense,ege must show both cause and prejudice for her failure to comply with michigan contemporaneous objection rule.the supreme court has acknowledged that cause may be established through a showing of counsel ineffectiveness in failing properly to preserve a claim for review in state court.id.not just any deficiency in counsel performance will do,however the assistance must have been so ineffective as to violate the federal constitution in ege case,her sixth amendment right to a fair trial.id.
the district court correctly noted that as a general rule,trial counsel strategic decisions on how the trial is to be conducted are afforded great deference.see strickland,at.holding that a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance see also wiggins smith,d declining to articulate specific guidelines for trial counsel conduct,and instead emphasizing that the proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.nevertheless,the district court was also correct that there must be some limit to this deference 
in this case,it is difficult to conceive of a reason for not objecting to the bite mark evidence and the statistical opinion.as the state court of appeals observed in its opinion on direct appeal,t he defense theory as presented in its opening statement was that defendant could not have been at the crime scene on the evening of the murder because as sic she was at the home all evening,and n one of the evidence submitted to the crime lab connected defendant to the crime.since the bite mark evidence was the only physical evidence connecting the petitioner to the crime scene at the time of the murder,challenging its admissibility likely would have been a sound decision with no adverse consequence.although bite mark evidence had been used in other michigan prosecutions,warnick never examined the bite wound himself,and the use of a photograph of the wound to make the comparison appears to be novel.even if defense counsel could not have anticipated the prosecutor question soliciting the unsupported statistical evidence,one might expect that lodging a contemporaneous objection and moving to strike the evidence,or perhaps for a mistrial,would be standard operating procedure for a competent defense lawyer.the flaw in warnick statistical opinion should have been obvious and its admissibility readily assailable the basis for objecting to this damaging yet unsubstantiated opinion evidence should have been obvious to defense counsel,and the failure to lodge the objection was substandard performance under prevailing professional norms.
july,at internal citations omitted.we agree with the district court resolution of the matter.it is true that strickland and wiggins compel a federal habeas court to give a wide berth to trial counsel actions,and that in most instances,an attorney decision to put on rather than object directly to expert testimony is strategically reasonable.but where,as in the instant case,physical evidence is presented linking a defendant to the crime scene,and it is the only physical evidence showing such a link,then defense counsel must object to its admission if no proper foundation has been laid by the presenter.anything else is objectively unreasonable.furthermore,the fact that defense counsel chose to introduce to warnick testimony does not insulate counsel performance.there is no reason counsel could not simultaneously have objected to warnick testimony and attempted to rebut it with experts of his own.
to establish sufficient prejudice to overcome procedural default with an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,a petitioner must show a reasonable probability that,but for her counsel errors,a different result likely would have occurred.strickland,at.a petitioner does not have to establish,however,that counsel error more likely than not altered the outcome of the case.id.at.reasonable probability under strickland,then,is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.at.given our previous discussion of actual prejudice caused by erroneous admission of warnick testimony,supra,we conclude that the strickland prejudice standard is met as well.thus,ege has met both the nested cause and nested prejudice prongs required to use an ineffective assistance of counsel claim as cause for her procedural default ege with michigan procedural default rule may therefore be excused.
ege ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
in order for a habeas petitioner to succeed on a ineffective assistance of counsel claim,even if the claim has been used in another guise as cause to excuse procedural default,the petitioner must still demonstrate i deficient performance of counsel,and ii prejudice,meaning the deficient performance deprived petitioner of a fair proceeding.strickland washington,d.if a petitioner can make this showing,and if the state court nevertheless denies her relief,then this court will consider the state court application of strickland to have been objectively unreasonable,and we will grant the writ.as discussed in part of this opinion,however,we decline to review the merits of ege ineffective assistance claim on habeas because we believe this claim is under d.
for the reasons discussed above,this court affirms the district court conditional grant of petitioner ege writ of habeas corpus as to her due process claim,but reverses as to her freestanding claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.our partial reversal thus does nothing to upset the district court july,that ege be released from custody unless the state of michigan brings her to trial again within seventy days,subject to the exclusions from such period allowed by.
i agree with the majority reversal of the district court grant of ege habeas petition based on her ineffective assistance claim.however,because i believe that ege claim was untimely,and that the admission of evidence does not constitute an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent,i dissent from the majority partial affirmance of the district court grant.the same reasons the court uses to deny part of ege petition should defeat the remaind
