proceeding pro se,robert simpson was convicted by an illinois jury of first degree murder and armed robbery and sentenced to death.simpson sentence was later commuted to natural life imprisonment without the possibility of parole by former illinois governor george ryan.after exhausting his appeals and collateral remedies at the state level,simpson filed a petition for habeas corpus under.the district court denied the petition on all the grounds simpson alleged.on appeal simpson primarily takes issue with his waiver of counsel and the performance of standby counsel.we affirm.
there is no dispute as to the factual background,with each side citing to portions of the trial record and to simpson two appearances before the illinois supreme court,people simpson,affirming simpson conviction and death sentence on direct appeal simpson i,and people simpson,upholding denial of collateral relief simpson ii.we garnered the facts accordingly.
robbery and police investigation 
on may,simpson and carolyn lagrone entered the fairway food grocery store in glenwood,illinois but soon left without making a purchase.a few minutes later they reentered the store.simpson,carrying a gun concealed under a piece of newspaper,approached a service desk and told a store employee he was robbing the store.the employee responded,you must be kidding.simpson grabbed the employee by her smock and forced her to the ground.lagrone approached the service area and held open a purse into which simpson started putting money.barbara lindich,a store customer,walked up behind the woman and peered over lagrone shoulder.simpson asked lindich if she wanted to help and then shot her in the neck,a wound from which lindich later died.simpson and lagrone left the store and got into a car in the parking lot in which lurlarn young was waiting.with simpson at the wheel,the three drove off.
shortly after arriving at the store,glenwood police summoned hayden baldwin,a crime scene technician.baldwin obtained fingerprint impressions from various objects and found a spent casing inside the service office.baldwin returned to the scene later that evening and recovered a bullet fragment employees had discovered in a door frame.
on may,the police arrested lagrone,and she gave a statement detailing the offense and the roles of young and simpson.later that day,the police arrested young,who was simpson girlfriend,as an accomplice to murder.at the time of her arrest,young was driving a car matching a description of the getaway car.
while in custody,young gave police two statements which were reduced to writing.young also signed a form consenting to the search of the apartment she shared with simpson.that evening,the police used young keys to make a warrantless entry into the apartment.the police found simpson at the residence and arrested him.early the next morning,simpson was placed in a lineup and was identified by employees and customers as the man who they saw commit the robbery.
the police further questioned young,and on may,she signed a second consent to search form.the police,accompanied by young,returned to the apartment and searched a storage locker in the basement where they found a caliber semiautomatic pistol,a caliber semiautomatic pistol,ammunition,and other evidence linking simpson to the crime.
forensic analysis revealed one of the pistols recovered from simpson storage locker produced characteristics that matched the cartridge case and bullet fragment recovered from the scene.the fingerprints lifted at the store were lagrone.
simpson waiver of counsel 
simpson legal proceedings did not get off to a good start in the circuit court of cook county.on june,simpson,lagrone,and young were arraigned on charges of first degree murder,armed robbery,aggravated battery,and armed violence.apparently while the court was making a record of the charges,simpson attempted to confer with his,leading to the following colloquy 
the court move that defendant away from these young ladies.now simpson,do you have the funds to hire your own lawyer 
simpson we have had a chance to communicate.you think maybe we can get that opportunity 
the court i do know who you are talking about communicating with 
simpson i talking about the three of us.
the court you not the spokesman for these young ladies.
simpson i not saying i the spokesman.i asked you a simple question and you want to 
the court i asked you a question.
simpson i asked you could we have a conference.
the court no,you can not.
simpson well,then,fuck what you talking about.i talk to you like a man and you want to talk to me like you do have good sense.
the court i assume,simpson,you think you have nothing to lose,but i can hold you in contempt of court.
simpson it not what i think,motherfucka 
the court i hold you in contempt and i sentence you to 
simpson i do care.fuck you.
the court six months.
simpson sentence me to fifty fucking year.i do care.
the court six months cook county department of corrections.
simpson right.fuck what you talking about.i talk to you like a man and you 
the court i tell you what i think,simpson 
simpson you ca tell me a motherfucking thing,motherfucker.
the court remove simpson from the courtroom.
simpson was removed from the courtroom and taken into custody 
simpson appeared in court soon thereafter three times,each time represented by a public defender.at these appearances,simpson said he was ready for trial and voiced his desire to proceed pro se.the court informed simpson that he would need to formally waive counsel and that the public defender would be appointed as standby counsel.at the third appearance,on august,simpson told the court that he wanted to go to trial as soon as possible even if it meant representing himself.when his appointed counsel,frank rago,said he needed a continuance to prepare for trial,simpson petitioned the court to represent himself.
in response,the court said,from looking at the charges in this case,it a very complex case.i do know if the state is going to be seeking the death penalty in this case,but they may be and there may be certain matters that you would not be able to handle if you do represent yourself in these matters.the law is that you will be treated just as if you were an attorney.
the court asked simpson for an explicit waiver of his right to counsel.simpson answered,the problem is that too many people running up here doing too many different things and nobody is ever here that supposed to be here each time.i want a jury trial and i ready for trial now.the court asked again for a waiver,and simpson stated,the last time i think we had talked and you said you were going to appoint him to act as.the court asked a third time for a waiver,and simpson said he wanted to go to trial,saying,i going to represent myself if that how the court feels.
the court read the charges to simpson and asked him if he understood,saying do you still wish to give up your right to a lawyer simpson replied,if that what it takes to go to trial,yes.the court then read the penalties and asked simpson if he understood,to which simpson gave the same answer.the court then instructed simpson that he had the right to a lawyer and that this right could not be taken away without his consent or approval.when the court asked simpson if he understood,he said,if i have a right to an attorney and the court appoints an attorney,how come every time i step in here,somebody different steps up and does know what going on the court explained that rago had lawyers assisting him,so that simpson actually had three lawyers.the court also explained that the public defenders needed time to investigate in order to provide competent representation.
should simpson waive his right to an attorney,the court explained,it would appoint standby counsel whose role would be that of an observer.the court stated,the reason why i do that is if there some type of outburst or some type of thing that prevents me from proceeding to trial,because you have to be your own lawyer,then what may happen is if i have to remove you from the courtroom,then the counsel would then come in to represent you i would let you confer with that standby counsel if you wished to,but you would be representing yourself.that person would not be actively engaged at all in your trial.you would be representing yourself.simpson replied,sounds fine.
the court clarified that if simpson wanted to be represented by a lawyer,the lawyer was duty bound to do so effectively,which would require time to look at the case.the court then explained what functions a lawyer would perform and that if simpson lacked the money,an attorney would be appointed for him.the court asked,do you have any questions about anything i have said to you simpson replied,no.the court then asked,knowing everything that i have said,do you still wish to give up your right to have a lawyer represent you in this case simpson replied,yes.
the court then asked simpson if he had graduated from high school and his level of education.simpson replied,i think i competent,your honor.the court repeated its question to ensure simpson would not have any problem researching the law in this area.simpson responded that he was ready for trial.the court asked again,and you want to represent yourself simpson responded,yes.and i want a jury.the following colloquy ensued 
the court i feel that you understand your rights under the law,under the possible penalties involved here.do you understand what you giving up 
simpson yes,sir.
the court and i believe that a free and voluntary decision on your part.
simpson it is.
the court anybody force you to do this 
simpson no.
the court this is of your own free will 
simpson well,not my free will,but did nobody force me.
simpson elaborated that he had a problem with one of the public defenders who appeared on his behalf at a previous hearing.the court told simpson that the lawyer could be removed from the case if simpson so desired,or that he could represent himself.simpson said he would represent himself.the court appointed rago to serve as standby counsel after rago moved to withdraw from representing simpson.
at two subsequent pretrial hearings the court asked simpson if he wished to stick with his decision to waive counsel.the court explained to simpson that while simpson waiver of counsel was not set in stone,he would not be able to use the retraction of waiver as a litigation strategy or delay tactic.the court said that at some point,simpson representation would have to be finalized.simpson did not equivocate on his waiver.
simpson trial and sentencing 
at trial,three employees present in the fairway food store identified simpson as the man who was behind the service desk holding a gun.a customer in the store that day also identified simpson as the man she saw passing in the lane next to her after she heard a male say,this is a stickup,and heard a loud pop.two of the employees and the customer identified one of the guns recovered from simpson storage locker as the weapon they saw him holding during the robbery.
simpson called several witnesses who were present in the store at the time of the crime.their versions of events differed from the prosecution witnesses accounts,but did not contradict them.simpson called young to the stand,but she invoked her right against and did not testify.against the advice of the trial judge and at simpson request,the custodial statements of young and lagrone were published to the jury.simpson did not testify.at the close of the evidence,the jury returned a verdict finding simpson guilty of first degree murder and armed robbery.at the first stage of capital sentencing,the jury found simpson to be eligible for the death penalty.sentencing proceeded to the second stage,and simpson continued to represent himself.
when it came time for simpson to introduce mitigation evidence,he sought to call three judges to testify on his behalf.the court instructed simpson standby counsel to locate the judges and ask them if they knew of simpson.none of the judges were able to remember simpson.at simpson request,the trial judge contacted each of the judges on more than one occasion.two judges stated their willingness to come to court but neither could remember simpson.simpson contacted one of the judges himself in order to refresh the judge recollection.simpson also requested and received various transcripts from witnesses.
the trial court repeatedly advised simpson that he should present some other mitigation evidence to sway the jury not to impose death.simpson declined,explaining that a death sentence would allow him to bypass the illinois appellate court and go directly to the illinois supreme court.the trial court questioned simpson strategy of relying on motions or appeal and pointed out that if one member of the jury disagreed with the death sentence,it would not be imposed.
simpson presented no mitigating evidence.the jury found no mitigating factors were present to preclude a death sentence.rago,simpson standby counsel,did nothing on his own with regard to performing a mitigation investigation,nor did he examine the prosecution aggravating evidence.
the court appointed counsel to represent simpson on his motion.simpson counsel obtained simpson prison medical file which indicated he suffered from headaches,dizziness,fainting spells,and bad eyesight,and noted he had survived a gunshot wound to the head from a prior incident at the hearing,simpson counsel argued simpson was not competent to waive his right to counsel.the trial court denied simpson motion and sentenced him to death for murder and years imprisonment for armed robbery.
simpson appealed directly to the illinois supreme court which affirmed both his convictions and death sentence.simpson i.then simpson sought collateral relief in state court,the denial of which was affirmed by the illinois supreme court.simpson ii.on may,simpson filed an application and notice of intent to file a federal habeas corpus in united states district court for the northern district of illinois.simpson then filed a petition for executive clemency on august.on september,simpson filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus.governor ryan commuted simpson death sentence to life imprisonment on january.
in light of the commutation,the district court inquired whether simpson wished to proceed with his habeas petition despite the risk that the award of a new trial reopened the possibility of a death sentence simpson elected to continue and filed an amended petition on june.on february,the district court issued an order denying relief on ten of simpson claims and directing supplemental briefing on simpson remaining claims,which were denied on june.pursuant to the district court certification,simpson raises the following issues on appeal 
whether simpson waiver of his right to counsel was valid 
whether simpson was entitled to standby counsel with a duty to investigate potential mitigation evidence for presentation at sentencing 
whether the trial court was obligated to appoint a mitigation expert in light of simpson alleged invalid waiver of counsel and purported ineffective standby counsel and 
whether evidence of simpson identity was the fruit of an illegal search because lurlarn young consent was allegedly coerced and evidence of the coercion was suppressed.
ii.analysis 
as with all habeas appeals,we review a district court findings of fact for clear error and its rulings on issues of law de novo.foster schomig,cir citing warren richland county circuit court,cir see barrow uchtman,cir.the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of the aedpa requires a petitioner to establish that the state court proceedings in his case resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.charlton davis,cir quoting d see williams davis,cir.a state court determination of a federal constitutional issue is unreasonable only if it is objectively unreasonable.williams taylor,d.in other words,a state court application of federal constitutional law will be upheld if it is at least minimally consistent with the facts and circumstances of the case.rice mccann,cir quoting sanchez gilmore,cir.
the parties do not dispute the facts the only issues raised are questions of law.simpson does himself no favors by not referring to the applicable state court decisions.the relevant decision for purposes of our assessment is the decision of the last state court to rule on the merits of the petitioner claim.charlton,at citing mcfowler jaimet,cir.some of the issues simpson raises were last reviewed by the illinois supreme court in his direct appeal simpson i and others on collateral review simpson ii.simpson merely argues what the trial court should have done,but that is not the proper basis of habeas review under the aedpa.
simpson waiver of counsel 
simpson argues that he was incompetent to stand trial and,therefore,incompetent to waive his right to counsel.and if he was competent,simpson alternatively maintains his waiver of counsel was not made knowingly and voluntarily.according to simpson,his inappropriate behavior at his arraignment and a similar blowup after he had been sentenced called into question his competence.had the trial court conducted a meaningful competence inquiry,simpson argues,it would have learned of simpson medical and mental histories which were consistent with the affidavits later obtained in preparation for his motion.
the supreme court has held that for a criminal defendant to waive the right to counsel,he must be competent to waive the right and do so knowingly and voluntarily.godinez moran,d.the focus of a competency inquiry is the defendant mental capacity the question is whether he has the ability to understand the proceedings.the purpose of the knowing and voluntary inquiry,by contrast,is to determine whether the defendant actually does understand the significance and consequences of a particular decision and whether the decision is uncoerced.id.at.citations omitted emphasis in original.a court is not required to make a competency determination in every case a defendant seeks to waive counsel a s in any criminal case,a competency determination is necessary only when a court has reason to doubt the defendant competence.id.at.citation omitted.
the state maintains that because simpson did not argue that his outbursts were part of his competency claim to the illinois supreme court,he has procedurally defaulted this claim.alternatively,the state argues that simpson did not make this argument to the district court,causing him to forfeit this claim.
to avoid procedural default,t he petitioner must establish that he fully and fairly presented his claims to the state appellate courts,thus giving the state courts a meaningful opportunity to consider the substance of the claims that he later presents in his federal challenge.bintz bertrand,cir citing harris mcadory,cir.fair presentment in turn requires the petitioner to assert his federal claim through one complete round of review,either on direct appeal of his conviction or in proceedings.lewis sternes,cir citing boerckel,d.to do so requires a petitioner to put forward operative facts and controlling legal principles.sweeney carter,cir.
although the state concedes simpson has fairly presented the legal principles controlling his waiver of counsel claim,the state asserts nevertheless we can not reach the merits of the issue.the state argues that simpson outbursts constitute operative facts which were not fairly presented to the illinois supreme court or the district court to support his invalid waiver claim.it is agreed that simpson did present the legal issue of the defective waiver of counsel.given the abundance of additional factual support relied upon by the lower courts to deny this claim,as we discuss below,simpson outburst can hardly be considered to be operative,so that its omission would cause procedural default of an entire issue.
simpson points to identical language in both his petition for collateral relief on direct appeal to the illinois supreme court and his petition for habeas corpus in the district court wherein he alleged in the factual background,after launching into an tirade against the trial court,simpson was cited for contempt and removed from the courtroom.but simpson did not argue specifically that his outburst evidenced his incompetence,and neither court made any mention of it.in any event,it would do simpson no good if we were to give him the benefit of the doubt.
although simpson outburst demonstrates ill will,bad manners,and certainly poor litigation strategy,it does not exhibit simpson incapacity to waive his right to counsel.in some instances,the use of profanity can be compulsive so that the utterance could be considered to be involuntary,but simpson does not fit into this category.simpson tirade actually proved him to be quite responsive to the judge.when the court said you think you have nothing to lose,simpson replied,it not what i think.after the court sentenced simpson to six months imprisonment,simpson asked for fifty years.and when the court said i tell you what i think,simpson interrupted and said,you ca tell me a motherfucking thing,motherfucker.a hothead simpson may be,but legally incapacitated he was not.
the other incident of simpson misbehavior occurred at a hearing on november,six months after he was convicted and sentenced to death.the prosecutor informed the court of his suspicion that simpson had surreptitiously filed a motion to withdraw young guilty plea on her behalf.simpson then called the prosecutor a liar,a bitch,and a motherfucker before being escorted from the courtroom.as with the earlier blowup,we reject simpson claim that this is indicative of incompetence 
for simpson argument that he did not knowingly waive counsel,relevant is the illinois supreme court review of the record in simpson i.in simpson i,the court noted simpson raises several arguments to support his contention he did not make a knowing and understanding waiver of counsel,at.the court referred to the sixth amendment implicit right of afforded to criminal defendants,as recognized by faretta california,d.id.the court then described,properly,the governing legal standards,citing godinez for the waiver of counsel and johnson zerbst,for the waiver of a constitutional right,and its own consistent precedent.
the court proceeded to address simpson many arguments which asserted,in essence,that the trial court did not go far enough in probing the validity of his waiver before and during trial,and at sentencing.id.at.the court thoroughly discussed the trial record and agreed with the trial judge that simpson knew what he was doing when he waived his right to counsel and chose to represent himself.id.at.the court also concluded that there were no subsequent developments during trial or sentencing to require the court to appoint counsel.id.at.the court analysis is supported by our own review of the record.
we conclude,therefore,that the district court denial of simpson claims regarding his waiver of the right to counsel was appropriate.
simpson sentencing issues 
simpson brings two claims related to his sentencing.first,simpson argues that he received inadequate assistance of standby counsel for his failure to act during the mitigation phase of simpson death sentence proceedings.second,in light of the alleged defective counsel and his own purported incompetence,simpson maintains the court erred by failing to appoint a mitigation expert.
justiciability 
before we address the substance of simpson sentencing claims,the state effectively raises three distinct justiciability issues relating to governor ryan grant of clemency.the state argues there is significance to simpson resulting sentence,the executive nature of his confinement,and the affirmative act of his filing a petition for clemency.the state argues these circumstances have either rendered simpson sentencing claims moot or show that he has abandoned them.
with respect to mootness,this case is governed by the result we reached in madej briley,cir.in madej,a federal district court issued a writ of habeas corpus due to ineffective assistance of counsel at allegation simpson makes here ordering the state of illinois to conduct another sentencing hearing for a inmat
