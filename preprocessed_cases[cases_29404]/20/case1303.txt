this court granted a certificate of appealability to permit john mayo appeal from a denial of habeas relief on the claim that he was constructively deprived of legal counsel at a critical stage of his prosecution,the period during which a new trial could be sought.texas courts denied relief on this claim,as did the federal district court.the issue before us,pursuant to aedpa standards,is whether the state courts decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the state court record.d.mayo rests his claim entirely on united states cronic,d,and its progeny.finding no basis to grant relief on these facts under cronic,we affirm.
background 
mayo kidnapped,raped and sexually assaulted a houston,texas,woman in may.he was convicted in march of aggravated kidnaping and aggravated sexual assault,and he received sentences of and years imprisonment,respectively,for those offenses.
the facts pertinent to this case,which we paraphrase,are succinctly reported by the state habeas court 
jacquelyn barnes,a veniremember for mayo trial,represented on her juror questionnaire that she had never been accused in a criminal case.before the veniremembers were brought to the courtroom,the presiding judge in the central jury room asked whether they had ever been convicted of any felony or theft.barnes either responded in the negative or remained silent otherwise,she would not have accompanied the panel to the courtroom.
mayo was represented at trial by retained counsel paul mewis,assisted by cynthia henley.neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel asked the veniremembers whether they had been convicted of any felony or theft,in reliance on the answers in the jury questionnaires and their knowledge that the veniremembers had already been qualified on this question in the central jury room.barnes became a juror.
unbeknownst to the parties and attorneys,barnes had a final conviction for misdemeanor theft dating from,which was discoverable as a public record in harris county,texas.had barnes disclosed her conviction during voir dire examination,the attorneys would have challenged her for cause,as she was absolutely disqualified from jury service under texas law.crim.proc.ann.frame state.
mayo was convicted and sentenced.mewis contract provided that his legal representation of mayo would terminate with the jury verdict.after sentencing,mayo indicated his desire to appeal.because mewis did not handle appeals,he advised mayo to hire another lawyer.
mewis took no further action in the case because he assumed that mayo would hire another lawyer.neither mewis nor henley as mewis assistant investigated jury misconduct,checked the local criminal records of the jurors,or investigated or filed a motion for new trial.
mewis did not move to withdraw as counsel because he was unaware that texas law required him to continue to represent mayo following conviction until such time as the court permitted him to withdraw or substituted counsel.ex parte axel.
nevertheless,when mewis had not heard from a prospective appellate lawyer after about three weeks,he met with mayo in jail to determine whether another lawyer had been hired.mayo said he was indigent.on april,three days before the time expired to file a motion for new trial and notice of appeal,mewis assured that mayo was brought to court,that he filed a notice of appeal,and that he signed an indigency affidavit requesting appellate counsel.that same day,the court appointed will gray as appellate counsel and mailed him notice of the appointment.gray did not,however,learn of his appointment until the time had expired to file a motion for new trial.
no attorney discovered barnes theft conviction in time to file a motion for new trial or to raise the issue on appeal.had counsel filed a motion for new trial and proven that barnes was absolutely disqualified from serving as a juror,the trial court would have had to grant a new trial,or the conviction would have been reversed on appeal.thomas state,state holloway,dist.under texas law,however,mayo is not entitled to obtain habeas corpus relief on a claim involving a disqualified juror.thomas,at ex parte bronson,
the state habeas court concluded that mayo was not denied assistance of counsel during the time for filing a motion for new trial,as paul mewis remained attorney of record.the texas court of criminal appeals denied mayo application for habeas corpus relief without written order on the findings of the trial court.the federal district court denied relief under,and this appeal followed after a coa was granted.
discussion 
this case turns on whether the state courts conclusion that mayo was not denied the assistance of counsel during the period for filing a new trial motion was an unreasonable application of federal law,as established by the supreme court,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.d.
mayo argument begins with the proposition that criminal defendants are constitutionally entitled to effective assistance of counsel at every critical stage of prosecution and through the conclusion of direct appeal.strickland washington,d evitts lucey,d.a defendant whose attorney provides no meaningful assistance may,however,be constructively denied the assistance of counsel.united states cronic,d.in mayo view,his lawyer failure to research or file a motion for new trial was the equivalent of denying him counsel for the purpose of challenging barnes qualifications as a juror.
the initial problem with this argument is that,from the standpoint of aedpa,its conclusion does not necessarily follow from its premises.few precedents exist explaining whether the period for filing a motion for new trial is a critical stage of prosecution to which the right to counsel attaches.the texas court of criminal appeals,for instance,expressly withheld ruling on that issue,although lower texas courts have described the period as critical.compare prudhomme state,with smith state,and oldham state.several federal courts of appeals have held that there is no constitutional right to counsel for motions for new trial.united states tajeddini,cir,abrogated on other grounds by roe,d united states lee,united states birrell,cir.but three federal courts of appeals have held,on particular facts,that the motion for new trial phase is a critical stage of the prosecution.kitchen united states,cir robinson norris,cir menefield borg,cir.the district court here seized on the absence of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,and concluded that the period for filing a motion for new trial is not clearly a critical phase hence,the state courts did not unreasonably reject mayo habeas claim 
unfortunately for mayo,his position succeeds only if the right to counsel clearly and fully attaches to the,phase of prosecution.but it is unnecessary,in resolving this appeal,to render such a broad decision instead,we focus on the state court finding that mayo was not denied counsel during the phase.this finding is not legally or factually unreasonable.under texas law,mewis was bound to represent mayo until the trial court permitted him to withdraw or appointed a new attorney that mewis was unaware of his legal responsibility does not transform an error into the denial or absence of counsel.mewis in fact represented his client by taking steps to ensure the appointment of appellate counsel.
the only asserted flaw in mewis legal representation was his failure to investigate the criminal records of mayo jury,to unearth a misdemeanor conviction of one juror,and to use that technicality to obtain a mistrial or new trial.for two reasons,this omission has no constitutional significance.
first,even if mewis should have investigated the jurors criminal histories,the investigation need not have awaited the outcome of trial.mewis could have questioned the jurors on the subject during voir dire exam.indeed,the voir dire examination provided the best opportunity to reveal disqualifying characteristics.moreover,mewis,armed with copies of the juror questionnaires,could have begun an investigation of the seated jurors by means of outside sources as soon as trial commenced.while the deadline for filing a motion for new trial fixes a completion date under texas procedure for such an investigation,it does not constrain the initiation of inquiries into jurors criminal records.there is no necessary connection between mewis alleged oversight and the period.this lack of connection is irreconcilable with any cronic claim regarding that period.
second,the facts demonstrate why mayo declines to characterize his claim as resting on the strickland test for constitutionally deficient legal representation.a strickland claim arises only if the attorney error falls outside the bounds of professional reasonableness.strickland,at.at.mewis did not question prospective jurors about their criminal histories because he relied on for that precise point.took place by means of written questionnaires and inquiries by the judge who conducts juror screening in the houston courts central jury room.it was not professionally unreasonable to rely on this dual screening mechanism.surely the best evidence of the reasonableness of mewis conduct lies in the fact that the prosecutor,who had as much to lose as mayo had to gain from the belated identification of an unqualified juror,also relied on the techniques.if mewis actions in failing to ask veniremembers about possible criminal records were not professionally unreasonable,it follows that the failure to conduct investigation and file a motion for new trial can not have been deficient 
our conclusion may be stated narrowly.whether or not the right to counsel attaches for some purposes during the,phase of the prosecution,mayo was not constructively denied the assistance of counsel for purposes of filing a new trial motion solely to assert the disqualification of a juror,where a the disqualification might have been discovered earlier,and b mayo attorney could reasonably rely on harris county juror procedures.the state courts did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law or reach unreasonable findings of fact in denying mayo relief from his conviction 
the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
the majority concludes,as did the state habeas court,that john mayo was not deprived of the assistance of counsel during the,time for filing a motion for new trial,despite the existence of affidavits from his attorneys attesting that they in fact did not represent mayo during this period.because i believe this conclusion to be unreasonable in light of the evidence presented in the state habeas proceeding,i respectfully dissent.further,because i conclude that the,time for filing a motion for new trial is a critical stage in the proceedings,i would grant mayo request for habeas relief.
assistance of counsel 
the majority concludes that the state habeas court finding that mayo was not denied counsel during the,time for filing a motion for new trial was not legally or factually unreasonable.it reasons 
under texas law,mewis was bound to represent mayo until the trial court permitted him to withdraw or appointed a new attorney.that mewis was unaware of his legal responsibility does not transform an error into the denial or absence of counsel.mewis in fact represented his client by taking steps to ensure the appointment of appellate counsel.
i have no quarrel with the majority recognition that,as a matter of texas law,trial counsel remains under a duty to continue representing his or her client until the court permits a withdrawal i am also cognizant that,under texas law,w hen a motion for new trial is not filed in a case,the rebuttable presumption is that it was considered by the appellant and rejected,and that the appellant carries the burden to rebut the presumption that the appellant was represented by counsel.oldham state.
however,being under a duty to represent and actually performing that duty are horses of a different color.contrary to the majority view,i believe it indisputable in this case that mayo did rebut the presumption that he was represented by counsel during the time for filing a motion for new trial.mayo presented two affidavits in support of his from mewis,his trial attorney,and one from gray,his appointed appellate attorney.mewis affidavit stated 
on march,after mayo was sentenced,he said that he wanted to appeal.because i do not handle appeals,i told him to hire another lawyer.i assumed that he would do so.i took no further action on his case.
when i had not heard from another lawyer after about three weeks,i went to see mayo in jail to determine whether he had hired counsel for the appeal.he said that he could not afford to do so.
on april,three days before the time expired to file a motion for new trial and notice of appeal,i had mayo brought to court.i filed a notice of appeal and had him sign an affidavit of indigency requesting the appointment of counsel on appeal.the court appointed will gray.
after mayo was sentenced,i did not provide him with additional legal assistance because i did not intend to represent him on appeal.for all practical purposes,he did not have the assistance of counsel from the time that he was sentenced until gray learned of the court appointment.as a result,no lawyer investigated the possible grounds for a motion for new trial.
gray affidavit stated 
the coordinator of the district court customarily forwarded me a copy of the combination order appointing counsel and pauper oath by united states mail if the order were mailed on april,the earliest i could have received it would have been april.
i was not able to speak with the appellant or file a motion for new trial by april.
in my view,these affidavits effectively rebut the presumption that mayo was represented by counsel during the time period for filing a motion for new trial mayo claims he was without representation both mayo attorneys have sworn under oath that mayo was without representation and no motion for new trial was actually filed.i can not conceive what more conclusive proof we could require mayo to present to demonstrate he was in fact without representation.
in ward state,the texas court of criminal appeals emphasized that the continuity of representation from trial to appeal is necessary to correct the ambiguity of representation which all too often follows a conviction.as the court explained,this is the precise reason for the rule requiring counsel to formally withdraw from representation.id.by failing to perform his statutory duty to formally withdraw from representing mayo,mewis subjected mayo to this ambiguity of representation,leaving mayo without an attorney to counsel him or investigate grounds for filing a motion for new trial,and depriving the trial court of notice that it was necessary to appoint new counsel.
because both mayo attorneys disclaim representing him during the,period for filing a motion for new trial,and because,in fact,no motion for new trial was filed,i would hold that mayo has demonstrated that he was without representation during that period.the state habeas court conclusion that mayo was represented is an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.because the majority holds otherwise,i respectfully dissent.
ii.critical stage 
as the majority notes,before prejudice in this case can be presumed,mayo must also show that the period he was without counsel was a critical stage of the proceedings.united states cronic,d.the state habeas courts did not consider this issue.the panel majority likewise declined to reach this issue because its conclusion that mayo had representation is dispositive of mayo appeal.nonetheless,the majority opines,in dicta,that the time period for filing a motion for new trial is not a critical period under cronic.i disagree.
it is well settled that a defendant is constitutionally entitled to the assistance of counsel at every critical stage of the proceedings,michigan jackson,d united states wade,d white maryland,d.under the test articulated by the supreme court,whether a particular time period i
