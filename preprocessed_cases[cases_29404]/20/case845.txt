in,virginia police arrested eric adam grueninger for sexually abusing his daughter.during his first interview with the police investigator,grueninger was read his miranda rights and said,i need an attorney.three days later,the investigator him without an attorney present,and this time,grueninger confessed to performing various sexual acts with his daughter.grueninger ultimately was tried on sexual abuse and child pornography charges.grueninger attorney did not file a timely motion to suppress the confession,and the commonwealth of virginia commonwealth relied on grueninger confession in securing his conviction.
on state collateral review,grueninger argued that his attorney failure to move to suppress his confession under edwards arizona,d,which prohibits police interrogation after an invocation of miranda rights,constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.a virginia circuit court rejected that claim,holding that grueninger had not been interrogated for edwards purposes,and that his statements therefore would not have been suppressed had counsel so moved.we disagree,and conclude that the state court decision on this point was objectively unreasonable under d.we further find that had grueninger statements been suppressed,there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different as to the sexual abuse charges,though not the child pornography charges.accordingly,we reverse in part and affirm in part the district court order dismissing grueninger federal habeas petition.
on march,the department of social services in hanover county,virginia,received a report that grueninger was having sexual intercourse and other sexual contact with his daughter.the police arrested him that day,and investigator david klisz met with grueninger in jail for a first interview.their interaction was captured on video,which was available to the prosecutor and to grueninger attorney,michael clower.the video depicts klisz administering miranda warnings to grueninger and grueninger saying in response,these are felonies,i need an a ttorney.grueninger claims,without disagreement from the commonwealth,that klisz immediately ceased all questioning.
on that same day,klisz searched grueninger home with the consent of grueninger wife.klisz found three thumb drives in grueninger top dresser drawer,one of which contained photographs and videos of child pornography.he also discovered a laptop in the home work room.subsequent forensic analysis revealed that the content on the thumb drive had been accessed on the laptop.
three days later,on march,hanover county issued a new arrest warrant with additional charges,and klisz again visited grueninger in jail.after administering the miranda warnings a second time,klisz asked grueninger questions about the charges against him.this time,grueninger answered klisz questions and admitted to performing oral sex on his daughter,ejaculating on her,shaving her pubic hair,inserting a yeast infection suppository into her vagina,and bathing with her naked.he also admitted that the computer he primarily used at home was the laptop on which child pornography had been stored and accessed.
a grand jury charged grueninger with two counts of indecent liberties with a child under the age of fifteen,two counts of aggravated sexual battery by a parent,one count of rape by force or threat,three counts of forcible sodomy,and two counts of sexual object penetration the sexual abuse charges.grueninger also was charged with nine counts of possession of child pornography and one count of distribution of child pornography the child pornography charges.on november,the circuit court of hanover county circuit court or hanover circuit court held a bench trial.
local rules required that a motion to suppress,like all motions in limine,be filed in writing before trial.clower,grueninger attorney,did not file a written motion to suppress grueninger confession.but on the first day of trial,clower belatedly took issue with the admissibility of the confession on edwards grounds.when the prosecutor argued that clower objection was untimely,clower attempted to excuse his delay by explaining that he had only recently become aware of the relevant statements and the timeline the prosecutor pointed out that in fact,clower had been afforded open file discovery,including access to the video of klisz interactions with grueninger.in any event,she argued,grueninger request for a lawyer was not unequivocal,as required to trigger edwards protections.the trial court overruled clower objection without reaching the merits because clower had failed to file a motion in limine.instead,the court held that the matter ought to be dealt with as it came up at trial.
the confession came up at trial when the prosecutor elicited testimony from klisz regarding grueninger inculpatory statements.but clower did not object.at the close of evidence,the trial court noted the importance of klisz testimony about his second interview with grueninger i f i find that detective klisz testimony was incredible and that the defendant did not make the statements that have been attributed to him,then the whole case shifts into a different perspective.the court did find klisz account of grueninger confession credible,and it convicted grueninger on all counts.
on february,the court sentenced grueninger to a total term of imprisonment of years,with all but suspended.on the sexual abuse charges,grueninger was sentenced to years with all but suspended,and on the child pornography charges,to years with all but suspended.grueninger appealed his convictions,arguing that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain them.the court of appeals of virginia affirmed and the supreme court of virginia refused grueninger petition for appeal.
on july,grueninger filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the hanover circuit court,before the same judge who had presided over his trial.grueninger alleged that the admission of his uncounseled confession to klisz was unconstitutional under edwards arizona.he also argued,among numerous ineffective assistance claims,that clower was ineffective for not moving to suppress his confession under edwards.
in opposing grueninger petition,the commonwealth produced an affidavit from clower the clower affidavit that described the video of the first interaction between klisz and grueninger on the day of grueninger arrest.according to clower,detective kliz sic did read the defendant his miranda warning,and grueninger said these are felonies,i need an attorney.clower also described the circumstances that produced grueninger confession during the second interview with klisz on a subsequent day detective kliz sic returned with new warrants.at that time,upon being served,grueninger volunteered statements that were later used in his conviction.id.
the circuit court held that grueninger was not entitled to relief on any of his claims and dismissed his petition.the court determined that grueninger procedurally defaulted his substantive edwards claim by failing to litigate it at trial or on direct appeal.and the court rejected grueninger argument that this failure itself constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under strickland washington,d.according to the court,grueninger statements to klisz were spontaneous or voluntary rather than the product of interrogation the mere serving of the warrants by klisz was not designed to provoke incriminating statements from the petitioner and was not an interrogation.it followed,the court held,that the statements would not have been suppressed under edwards which applies only when a suspect is interrogated and therefore that clower failure to move for suppression was neither deficient performance nor prejudicial under strickland.
grueninger appealed the dismissal of his state habeas petition to the supreme court of virginia.the supreme court summarily found that there was no reversible error in the judgment complained of and refused the petition for appeal.
on june,grueninger filed a federal habeas petition under in the eastern district of virginia alleging largely the same claims as in his state habeas petition.the district court agreed with the circuit court that grueninger substantive edwards claim was procedurally defaulted.as to ineffective assistance in connection with the edwards claim,the district court also agreed that trial counsel reasonably eschewed moving to suppress,quoting clower statement in his affidavit that any such motion would have been baseless.in the alternative,the district court held,even if a motion to suppress had been made and granted,the resulting exclusion of grueninger confession would not have led to a different outcome at trial even without grueninger statement to detective klisz,overwhelming direct and circumstantial evidence of grueninger guilt existed.id.the district court rejected the remainder of grueninger claims,dismissed grueninger petition,and denied a certificate of appealability.
grueninger filed a timely appeal with this court.we granted a partial certificate of appealability as to the following issues whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to seek pretrial suppression of grueninger inculpatory statement under edwards arizona,d,and if so,whether counsel ineffectiveness demonstrates cause and prejudice to excuse grueninger procedural default of his claim that his statements were unconstitutionally obtained in violation of edwards.
we review the district court denial of a habeas petition de novo.macdonald moose,cir.our analysis is circumscribed,however,by the amendments to enacted as part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.
under d,the availability of federal habeas relief is limited with respect to claims previously adjudicated on the merits in proceedings.harrington richter,d.a federal habeas court may not grant relief on such claims unless it concludes that the state court merits determination was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law as set forth by the supreme court,d,or rested on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidentiary record before the state court,id.d.and a state court factual findings must be presumed correct,absent rebuttal by the petitioner by clear and convincing evidence.id.e.
as the supreme court has made clear,d permits federal habeas relief where a state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.wiggins smith,d quoting williams taylor,d.but that is a high threshold,and only an objectively unreasonable determination by a state court will warrant federal habeas relief.id.at see also tice johnson,cir.
grueninger primary argument is that his counsel was ineffective for failing to move to suppress his confession.we begin by setting out briefly the legal principles that govern this claim.
in edwards arizona,the supreme court held that once a suspect invokes his right to counsel under miranda,he is not subject to further interrogation by the police,unless in an exception not relevant here the suspect himself initiates renewed communication with the police.at.if the police do interrogate a suspect in custody after he asserts his right to counsel,then any statements they elicit are per se inadmissible,even if the suspect is again advised of his miranda rights.id.at.to establish an edwards violation,a petitioner must show both that he clearly and unambiguously invoked his right to counsel,davis united states,d edwards,at police may not interrogate a suspect who has clearly asserted his miranda right to counsel,and also that the police subsequently interrogated him,edwards,at prohibiting further custodial interrogation after invocation see rhode island innis,d miranda safeguards come into play when police engage in interrogation of a suspect in custody.
claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are evaluated under the framework set out in strickland washington.to prevail,a petitioner must show that his lawyer rendered constitutionally deficient performance,meaning that the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.strickland,at.under strickland,courts are to take a highly deferential look at counsel performance,so that review of a finding on deficiency becomes doubly deferential under aedpa.cullen pinholster,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.and a petitioner also must show prejudice from counsel deficiencies,meaning that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.
we have further refined the strickland analysis as it applies in cases,like this one,where an ineffectiveness claim is based on counsel failure to file a motion to suppress.under the deficient performance prong of strickland,it is enough to call into question counsel performance that an unfiled motion would have had some substance.tice,at.and the prejudice prong in such cases has two distinct components,with the petitioner required to show both that the motion was meritorious and likely would have been granted,and a reasonable probability that granting the motion would have affected the outcome of his trial.kimmelman morrison,d tice,at.
in applying d in this case,we look through the supreme court of virginia summary refusal to hear grueninger appeal and evaluate the circuit court reasoned decision on grueninger claim.see brumfield cain,d applying look through doctrine to evaluate state trial court reasoned decision denying claim on the merits where state supreme court summarily denied petition for review ylst nunnemaker,d federal habeas courts should presume that w here there has been one reasoned state judgment rejecting a federal claim,later unexplained orders upholding that judgment or rejecting the same claim rest upon the same ground.in other words,the decision that we review for objective reasonableness under aedpa highly deferential standard is that of the hanover circuit court,applying the edwards interrogation requirement to deny grueninger ineffective assistance claim.
the commonwealth appears to argue for a different approach.under harrington richter,an unexplained state supreme court judgment may be disturbed under d only if there is no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief.at emphasis added.so here,the commonwealth suggests,where the supreme court of virginia summarily refused to hear grueninger appeal,grueninger can prevail only by showing that any hypothetical ground for denying his claim,whether or not addressed by the circuit court,would be objectively unreasonable 
we disagree.richter addressed a situation in which a state habeas petition was presented directly to a state supreme court as an original petition and then denied by that court in a summary order,so that there was no reasoned decision by any state court.at.in those circumstances,the court held,where there is no indication of the state court reasoning,a federal habeas petitioner must show that there was no reasonable basis for the state court to deny relief,id.at,and a federal habeas court must defer under aedpa to any reasonable arguments or theories that could have supported the state court decision,id.at emphasis added.
but b y its terms,richter is limited to cases where a state court decision is unaccompanied by an explanation.woolley rednour,cir alteration omitted quoting richter,at.the situation is different when there is a decision explaining the rejection of a claim.id.when a state appellate court summarily affirms a reasoned decision,or refuses a petition for review,then under ylst,a federal habeas court is to look through the unexplained affirmance to examine the last reasoned decision on the claim,assuming that the summary appellate decision rests on the same ground.at.the maxim is that silence implies consent,not the opposite and courts generally behave accordingly,affirming without further discussion when they agree,not when they disagree,with the reasons given below.id.at.so in our case,we may assume that the supreme court of virginia has endorsed the reasoning of the circuit court in denying grueninger claim,and it is that reasoning that we are to evaluate against the deferential standards of d.
we recognize that the relationship between richter and ylst has generated some questions in the courts of appeals,though many courts have continued to apply ylst even after the richter,looking through summary affirmances and affording aedpa deference only to the grounds on which the last reasoned decision rests.see cannedy adams,cir concluding that if the supreme court had intended to disrupt common practice under ylst when it decided richter,it would have made that intention clear our court has not passed directly on the issue,though we have questioned whether ylst,which was concerned with determining whether a state court had refused relief on state procedural grounds,applies where a state procedural bar is not at issue and the last reasoned decision is on the merits.tice,at 
but to the extent there has been any doubt about the scope and continued vitality of ylst after richter,we think the supreme court clarified the matter in its decision of this year in brumfield,when it applied ylst on federal habeas review to look through a state supreme court summary denial of a petition for review to evaluate a state trial court reasoned decision denying a petitioner claim on the merits.at.deference under d,the court explained,extended only to the points actually determined by the state trial court in its reasoned decision the richter rule requiring deference to hypothetical reasons a state court might have given for rejecting a federal claim is limited to cases in which no state court has issued an opinion giving reasons for the denial of relief.id.at 
in light of brumfield,it is clear that the decision we are to evaluate under d is the determination of the hanover circuit court that grueninger could not make out an edwards violation and that his counsel therefore was not ineffective for failing to move to suppress his confession.it is to that determination that we now turn.
in rejecting grueninger ineffective assistance claim,the circuit court reasoned as follows 
the court finds reasonable counsel decision not to file a suppression motion,where petitioner made voluntary statements in response to being served with warrants one day in jail.exhibit affidavit of michael clower.the mere serving of these warrants was not designed to provoke incriminating statements from the petitioner and was not an interrogation,thus counsel correctly determined that the statements would not have been suppressed.the court dismisses this claim for failure to establish deficient performance or prejudice.strickland,d.
with due respect to the state court,we find that determination to be objectively unreasonable under d.
first,there is no question and indeed,the commonwealth does not dispute that when klisz visited grueninger in jail on march to serve new arrest warrants,he questioned grueninger about the charges against him.klisz trial testimony leaves no room for doubt on this point when the prosecutor asks,a fter you read him miranda,did he answer any of your questions klisz replies,he did i asked him questions and he talked about we talked about the case,and then,just a few moments later,elaborates,i asked him about the charges,they were all of a sexual nature.emphasis added.
second,it is equally plain and again,the commonwealth concedes that the asking of questions about the substance of a case constitutes interrogation for edwards purposes.see innis,at.the difficult issue when it comes to defining interrogation is not whether express questioning counts it does but whether police conduct short of direct questioning might also be covered.in innis,the supreme court answered that question in the affirmative,holding that interrogation includes not only express questioning but also its functional equivalent words or actions on the part of the police that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.id.footnotes omitted.the circuit court appears to have held that klisz serving of a new arrest warrant on grueninger did not rise to the level of interrogation under this alternative definition,as it was not designed to provoke incriminating statements from the petitioner.we need not quibble here with the circuit court substitution of a subjective standard designed to elicit for innis objective standard should know are reasonably likely to elicit,and may assume that the state court correctly,or at least not unreasonably under d,determined that confronting grueninger with the new arrest warrant did not itself constitute interrogation.but that is beside the point,because under any reading of the supreme court established precedent,klisz express questioning of grueninger about the charges against him surely does qualify as interrogation under edwards.innis,at.
the circuit court rejected grueninger ineffective assistance claim on the ground that because there was no interrogation,grueninger statements would not have been suppressed even if his counsel had moved to exclude them under edwards.there was not an interrogation,thus counsel correctly determined that the statements would not have been suppressed.the court dismisses this claim for failure to establish deficient performance or prejudice.the commonwealth does not defend that holding,and we believe the circuit court decision involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states under d 
the commonwealth urges us to affirm the dismissal of grueninger ineffective assistance claim on two alternative grounds.first,the commonwealth argues,the circuit court determination that any edwards motion to suppress would have been denied turns out to be correct,not because there was no interrogation,but because grueninger did not unequivocally invoke his miranda right to counsel.second,the commonwealth contends,the district court properly found that even had grueninger confession been suppressed,there was no reasonable probability that the result of his trial would have been different,and so no strickland prejudice.because the state court did not reach these questions,we consider them de novo.see brumfield.at where state trial court does not make finding on particular component of claim,there is no determination on that point to which a federal court must defer under d wiggins,at no aedpa deference in evaluating prong of strickland analysis that state court has not reached see also early packer,d per curiam habeas relief may be granted if either the reasoning or the result of the decision is objectively unreasonable under d 
the commonwealth primary argument is that grueninger can establish neither deficient performance nor prejudice under strickland because any suppression motion would have been denied.relying on clower representations in his affidavit,the commonwealth insists that clower made a deliberate tactical decision to forgo a suppression motion under edwards,predicated on his judgment that such a motion would be baseless because grueninger did not use the terminology needed to evoke sic his miranda rights when he said,i need an a ttorney.clower affidavit.we disagree.
we recognize that review of counsel performance under strickland is deferential,respecting the wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions.strickland,at.but on this record,it is hard to discern any tactics at all.clower did not,in fact,forgo an edwards objection he raised the edwards issue on the first day of trial.the only thing forgone was the opportunity to make his edwards argument in a timely manner and in writing,as required by local rules or,once that opportunity was lost,to accept the invitation of the trial judge to object at trial when the confession was introduced.a strategic judgment that baseless motions should be avoided,see clower affidavit,may be,but it can not explain a decision to raise a baseless claim only in an improper manner that ensures its denial.see tice,at finding deficient performance on habeas review and declining to engage in rationalization of a litigation strategy that almost certainly was never contemplated richards quarterman,cir finding
