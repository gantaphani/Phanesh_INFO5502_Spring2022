this case,involving the exhaustion requirement for habeas petitioners,requires us to examine some particulars of massachusetts appellate procedure.although we note the possibility that a portion of one of our prior decisions,barresi maloney,cir,might no longer be valid in light of the supreme court decision in baldwin reese,d,we need not decide that question here.we conclude that the habeas petitioner in this case succeeded in exhausting one claim,which the district court found unexhausted,because of the massachusetts rules of appellate procedure.we also find,however,that another claim was properly deemed unexhausted by the district court because the state rules do not reach as far as the petitioner has suggested.we therefore affirm in part,reverse in part and remand as to one claim.
state court proceedings 
because the specific facts of the crime underlying this case are not particularly relevant,we recount them only briefly,with the rebuttable presumption that factual findings by the state courts are correct.see e.a more complete recitation of the facts can be found in the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc opinion,commonwealth clements.
clements was convicted of murdering gregory tillery in.tillery was shot on a street corner by a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt.an eyewitness identified clements as the killer while testifying before the grand jury,but recanted that testimony at trial.the remainder of the evidence presented by the government was circumstantial.clements was convicted on charges of murder in the second degree by joint venture,armed assault with intent to murder,and unlicensed possession of a gun.a was acquitted.
clements was given a life sentence,and he immediately appealed his convictions.his motion for a new trial was denied,and he appealed that decision as well.clements made nine separate legal arguments to the appeals court,but his conviction was affirmed thereafter,he filed an application for leave to obtain further appellate review alofar with the sjc,raising only three legal claims 
the sjc granted further appellate review,limited to the sufficiency claim,and affirmed the conviction.the sjc held that the recanted testimony was not the sole evidence of guilt,as clements claimed,and that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict.clements argument in support of this claim,both in his alofar and his supplemental brief to the sjc,relied exclusively on state law.
federal court proceedings 
after the sjc rejected his direct appeal,clements filed this habeas petition in the district court raising six legal claims.three of them were the ones included in the alofar.two of the other three had been argued to the state appeals court.one had not previously been raised in any court.in response to the state motion to dismiss,clements argued that he had fully exhausted his state remedies on all six claims and that,if some claims were found unexhausted,he should be granted a stay in federal court so that he could return to state court to exhaust his remaining claims without fear of exceeding aedpa statute of limitations.the district court carefully reviewed the claims clements raised in his habeas petition,looking first at the claims that had been included in his alofar and then at the claims excluded therefrom,and concluded that only the jury claim was exhausted because it was the only one fairly presented by the petitioner for review as a federal claim.
more specifically,the court found that both the sufficiency and the joint venture claims were presented to the sjc solely as state law claims and that they therefore had not been exhausted.as to both of these claims,the district court stated that no federal cases were cited and the alofar did not articulate any federal issues in a recognizable way.
with respect to the claims raised in the habeas petition that had not appeared in the alofar,the court found that three of these claims were presented to the appeals court as state law claims,while two were originally argued in reliance on both state and federal law.one claim appeared in the habeas petition,despite not being raised before either the appeals court or sjc clements argued that all of these claims had some basis in federal law,and that they ought to be found exhausted because a review of the brief filed with the appeals court revealed those federal bases.the district court found clements arguments meritless because the supreme court decision in baldwin reese,d,held that a claim can not be exhausted if it is not presented directly to the state highest court.
finally,the district court rejected clements request for a stay of his habeas petition because the failure to exhaust was a result of deliberate,tactical decisions by clements counsel.the court noted our decision in neverson bissonnette,cir,which endorsed granting stays in certain cases,but concluded that this case did not merit a stay.the district court issued a provisional decision,allowing clements to decide whether to proceed in federal court on his single exhausted claim by voluntarily dismissing the other,unexhausted claims or to dismiss his whole petition and return to state court.
clements requested additional time to respond to the district court provisional order,citing the supreme court decision regarding mixed habeas petitions,rhines weber,d the request was granted and clements subsequently informed the district court that he would not voluntarily dismiss any of his habeas claims in order to proceed with the exhausted claim,and that he fe lt strongly that the supreme court decision in rhines weber supports his request for a s tay.the district court then dismissed clements petition pursuant to its earlier provisional order.
the requirement that habeas petitioners exhaust all available state remedies was originally imposed by the supreme court in rose lundy,d.subsequently,congress codified the requirement as part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,b a,and also added a one year statute of limitations for the filing of habeas petitions,id.d.regardless of its source,the exhaustion requirement has long served to infuse into our habeas jurisprudence the interests of comity and federalism.see,rose,at.finding that it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal district court to upset a state court conviction without an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional violation,and that a rigorously enforced total exhaustion rule will encourage state prisoners to seek full relief first from the state courts,thus giving those courts the first opportunity to review all claims of constitutional error quoting darr burford.
in order to exhaust a claim,the petitioner must present the federal claim fairly and recognizably to the state courts,meaning that he must show that he tendered his federal claim in such a way as to make it probable that a reasonable jurist would have been alerted to the existence of the federal question.casella clemons,cir quoting adelson dipaola,cir.this means that the legal theory articulated in the state and federal courts must be the same.gagne fair,cir.this standard must be met,as a general rule,by fairly present ing a federal claim within the four corners of the alofar.mele fitchburg dist,cir.we have previously held that a habeas petitioner may accomplish this by doing any of the following citing a provision of the federal constitution presenting a federal constitutional claim in a manner that fairly alerts the state court to the federal nature of the claim citing federal constitutional precedents or claiming violation of a right specifically protected in the federal constitution.gagne,at.we have also noted that,in some situations,citations to state court decisions which rely on federal law or articulation of a state claim that is,as a practical matter,indistinguishable from one arising under federal law,may suffice to satisfy the exhaustion requirement.nadworny fair,cir.it is,however,clearly inadequate to simply recite the facts underlying a state claim,where those facts might support either a federal or state claim.martens shannon,cir.
clements contends that all six of his habeas claims have satisfied the exhaustion requirement because they were all presented to the appeals court with some citation or reference to federal cases.he explains that our precedent,barresi maloney,cir,permitting us to review certain backdrop materials in some cases,in combination with massachusetts procedural rules,effectively renders his brief to the appeals court presented to the sjc,meaning that all the arguments he made before the appeals court were made to the sjc.the government responds by arguing that our decision in barresi has been invalidated by the supreme court more recent decision in baldwin reese,d.
we begin with the two claims that were presented in the alofar,which the district court found to be unexhausted first the joint venture claim and then the sufficiency claim.we will briefly comment on the government argument about the continued vitality of our barresi decision in the context of the joint venture claim.we then turn to the claims that were omitted entirely from the alofar.our review of the district court decision regarding exhaustion is de novo.goodrich hall,cir barresi,at.
joint venture claim 
one of clements three alofar joint venture presented to the sjc solely in terms of state law.the portion of clements alofar discussing this claim relied on no federal cases and did not label the claim as federal.it also made no arguments using vague and possibly federal law based phrases,such as due process.clements argues,nonetheless,that this claim was exhausted because,under barresi,at,the exhaustion analysis should include a review of backdrop materials,such as the appeals court brief,wherein he says that the federal nature of his claim was made clear.in order to evaluate this claim,we must determine whether barresi applies to a claim styled like clements joint venture claim.
barresi maloney 
in barresi,we held that,where a claim has not been abandoned before the state highest court,the exhaustion analysis includes an examination of the backdrop against which later filings must be viewed,at second alteration in original quoting scarpa dubois,cir,and that backdrop includes the pleadings and filings submitted to lower state courts,id barresi also recognized the continued validity of the four corners rule,see mele,at,and held that the backdrop materials could only be consulted under certain circumstances.at.
at that time,we did not specify what those limited circumstances might be.however,in barresi itself,the alofar at issue included claims regarding the right to confront adverse witnesses and due process,both of which are claims that may be grounded either in state law or federal law or both,and cited state court cases that relied upon federal law.id.at.therefore,we found that barresi alofar minimally satisfied the exhaustion requirement.as part of the explanation for that conclusion,we noted that the same claims had been raised in the intermediate appellate brief,where barresi had directly cited federal precedents.id.at.
we have subsequently said that the barresi backdrop rule applies only in cases where the alofar or other petition to a state supreme court was ambiguous about the federal nature of a claim,as it was in barresi.see josselyn dennehy,cir noting that barresi s backdrop principle applies when there is ambiguity in the alofar regarding the federal nature of the claim goodrich,at reviewing the petitioner lower court briefs as part of the exhaustion analysis,because the alofar relied primarily on state cases,but was somewhat ambiguous about the source of the legal claim.
because this case involves an alofar that was not ambiguous,the barresi backdrop principle,assuming it is still valid,provides no assistance to clements.we add that qualifier about the continuing validity of the backdrop principle because of the supreme court decision in baldwin reese.
in baldwin,at,the court held that,where a federal claim was not included in a petition,the exhaustion analysis could not encompass materials beyond the petition or brief filed with the state highest court.in that case,the defendant had filed a petition seeking discretionary appellate review by the oregon supreme court and had argued some claims based on federal law and other claims based only on state law.the defendant later filed a habeas petition and argued that at least one of the claims which was presented on state law grounds could be deemed exhausted because a review of the intermediate appellate court opinion showed that he had made federal law arguments on that claim below.pursuant to oregon procedural rules,oregon supreme court justices had access to the lower court opinions in cases for which a petition was filed,but their rules did not require them to review such opinions.id.at.rather,the rules required a party seeking review to assert all claims in the appellate brief.
at the outset of its analysis,the supreme court noted its assumption that the defendant petition by itself did not properly alert the oregon supreme court to the federal nature of the claim.id.at.the court then reasoned that,in such a context,permitting the exhaustion inquiry to include a review of the lower court opinion simply because the state court judges had an opportunity to review it would effectively mean that those judges must read the lower court otherwise they would forfeit the state opportunity to decide that federal claim in the first instance.id.at.the supreme court found that burden incompatible with the considerations of comity that the exhaustion requirement seeks to promote.id.at.therefore,the court held that ordinarily a state prisoner does not fairly present a claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition or a brief that does not alert it to the presence of a federal claim in order to find material that does so.id.
the barresi approach to the exhaustion analysis may be incompatible with baldwin.barresi permits us to consider lower court pleadings or opinions where the state court did not and was not required to consider them itself.however,as we have explained,we subsequently limited the barresi backdrop principle to cases in which there is an ambiguity in the alofar about the federal nature of the claim.whether baldwin forecloses consideration of backdrop materials even in cases of ambiguous petitions is a question we need not decide here because clements joint venture claim is unmistakably couched only in state law terms.we therefore reserve the issue of the continuing validity of barresi backdrop principle for a case in which it is directly raised.
massachusetts procedural rules 
clements offers an alternative to his barresi argument in support of his claim that he fairly presented his joint venture claim to the sjc.he argues that massachusetts rule of appellate procedure mrap permits him to rely on the brief that he filed with the massachusetts appeals court to demonstrate the exhaustion of his claim.
mrap rule says that the full appeals court record should be transferred to the sjc after further appellate review is granted.at the time of clements appeal,the rule also stated that the sjc appeal would be conducted on the basis of the appeals court briefs see infra note explaining subsequent alteration of this rule.clements contends that after further appellate review is granted regardless of whether it is a limited or general grant,the entire appeals court brief is properly before the sjc,in the same way that the arguments contained in the alofar were before the sjc.he contends that mrap has the effect,therefore,of rendering all the arguments he presented to the lower court exhausted because the sjc was in possession of the full appeals court record,including his appeals court brief.citing this possession,and the provision regarding reliance on the appeals court brief,clements claims that the sjc is actually required by state rules to review the lower court papers.consequently,he argues,his appeals court brief should be treated as a part of the sjc evaluation of his claim,just as the alofar is so treated,and not as additional or independent backdrop material.
clements argument the significance of a limited grant of further appellate review.clements relies on the provision which allows an appeal,after further review has been granted,to be argued on the basis of the appeals court brief for his contention that the entire brief not just the portion relevant to a limited grant must be reviewed by the sjc.see mele,at noting that mrap requires the lower court record to be forwarded to the sjc only grants an alofar.as we have noted,the sjc in this case granted further review on only one issue the sufficiency claim.under massachusetts rules,when the sjc issues a limited grant,it does not decide any issues beyond the one or ones granted review for this reason,the formal transfer of the appeals court record to the sjc does not require the sjc to review briefing or other materials relating to issues beyond the one s for which review was granted.here,the sjc receipt of the lower court record,including the appeals court brief,is relevant only to the one issue sufficiency of the evidence on which it exercised its appellate jurisdiction.on the issues for which review was denied,such as the joint venture claim,the physical transfer of the record and the use of the appeals court brief for argument on the sufficiency claim are irrelevant to the exhaustion inquiry.
we find further support for this conclusion in the general principles articulated in baldwin,at.clements interpretation of mrap would effectively require the sjc to read and evaluate all of the arguments presented to the lower court after even a limited grant of further review,which is precisely what baldwin sought to preclude.in claiming that a limited grant of further review places the full record including both the trial court and appeals court proceedings before the sjc,and that the exhaustion analysis should encompass that full record,clements invites the federal habeas court to ignore the state procedural rules.however,disregarding the difference between a limited grant and a general grant would contravene baldwin.baldwin clearly limits the exhaustion analysis to the materials that a state highest court reviewed while deciding whether to grant a discretionary appeal or evaluating such an appeal on its merits.id.at.materials that are merely accessible to that court are not to be reviewed in an exhaustion inquiry.
under mrap,the portion of the appeals court brief relating to the joint venture claim was not before the sjc when it reviewed clements appeal on the merits.therefore,our review of the district court finding that the joint venture claim was not exhausted must be based solely on the contents of the alofar.
exhaustion of the joint venture claim 
clements has not sought to persuade us that his alofar described,or even hinted at,a federal basis for his joint venture claim.the alofar discussion of this claim refers only to state law,and none of the cited state cases relied on federal law.the federal basis for the claim was not presented fairly and recognizably,casella,at,nor did clements articulate a federal law argument in such a way as to make it probable that a reasonable jurist would have been alerted to the existence of the federal question,scarpa,at.without any references,explicit or implicit,to federal law or principles,the alofar presentation of the joint venture claim did not apprise the sjc of a possible federal error in the state court decision.therefore,we agree with the district court conclusion that the joint venture claim was not exhausted.
b.the sufficiency claim 
unlike the joint venture claim,the sjc granted clements further appellate review for his sufficiency claim.this important fact distinguishes our analysis of this claim from all other claims in this case,as well as the claims discussed in recent cases such as goodrich,at,and josselyn,at where the claims at issue were not even mentioned in the alofar and were deemed abandoned when the alofar was filed with the sjc.the grant of further appellate review is significant,as we have explained,because of the procedural rules in massachusetts.
prior to a amendment,mrap f stated that after further appellate review is granted,a party may elect to proceed with the appeal before the sjc on the basis of the appeals court brief previously filed or may petition for permission to submit a new separate or supplemental brief.see.reporter.clements requested,and was granted,permission to file a new brief.at the time of clements appeal,the massachusetts rules did not expressly indicate whether the new brief would be considered exclusively or alongside the appeals court brief.because the rules said that a new brief may be supplemental,we assume here that the sjc reviewed both the appeals court brief on the sufficiency issue only and the new or supplemental brief therefore,we examine the alofar,the supplemental brief to the sjc,and the relevant portion of the appeals court materials actually reviewed by the determine whether clements sufficiency claim was exhausted.
in his alofar,relying on massachusetts cases,clements urged the sjc to reverse his conviction because the inconsistent,recanted,extra judicial grand jury testimony tying him to the crime was not corroborated by any more reliable evidence,and therefore was insufficient under commonwealth daye.clements argues that this claim was exhausted because his appeals court brief included a citation to a supreme court decision,barber page,d,for the simple proposition that the right to confront adverse witnesses is a trial right.
we find it doubtful that this single cite to a supreme court case is enough to satisfy the fair presentation requirement.however,clements appeals court brief did label this claim as follows the court violated clement rights pursuant to the sixth and fourteenth amendments as well as article xii of the massachusetts declaration of rights,when it held at trial and on the motion for a new trial that the jury could consider willis grand jury identification as substantive evidence of clement sic guilt.in baldwin,the supreme court found that such labeling of a claim would be enough to satisfy the fair presentation requirement.at.noting that a petitioner who wish es to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a petition or brief,for example,by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds,or by simply labeling the claim federal.therefore,with this label the sufficiency claim was exhausted,and the district court erred in ruling otherwise.
clements four other claims 
clements habeas petition included,in addition to the three alofar claims the joint venture and sufficiency claims discussed above,and the jury claim found exhausted by the district court,four additional claims three of these four claims were presented to the appeals court,but none were raised before the sjc because they were not mentioned in the alofar 
both baldwin,at,and barresi,at,explicitly hold that claims omitted from an alofar or similar petition are unexhausted.see also josselyn,at we observed in mele,that finding exhaustion where a claim appeared in the appeals court decision but was omitted from the alofar would unfairly require the sjc to go over each and every opinion of the appeals court with a fine tooth comb,in an unremitting search for errors that the parties have neglected to pursue second alteration in original quoting mele,at.the district court therefore correctly ruled that these four claims,omitted from the alofar,were not exhausted.
nature of the remand 
we have now determined that,in addition to the jury claim deemed exhausted by the district court,the sufficiency claim was also exhausted.clements habeas petition remains mixed,and he can not proceed on a mixed petition.see rose,at.where a petition is deemed mixed,district courts must either dismiss the petition in compliance with the total exhaustion rule announced in rose,id.at.or permit the petitioner to dismiss his unexhausted claims,id.at.therefore,we remand the petition to the district court,where clements should be given the opportunity to dismiss his unexhausted claims.see kelly small,cir remanding an entire petition to the district
