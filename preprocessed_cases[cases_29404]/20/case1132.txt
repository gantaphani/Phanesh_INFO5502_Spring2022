nathaniel quarterman quarterman appeals the opinion and order of the district court granting virgil euristi martinez martinez petition for a writ of habeas corpus based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.martinez alleged,and the district court agreed,that his trial attorneys,jerri yenne and stan mcgee,provided ineffective assistance of counsel by inadequately investigating temporal lobe epilepsy tle as mitigating evidence at the punishment phase of his trial.however,we conclude that reasonable professional judgments supported counsel limited investigation into tle and that martinez failed to establish prejudice as a result of counsel limited investigation.the texas court of criminal appeals denial of martinez application for habeas relief was not objectively unreasonable.we therefore reverse.
factual and procedural history 
this is the second time that this court has considered martinez petition for habeas corpus martinez alleges that his counsel provided ineffective assistance at the punishment phase of his trial because they failed to fully investigate tle as mitigating evidence.martinez contends that the tle evidence would have rebutted the state case of future dangerousness,provided the jury with a vehicle to spare his life,both in terms of future dangerousness and mitigation,and provided an explanation for his behavior and violent crime.at.in support of his claim,martinez submitted affidavits from theodore pearlman and anand mehendale,in which the doctors opined that tle played a role in martinez committing the murders.although the state habeas record contained affidavits from martinez trial counsel,those affidavits did not clearly demonstrate the extent of counsel investigation into and knowledge of tle.
given the indeterminacy of the record,we vacated the district court denial of habeas and remanded for further development of the record.we instructed the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether counsel investigation of martinez temporal lobe epilepsy was unreasonably deficient and,if so,whether counsel failure to investigate this condition and produce evidence relating to it amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.martinez.at.specifically,we asked the district court to clarify how much of the information in pearlman february,report did yenne learn in her investigation,and whether the report should have triggered further investigation whether mehendale told yenne that martinez suffered from tle or about that condition effect on aggressive behavior and whether yenne read martinez school records and considered how tle might relate to the behavioral problems noted therein.id.at.
a magistrate judge held a hearing on june,and the parties submitted additional deposition evidence to the court.the magistrate judge determined that yenne read pearlman report and knew of his diagnosis of tle.the report and recommendation concluded that yenne did not understand the relationship between tle and aggression or martinez future dangerousness because she failed to ask mehendale his medical opinion on these subjects.the magistrate judge also found that,though yenne read the school records,she never asked either pearlman or mehendale about how tle might explain martinez behavioral problems in school.according to the magistrate judge,counsel failure to further investigate tle constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.the report and recommendation concluded that counsel failure to fully investigate tle prejudiced martinez because,with further investigation,counsel could have rebutted much of the state aggravating evidence and could have given the jury an explanation for martinez crime.accordingly,on november,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation advising that the district court grant habeas relief.
on february,the district court issued an opinion and order accepting the magistrate judge report and recommendation and granted martinez petition for habeas relief.quarterman now appeals the district court opinion and order.
ii.standard of review 
in a habeas appeal,this court reviews the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo,applying the same standards to the state court decision as did the district court.busby dretke,cir.
martinez filed his habeas petition after the effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,therefore,aedpa governs this appeal.lindh murphy,d.under aedpa,this court may not grant habeas relief on a claim that a state court has adjudicated on the merits unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.riddle cockrell,cir quoting d internal quotations omitted.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it relies on legal rules that directly conflict with prior holdings of the supreme court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the supreme court on materially indistinguishable facts.busby,at citing williams taylor,d.a decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it is objectively unreasonable.pondexter dretke,cir.the decision of the state court might be incorrect,but still fall below the objectively unreasonable threshold.see neal puckett,cir.this court must presume that a state court findings of fact are correct,and the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.see e.
ten years after aedpa enactment,its standards are by now familiar,but quarterman vigorously objects that neither the magistrate judge nor the district court applied aedpa deference.we need not decide this particular issue because we are persuaded that,irrespective of aedpa deference,the district court erred in finding ineffective assistance under strickland washington,d.
iii.discussion 
in strickland,the supreme court articulated the standard for establishing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.martinez must demonstrate both that his counsel performance was deficient and counsel deficient performance prejudiced his defense.strickland,at.counsel performance is deficient if it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at.the supreme court has instructed that judicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential.id.at.a reviewing court should make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.id.further,strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.id.at.emphasis added.
in addition to deficient performance,martinez must demonstrate prejudice.deficient performance results in prejudice when there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.more precisely,in a capital case such as this one,the standard is whether there is a reasonable probability that,absent the errors,the sentencer would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.id.at.
deficient performance and inadequate investigation 
the gravamen of martinez ineffective assistance of counsel claim is that his counsel prejudiced his defense by failing to conduct a reasonably adequate investigation of tle as mitigating evidence.the magistrate judge found that counsel read pearlman report and knew of pearlman opinion that martinez committed murder during the course of a seizure.nevertheless,both martinez and the district court fault counsel for not further investigating tle and discovering the links between tle and aggression,tle and martinez poor disciplinary record at school,and how tle could have explained martinez bizarre and,at times,violent behavior at the kerrville state hospital.however,strickland does not require counsel to fully investigate all mitigating evidence.the strickland court recognized there would be times when reasonable professional judgments support ed limitations on investigation.at.see also wiggins smith,d in assessing the reasonableness of an attorney investigation,however,a court must consider not only the quantum of evidence already known to counsel,but also whether the known evidence would lead a reasonable attorney to investigate further.certainly counsel did not fully explore tle,but we must decide whether counsel decision to forego further investigation was based on reasonable professional judgments.
without a doubt,pearlman report brimmed with information which could have been useful to martinez mitigation case,but it also teemed with damaging information which convinced counsel not to pursue tle any further pearlman report contained information which counsel rightly did not want the jury to hear.first and foremost,counsel thought that it would be more harmful than beneficial for the jury to learn that martinez had a mental disorder which,in pearlman words,caused savage and uncontrolled aggressiveness.yenne dep.vol.at.counsel believed that this might cause the jury to believe that martinez was a complete danger to society and that he was incapable of controlling any of his behavior.id.at counsel thought that evidence of martinez aggressiveness,even if it were caused by a physical condition,would not sit well with a brazoria county jury.id.at.the evidence for martinez tle embodies the type of evidence which this circuit has repeatedly stated that counsel may elect not to present to the jury.martinez dretke,cir martinez ii johnson,at.
the tle evidence failed to impress counsel not only because it suggested that martinez was prone to aggressiveness,but also because counsel feared that the jury simply would not believe it.counsel suspected that the jury would not accept that epilepsy caused the murders because epilepsy is a fairly common disorder and,in most people experience,does not result in such catastrophic violence.yenne dep.vol.at further,yenne believed that martinez lack of violent incidents in jail was inconsistent with someone who could not control his behavior.id.vol.at.counsel were also skeptical of pearlman opinion that martinez committed the murders while having a seizure mcgee questioned how a seizure could last long enough to encompass four murders in which the victims were shot multiple times,requiring martinez to reload.mcgee dep.at.the law permits counsel to question pearlman conclusions based on their review of the evidence.see riley dretke,cir allowing counsel not to put on evidence of mental retardation where counsel subjective belief that his client was not retarded based on counsel observations of the client,information from the family,and school records.
in addition to suggesting that martinez was prone to aggressiveness,pearlman report was based,in part,on school records which showed that martinez engaged in antisocial behavior from a young age.counsel feared that letting pearlman testify about tle would open the door to martinez troubling school records.a fairly representative sample of those records noted that martinez exhibited explosive behavior,thinks about and plans what he can do to get back at those who have bothered him,and once brought live caliber cartridges to class.res.ex.vol.tab e at.pearlman report gave no indication that tle caused or contributed to these behavioral problems.even if pearlman report had suggested that tle was the cause,such evidence would have been.
finally,pearlman report contained information which counsel believed undermined their overall trial strategy.the report referenced a quotation from martinez mother in which she stated that martinez was jealous in his love for veronica fuentes.counsel concluded,not unreasonably,that this provided the state with a motive for the murders where before it did not have one.yenne dep.vol.at.counsel believed that evidence of jealousy or stalking would have cinched the death penalty for martinez.id.at.the report also mentioned martinez confession to pearlman that he had killed john gomez counsel believed that conceding martinez had killed gomez would have conflicted with their strategy of arguing mistaken identity at the phase of the trial.while there is certainly no formal rule against switching theories between the punishment and phases of the trial,in this case,counsel believed that switching theories would make them lose credibility with the jury and appear hypocritical.yenne dep.vol.at.indeed,stan mcgee testified that,in his experience,juries did not react well to a switch in theories between the different phases of the trial.counsel chose to argue residual doubt rather than presenting inconsistent theories to the jury.see,moore johnson,cir noting that this circuit has held that arguing residual doubt may be a reasonable,even highly beneficial,strategy in a capital case.
after reading pearlman report,counsel knew that pearlman believed that martinez suffered from a mental disorder which made him prone to aggressive behavior and that martinez committed the murders during a seizure therefore,this case is unlike lockett anderson,in which we found that counsel provided ineffective assistance where counsel failed to discover evidence of brain abnormalities because counsel did not follow up on evidence which suggested psychological problems.cir.given all of the damaging information contained in pearlman report,counsel made a reasonable professional judgment to limit their investigation into tle as mitigating evidence.
despite counsel reasonable reservations about presenting tle to the jury,counsel did make some attempts to follow up on the tle evidence discovered in pearlman report.jerri yenne met with mehendale and asked the doctor what he thought of pearlman opinion that martinez committed the murders during an epileptic seizure.mehendale responded that he believed it was unlikely that martinez committed the murders while martinez was having a seizure.faced with conflicting expert testimony about the role that tle played in the commission of the crimes,it was reasonable for counsel to conclude that tle was not worth pursuing.counsel believed that it made no sense to put on experts with different opinions.yenne dep.vol.at.
nevertheless,the district court and martinez both fault counsel for not asking mehendale about aggression or how tle might explain martinez poor behavioral record at school and at the kerrville state hospital.to fault counsel for not asking these particular questions is to engage in the kind of hindsight that strickland warned against.at.perhaps different counsel might have asked those questions,but this does not mean that martinez counsel actions fell below an objective standard of reasonableness because they failed to do so.id.at.yenne pointedly asked mehendale to evaluate pearlman opinion that martinez committed the murders during a seizure and mehendale rejected that position.in a minute conversation with yenne,mehendale never suggested that,while it was unlikely martinez committed the murders during a seizure,aggression could have accounted for the murders.mehendale dep.at.yenne is a lawyer,not a medical doctor.yenne and mcgee personal experiences with and knowledge of epilepsy did not put them on notice of aggression.mcgee dep.at yenne dep.vol.at see also martinez ii,at taking into account counsel personal and professional experience in evaluating whether counsel should have been put on notice to investigate further.further,and perhaps more importantly,there was simply nothing in pearlman report which would have alerted counsel to the possibility of aggression or to a link between martinez behavioral problems in school and tle 
instead of pursuing tle,counsel made the strategic choice to argue residual doubt at the punishment phase.counsel believed that they had a strong chance of prevailing on a direct appeal with respect to some exclusion of evidence issues.yenne d
