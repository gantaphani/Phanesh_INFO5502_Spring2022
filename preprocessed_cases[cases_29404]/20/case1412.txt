christopher hall filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in connection with his state convictions.a michigan jury convicted hall of criminal sexual conduct against his daughter as well as obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice.during the trial,both the prosecutor and defense counsel elicited testimony about hall silence during an earlier probate court proceeding and commented on hall silence during their respective closings.on habeas review,the district court concluded that the testimony and remarks of the prosecutor violated hall federal constitutional rights to due process and against.moreover,defense counsel failure to object to the testimony and remarks constituted ineffective assistance of trial counsel.the district court conditionally granted habeas relief to hall.the warden,doug vasbinder,now appeals.
for the reasons set forth below,we reverse.
hall trial 
the charges against hall arose out of an incident that occurred in august.hall daughter,who was then old,testified that at the time,she lived with her father and dondrea hall in charlotte,michigan.she said that around august of that year,she took a weekend trip to her grandparents house in kalkaska,michigan,with her father,sister,and best friend.on saturday of that weekend,she suffered a slight accident on an vehicle,and that night,while hall and the children were watching television,her father gave her a back rub.she testified that hall,her sister,and her friend were in the room with her watching television,while her,janet hall hall,and dondrea were in the dining room,a short distance away.
hall daughter testified that at some point during the back rub,hall started massaging her breast,and continued to squeeze and rub her breast for four or five minutes.she testified that her told hall to leave her alone and go to bed.she said that her father appeared to be drunk at the time.she testified that the next morning,she told dondrea what had happened,and that dondrea in turn talked to hall.they drove back to charlotte that day,and hall told his daughter that he was sorry,that he would make sure it never happened again,and that he would never again drink all day.she took this to mean that he was apologizing for drinking,not for fondling her.janet,dondrea,art hall chris father,and his daughter friend all testified at trial that they did not see hall massage his daughter breast.hall also testified that he did not intentionally massage his daughter breast.
in december,the family again went to kalkaska,and when they returned,hall daughter told her birth mother,who lived in kansas,what had happened back in august.her mother instructed her to tell a school counselor,which she did.subsequently,the daughter spoke to kellogg of the michigan state police and marie iott of the family independence agency.the following day at school,while the daughter was waiting in a school office to talk with iott again,dondrea came in,said that the daughter had to leave for a doctor appointment,and drove her home.dondrea yelled at her and telephoned her father,who came home from work.
hall daughter,dondrea,and hall then drove to the office of victoria easterday,an attorney.the two adults waited in a conference room while the girl talked to easterday privately about what had happened.when they returned to the conference room,easterday informed hall of the legal consequences if he were found guilty of criminal sexual conduct.hall daughter testified that easterday told her that it would be a good idea for her to write a letter to kellogg to the effect that she made the whole thing up.she testified that she did not want her father to get into trouble and felt intimidated.she also said that later that evening at home,she wrote the letter as dondrea watched her.dondrea then took the letter and read it over the phone to easterday.afterward,dondrea showed the letter to hall.however,the daughter hid the letter under her mattress because she did not want it to be sent.three drafts of the letter were admitted as an exhibit.
a hearing was held the next day in eaton county probate court.hall,dondrea,and hall daughter all attended.easterday represented hall and a attorney represented the girl.kellogg was the only witness who testified at the hearing.following the hearing,hall daughter was temporarily placed in foster care and then permanently placed with her birth mother who lived in kansas hall was subsequently arrested on february.
matters concerning the probate hearing 
during the trial,the subject of who had the opportunity to testify and who did,in fact,testify at the probate hearing came up on multiple occasions.given the centrality of this topic to hall habeas claims,following is a detailed account of the arguments and testimony about who testified at the probate hearing.
the prosecutor noted during his opening statement that hall daughter was removed from hall home as a result of the probate hearing.the prosecutor did not refer to who did or did not testify at the hearing.immediately after the prosecutor finished,defense counsel gave an opening statement.counsel made it clear that one of the main defense themes was going to be governmental overreach.specifically,defense counsel stated near the end of his opening statement 
hall will testify that he was abruptly summoned to a probate court hearing.he went to a court hearing,and he was told,the court takes jurisdiction of not only your two children the daughter,and her younger sister,children of the mother in kansas.but also takes jurisdiction of the child that you and dondria have and place them under the jurisdiction of the court,and they going into foster care,and that exactly what happened.they went into foster care.dondria hall left chris.subsequently,she filed for divorce.
what happens after that he ends up filing a bankruptcy proceeding because he loses his house.loses just about everything.and he would lose everything if it was for this jury.and what caused that was that the child was it something that chris did or,was it government we contend it was government.
trial transcript tt i.
hall daughter was the prosecution first witness.on direct,the prosecutor asked her if there was a court hearing about putting the children into foster care,and she testified that there was such a hearing.the prosecutor did not ask her who testified during the hearing.on,the following colloquy occurred between defense counsel and hall daughter 
q when you were there,did dondrea anything to this person that put you in foster care 
a what do you mean 
q she say anything from the witness stand,like this a chair,with 
q did your father 
a not that that i remember.
q so,you,and your younger sister,and your even younger sister were taken into foster care with no testimony.spoken by you,or dondrea,or your father.
a i did say anything.i do remember if my dad did,or not.
tt ii.on redirect,the prosecutor asked her whether she had an attorney at the hearing she did and whether her father was present and represented by easterday yes to both.
iott confirmed on direct that easterday represented hall at the probate hearing.she also testified that hall attorney had an opportunity to question any witness and to contest the proceedings.
kellogg testified for the prosecution after iott.during his direct testimony,the following colloquy took place 
q did you,yourself,testify at this hearing 
a i did.i believe i was the only one who did testify after the petition was read into the record.
q did christopher hall testify in that hearing about the custody of his daughter 
a no.he did.
q did the parties have an opportunity for anybody else to testify that wanted to 
a yes.it was done.
tt iii.defense counsel did not kellogg.
hall testified on his own behalf.on direct,his counsel asked him about the hearing.hall testified that it happened fast.it was just shooo.tt iii.then,on,the following exchange occurred between the prosecutor and hall 
q and i think we heard defense counsel tell the jury that,basically,with almost no ifs,ands,or buts,the kids were just taken away from you.why did you testify at that hearing,hall 
a it went quick.everything was was a room full of attorneys,and a room not much bigger than that jury box,and we were all crammed in there.and it was just bang,bang,bang.and i asked vic attorney easterday if i could say anything,and she said,i recommend you did say nothin.
q oh.i see.so,it was that you did have a chance.it was that you could talk.it was that all this process went on without any opportunity for you.it that you did and your lawyer told you not to.that what happened,right 
a she said,i suggest you did.
q okay.so you just pause you just passed on your opportunity to have some input into that process.you could have.
a i guess.yeah.
q well,i mean,come on,hall.your kids were bein removed.
a we did know that at that time.that was determined at the end of the hearing.
q oh.so you just sat there like a bump on a log,and did even think about what the proceeding was involving 
a we did know exactly what the proceeding was involving 
tt iii.hall counsel did not object to any of this questioning.
in his closing argument to the jury,the prosecutor made the following statements regarding the probate hearing 
see,this government action,this was this did make anything permanent all this did was a hearing to determine that there was some good reason to think that there was enough of a problem and these kids were at risk,to take them out,call timeout and look into it.so again,as you start to think about this government intrusion in the untroubled family think about that,and probably most striking of all was the discovery for all of us that at that process that was portrayed as being so sinister and unfair the defendant was there with his attorney,who sat there silent and made no objection and made no statement and offered no testimony at all,who stood there and what did he do hid from the proceedings,he hid from the proceedings,he did not say a word while this was going on.he cowered in fear of discovery for what he had done and what he did that week to try to thwart this investigation.that what happened that friday it was the guilty man in court being whispered to by his lawyer saying do get involved in this,they might find something out.that what you can conclude from that process where detective kellogg just explained what hall daughter told him and a decision was made,this kids are at risk right now,we got to make some adjustments here until we can find out more.
tt iv emphasis added.the prosecutor again alluded to hall silence later in his closing detective kellogg explains how he testified at the placement hearing.the defendant made no statement at the hearing,even though he could.tt iv.
hall counsel then addressed the subject of the probate hearing during his own closing argument.he argued that hall did not,in fact,have an opportunity to testify at the hearing 
okay,all this stuff is going on,so what does one of the governmental representatives do,and that includes the referee over at the eaton county probate court,they get up a quick hearing,give lawyers to these people dondrea did even want the lawyer,she called him john something,put them in a small room,there is no opportunity to testify they let detective kellogg testify,marie iott testified.the referee did say i want to hear the kid,i want to hear what going on before issuing an order taking children away from their parents.then what happens hall daughter gone,her siblings are gone whoosh,out they go,and they never come back to chris at all.that very thing,the very thing that dondrea said she was concerned about happened,the family was broken up the family split,children gone,he lost his house,lost his family,he in bankruptcy.what more could the state do maybe they were acting under good intentions the prosecutor would have you believe for all the best of intentions.look what happened to this man.
tt iv emphasis added.
during his rebuttal closing argument,the prosecutor returned to the issue of the probate hearing 
counsel said,then,back to the government.his words,i think,were cobbled up a quick hearing,very little opportunity to testify.i ask you this,how long does it take to prepare if all you gon na do is go in there and tell the truth how big of a deal is it to go somewhere and answer a few questions if it the truth it not a big deal.what a big deal is if it a lie and you got ta cover all the bases and get to everybody and put something together.that why the defendant did testify at that hearing that friday because they had been able to get victoria easterday up to get the grandparents handled and get everything nailed down yet.he had to stay out of it because everybody did have their stories straight.that was guilt working there and guilty knowledge.the truth is always the truth,it the truth the minute you asked you do have to get it straight,it is straight.
tt iv emphasis added.defense counsel did not object to any of the prosecutor comments during closing.
after the prosecutor finished with his rebuttal,the trial court instructed the jury.as to what constitutes evidence,the court explained 
when you discuss the case and decide on your verdict you may only consider the evidence that has been properly admitted in the case evidence includes only the sworn testimony of witnesses and the exhibit admitted into evidence.many things are not evidence and you must be careful not to consider them as such the lawyers statements and arguments are not evidence,they are only meant to help you understand the evidence and each side legal theories you should only accept things the lawyers say that are supported by the evidence or by your own common sense and general knowledge.
c.the verdict and direct appeal 
the jury found hall guilty on all charges one count of second degree criminal sexual conduct csc,mcl b one count of obstruction of justice,mcl and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice,mcl,a.the trial court sentenced him to to months on the csc count and to months on the obstruction and conspiracy counts,to run concurrently.
on direct review,the michigan court of appeals,in an unpublished per curiam opinion,acknowledged that t his case presented a credibility contest.people hall,slip op.at,wl.hall raised several claims,including a claim that the prosecutor breached hall right to remain silent under the fifth amendment and engaged in other improper conduct,depriving him of a fair trial.as to the fifth amendment issue,the state court found that the prosecutor remarks were improper 
viewed in context,we conclude that the testimony elicited by the prosecutor and the prosecutor remarks at closing argument were improper.the united states constitution and michigan constitution both provide individuals the right to remain silent to avoid being compelled to serve as a witness against themselves.us const,am v const,art.
id.at.however,because trial counsel had not objected,the state court reviewed the issue for plain error and found no such error in light of the overwhelming evidence that was properly admitted from which the jury could find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
hall also argued that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by,among other things,failing to object to the prosecutor remarks about his silence at the earlier hearing.the state court rejected the claim,explaining,for the reasons previously discussed in this opinion,we conclude that defendant has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel performance and has not overcome the presumption that his trial counsel rendered effective assistance.id.at.
the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal.
petition for habeas relief 
hall then sought relief in federal district court.he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus,raising the following issues 
i.the fifth amendment privilege against was violated where the prosecutor elicited evidence of defendant silence in prior probate court proceedings and then argued to the jury that in probate court it was the guilty man being whispered to by his lawyer who did not testify there.const.amend.v and xiv.
ii.irrelevant and highly prejudicial evidence became themes and were the repeated focus of this trial where the improper evidence enhanced the prosecution and destroyed defendant right to a fair trial.const.amend.v,vi and xiv.const.
iii.where the prosecutor extensively berated defendant character before the jury with impermissible evidence and argument to the jury,a new trial is required.
iv.where the sentencing judge fails to resolve objections to the sentence information report sir and when the sentence for csc ii and obstruction of justice is disproportionate to these offenses and to the offender,there is an abuse of sentencing discretion requiring resentencing.
defense counsel failure to object to improper evidence and prosecutorial misconduct was constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.const.amend.v,vi and xiv.
the district court referred hall petition to a magistrate judge for report and recommendation.the magistrate judge concluded that the prosecutor had violated hall fifth amendment right against and his due process right to a fair trial.hall vasbinder,d.the magistrate judge also concluded that hall trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance for failing to object to the prosecutor questions about hall earlier silence and comments made during closing.id.at.the ineffective assistance served as cause for hall procedural default of his fifth amendment and due process claims,and the magistrate judge concluded that hall was sufficiently prejudiced by the errors to excuse the default.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation over the warden objections and conditionally granted habeas relief to hall.id.at.
the warden timely appealed.
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision.murphy ohio,cir.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,a federal court can order habeas relief only if the state adjudication of a claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.in applying these standards,we examine the holdings of the supreme court as they existed at the time of the relevant decision.williams taylor,d.we can,however,look to decisions of other courts to determine whether a legal principle had been clearly established by the supreme court.smith stegall,cir.
b.the right against self incrimination under the fifth amendment 
references to hall silence 
the supreme court has drawn a distinction between a defendant silence prior to any miranda warnings and silence after such warnings.hall was arrested months after the probate hearing.thus,hall silence at the probate hearing amounted to silence.
the fifth amendment guarantees no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself the fifth amendment right to silence applies to a defendant in a state court proceeding under the fourteenth amendment.griffin california,d.in general,a defendant decision to remain silent can not be used as substantive evidence of guilt.id.this rule clearly applies to a defendant silence after the defendant actually invokes the right to remain silent.see doyle ohio,d precluding the use for impeachment purposes of a defendant silence.however,as a panel of this court recently observed,the constitutionality of using a defendant silence as substantive evidence of guilt has not been addressed by the supreme court.jones trombley,cir.unpublished.the circuit courts have split on this issue.see combs coyle,cir collecting cases.while this court has held that silence can not be used as substantive evidence of guilt,it did so under a,de novo standard of review.see id.at.it is,therefore,not controlling in this case,hereford warren,cir jones.at,notwithstanding the district court conclusion to the contrary,hall,d at.
apart from substantive evidence,a defendant silence can be used to impeach his credibility as a witness.portuondo agard,d the prosecutor comments in this case,by contrast,concerned respondent credibility as a witness,and were therefore in accord with our longstanding rule that when a defendant takes the stand,his credibility may be impeached and his testimony assailed like that of any other witness.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original jenkins anderson,d we conclude that the fifth amendment is not violated by the use of prearrest silence to impeach a criminal defendant credibility.when a defendant chooses to testify at trial,he has opened his credibility to attack like any other witness.as the supreme court explained in raffel united states,we can discern nothing in the policy of the law against which would require the extension of immunity to any trial,or to any tribunal,other than that in which the defendant preserves it by refusing to testify.
moreover,a prosecutor can refer to a defendant silence if doing so would be a fair reply to a defense theory or argument,for example,when defense counsel asserts that the government did not give his client an opportunity to tell his side of the story.united states robinson,d holding that the prosecutor can refer to the defendant silence at trial when defense counsel argued that his client was precluded from telling his side of the story lockett ohio,d rejecting the fifth amendment claim of the defendant because her own counsel had clearly focused the jury attention on her silence,first,by outlining her contemplated defense in his opening statement and,second,by stating to the court and jury near the close of the case,that lockett would be the next witness.when the prosecutor goes no further than to take defense counsel up on an invitation,that conduct will not be regarded as impermissibly calculated to incite the passions of the jury.crim.prac.manual citation omitted.this invited reply rule is limited,though,to the scope of the invitation.id.
the michigan court of appeals did not provide any analysis in support of its finding that the testimony elicited by the prosecutor and the prosecutor remarks were improper,other than to note that both the federal constitution and the state of michigan constitution provide an individual with the right to remain silent.hall,slip op.at.to the extent that any of the testimony elicited by the prosecutor or the prosecutor remarks during closing arguments constituted impeachment or invited reply,the michigan court of appeals decision would be contrary to supreme court precedent on the scope of permissible uses of pretrial silence under the federal constitution.robinson,at.jenkins,at.if,however,the testimony or arguments went beyond these permissible uses and were used instead in a substantive way to prove hall guilt,then the state court finding would not conflict with any supreme court precedent and would be in line with this court holding in combs.
it is difficult to see how hall silence could have been used to impeach his credibility as a witness.there are generally five types of impeachment evidence bias character capacity to observe,remember,or recount events and specific contradiction.mccormick on evid.ed update.it seems clear that hall silence could not be used to show bias,impugn his character,or undercut his capacity.that leaves only and specific contradiction.the warden argues that the prosecutor used hall silence only on and not in the government.warden br.at.that is inaccurate.while hall defense counsel did argue during his opening statement that his client was a victim of governmental persecution and did first elicit testimony from hall daughter about whether her father or testified at the hearing,the prosecutor asked kellogg on direct examination whether hall had testified at the probate hearing.a nticipatory impeachment of a witness is generally disfavored and,given the importance of the right against compelled,it should be strictly circumscribed in the criminal context.see united states banks,cir unpublished banks had not yet taken the stand when agent cannon testified,however,and the government anticipatory impeachment theory seems to have no support in the caselaw.this form of impeachment presents the defendant with the same dilemma as when an officer testimony about the defendant silence is used as substantive evidence of guilt.
rather than impeachment of hall as a witness,the testimony and arguments are better viewed as a reply to the defense theory of governmental persecution.when considering whether the prosecutor acted properly in replying to a defense theory,it is critical that we examine the prosecutor questions and remarks in their context.robinson,at.as the supreme court explained in united states young,a criminal conviction is not to be lightly overturned on the basis of a prosecutor comments standing alone,for the statements or conduct must be viewed in context,d.
with regard to the probate hearing,defense counsel argued from the outset that the hearing was abruptly arranged and lacked certain features of due process,the victim did not testify or swear out a complaint.defense counsel then went one step further and actually raised the issue of hall silence during the daughter.importantly,it was defense counsel,not the prosecutor,who first broached the topic of whether hall testified during the probate hearing.defense counsel did so presumably to show that the probate court failed to hear any evidence from family members,but instead made its decision based solely on evidence from kellogg and the written petition,evidence from government sources.by doing so,however,he invited the prosecutor to explore whether hall had received a fair hearing,including whether he had been given the opportunity to testify and whether he took advantage of that opportunity.in short,defense counsel opened the door on hall silence when he asked the daughter whether her father had testified at the hearing.the testimony about hall silence was not elicited by the prosecutor for an improper purpose,but rather in reply to the defense theory that hall was the subject of governmental persecution throughout the investigation.
beyond the witnesses testimony about his silence,hall also complains that the prosecutor treated his silence as substantive evidence of guilt during the prosecutor closing statements.viewed in isolation,the prosecutor closing remarks are troubling.he described hall as cower ing in fear during the probate hearing,as the guilty man in c ourt,and as having guilt working there and guilty knowledge.again,though,the question is not whether the prosecutor referred to hall motives for not prosecutor clearly did.the question,instead,is whether the defense strategy somehow fairly invited the prosecutor to characterize hall motives in this manner.
recall that during of hall daughter,defense counsel first advanced the notion that custody of the children was stripped from hall and his wife with no testimony from the daughter or any family member.hall later testified that he did not understand exactly what was going on during the hearing,that he could be stripped of custody of his children.this theme of governmental overreach was extended during closing.defense counsel argued to the jury that the probate hearing was hastily arranged,contended that there was no opportunity for family members to testify,and,most strikingly,strongly implied that the referee did not want to hear from hall daughter or any other family member about what going on before taking the children from their parents.this defense theme fairly invited the prosecutor comments during closing that hall had not been denied the opportunity to testify,but instead had refused to testify because doing so would have undermined his plan to cover up the sexual conduct.by delving into the purported motives of the government actors,defense counsel left the door open for the prosecutor to respond by delving into hall own motives at the hearing.
with that said,the prosecutor arguably went beyond even that fairly wide opening by explicitly characterizing hall refusal to testify as evidence of guilt.in general,it is improper for a prosecuting attorney in a criminal case to state his personal opinion concerning the credibility of witnesses or the guilt of a defendant.byrd collins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in young,the supreme court identified two dangers from a prosecutor personal opinion about a defendant guilt 
s uch comments can convey the impression that evidence not presented to the jury,but known to the prosecutor,supports the charges against the defendant and can thus jeopardize the defendant right to be tried solely on the basis of the evidence presented to the jury and the prosecutor opinion carries with it the imprimatur of the government and may induce the jury to trust the government judgment rather than its own view of the evidence.
at.citing berger united states.in the present case,there is little danger that the jury believed that the prosecutor knew of evidence not presented to the jury because his remarks about guilt were not made in some general,statement,but rather in direct reference to the probate proceedings and why hall did not testify at those proceedings.
as to the imprimatur of the government,this court has found less inflammatory remarks of prosecutors to have violated a defendant right against or due process,although those remarks took place during trials where the defendant did not testify or did not otherwise initiate some discussion about his pretrial silence.see,combs,at,holding that the prosecutor violated the defendant right to remain silent by eliciting testimony that the defendant told police to talk to my lawyer and the prosecutor argued during closing that the statement was evidence that he realizes the gravity of the situation and at this time gave that particular comment or response to police however,the defendant did not testify at trial gravley mills,cir in silence context,holding that repeated references by prosecutor to the defendant pretrial silence were improper however,prosecutor was the first to introduce testimony that the defendant had chosen to remain silent during a police interrogation.because the matter of harmless permits clearer resolution of this case,we presume without deciding that the prosecutor specific remarks regarding guilt went beyond the scope invited by the defense strategy.
harmless error under brecht 
improper remarks by a prosecutor about a defendant right to remain silent do not constitute a structural error requiring automatic reversal.brecht abrahamson,d characterizing a violation of the right to silence as a trial error,rather than a structural one.the michigan court of appeals concluded that hall was not prejudiced by the improper actions of the prosecutor in light of the overwhelming evidence that was properly admitted from which the jury could find hall guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.hall,slip op.at citing people graves.this is the familiar standard of chapman california,d graves cites people anderson,which explicitly relies upon chapman for the test.this was a legal determination of the state court,not a factual one as suggested by the warden,and thus it does not enjoy aedpa strong presumption in favor of a state court finding of historical fact.e brecht,at.
in the normal course,the next step would be to consider whether,pursuant to brecht,the prosecutor actions had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury verdict.fry pliler,d holding that the brecht standard,rather than the chapman formulation,is applicable on federal habeas review.this would entail a de novo examination of the trial record.brecht,at.however,as explained below,hall has procedurally defaulted his fifth amendment claim.in order to excuse the default,hall relies solely on the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel.the prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance analysis subsumes the brecht review.kyles whitley,d explaining that agurs materiality standard,later adopted as the prejudice standard for ineffective assistance of counsel,is stricter a habeas petitioner than is the brecht standard.if hall can show that he was prejudiced by his attorney failure to object during closing,then he necessarily satisfies brecht if,alternatively,hall fails to establish that he was prejudiced,then we can not excuse his default and it is immaterial whether he can otherwise satisfy brecht.
