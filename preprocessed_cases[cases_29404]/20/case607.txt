appellant luther glenn was tried and convicted of the murder of william anthony griffin in the court of common pleas of allegheny county court of common pleas and is currently a prisoner of the commonwealth of pennsylvania.glenn appeals the ruling of the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania district court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.he argues that the court of common pleas violated his rights under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment by refusing to grant his motion for a mistrial after an eyewitness proffered contradictory testimony,opting instead to strike the entirety of this testimony and provide cautionary jury instructions,and after the court of common pleas struck this testimony,his trial counsel was ineffective in not moving to strike other evidence in the record that referred to this witness identification of glenn as the murderer.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
on december,william anthony griffin was shot and killed on sterrett street in the homewood neighborhood of pittsburgh,pennsylvania.days later,on december,glenn was arrested after fleeing from the police in a stolen vehicle.he was subsequently charged with griffin murder.
glenn trial in the court of common pleas took place in june of.during that trial,georgianna cotton testified that she witnessed glenn murder griffin.cotton originally testified that after leaving a bar at am,intoxicated to the point of staggering she encountered griffin on sterrett street and engaged in a brief conversation with him.as she made her way into a nearby partially abandoned building to smoke marijuana and crack cocaine,she saw glenn standing on the corner of sterrett street and kelly street,talking with some of his friends.cotton entered the building,climbed the stairs to the second floor,and began smoking crack cocaine on a balcony that overlooked the street she soon heard and possibly saw glenn and griffin arguing,and then heard glenn tell griffin he was going to kill him id.shortly thereafter,cotton saw glenn walk around the corner onto kelly street and saw griffin enter the first floor of the building she was in.within a few seconds,she saw glenn return in a blue station wagon,pull up in front of the building,and jump out of the car brandishing a pistol sideways.she saw glenn pull a hoodie over his head,run towards griffin who was then standing in the doorway of the building and shoot him six times.she then saw glenn return to the car and leave.finally,cotton testified that,as she was running down to check on griffin,she encountered dwayne youngblood youngblood,the occupant of a apartment in the building in which griffin was shot,who told her not to say anything about the murder she had just witnessed.
on,cotton began to contradict herself.she testified that she had not actually seen the shooter face,but was able to identify glenn based on what people told her on the streets.on redirect,she testified that she was present during the murder,but that she was also threatened.at that point,the judge declared a recess to address cotton contradictory testimony in his chambers.during this in camera proceeding,cotton at first told the judge that she had indeed witnessed the murder,but that she had been threatened b y the defendant people on the street.after receiving promises that she would not be prosecuted for perjury,she then said that she did not see the murder,but that people told her glenn was the murderer.she went on to equivocate about whether youngblood the resident had asked her to testify against glenn or specifically asked her not to testify against glenn thereafter,the judge adjourned the trial until the following day to provide the prosecutor with an opportunity to assess his case and decide how to proceed.in the interim,the commonwealth granted cotton immunity from any potential perjury charges and she received a attorney.
the next day,cotton again took the stand.on,she testified that during the previous day in camera proceeding she had told the attorneys and the trial judge that she had not seen glenn kill griffin.when the commonwealth asked her to provide a truthful account of what,if anything,she saw or heard,she claimed that she heard arguing and gunshots,but did not see anything until after the shooting,when she witnessed glenn and a couple other guys running away from the crime scene and jumping into a car.when asked why she changed her story,she claimed that she was scared for somebody else life that knew what happened.on,however,cotton testified that she did see shots being fired,at which point glenn counsel moved for a mistrial.in response,the judge declared a recess.
after some discussion between the court and counsel,the judge denied the motion for a mistrial but invited defense counsel to move to strike cotton entire testimony from the record.glenn counsel promptly did so.thereafter,the judge returned the jury to the courtroom and issued the following instructions 
the court good afternoon,ladies and gentlemen.the court has made the following ruling on its own motion you are to completely and totally disregard the testimony of cotton.her testimony is not to play any part in your determination as to the facts in this case.it is as if she has not testified.do you understand that,ladies and gentlemen 
the jury yes.
cotton testimony was not the only incriminating evidence offered at trial.the commonwealth also presented testimony from jerry pratt,an inmate who shared a cell with glenn in the allegheny county jail after glenn arrest.pratt testified that,on january,glenn told him that he had murdered griffin in the homewood neighborhood of pittsburgh,pennsylvania following an argument over a bad drug deal.glenn also told him that a female had witnessed the crime from the balcony of an apartment building,but that her testimony would not hold up in court because she was a crack addict and because her view was obscured.when pratt opined that this testimony could still be damaging,glenn responded i really not worried about it,because i have a person out there who can take care of her for me.glenn identified that person as monte blair.
the commonwealth then offered evidence that two days before the alleged conversation between glenn and pratt police had engaged in a vehicle pursuit of blair,in which blair had crashed his vehicle but escaped on foot.when police searched blair wrecked vehicle,they recovered a caliber glock handgun loaded with rounds of ammunition and equipped with a laser sight.during summation,the commonwealth argued that when police engaged blair vehicle he was en route to murder cotton in order to prevent her from testifying.
the commonwealth also presented testimony from charina johnson,who was involved in a sexual relationship with glenn prior to griffin murder.johnson told the jury that glenn had asked her to testify that he was at her house at the time of the murder but that she had refused to do so.she went on to testify that she could not remember if he was there,though she was impeached with a prior statement that glenn was not there and had asked her to lie 
finally,the commonwealth presented testimony from youngblood that glenn had been at his residence located in the apartment building where griffin was shot six to seven hours before the shooting occurred.
at the close of the trial,the judge reiterated his earlier instruction to disregard cotton testimony 
the court y ou must not consider any testimony which i have ordered stricken from the record.so that it is clear,ladies and gentlemen,i ordered st r icken from the record the testimony of cotton.you must not,i repeat,must not,consider that testimony for any reason whatsoever.it should be as if that witness never took the stand.
on june,the jury convicted glenn of murder and the judge sentenced him to life imprisonment.glenn then filed motions,which were denied on october.thereafter,the pennsylvania superior court superior court affirmed his conviction and the supreme court of pennsylvania denied his petition for allowance of appeal.
after unsuccessfully pursuing collateral relief in the pennsylvania courts,glenn timely filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the district court on april.on september,the district court denied his petition,but later granted a certificate of appealability on the following issues whether the court of common pleas violated glenn due process rights when it refused to grant a mistrial,opting instead to strike cotton testimony,and whether,after cotton testimony was stricken,trial counsel was ineffective in not moving to strike other evidence referring to cotton identification of glenn as the shooter.glenn timely appealed.
we have jurisdiction over glenn claims by virtue of the district court certificate of appealability and and.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,and.we review the district court decision de novo,as it did not conduct an evidentiary hearing on these claims.duncan morgan,cir.
our review of glenn habeas petition is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,which provides 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted unless the adjudication of the claim raised 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
glenn pursues both of his present claims under subsection d,and argues that the superior court decision finding neither a due process violation nor a sixth amendment violation involved unreasonable application s of clearly established federal law.id.
glenn first claim is that the court of common pleas violated his rights under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment when it denied his motion for a mistrial based on cotton inconsistent testimony.importantly,this claim requires more than a showing that the court of common pleas erred under pennsylvania law.see estelle mcguire,i t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine determinations on questions.rather,the scope of our review is the narrow one of due process,and not the broad exercise of supervisory power we would possess in regard to our own trial court.donnelly dechristoforo.
to prevail on his due process claim,glenn must prove that he was deprived of fundamental elements of fairness in his criminal trial.riggins nevada,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.glenn must tread a steep hill.the supreme court has defined the category of infractions that violate fundamental fairness very narrowly,based on the recognition that,beyond the specific guarantees enumerated in the bill of rights,the due process clause has limited operation.medina california.in order to satisfy due process,glenn trial must have been fair it need not have been perfect.see united states hasting.
glenn argues that cotton unreliable testimony rendered his trial fundamentally unfair.he insists that the trial judge curative instructions could not purge the record of the taint from this testimony and that a mistrial was the only constitutionally adequate remedy.it is well established that,absent extraordinary circumstances,jurors are presumed to follow the instructions given them by the court.see greer miller,richardson marsh,united states bornman,cir.glenn,however,urges us to abandon that presumption because,in his view,most of the remaining evidence in his case directly or tangentially related to cotton identification of glenn as the shooter and,accordingly,no jury could render an impartial verdict without cotton trial testimony on some level seeping into the deliberations.appellant br.
in support of this argument,glenn relies upon three cases wherein we concluded that curative instructions were insufficient to purge the record of inadmissible evidence because that evidence was too difficult for the jury to ignore.each of these cases is distinguishable.
in united states lee,cir,the jury,during deliberations,discovered handwriting on the back of a hotel room registration card indicating that the defendant had extended his stay through the date on which police found illegal narcotics in his room.this information,which had never been disclosed to the defense,had much of the credibility of properly admitted evidence and entirely defeat ed the defendant argument that he had checked out of the room days earlier.id.at.though the jury was instructed to ignore this evidence,on appeal we held that u nder these highly unusual circumstances we would not assume that the jury was able to ignore the elephant in the deliberation room.id.at.in contrast,the jury in glenn case was repeatedly instructed to ignore testimony that had already been cast into doubt by defense counsel successful.this testimony would have been far easier for glenn jury to disregard than the veritable smoking gun discovered by lee jury in the eleventh hour of his trial.
we view vazquez wilson,cir,as similarly distinguishable.in vazquez,the jury was asked to ignore a statement implicating the defendant in a murder because the statement violated the defendant sixth amendment confrontation clause rights under bruton united states.at.the statement there had not been revealed until closing arguments and therefore had not been discredited in any way.here,cotton testimony had been severely discredited during.further,in vazquez,the jury,after receiving instructions to ignore the statement,asked the judge during deliberations whether it was supposed to not consider the statement that vazquez was the shooter,which we considered to be direct evidence that the original instruction was not completely effective,if effective at all.id.at.the jury in glenn case never suggested any such misunderstanding.
finally,glenn reliance on moore morton,cir,is likewise unavailing.in moore,we found curative instructions to be inadequate to purge the record of three wildly inappropriate arguments made by the prosecutor during summation that asked the jury to decide the case on bias and emotion rather than on the evidence presented.id.at.moore involved prosecutorial misconduct,while no such issue is before us in this case.moreover,we relied heavily in moore on the weakness of the remaining evidence against the defendant,which consisted primarily of testimony based on hypnotically enhanced memory.see id.at.here,the commonwealth offered ample evidence of glenn guilt,including,inter alia,evidence that he had admitted guilt to a fellow inmate.moore is simply not analogous 
because we presume that glenn jury was able to follow the instructions to disregard cotton unreliable testimony,this testimony did not render glenn trial fundamentally unfair.accordingly,the superior court decision affirming his conviction was not error,much less an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.d.
glenn also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in not moving to strike lingering references to cotton identification of the shooter after the trial judge struck her testimony from the record.glenn argues that because of this failure the trial court remedy of striking cotton testimony was largely meaningless.appellant br.
to prove ineffective assistance of counsel under strickland washington,glenn must prove that his trial counsel performance was deficient,that is,it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and that counsel deficient performance prejudiced him,that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.albrecht horn,cir citing strickland,at.we have previously referred to these as the performance and prejudice prongs of the strickland test.see,united states booth,cir.
glenn identifies six pieces of evidence that his trial counsel should have moved to strike.with respect to five of these pieces of evidence,glenn claim is procedurally defaulted.with respect to the remaining piece of evidence,his claim lacks merit.
in his habeas proceeding in the district court,glenn identi
