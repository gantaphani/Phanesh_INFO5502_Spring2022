in the early morning hours of may,penny anderson was murdered at her springfield,massachusetts apartment.in,a superior court jury convicted the petitioner,edward wright,of the crime.although wright admitted that he had spent time with anderson the night before her death,he claimed to have left her apartment before she was killed.
after a lengthy foray through the massachusetts state courts unsuccessfully challenging his conviction,wright filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court.the district court initially denied relief but later granted a motion for reconsideration and held an evidentiary hearing to permit wright to introduce new evidence.this new evidence showed that according to a witness,another man,allen smalls,had made statements about anderson murder.after considering the new evidence,the district court denied habeas relief.wright filed a timely appeal,arguing that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to make two specific arguments when objecting to the admission at trial of the prior grand jury testimony of a key witness,arthur turner and because he failed to request that the jury be instructed to take into account the possibility of mistaken identification in determining whether the commonwealth had proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.because wright has failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel,we affirm the denial of his habeas petition.
background 
we begin with the facts,reviewed as described by the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc in commonwealth wright,supplemented with other record facts consistent with the sjc findings.shuman spencer,cir quoting yeboah sefah ficco,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
wright and anderson left a nightclub together on may,hours before anderson was murdered.after stopping to pick up her infant son and run some errands,they had sex in the car and then went to anderson apartment,arriving around midnight.wright was driving a car borrowed from a friend.according to wright,he and anderson talked for about an hour and she let him out of the apartment at about.he said he then went to a friend house but because he did not want to wake the friend,wright slept in the car.at about on may,wright left for a previously planned visit to his sister house in delaware.
sometime in the early morning hours of may,anderson died from multiple stab wounds.a neighbor heard a woman screaming shortly before,and then heard a car drive away.the medical examiner estimated anderson time of death to be between and 
anderson body was discovered that afternoon,after her family contacted the building maintenance supervisor and gained access to her apartment.investigation of the crime scene yielded evidence including a bloody imprint made by a shoe on the tiled kitchen floor of the victim apartment.
phone call and turner testimony 
perhaps the key testimony at trial came from arthur turner,the son of wright girlfriend,thelma.wright and turner had known each other for several years prior to the crime,living in the same house in delaware for part of that time.
on the night of the murder,turner got into a car accident while returning from a trip.he arrived home in springfield at around p.on may,tired from having been up all night dealing with the accident.at about in the afternoon,he received a phone call from someone who identified himself as ed.the caller said he had killed someone,provided anderson address,and described the victim as a white bitch who was on tic.he provided additional details about the murder weapon and added that turner should watch the news or go get the newspaper and then he would know who the victim was.
turner learned of anderson murder through media reports and told his sister about the phone call,which he attributed to wright.his sister told their brother,who notified the police.turner provided information consistent with what he had told his sister to the police and he signed a police statement on may.during grand jury proceedings on june,turner police statement was read into the record,and turner reaffirmed the truth of everything in it.
some six months later,after turner mother and wright had reconciled,turner changed his story.he still said he had received a telephone call from a person who identified himself as ed and that the caller provided information about the murder,but he said he was no longer positive that the caller was in fact wright.
still,wright first name is edward,and wright was the only person turner knew named ed.phone records confirmed that a minute phone call was made from wright sister home in delaware to turner number in springfield at on may.wright sister testified that she made all phone calls in question that day,but the commonwealth rebutted with testimony from turner aunt,who said that wright called her that day and asked for turner telephone number.
given turner partial recantation,the commonwealth moved in limine to admit turner prior inconsistent grand jury testimony for its truth under commonwealth daye.wright counsel filed a written opposition arguing that turner grand jury testimony was inadmissible,citing daye and requesting a voir dire.the trial judge conducted a voir dire and concluded that turner prior inconsistent grand jury testimony was admissible for its truth under daye.
other evidence 
following turner disclosure of information to the springfield police,wright was arrested in delaware on may.during interrogation he told a delaware police detective that he was with anderson on the night in question and described her as a whore who was on tic.
traces of blood were found inside the car wright drove the night of anderson murder.however,the commonwealth called the owner of the car,vernal archie,as a witness,and he testified that a few weeks before the murder,wright had been stabbed and archie had driven him to the hospital in the same car.
additionally,a bloody shoe print found at the murder scene could have been made by wright sneakers,which police confiscated on may.but the sneakers were a popular style and no traces of blood were detected on them.
how we got to this point 
wright was convicted of murder by a jury on april,and sentenced to life in prison.wright filed two separate motions for a new trial,both based in part on allegations of newly discovered evidence primarily,an affidavit by lee britt,mother of smalls,implicating smalls in the murder.after holding an evidentiary hearing,the trial court denied both motions.the sjc consolidated wright appeal from the denial of his motions with his direct appeal of the conviction,and affirmed everything.wright,at,at.the sjc specifically noted that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying wright first motion for a new trial based on a finding that the newly discovered evidence lacked probative value.
in september of,wright sought relief in federal court,filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district of massachusetts pursuant to.in,wright moved for voluntary dismissal of his first federal habeas petition and returned to state court.
wright filed a third motion for a new trial,in which he first raised the ineffective assistance of counsel claims at issue in this appeal.the motion was denied by the trial court in march of.the sjc denied leave to appeal,holding that all of the claims asserted were procedurally defaulted because they had already been addressed or could have been addressed during trial or on direct review.commonwealth wright,no.sj,slip op.at.
in,wright filed a second petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,the case from which this appeal has arisen the district court denied the petition in,rejecting wright invitation to reach the merits of his procedurally defaulted claims based on new evidence of actual innocence the evidence included britt testimony during the state court hearing on wright first motion for a new trial,in which she claimed that smalls had admitted the murder to his girlfriend who then relayed the statement to britt,and britt claim that on the day of the murder,smalls had tried to sell a knife possibly similar to the murder weapon.the district court stated that i f properly corroborated,this information would provide troubling new evidence of actual innocence.but because the massachusetts trial court had rejected the new evidence as either hearsay or not credible,the district court accorded its finding a presumption of correctness.
wright sought reconsideration and an evidentiary hearing,bolstering his contentions with additional evidence including an affidavit from smalls former girlfriend,maria rivera ramos,reciting that he had threatened to kill her like i did anderson.the district court appointed counsel for wright and held a hearing on his motion for reconsideration.in,at the parties request,the district court stayed federal proceedings without prejudice so wright could present the new affidavit to the state court and seek forensic testing of the knife sold by smalls,which was in the possession of the state court clerk office.
forensic testing of the knife was inconclusive.in,wright filed a fourth motion for new trial in state court,arguing that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to locate ramos earlier.the state trial court denied the motion and the sjc declined to allow an appeal.
wright returned once more to federal court in,to resume the proceedings which had been stayed five years earlier.after conducting an evidentiary hearing,the district court in allowed wright motion for reconsideration based on evidence of actual innocence and permitted him to proceed on the merits of his procedurally defaulted claims.see house bell.
both parties briefed and argued the merits of those claims and,in an order dated november,the district court denied wright petition,finding that he had failed to demonstrate that his trial was tainted by constitutional error.with respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel claims,the district court found that wright failed to show a reasonable probability that the result of his trial would have been different if trial counsel had launched a more focused attack on the admissibility of turner grand jury testimony.similarly,the district court found that wright had not been prejudiced by trial counsel failure to request a misidentification instruction.
the district court granted a certificate of appealability limited to two claims of ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel failure to object to the admission of turner grand jury testimony pursuant to daye and failure to request a jury instruction on misidentification.on appeal,wright argues that trial counsel performance was deficient because he failed to argue specifically that turner grand jury testimony was a mere confirmation of a statement by an interrogator which would make it inadmissible under the third prong of daye and that the commonwealth failed to introduce sufficient corroborating evidence which would make it inadmissible under the fourth prong of daye.wright asserts a second claim of ineffective assistance based on trial counsel failure to request a jury instruction on misidentification.
discussion 
we review a district court denial of a habeas petition de novo.schuman,at.when we conduct such a review,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,d,requires that we assume a highly deferential posture toward a state court decision rejecting a federal claim on the merits.see clements clarke,cir.here,however,the district court determined that wright claims were not adjudicated on the merits in state court and consequently evaluated them de novo.see fortini murphy,cir w e can hardly defer to the state court on an issue that the state court did not address.the parties do not challenge that determination on appeal,and we therefore also proceed to review wright ineffective assistance claims de novo.
we can grant habeas relief only if we identify an error which had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.frye pliler,quoting brecht abrahamson,internal quotation marks omitted foxworth amand,f d,cir.
to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,wright must show both that counsel performance was deficient and that it resulted in prejudice.see strickland washington,shuman,at.if he falls short on either requirement,his claim fails.see strickland,at.
deficient performance means that trial counsel representation failed to meet an objective standard of reasonableness.tevlin spencer,cir quoting strickland,at internal quotation marks omitted.counsel performance is deficient only if no competent attorney would have acted as he did.id.c ounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.strickland,at see also harrington richter.
wright also must demonstrate prejudice to show ineffective assistance of counsel.he must show a reasonable probability that if counsel had acted differently,his trial would have had a more favorable outcome.tevlin,at quoting porter mccollum,per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.
admission of turner grand jury testimony 
wright first ineffective assistance claim is based on trial counsel failure to advance certain specific arguments when arguing that turner grand jury testimony was inadmissible.we elaborate.at the time of wright trial,whether a prior inconsistent statement made before a grand jury could be admitted for its probative value was governed by daye,at,at.daye spells out a test a prior inconsistent statement made before a grand jury is admissible for its truth when the statement was made under oath before a grand jury the witness could be effectively as to its accuracy it was not coerced and was more than a mere confirmation or denial of an allegation by the interrogator and other evidence was presented which tended to prove the issue id.
wright hones in on daye third and fourth requirements.he contends that counsel erred by failing to argue the inadmissibility of turner testimony because it fell short on the third daye factor,because it was a mere confirmation of an allegation made by an interrogator the prosecutor who questioned turner in front of the grand jury rather than turner own statement and the fourth daye factor,the commonwealth failed to introduce sufficient corroborative evidence.
to be clear,this is not a case in which trial counsel failed to object at all.wright attorney repeatedly objected to the admission of turner grand jury testimony.in fact,he filed a opposition to the commonwealth motion in limine which sought to introduce the grand jury testimony.the opposition began with a summary of daye,recited the four daye factors,and repeatedly cited to daye.although the opposition chiefly focused on state constitutional grounds,it cited to daye in support of a request that the court conduct a voir dire before admitting turner testimony into evidence,a request which the trial judge granted.
after the voir dire,when the trial court ruled that it would admit turner grand jury testimony,trial counsel again cited daye in his objection.so wright argument is not that counsel failed to object,but that his objection was not properly focused on the third and fourth daye factors.we examine each in turn.
turner testimony was more than a confirmation 
the third daye factor precludes the admission of a prior inconsistent statement made to a grand jury if it is the statement of the interrogator rather than the statement of the witness.daye,at,at.a judge should exercise discretion in admitting a witness yes or no answer to a leading,question posed at the grand jury proceeding as probative evidence regarding the facts alluded to in the question.id.at,at.wright claims that his trial counsel performance was deficient because he did not specifically argue that turner testimony was a mere confirmation of a statement made by the assistant district attorney ada 
turner grand jury testimony began with the ada eliciting from turner his name,address,that he had known wright for several years,and that he had spoken with wright on the phone on may,the day of the murder.the ada then showed turner his police statement,had him identify it by his signature,and then read it into the record.
the ada asked no leading or questions.before and after she
