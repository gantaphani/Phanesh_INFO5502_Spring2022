in,todd daniels helped a friend to burn down a house in detroit,killing three children.in,a michigan state jury convicted him of three counts of murder and seven counts of assault with intent to commit murder.the trial court sentenced him to twenty to forty years of imprisonment.the district court denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus he now appeals.first,he contends that the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to counsel by replacing his original attorney with a different attorney,allegedly without cause.second,he argues that an instruction given to his jury regarding the mental state required to commit murder as an aider and abettor so gravely misrepresented michigan law that it violated his fourteenth amendment right to due process,and that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the allegedly erroneous instruction.
we affirm.we reject daniels first claim because the sixth amendment gives an indigent defendant a right to adequate representation but not to his choice of counsel.because daniels does not allege that the change in counsel prejudiced his defense,he can not demonstrate a violation of this right and therefore can not establish a sixth amendment violation.we reject daniels second claim because,even though one sentence of the instructions contained a confusing and arguably misleading statement of the law,the trial court correctly stated the law at several other times.consequently,daniels can not show that the ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process,cupp naughten,d,or that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel failure to object.
paula bailey wanted revenge against some girls,one of whom apparently was dating her.encouraged by her brother paul,she offered a thousand dollars to anyone who would burn down their house.daniels friend eugene mckinney took bailey up on her offer.
with daniels accompanying him,mckinney drove to a gas station,filled a plastic container with gasoline,drove to the house that bailey had identified,and poured the gasoline on the side of it near the front porch.apparently believing that he had not poured enough gasoline to burn the house,mckinney returned with daniels to the gas station,refilled his container,and then told daniels to fill an old antifreeze jug with gasoline.mckinney poured his gasoline in the same place by the front porch,while daniels poured his on the other side of the house,near the back door.mckinney then lit a match flames engulfed the front porch and the two men ran to the car and left.daniels did not set fire to the gasoline that he had poured.
after mckinney showed paula and paul bailey that he had done the job,paula bailey paid mckinney a thousand dollars as promised.mckinney gave of the money to daniels.soon thereafter,the state brought charges related to the fire against daniels,mckinney,paula bailey,and paul bailey.the trial court appointed a separate attorney to represent each defendant.daniels was charged with three counts of felony murder,with arson as the underlying felony,and seven counts of assault with intent to commit murder.a jury found him guilty of three counts of murder and seven counts of assault,but not guilty of felony murder.having exhausted his state remedies,he filed the petition for a writ of habeas corpus at issue in this appeal.
daniels bases his first claim for relief on the replacement of his original attorney.
the trial court scheduled a hearing to consider motions on april.mckinney and paula bailey filed motions prior to that date daniels,then represented by mark brown,did not.of the four defendants attorneys,only brown appeared at the hearing.at the hearing,the prosecutor intimated that brown had stated that he intended to file a motion to suppress a statement that daniels had made to police after his arrest,but had not done so by the court deadline.trial court,april,at district court document.brown did not say anything.
frustrated by the attorneys failure to appear and wishing to avoid postponement of the trial,set to begin on july,the trial court decided to replace all counsel and pick counsel who can try this case on the trial date we currently have.it appointed lawrence burgess to replace brown in representing daniels.during the next court date,daniels attempted to object to something,but was told that he could not speak except through burgess.daniels now says that he wished to object to the replacement of brown as his attorney.burgess made no such objection,but he did file four motions,including a motion to suppress.the case proceeded to trial with burgess representing daniels.
the sixth amendment states that,in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defence,amend.vi.daniels contends that the trial court violated this right when it removed brown as daniels attorney,allegedly without cause.we disagree.
the sixth amendment right to counsel encompasses two distinct rights a right to adequate representation and a right to choose one own counsel.the right applies to all defendants and focuses on the adversarial process,not on the accused relationship with his lawyer as such.united states cronic,d.a defendant has the right to counsel acting in the role of an advocate,anders california,d,who will require the prosecution case to survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing,cronic,at.daniels does not claim that brown could have been a better advocate than burgess was indeed,the record shows,if anything,that burgess put forward a stronger defense,filing four motions where brown had filed none.without even alleging prejudice from the change in counsel,daniels can not establish that the change violated his right.
nor can he demonstrate a violation of any right to his counsel of choice.in powell alabama,the supreme court stated that a criminal defendant who hires,and pays for,an attorney has the right to select that attorney.more recently,in united states,d,it held that a defendant could obtain a new trial without showing prejudice when the trial court arbitrarily denied him the services of his retained that case,by erroneously refusing to grant the chosen attorney admission pro hac vice.if they applied to daniels,the rights at issue in powell and might very well entitle him to relief.
yet neither powell nor suggests that the right at issue is universal to all defendants.the court explicitly stated that the basis for its decision was the right of a defendant who does not require appointed counsel to choose who will represent him,indicating that the erroneous or arbitrary exclusion of counsel might not trigger the same constitutional scrutiny.id.at emphasis added.in caplin drysdale united states,d,the court was even more direct those who do not have the means to hire their own lawyers have no cognizable complaint so long as they are adequately represented by attorneys appointed by the courts.although this language from and caplin drysdale is dicta,its import is clear daniels,an indigent defendant forced to rely on counsel,has no right.thus,he is not entitled to relief.
we reach this result without applying the deferential standard of review set forth in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,d.the last state court to consider daniels sixth amendment claim rejected it not because it concluded that defendants relying on counsel have no right,but rather because it believed that daniels had acquiesced to the replacement of brown and that the trial court had good cause to replace brown people daniels,wl,at.lexis,at.indeed,the court suggested that it would have resolved the sixth amendment question in daniels favor,stating that a fter adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated,a trial court removal of a criminal defendant appointed counsel for any reason other than gross incompetence,physical incapacity,or contumacious conduct violates the defendant constitutional right to counsel.ibid.thus,in reviewing the sixth amendment question,we face a state court treatment of an issue in a manner favorable to the petitioner but not dispositive of his claim for relief.
