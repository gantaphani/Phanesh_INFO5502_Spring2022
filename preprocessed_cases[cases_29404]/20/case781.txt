opinion of the court 
this appeal requires us to review a downward departure from the sentence prescribed by the united states sentencing guidelines the defendant,arthur,was convicted of violating a b by threatening to kill a federal judge with the intent to impede,intimidate,and interfere with the judge while engaged in the performance of official duties,and with intent to retaliate against the judge on account of the performance of official duties.the defendant committed this crime while serving a prison term on a federal conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.the defendant was apparently motivated to write the threatening letter by frustration regarding the way in which time that he spent in custody after arrest was taken into account in determining the amount of time that he was required to serve on the federal conviction and a related state sentence.the district court downward departure appears to have been designed in large part to rectify this determination.we reverse and remand for resentencing within the guidelines range.
in early february,law enforcement officers in rhode island executed a search warrant for residence and found a handgun and ammunition.at that time,was on probation for a prior state felony conviction.rhode island state authorities arrested for violating the terms of his state probation,and he was assigned to a state correctional facility pending disposition of the state probation violation charge.
on march,was indicted by a federal grand jury in the district of rhode island for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,in violation of g.because all of the district judges in the district of rhode island were recused,federal case was assigned to judge joseph diclerico,of the district of new hampshire,who sat by designation in the district of rhode island.on march,was transferred to federal custody pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum but was returned to state custody on september.on december,he was again transferred to federal custody,this time for trial.a jury found guilty on the charge,and on march,judge diclerico sentenced him to months imprisonment.judge diclerico recommended that the bureau of prisons bop give credit for the period that he had spent in custody since his federal indictment.in so doing,however,judge diclerico recognized that the bop was not required to accept his recommendation.see app.at.
following the federal sentencing,was returned to the state for the probation violation hearing,and on march,judge clifton of the rhode island superior court sentenced to a term of days imprisonment and entered a judgment for time served,crediting for the time that he had spent in custody from february,to the date of the judgment.app.at.was then released to federal custody to serve his federal sentence and was sent to the federal correctional institution at dix,new jersey.because almost all of the time that had spent in custody following his arrest had already been credited against his state sentence,the bop declined under b to credit any of that time against his federal sentence.under that provision,time spent in custody before sentencing may be credited against a sentence if,among other things,that time has not been credited against another sentence.id.
although could have challenged the bop decision in administrative proceedings,he did not do so but instead filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under in the district of rhode island.on june,judge diclerico dismissed the petition without prejudice to in the district of new jersey after exhaustion of administrative remedies in an appeal,the united states court of appeals for the first circuit affirmed conviction and sentence and held that he could not contest the bop decision concerning his sentence until he had exhausted administrative remedies.united states,cir.
then mailed a letter dated june,from dix to ed roy,his attorney in the state and federal cases in rhode island.the letter stated in pertinent part 
i f they make me work one more day,and continue to fuck up my sentence computation,i will seek revenge on the day of my inevitable discharge against the conspirators.as soon as i get off the bus in providence next month or next year,i will kill the judges who directed the state police to frame me with those nursery rhymes.i may charge after one and break his neck with my bare hands,or i might douse myself with gasoline and light the match next to a judge,or i may get a gun and shoot them all 
as i said,you must understand how sick i am of losing,and that i will not accept this latest conspiracy.the are 
the ausa in the district of rhode island others 
so the way we left it is that nobody had better push me or i explode.leave me the fuck alone i said,or i kill somebody.i also said that i will not do this time and plan to beat the judges however i can even if it means hanging myself 
but they have to let me out eventually.i told them where we at.if they do drop these terror tactics immediately,i dedicated to killing judges when i out.i put the conspirators on the front page i dare anybody to push me.you can accept all they done to me in this hoax case.i wo.if i in when this arrives,i expect you to call these and demand my release.they have no authority over me anymore.arthur.
after consulting with the rhode island supreme court office of disciplinary counsel,roy disclosed the contents of letter to the federal bureau of investigation.app.at.a federal grand jury in newark,new jersey,indicted for threatening to assault and murder a federal judge,in violation of a b,and the case was assigned to the honorable joseph irenas.
in the meantime,again challenged the bop decision by filing a second habeas petition under,this time in the district of new jersey,and that case was also assigned to judge irenas.judge irenas denied the petition,concluding that 
although judge diclerico recommended that petitioner be credit ed against his federal sentence for time served since march,the bop properly calculated petitioner sentence pursuant to b.under the statute,no prior custody may be credited to a prisoner sentence if he has received credit for the same time period on another sentence.thus,because received credit from february,to march,toward his state sentence,the bop appropriately concluded that the same time period could not be credited against the federal sentence.
trial on the threat charge began on november,and on december,a jury returned a guilty verdict.on january,the district court denied motion for release pending sentencing,finding that had failed to demonstrate that he was not a danger to the community.on february,however,the district court reversed course and granted bail pending sentencing.in the course of the hearing,the court referred to the issue of the bop treatment of the time that had spent in custody prior to sentencing on the federal charge.among other things,the court mentioned that t here might be a downward departure issue,and recommended that defense counsel give some thought to that.app.at.the government appealed the order releasing the defendant,and a panel of this court vacated that order and ordered that be detained pending sentencing.
on april,the district court commenced a sentencing hearing,and counsel,picking up on the court suggestion,moved for a downward departure from the applicable sentencing guidelines range in order to rectify the bop decision regarding credit for the time that had spent in custody prior to sentencing on the federal charge.app.at.defense counsel stated it clear to me that the vop violation of probation credit decision is what led to his writing this letter.id.
during continued sentencing proceedings on april,the district court determined that under the sentencing guidelines total offense level was combining this offense level with criminal history of category v,the district court determined that the defendant guidelines range was to months of imprisonment.however,the district court departed downward three offense levels to a range of to months of imprisonment and imposed a sentence of months followed by three years supervised release.
holding that case fell outside the heartland of cases under the applicable guideline,the district court provided an oral explanation of the basis for its decision.we note five points that the court made.first,the court commented that it was difficult to identify the heartland of the offense in this case because the statutory index lists numerous guidelines that may apply to a violation of a and because it appeared to the court that there were not many prosecutions under this provision.app.at.
second,the court implied that was not particularly dangerous.the court observed that letter was flaky,app,and added 
t his is a flaky case.it flaky.i do care what anybody says i do blame the marshals for taking it seriously i do even blame anybody for being particularly frightened.it a letter that is designed to frighten,and it does frighten.it does change my view that the whole situation is just flaky.
id.at.the court commented that it had seen ability to get angry and ferocious at judicial system but had not seen anything that suggesting he a mass murderer.id.at.
third,the court implied that may not have even violated a b.the court stated that,while it was not impugning the jury verdict,the court had read the letter about times and was fairly sure when you parse it that the only persons whom actually threatened to kill were the rhode island state judges,not judge diclerico.app.at.
fourth,the court stated its belief that the sentencing expectations of both judge diclerico and judge clifton had been frustrated.the new jersey district court judge stated that,in light of the information then before him it was clear that judges diclerico and clifton wanted federal and state sentences to run concurrently but that these expectations were not realized because neither the state judge nor attorney had understood that,if he was given credit against his state sentence for the time that he had already spent in custody,b would not permit that time to be credited against his federal sentence.
fifth,the court implied that frustration over this situation,while not a justification for his letter,was nevertheless a factor to consider.app.at.in sum,the court stated that the situation of a prisoner who writes this kind of letter,threatening crazy letter,in the situation where he being held in jail and on the face of the two judges who said he should be set free,is the basis for a downward departure.id.at.both and the government appealed from the final judgment in the criminal case.
in the meantime,however,a development in state court in rhode island affected the calculation of sentence.requested,and the rhode island state court granted,a reduction of his probationary sentence on an unrelated rhode island conviction.this relief had the effect of decreasing criminal history category from v to iv.see c.citing the sentence reduction granted by the rhode island state court,filed a motion under seeking that his a b conviction be vacated,but the new jersey district court judge denied that motion,and appealed.
while the appeals from the judgment in the criminal case and the denial of the section motion were pending in our court,the parties filed a joint motion for a limited remand in the section appeal,and we granted the motion so that the district court could correct an uncontested claim of error.app.the district court then reduced criminal history category from v to iv,and the court again granted a downward departure.the court to a term of imprisonment,a sentence at the bottom of the applicable range of to months.app.at.during the new sentencing hearing,the district court again attempted to explain its downward departure.the court stated that,by virtue of the departure,
ha d gotten almost all he would have gotten had the habeas corpus been granted in the first instance.now,i know,it hard to put back together again.i think he was let out in june of,this crime never would have happened,he never would have had to write the letter.you ca you ca kind of view it in the abstract.it not like he went out,robbed a bank,something totally unrelated to what was going on here.
but be that as it may,at least in terms of credits,he has gotten the credit,or almost all of the credit so,he has gotten it all,he come very,very close to getting most of it.
id.at.the government then took this appeal.
the standards for sentencing departures are familiar.the sentencing reform act,b,requires a judge to impose a sentence within the pertinent guideline range unless the judge finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.in koon united states,d,the supreme court explained that factors relevant to departures are divided into four categories prohibited,discouraged,unmentioned,and encouraged.unless a factor is categorically prohibited,koon held,a sentencing court must determine whether the particular case at hand falls outside the heartland of cases covered by the relevant guideline.id.the court wrote 
if the special factor is a forbidden factor,the sentencing court can not use it as a basis for departure.if the special factor is an encouraged factor,the court is authorized to depart if the applicable guideline does not already take it into account.if the special factor is a discouraged factor,or an encouraged factor already taken into account by the applicable guideline,the court should depart only if the factor is present to an exceptional degree or in some other way makes the case different from the ordinary case where the factor is present.if a factor is unmentioned in the guidelines,the court must,after considering the structure and theory of both relevant individual guidelines and the guidelines taken as a whole,decide whether it is sufficient to take the case out of the guideline heartland.the court must bear in mind the commission expectation that departures based on grounds not mentioned in the guidelines will be highly infrequent.ch,pt.a.

we have interpreted koon as calling for a inquiry 
first,we determine if the factor relied upon in the case makes it special or unusual,taking it outside the heartland.second,we determine whether departures on such factors have been forbidden by the commission.third,we determine whether the commission had encouraged departures based on such factors.fourth,we determine whether the commission has discouraged departures based on such factors.

under koon,we do not defer to a district court decision as to whether a factor is a permissible basis for departure under any circumstances.koon,at.however,koon instructs us otherwise to apply an standard.id.at.
after the sentence in the present case was imposed and this appeal was fully briefed,congress amended e and directed us to review de novo the district court application of the guidelines to the facts.the government has argued that this provision applies to appeals pending when it took effect and is thus applicable here.see united states thurston,wl.lexis cir,united states,cir.however,because this question has not been fully briefed and because we need not resolve this question in order to decide the present appeal,we do not do so.we assume for the sake of argument that the standards of review set out in koon still govern.
the district court did not provide a single,compact explanation of the specific reason for its departure decision.instead,as noted,the court discursive oral comments touched on many matters,and it is not entirely clear which of the matters discussed were regarded by the court as grounds for departure.on appeal,first argues that t he district court based the downward departure on a number of circumstances,appellee br.at,but later states that there were two factors that led to the court decision to depart the bop decision regarding credit against his sentence and the fact that the denial of credit by bop was the direct causation of the offense of threatening a federal judicial official.appellee br.at.we agree that these latter factors seem to have been the most important,but we will addre
