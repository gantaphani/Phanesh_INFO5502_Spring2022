a north carolina jury convicted thomas moore,of burglary and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury.after moore exhausted his direct appeals and state remedies,he petitioned the district court for a federal writ of habeas corpus under.
the district court granted the writ.it found that the north carolina court unreasonably applied the supreme court holding in strickland washington,when it rejected moore claim that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to present an expert on the fallibility of eyewitness identification,and that the court denied moore relief based on an unreasonable factual determination.
the state of north carolina,acting through reuben young,secretary of the north carolina department of public safety,and michael hardee,administrator of hyde correctional institution collectively,the state,now seeks reversal of the district court order granting moore writ.moore from the district court denial of one of the additional claims of ineffective assistance he asserted below,that his trial counsel was ineffective for stipulating to irrelevant and prejudicial evidence.
given the deference required by strickland and the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of the aedpa to the court,we are constrained to disagree with the district court decision to grant the writ.we therefore reverse the district court judgment granting moore petition on his claim of ineffective assistance based on his counsel failure to call an expert in eyewitness identification,and affirm the portion of the district court judgment rejecting moore other claims of ineffective assistance.
although the north carolina court of appeals aptly summarized the facts when it directly reviewed moore convictions,we briefly restate them here.
in,richard and helen overton were robbed at gunpoint at home.they accused moore and his brother,linwood moore,of committing the masked,armed robbery.in,the overtons testified against the moore brothers in court.the state court dismissed the charges against thomas moore linwood moore was acquitted.
on june,helen and richard overton were at their macclesfield,north carolina home.around pm,helen overton noticed an african american male she later identified as thomas moore standing outside the storm door richard overton was asleep in another room.helen overton conversed with moore,who was two feet face to face with her.moore asked if he could use her phone because his car had broken down.when helen overton grew suspicious,backed away from the door,and attempted to shut it,he drew a gun and pushed his way inside.helen overton then noticed a second african american male running toward the house.she pushed the door shut and attempted to lock it to stop the second person from entering,but moore began hitting her hands to prevent her from doing so.
when richard overton entered the room,moore started shooting richard overton suffered gunshot wounds to the shoulder and hand.moore then pointed the gun at helen overton and threatened to kill her,but she pushed him away.the assailants fled the scene,and helen overton contacted emergency services.
when helen overton spoke with police on the night of the assault,she did not identify moore as the shooter.instead,she told officers that her husband had told her the intruder was the same man as last time.
two days later,when officers presented her with a photographic lineup,helen overton identified moore as the shooter.when officers asked richard overton who had shot him,he replied,those damn moore boys that robbed me three years ago.richard overton indicated that he saw moore face.id.at.
moore was indicted for burglary and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury and tried before a jury on april.richard and helen overton identified moore as the assailant before the jury.helen overton confirmed that she had identified moore from the photographic lineup based on his involvement in the incident,not because her husband had told her it was the same man as last time or because she had seen moore in court during the proceedings.the state also presented,without objection from the defense,a caliber revolver that officers performing a separate investigation had recovered several miles from the overtons house two weeks after the incident,along with a forensic report analyzing the revolver and the bullets recovered from the overtons house.the report was inconclusive with regard to any connection between the admitted firearm and the assault.
defense counsel the overtons regarding the fact that they had previously accused moore and his brother of robbery and had seen and testified against the brothers in the earlier case.on,richard overton acknowledged that on the night of the assault,he had referred to the two assailants as the moore boys even though he himself had only seen one moore.although richard overton characterized his identification as referring to thomas moore,for one rather than both moore boys,counsel significantly impeached richard overton testimony with evidence that linwood moore was incarcerated on the night of the assault and could not have been present.on of the state crime scene investigator,defense counsel elicited testimony that the revolver recovered several miles from the overtons home was connected neither to moore nor to the incident at the overtons home.finally,moore testified in his own defense,explaining that on the night of the burglary,he had been at home with his mother.after a trial,the jury convicted moore of both charges.
before sentencing,moore filed a motion for appropriate relief mar requesting the court to set aside the verdict on sufficiency of the evidence grounds.the court denied the motion and sentenced moore to to months of imprisonment for the assault conviction and to months of imprisonment for the burglary conviction,to be served consecutively moore appealed.
the north carolina court of appeals affirmed moore convictions.reviewing moore challenge to the admission of the firearm and forensic report for plain error,it found the challenged evidence irrelevant and prejudicial,but remained unconvinced that absent the error the jury probably would have reached a different verdict,ultimately concluding that the admission of the evidence did not constitute plain error.
in,moore filed a third mar with the edgecombe county superior court the mar court.for the first time,he asserted that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to suppress the overtons in and identifications of him consult with and call an expert in the fallibility of eyewitness testimony and object to the admission of the firearm and the forensic report moore attached the affidavit of lori van wallendael,an expert in eyewitness memory.her affidavit detailed several factors which can affect the reliability of eyewitness identifications,including the weapon focus effect and unconscious transference.wallendael also presented evidence about the less reliable nature of identifications as well as the weak correlation between an eyewitness confidence in his or her identification and the accuracy of that identification.wallendael explained that these issues are not apparent to a common sense appraisal of eyewitness testimony,and that the testimony of an expert witness could have assisted the jury in evaluating the reliability of the identifications in this case.
the mar court denied moore third mar without conducting a hearing.regarding moore claims of ineffectiveness,the mar court concluded 
the court finds that evidence as to the and identification of the defendant was fully presented to the jury,including evidence that one of the two persons identified by a witness for the state was not present at the time of the commission of the crimes.the jury also heard evidence that at an earlier time the defendant was acquitted of crimes allegedly committed against the victims of these offenses.the jury heard all of the evidence surrounding the identification of the defendant and the weight of that evidence was for the jury.the witnesses were examined and cross examined regarding the identifications.the defendant does not suggest that there is any more evidence regarding the identification.the court concludes any error in failing to request a voir dire on the identification was harmless and not prejudicial and that there was no showing to justify or require an expert on identification.
the court finds that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are without merit that the defendant has failed to show that counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness that the defendant has failed to show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for any alleged errors of trial counsel,there would have been a different result in the trial that the defendant has failed to overcome the presumption that counsel failure to request a voir dire on identification falls within the range of reasonable professional assistance and sound trial strategy and that any alleged errors in the failure to request a voir dire by defendant trial counsel and to stipulating to the admission of evidence were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
on august,moore request for certiorari was denied 
moore filed his federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina in august.in it,he argued that the mar court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law and based its decision on an unreasonable factual determination,entitling him to the writ under.moore made the same ineffective assistance of counsel claims he presented to the mar his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to prepare and call an expert in the fallibility of eyewitness testimony move to suppress the overtons in and identifications richard overton on his eyesight and object to the admission of the firearm and forensic report.the state moved for summary judgment,and moore filed a for the same.
the district court granted moore petition after concluding that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to consult and call an expert on the fallibility of eyewitness testimony.the court first determined that when the mar court found that moore failed to allege the existence of any more evidence concerning the identifications and.failed to demonstrate even a justification for such an expert,the mar court unreasonably applied the supreme court strickland decision to the facts and based its decision on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.moore keller,d,hc f,wl,at march.
to reach this conclusion,the district court primarily relied on two cases ferensic birkett,cir and bell miller,cir as well as wallendael affidavit.the district court highlighted the expert utility in light of the unique facts of moore case.moore,wl,at.it concluded that,given that there were no jury instructions embracing the numerous factors potentially affecting the reliability of the eyewitness identifications,and that there is no other evidence of moore guilt besides the overtons testimony,expert testimony on the fallibility of eyewitness identifications would have been particularly useful to moore defense.id.based on wallendael affidavit,the district court found that expert testimony could have exposed the jury to the concepts of the weapon focus effect and unconscious transference,while alerting the jury to problems inherent in identifications,as well as the danger of correlating a witness supposed confidence in their identification with accuracy.id.at.
after determining that jurists could not dispute that the mar court judgment represented an unreasonable application of strickland as well as an unreasonable factual determination,the district court turned to the merits of moore ineffective assistance claim.id.at.recognizing that its decision could be considered novel,id.at,the court found counsel failure to obtain an appropriate expert witness deficient pursuant to strickland despite counsel of the overtons and attempt to establish an alibi,id.at.the court reasoned that could have been presented in tandem with expert testimony,and that there was no overarching strategy that required counsel to choose between sponsoring appropriate expert testimony or vigorously cross examining the witnesses and establishing an alibi.id.at.such testimony would have provided a scientific,professional perspective that no one else had offered the jury.id.quoting ferensic,at.because no other evidence connected moore to the crime and other admitted evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial,the district court found a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had counsel called an expert in eyewitness fallibility.id.at citations omitted.
the court rejected moore other claims of ineffective assistance.as relevant to this appeal,the court concluded that even if moore counsel was deficient for failing to object to the admission of the irrelevant and prejudicial firearm and forensic report,the mar court did not unreasonably apply strickland when it concluded that the admission of the evidence did not prejudice moore.this was particularly the case because moore counsel successfully demonstrated that none of this evidence could be linked with moore or the crime.id.at.
the state appealed,and moore,after receiving a certificate of appealability,the district court denial of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on his counsel failure to object to the admission of the firearm and forensic report.
we first address the state contention that the district court erred in granting moore writ.we begin our de novo review of the district court grant of habeas corpus with the aedpa,which guides our consideration of a state prisoner habeas corpus petition.see richardson branker,cir.the provisions of the aedpa substantially constrain our review of an underlying state court decision.wolfe johnson,cir.under the aedpa,a writ of habeas corpus shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.

in practice,a decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it unreasonably applies a supreme court precedent to the facts of the petitioner claim.buckner polk,cir quoting williams taylor.a similar analysis naturally applies to the analogous and adjacent language in d.for a state court factual determination to be unreasonable under d,it must be more than merely incorrect or erroneous.it must be sufficiently against the weight of the evidence that it is objectively unreasonable.winston kelly,cir citation omitted.
the limited scope of federal review of a state petitioner claims is grounded in fundamental notions of state sovereignty.richardson,at citing richter.at.because federal habeas review frustrates both the states sovereign power to punish offenders and their attempts to honor constitutional rights,richter.at quoting calderon thompson,section d is designed to confirm that state courts are the principal forum for asserting constitutional challenges to state convictions,id.
with these background principles in mind,we turn first to the district court conclusion that,under d,the mar court unreasonably applied the supreme court precedent in strickland.we then address its finding that the mar court based its decision on an unreasonable factual determination under d.finally,we turn to moore.
where a habeas corpus petition alleges ineffective assistance of counsel,we review the claim not only through the strictures of the aedpa but also through the additional lens of strickland and its progeny.richardson,at.the aedpa and strickland provide dual and overlapping standards which we apply simultaneously rather than sequentially.id.citing richter.at.this doubly deferential review requires the court to determine not whether counsel ac
