gregory edward wright moves for a certificate of appealability coa to appeal the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.he argues that reasonable jurists would find debatable whether his confrontation clause claim is procedurally barred he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and the state suppressed evidence in violation of the fourteenth amendment and brady maryland,d.
the evidence at trial established that donna vick was stabbed to death in her home in desoto,texas,in the early hours of march.wright,who had been staying with vick in her home,was seen with her at a vfw lodge on the night before the murder.around the next morning,wright and his friend,john adams,drove vick car to purchase crack cocaine from a drug dealer who was staying at llewelyn mosley home.mosley testified that adams and wright arrived at his house on the night of the murder and told him that they had some things from a woman in desoto that they wanted to get rid of,including a television,a weed eater,a rifle,a color printer,and a microwave.several of these items were later identified as belonging to vick.wright negotiated with the dealer.after exchanging some of the items,wright and adams appeared cheerful and exchanged high fives.
the next day,adams asked daniel mcgaughey,an employee at a video store,to call the police because he wanted to turn himself in.adams directed the police to vick house and assisted in recovering her car.dna testing revealed that blood found on the steering wheel belonged to wright.at the house,the police found vick body on her bed and wright bloody fingerprint on her pillowcase.in a trash can,the police found a handwritten note reading,do you want to do it 
adams also led the police to a shack that wright sometimes stayed in,where they arrested wright and seized a bloody and splattered pair of blue jeans.outside the shack,the police found a bloody knife.dna evidence established that the blood on the knife and jeans was vick.several cans of gold spray paint were found in wright home,and witnesses testified that wright had previously been seen with gold paint on his face and clothes.a police officer testified that he had known people to inhale spray paint to get high.the police also found mail addressed to adams at the shack.after wright was arrested,he phoned a friend from jail and asked her to remove any of his clothing from the shack.
adams also led the police to a knife in a vacant lot near mosley home.dna testing revealed that the knife had vick blood on it.a medical examiner testified that vick could have been stabbed by more than one knife.
at trial,the prosecution argued that both adams and wright attacked vick the court instructed the jury that it could convict wright only in the event that it found that he actually attacked vick.the court did not instruct the jury on a law of the parties theory of liability the jury found wright guilty,and he was sentenced to death.
wright conviction was affirmed on direct appeal to the texas court of criminal appeals tcca.wright state.he petitioned the state court for a writ of habeas corpus.the state trial judge adopted the state proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in their entirety and recommended that relief be denied.the tcca adopted the trial court findings of fact and conclusions of law and denied relief.
wright petitioned the united states district court for the northern district of texas for a federal writ of habeas corpus.a magistrate judge recommended denying relief on all of wright claims.wright dretke,wl.the district court judge adopted the magistrate judge recommendation and denied the petition.
we issue a certificate of appealability only when the movant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c.this requires him to demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.slack mcdaniel,d.at this stage,we are not permitted to give full consideration of the factual or legal bases in support of the claim.cockrell,d.instead,we merely conduct an overview of the claims and a general assessment of their merits.id.
the movant arguments must be assessed under the deferential standard required by d.tennard dretke,d see,at.scalia,concurring arguing that a court must consider d deferential standard of review when ruling on motion for coa.a federal court may not issue a writ of habeas corpus with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the court either arrived at a conclusion of law opposite that reached by the supreme court or arrived at a result opposite that of the supreme court on materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a state court decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court derives the correct legal principle from supreme court decisions but applies that principle in an objectively unreasonable manner.id.at.
wright argues that his sixth amendment right to confront witnesses against him was violated when the trial court admitted into evidence the testimony of detective dan trippel.on direct examination by the prosecution,trippel described a conversation he had with adams,who did not testify.trippel testified that he discovered vick body after meeting with adams.on cross examination,wright elicited testimony from trippel that adams claimed that he owned one of the knives used in the murder.on redirect,trippel testified that adams told him that wright used adams knife to stab vick.wright made a hearsay objection.the prosecution responded that the testimony was admissible under the rule of optional completeness.see evid.when part of a conversation is given in evidence by one party,the whole on the same subject may be inquired into by the other.under the rule of optional completeness,hearsay is admissible when it serves to clarify other hearsay evidence elicited by the opposing party.bunton state,pet.ref.the prosecution argued that if the jury only heard that adams admitted that he owned one of the murder weapons,it might be left with the mistaken impression that adams confessed to trippel that he had killed vick.wright responded that the rule was inapplicable because the jury had not been given a false impression.wright did not argue to the trial court that the sixth amendment prohibited admission of this testimony.
on direct appeal,wright argued that the admission of trippel testimony violated texas evidentiary and the confrontation clause.the tcca deemed wright confrontation clause argument waived because his objection based on hearsay did not alert the trial court to the federal nature of his claim.wright,at see.a a stating that to preserve error for appeal,appellant must have objected with sufficient specificity to make trial court aware of the complaint,unless the specific grounds were apparent from the context.on subsequent habeas review,the district court consequently deemed wright confrontation clause claim procedurally defaulted.wright,wl,at.
a federal court may not grant a petition for a writ of habeas corpus where the state court expressly denied the claim based on an independent and adequate state procedural rule.coleman thompson,d to be adequate,a state rule must be firmly established and regularly followed.ford georgia,d see barr city of columbia,d alabama ex rel.flowers,d.it is the petitioner burden to demonstrate that the procedural bar is not regularly applied,stokes anderson,cir,or that the rule was exorbitantly applied under the circumstances of the case,lee kemna,d.we review the adequacy of a state law used to preclude federal habeas review de novo.rosales dretke,cir.wright argues that his objection based on a texas state evidentiary rule was sufficient under texas law to preserve his confrontation clause claim and that the tcca decision is therefore not an adequate procedural bar.
wright argument is contrary to texas law,which generally requires a defendant to make a specific confrontation clause objection to preserve such an error.in support of its ruling that a hearsay objection does not generally preserve a confrontation clause claim,the tcca relied on dewberry state.wright,at.although dewberry was decided after wright trial,the tcca had applied the same rule as early as in holland state.holland objected to the admission of testimony concerning an statement on the ground of hearsay.id.at.he did not object that admission of the evidence violated the confrontation clause.id.the tcca held that the federal constitutional claim was not preserved for review.id.texas courts have frequently held,both and wright trial,that where it is not clear from the context of the trial that the defendant was raising a confrontation clause claim,a hearsay objection does not preserve the federal constitutional error.
the cases wright cites are not to the contrary.none addresses the specific question of under what circumstances a hearsay objection is sufficient to preserve a confrontation clause claim.wright primarily relies on kittelson dretke,cir,in which we held that the petitioner confrontation clause claim was exhausted when it had been fairly presented in a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus.because no state court held that kittelson claim was barred by a state procedural rule,id.at noting that state court did not rely on procedural rule in disposing of kittelson claim,we did not address whether texas courts consistently held that hearsay objections generally did not preserve confrontation clause claims.kittelson,therefore,does not control this case 
wright also cites several cases applying texas statutory exception to the hearsay rule for statements made by child abuse victims.see crim.proc.in lankston state,benavides,for example,the defendant lodged a hearsay objection to the testimony of an adult to whom the alleged child victim of sexual assault had reported the crime.such testimony is admissible under the statute so long as the prosecution provided the defendant with a written summary of the statement prior to trial.id.at see crim.proc,b.the tcca held that a hearsay objection is sufficient to preserve a claim that the proffered testimony fell outside the written summary where it is clear from the transcript that the trial court understood the basis for the objection.lankston,at see heidelberg state,distinguishing lankston on the ground that the record clearly showed that all parties knew the nature of the objection.the tcca did not consider in what context a hearsay objection was sufficient to preserve a confrontation clause claim.
similarly,in gabriel state,no pet,the prosecution presented testimony under the same statutory exception to the hearsay rule.the defendant made a hearsay objection on the ground that the prosecution failed to provide notice of its intent to introduce certain testimony concerning a child victim outcry statements.id.at.the court of appeals held that the objection was sufficient to preserve the error because after a hearsay objection is made,the state has the burden to show it has complied with all the requirements of the statute.id.at.because wright trial did not concern application of texas statutory outcry exception to the hearsay rule,gabriel is not contrary to the tcca decision in wright case 
we therefore conclude it is not debatable amongst jurists of reason that the texas court application of the contemporaneous objection rule constitutes an adequate and independent procedural bar to wright confrontation clause claim.
wright argues that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel.we evaluate such claims under the test established by strickland washington,d.under strickland,a petitioner must establish that his counsel performance was deficient and that he suffered prejudice as a result.id.at.prejudice results when there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different absent the error.id.at.
wright claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to make a confrontation clause objection to the admission of adams hearsay statement.as noted,that statement was in sum that wright used adams knife to kill vick.wright argues that adams hearsay statement was critical because the jury was not instructed on a law of the parties theory of liability.the jury therefore had to find that wright personally attacked vick.wright argues that adams hearsay statement that he gave his knife to wright therefore substantially bolstered the prosecution case.
the texas habeas court held that the decision not to make a confrontation clause objection was the result of a considered trial strategy on the part of wright trial counsel.the court held that it was reasonable to speculate that defense counsel realized that they could not vouch for the reliability of the statements that adams owned the murder weapon and then object to the introduction of the remainder of the statements under the confrontation clause.
the district court did not address this ground for the texas court decision the district court instead reasoned that the state court could reasonably have concluded that wright could not establish that he was prejudiced by his counsel failure to make a confrontation clause objection due to the overwhelming evidence establishing that wright murdered vick.wright,wl,at.
in light of aedpa deferential standard of review,we decline to grant a coa on this issue because,assuming arguendo that the objection would have been sustained and the testimony excluded,it is not debatable amongst jurists of reason that the state court could have reasonably concluded that wright can not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by his counsel failure to object.first,in its closing statement,the prosecution did not rely on adams hearsay statement that he gave one of the murder weapons to wright.second,and more significantly,there was overwhelming evidence establishing that wright personally,and most likely in conjunction with adams,attacked vick.at the scene of the crime,the police found wright bloody fingerprint next to the body and his blood on a towel.immediately following vick death,wright was seen driving vick car and trading her belongings for drugs.his blood was found on the steering wheel.at wright shack,the police recovered a pair of blue jeans with gold and vick bloodstains in wright shack.wright was a known inhaler of gold spray paint.finally,the police recovered two knives with vick blood,one from near wright shack.
finally,wright argues that the prosecution suppressed the following evidence in violation of the fourteenth amendment and brady maryland that the state had agreed not to prosecute llewellyn mosley in exchange for his testimony that adams had confessed to the murder to jerry causey at mosley house the tape of the call daniel mcgaughey made reporting that adams wanted to turn himself in police notes recording a statement by daniel mcgaughey to the police concerning adams and evidence that the police found papers belonging to adams in the shack.
the district court rejected each of these claims on several grounds.the court first noted that wright had procedurally defaulted his brady claims.wright,wl,at.despite holding that these claims were procedurally defaulted,the district court proceeded to consider and reject them on their merits.id.at.the district court held that wright failed to establish that the prosecution suppressed any agreement with mosley,adams confession to causey,the tape,or adams papers.id.in the alternative,the court held that none of this evidence was material.id.
wright does not dispute that his brady claims are procedurally defaulted.he argues,however,that we should nevertheless consider the merits of these claims because he is actually innocent of the crime.see house bell,d schlup delo,d.
to establish actual innocence under schlup,wright must demonstrate that in light of all the evidence,including that tenably claimed to have been wrongly excluded or to have become available only after trial,id.at,it is more likely than not that n
