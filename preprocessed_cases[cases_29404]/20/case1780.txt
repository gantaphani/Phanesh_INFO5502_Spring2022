jeris bragan appeals the district court decision denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus based on his allegation of prosecutorial vindictiveness.for the reasons provided below,we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
in the evidentiary hearing held on this matter before the united states magistrate judge william haynes,the parties stipulated to the following facts 
the petitioner,jeris bragan,was charged along with darleen bragan,who was then the wife of the petitioner,with the premeditated and deliberate murder of george nesbitt urice in an indictment filed march.the petitioner and his spouse were jointly tried in september.bragan was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to years imprisonment.the former bragan was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to not less than years nor more than years imprisonment,modified on appeal to a determinate sentence of fifteen years.bragan conviction was affirmed by the court of criminal appeals of tennessee on january.the supreme court of tennessee denied certiori sic as to bragan on april.
bragan filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court on july.the writ was granted by the honorable john nixon in a memorandum and order filed april.the case was reported as bragan morgan,sic.the court ordered bragan released from custody if he was not provided a new trial within sixty days,page of the reported opinion.
among the bases for this court previously granting habeas corpus relief were its findings that prosecuting attorneys at bragan trial knowingly suppressed evidence favorable to the defense and failed to correct the false or misleading testimony of the state key witness,william harold buggy torbett.the court opined that torbett false statements were literally put in torbett mouth by the prosecutor on direct examination and later repeated in closing argument.the respondent has acknowledged that judge nixon findings in bragan morgan as to the prosecuting attorneys misconduct at the trial have become the law of the case.
the state complied with this court order by releasing bragan from custody on may.subsequent to his release from custody,bragan remained at liberty without bond even though he was subject to being retried in state court on the indictment.

according to petitioner,after the state dropped its appeal of the order granting petitioner habeas writ,he asked fred steltemeier,an attorney,to pursue disciplinary proceedings against gary gerbitz,the district attorney general and the lead prosecutor in petitioner original trial,and stan lanzo,an assistant district attorney involved in the initial prosecution of petitioner.on june,steltemeier filed a complaint with the board of professional responsibility against gerbitz and lanzo.steltemeier based the substance of the complaint primarily on judge nixon memorandum granting petitioner habeas writ.
following his release from prison,petitioner gave interviews to the associated press,the tennessean,the banner,and the chattanooga times regarding his trial.he also appeared on several network radio programs as well as at least two radio talk shows in nashville.the substance of those interviews concerned the perjury of an informant,william buggy torbett,and petitioner allegations that gerbitz and lanzo arranged for petitioner and the informant to be locked in the same cell,that gerbitz and lanzo suborned perjury,and that they coached the informant as to what to say.petitioner also communicated to the media that a witness at his original trial,ralph janow,had expressed that he was in fear of his life,and that janow was subsequently murdered.petitioner also appeared on television and spoke before groups about his trial and his prosecutors.in january,petitioner completed a book entitled beyond prison walls,an autobiography scheduled for release on april.petitioner summarized the content of the book discussion of gerbitz and lanzo 
t hat i believe the evidence shows that they were corrupt prosecutors that suborned torbett to perjury.that they arranged to have me placed in a cell with him so he could identify me.and that they went to great lengths to cover that up and keep it from ever being exposed.

taylor review of the evidence did not disclose any evidence that would not have been available to gerbitz at the time he decided to reinstate the case.taylor did not know of any change in the law between the time of the reinstatement and the time he entered the case that would have affected the decision to reinstate.
