this is a habeas corpus case involving a state prisoner and raising confrontation clause questions.the district court denied habeas relief we find the question closer,but affirm the denial of relief because the state court decision affirming petitioner murder conviction can not be said to be an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.
on july,a babysitter,erica forestiere,was stabbed to death between and while her two young charges slept upstairs.in,a state court jury convicted theodore trigones of the crime,finding him guilty of first degree murder.he was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.
trigones defense at trial was that the father of the children,leo trzcinski,intending to kill his estranged wife,had mistakenly killed forestiere,the babysitter.trigones testified that,on the night of the murder,he went to the trzcinski residence,where he encountered trzcinski sitting near the already dead babysitter.
later that night,trigones spoke with his stepfather,roland weed.at a pretrial hearing on trigones motion to suppress,weed testified that trigones,in the early morning hours following the murder,had said i done something terrible or i did something terrible.at that same hearing,weed also testified that he understood trigones to say i killed someone,and that trigones said something like t here a lot of hate in me and if it was her it would have been somebody else.
the only purpose of this pretrial hearing was to determine whether trigones statements to weed were voluntary and products of a rational intellect,given trigones contemporaneous drug and alcohol ingestion the trial court found the statements voluntary and admissible.
trigones was denied the opportunity to confront weed at trial.an edited version of the transcript of weed suppression hearing testimony was read to the jury,over trigones objection,when weed exercised his fifth amendment rights by refusing to testify at trial.trigones sought interlocutory relief on the question of the admissibility of the weed testimony and lost.
at trial,trigones testified and pointed the finger at trzcinski.trigones also attempted to counter weed statement.he testified that what he had said to weed was not that he,trigones,had killed someone,but that it was trzcinski who had killed someone,although,in the conversation with weed,trigones did not name trzcinski as the killer.trigones testified that he had told weed that there is a lot of hate in him,meaning trzcinski,and that,if it was her the babysitter,he,again meaning trzcinski,would have killed someone else.trzcinski also testified and provided a version of the facts which,if credited,exculpated him.the jury had the opportunity to hear from both trigones and trzcinski and to evaluate which witness to believe and who was the killer.
weed testimony,read into evidence at trial,was an important element of the commonwealth case.trigones alleged confession,as recounted by weed,was a significant part of the evidence tending to show that trigones,rather than trzcinski,committed the murder.indeed,as the federal district court that heard this habeas petition noted,weed testimony recounting trigones alleged confession was likely some of the most damning evidence.trigones hall,d.the differences between trigones version of his statement to weed and weed version of trigones statement make all the difference,according to trigones,because trigones version is an admission only to being an accessory after the fact,whereas weed version is an admission that trigones committed the murder himself.
the jury convicted trigones,and the supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc affirmed the jury verdict on appeal,commonwealth trigones.the sjc rejected trigones argument that,under the confrontation clause,the court should not have admitted weed statement.id.at.it concluded that,under ohio roberts,d,the testimony was admissible because weed was unavailable to testify at trial and his suppression hearing testimony bore adequate indicia of reliability.trigones,at.
in trigones filed a new trial motion based on ineffective assistance of counsel.the trial court initially denied the motion without a hearing.a single justice of the sjc then denied trigones motion for leave to appeal the denial,but remanded to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing because the justice could not make the requisite ineffective assistance of counsel determination on the record as it existed at the time.the trial court held an evidentiary hearing at which trigones trial counsel testified.after this hearing,the trial court again denied the motion and a single justice of the sjc then denied trigones motion for leave to appeal.trigones next filed an unsuccessful action in the sjc for a declaration that it was unconstitutional to deny him the right to appeal from the denial of the new trial motion.trigones attorney.
in,some thirteen years after his conviction,trigones sought federal habeas corpus relief.he argues that the admission into evidence of the transcript of weed testimony denied him his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to weed at trial.the district court denied the writ,holding that it was bound by what it considered the sjc factual conclusion that trigones abandoned his bias line of questioning at the suppression hearing and that trigones had failed to raise before the state courts his argument that his counsel had lacked a similar motive to at the suppression hearing.trigones,d at.
although trigones argument is far from frivolous,we affirm the district court denial.in light of the particular circumstances of this case,we can not say that the sjc conclusion was unreasonable.
trigones makes a argument that admission at trial of the weed transcript violated his sixth amendment right to confront weed and that the sjc decision that there was no sixth amendment violation was either contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
there is no credible argument that this case fits within the contrary to framework of analysis.see williams taylor,d hurtado tucker,cir,cert.denied,d.this is simply because trigones has not shown that the sjc decision arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law.williams,at.see also bell cone,d.nor has he shown that the sjc confront ed facts that are materially indistinguishable from a relevant supreme court precedent and arrive d at a n opposite result.williams,at.see also bell.at.because the sjc adjudicated the constitutional claim on its merits,we apply the deferential,statutory unreasonable application test,d and do not review the sjc constitutional conclusion de novo.fortini murphy,cir stating that we can hardly defer to the state court on an issue that the state court did not address,cert.denied,d.even an incorrect state court decision is not necessarily an unreasonable one for habeas purposes.williams,at.stating that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law see also bell.at.
the unreasonable application issue is measured against the sixth amendment requirements for the admission of prior preliminary judicial hearing testimony of a witness who is unavailable at trial.the sixth amendment confrontation clause states that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.it applies to the states through the fourteenth amendment due process clause.pointer texas,d.
the confrontation clause does not prohibit the admission of all hearsay evidence.idaho wright,d mattox united states.although a literal interpretation of the confrontation clause could bar the use of any statements when the declarant is unavailable,the supreme court has rejected that view as unintended and too extreme.bourjaily united states,d quoting roberts,at.t here has traditionally been an exception to the confrontation requirement where a witness is unavailable and has given testimony at previous judicial proceedings against the same defendant which was subject to by that defendant.barber page,d.that is because the right of initially afforded provides substantial compliance with the purposes behind the confrontation requirement.id 
where hearsay evidence is offered,and that evidence consists of testimony by an unavailable declarant,the confrontation clause requires that the proponent here the commonwealth show that the transcribed testimony from the preliminary judicial hearing bears adequate indicia of reliability,sufficient to offset the lack of.roberts,at.quoting dutton evans,d plurality see also wright,at.applying the roberts framework mccormick on evidence,at strong,ed outlining the confrontation clause standard for admission of prior testimony.adequate indicia are shown if the proffered testimony falls within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay prohibition or if the proponent of the evidence makes a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.roberts,at.if the testimony is within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,then it has adequate indicia of reliability,without more.white illinois,d roberts,at.
the federal and state hearsay rules,although they do not control the constitutional inquiry,are instructive because they outline the contours of the firmly rooted hearsay exception at issue in this case.we have previously concluded that.b codifies a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay prohibition,and so evidence admissible under rule b is,by definition,not vulnerable to a challenge based upon the confrontation clause.united states mckeeve,cir.
the federal rules provide that former testimony is not excluded by the hearsay prohibition if the declarant is unavailable as a witness and the party against whom the testimony is now offered had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony.b see generally mccormick on evidence,supra,at stating that the issues in the first proceeding,and hence the purpose for which the testimony was offered,must have been such as to produce an adequate motive for testing on the credibility of the testimony.the massachusetts rule is similar.see commonwealth meech,trigones,at liacos et,handbook of massachusetts evidence,at ed stating that p rior testimony is admissible if it was given under oath in a proceeding where the issues were substantially the same as in the current proceeding and the party against whom it is offered had an opportunity and a similar motive to the witness.
even if the motives to develop the testimony are dissimilar,that does not end the confrontation clause inquiry.although a showing of sufficiently dissimilar motives removes the testimony from the firmly rooted exception analysis by placing the testimony outside of rule b or any other firmly rooted hearsay exception,the testimony may still be analyzed for particularized guarantees of trustworthiness and,if such guarantees are found,admitted into evidence.roberts,at.see also lee illinois,d stating that hearsay evidence that does not fall within a firmly rooted exception may nonetheless be admitted without violating the confrontation clause upon a showing that it has particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.if the testimony is not within a firmly rooted exception,then the proponent must show particularized guarantees of trustworthiness rendering the contested hearsay statement at least as reliable as a statement admissible under a firmly rooted exception.wright,at.citing roberts,at.
the sjc correctly articulated the federal constitutional standards the only issue,then,on federal habeas review is whether the sjc unreasonably applied those standards.
trigones,in his habeas appeal,argues that the admission of the weed transcript violated his sixth amendment rights because he was unable to weed on two issues bias and weed ability to recollect accurately the statements weed recounted.we address bias below,and find that trigones has failed to exhaust his argument pertaining to weed ability to recollect except to the extent that he is alleging an inaccuracy in weed recollection due to bias,as distinguished from inaccuracies resulting from other imperfections in weed ability to have perceived and recalled trigones statement,such as lack of memory or inability to hear the statements at the time they were allegedly made.the sjc concluded that trigones sole argument was that weed testimony lacked reliability because he was not fully on the possibility that he may have lied in order to protect his wife and himself from prosecution as accessories to the crime.trigones,at.after closely examining trigones arguments presented to the sjc,we agree that trigones did not make his inability to recollect argument before the sjc and hence,for reasons of lack of exhaustion,he may not raise it now.scarpa dubois,cir 
trigones argued before the sjc that the admission of the weed transcript violated his sixth amendment rights because he was unable to weed on the bias issue.he claimed that his suppression motion sought to exclude weed trigones statements after the weed testimony also showed that trigones was intoxicated on drugs and alcohol and could not have made a voluntary statement.bias,trigones argued to the sjc,was not an issue at the suppression hearing,but would have been an issue at trial if weed had testified.the asserted bias was in favor of the commonwealth,and brought about by the interests of weed and his wife in avoiding being charged as accessories after the fact to murder.trigones,at.
the sjc addressed three issues the extent of the asserted restriction of,the sixth amendment principles governing the admission of weed recorded testimony,and whether the constitutional standard was satisfied.id.it concluded there was no constitutional violation,id.at,finding that trigones had an opportunity to weed on bias,although,p erhaps for tactical reasons,defense counsel acquiesced in the judge suggestion of irrelevance and abandoned that line of questioning,id.at.the sjc noted that there had been some limited examination on bias at the suppression hearing.id.at.as to motive,the sjc concluded that trigones should have had the same motive to weed at the pretrial hearing on the relevant issue of bias as he would have had if weed had testified in person at trial.id.at.
these conclusions,if correct or,for habeas purposes,at least reasonable,were sufficient under clearly established supreme court law for the sjc to reject trigones confrontation clause argument.the sjc,however,proceeded to address whether weed testimony should nonetheless be excluded because trigones did not adequately pursue his opportunity to weed on bias,and concluded that on this point would not have made a difference.id.we hold that the sjc conclusions on opportunity and similar motive were not unreasonable and therefore conclude that weed testimony fell within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.because it would not have been unreasonable for the sjc to stop the analysis there,given that the supreme court has not resolved whether an unexercised opportunity is sufficient to satisfy the confrontation clause requirements,roberts,at,we conclude without the need to address the sjc holding that on bias at trial would not have made a difference.
opportunity to weed on bias 
the question whether trigones had an opportunity to pursue his bias line of questioning at the suppression hearing is a very close one.even if,faced with the issue on direct appeal,we would have resolved the issue differently,we can not say that the sjc conclusion as to opportunity was unreasonable.
the question whether trigones counsel,regardless of his motive,had a sufficient opportunity to weed at the suppression hearing turns on one interpretation of the following exchange,which occurred at the suppression hearing,between counsel delinsky and weed,immediately followed by an exchange between counsel and the trial judge 
q were you told at that time that weed could not be prosecuted for helping somebody after a crime was committed because she was a blood relative and a mother were you told that by the police 
a no,i was.
q were you told that by the district attorney 
the court now wait,delinsky,please.let assume that all of this ha
