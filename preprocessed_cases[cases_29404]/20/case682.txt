opinion of the court 
appellant kevin siehl was convicted of first degree murder after a jury trial in a pennsylvania state court.following unsuccessful direct appeal and relief proceedings,siehl instituted this habeas corpus proceeding in the district court alleging ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.the district court denied relief,and this appeal followed.we will reverse and remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing.
on july,christine siehl landlord received complaints that water was running out of the apartment building.he entered siehl apartment and found her body in the bathtub with the shower running.she had multiple stab wounds which resulted in her death.the time of death was estimated to be between the hours of on july and or on july.based on testimony from the mother of a neighbor who heard commotion in the apartment at approximately on july,the commonwealth argued that she was killed at approximately that time.
the bathroom contained indications of a struggle between the victim and the murderer,including blood on the walls and floor,broken mirror pieces,and scattered cat litter.there was no sign of forced entry.potential suspects in the criminal investigation were kevin siehl,who was married to but living separately from the victim frank wills,with whom the victim had been romantically involved while married to siehl and robert prebehalla,who told people of his hatred for the victim.according to sergeant angelo cancelliere,siehl became the prime suspect because a fingerprint on the showerhead and a blood sample from the scene were determined to match siehl.
siehl was arrested and charged with first degree murder,third degree murder and involuntary manslaughter.public defenders david weaver and linda fleming were appointed by the trial court to represent siehl.they promptly persuaded the court to appoint a forensic expert to assist them in the defense of their client.for reasons that will hereafter become clear,we will refer to their chosen expert as john smith.smith promptly provided counsel with a page and a half preliminary analysis,the purpose of which was to give an explanation as to how this crime was committed and to explain certain items of physical evidence.app.at.he determined,after reviewing a photograph of the latent print and the fingerprint card of siehl,that the latent print from the showerhead matched siehl.smith full discussion of the print was as follows 
this print does match the rolled inked impression on the finger print card bearing the name of kevin charles siehl.see lift photograph and finger print card.it can be stated however,that the print is an exceptionally clear print and not smudged,as one would expect to find in a homicide scenario such as this one.the other thing about this print that is unusual,is that microscopic examination of the shower head,where the print was developed,shows no trace evidence of blood which one would expect to find due to the nature of the crime.it also can be stated that no time frame can be placed on this print as to when it was made.the alleged suspect,kevin siehl,had access to this apartment prior to the commission of the crime,therefore,the print could have been made well before the homicide occurred.
app.at.smith preliminary analysis did not explain the basis for his preliminary conclusion that the print belonged to siehl.while it commented on three of the bloodstain evidence items out of the eighty items tested,he did not test the blood evidence and made no findings with respect to the bloodstain which the commonwealth would maintain was consistent with siehl blood.smith did not prepare any other reports,nor did he testify at trial.
during opening statements,the commonwealth emphasized that the fingerprint was siehl,was a direct piece of evidence that tied siehl to the murder scene,and was in a position which would indicate that siehl was outside the shower when the fingerprint was made.the prosecutor also told the jury to pay attention to testimony regarding blood evidence consistent with siehl blood type found on the bathroom doorframe.
at trial,trooper merril brant testified that the latent fingerprint on the showerhead matched that of siehl,and that the position of the print led him to conclude that it was not left by someone showering,but rather was left by the murderer who was standing outside the tub and directed the shower onto siehl body.brant used the showerhead to demonstrate this theory for the jury.brant further testified that the print had not yet started to deteriorate,and that therefore it must have been left within hours of when the victim was discovered.prior to this testimony,the jury was read a stipulation of the parties that the fingerprint found on the showerhead belonged to siehl.defense counsel did not present expert testimony to counter brant testimony regarding the timing and position of the fingerprint.
at trial,scott ermlick,the state crime lab supervisor,testified as a serological expert.ermlick testified that one of the twelve bloodstains recovered from the bathroom was consistent with siehl blood group markers,and that none of the blood was consistent with those of wills or prebehalla.the stain,which he testified was consistent with siehl blood group markers,was one of two small spatters found on the bathroom doorframe.he identified the other spatter as consistent with siehl blood group markers.because the sample was small,no dna or testing could be performed.defense counsel did not present expert testimony to counter ermlick findings.
siehl presented an alibi defense.his father and brother,with whom he was living at the time,and his parents neighbor all testified.they stated that siehl dropped siehl off at his parents home at approximately on july,and then drove away while siehl remained at his parents home for the remainder of the evening.
siehl was convicted of first degree murder.the jury unanimously decided that a life sentence would be imposed.siehl then retained new counsel,terry despoy,who represented him on direct appeal.the pennsylvania superior court affirmed the judgment of conviction.a petition for allowance of appeal to the pennsylvania supreme court was denied.
siehl next filed a petition for relief in the court of common pleas.with new counsel in that proceeding,he raised and sought an evidentiary hearing on the issues of whether trial counsel were ineffective for stipulating that the fingerprint belonged to siehl and for failing to secure the assistance of a competent forensic expert at trial,and whether appellate counsel was ineffective for not raising those issues on appeal.in response to the commonwealth argument that siehl had waived his claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel by failing to raise them on direct appeal,siehl insisted that this was a situation involving ineffective assistance of appellate counsel as well and,thus,layered claims of ineffectiveness.he argued that under commonwealth sawyer,he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the ineffectiveness of both trial and appellate counsel.the court rejected this argument and concluded that siehl claims of ineffectiveness of trial counsel had been waived by his failure to raise them on direct appeal.the court agreed to an evidentiary hearing limited to only two issues one not here relevant and the competence of smith.
at the first evidentiary hearing,trial attorney fleming testified only on direct examination by siehl.she testified that she did not recall whether smith tested either the blood or the fingerprint evidence.she also testified that smith did not prepare a report for counsel prior to trial,and that she did not recall whether smith was an expert in serology.fleming direct testimony was cut off by the court because it concluded that counsel was addressing the prohibited ineffective assistance of counsel issues.accordingly,the commonwealth was not afforded an opportunity to her.a second evidentiary hearing was held at which the court again cut short siehl evidence.it declined to hear any testimony from professor herbert leon macdonell,a highly credentialed forensic expert siehl was,however,permitted to make an offer of proof.the proffer summarized macdonell affidavit in which he opined that the developed latent fingerprint from the showerhead did not come from siehl brant fingerprint deterioration theory was incorrect,and it was impossible to determine how long the print had been on the showerhead the two small blood spatter stains came from the same source and the probability of the two having come from two different individuals was so unlikely that for all intent and purpose it is an impossibility app.at and smith was not qualified in any field of forensic science,including fingerprint identification and bloodstain pattern interpretation,to testify as an expert the court denied relief and siehl filed an appeal raising the same issues of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.the superior court of pennsylvania affirmed.
the superior court addressed the merits of siehl ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims.it recognized the validity of the concept of layered ineffective assistance of counsel claims,but it had no occasion to express an opinion on the waiver issue it recognized that the controlling principles were those endorsed by the supreme court in strickland washington,d.with respect to the claim that counsel was ineffective for stipulating that the fingerprint on the showerhead belonged to siehl,the superior court assumed arguendo that the print was not siehl but concluded that counsel had a reasonable basis for making the stipulation and that siehl had failed to establish prejudice.specifically,the court found 
t he record reflects that counsel had a reasonable basis for making the stipulation.the record reflects that appellant did not deny,at that time,that the fingerprint was his.thus,trial counsel had a reasonable basis for making this stipulation as part of his strategy.
moreover we observe that no prejudice has been demonstrated.the murder victim was appellant or estranged wife,in whose apartment appellant often visited.a police officer testified that appellant told the police that he showered there at christine apartment many times and that his fingerprints would be all over the place.thus,even before his arrest,appellant had explained the presence of his fingerprints in the victim apartment.appellant fails to establish prejudice due to the stipulation because,if trial counsel had not made the stipulation,there is no probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different.
app.at citation omitted.
with respect to the claim that counsel was ineffective because they did not obtain a qualified forensic expert to assist them at trial,the court determined only that siehl could not demonstrate prejudice 
the record is clear that appellant was a frequent visitor to the apartment and that his fingerprints were throughout the apartment.appellant fails to demonstrate that a challenge to the fingerprint evidence or the retention of a qualified forensic expert would have affected the outcome of the trial.
thereafter,siehl instituted this habeas proceeding in the district court.the magistrate judge report and recommendation addressed the merits of siehl ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims and recommended denial of the petition and of a certificate of appealability because siehl failed to show that the state court adjudication of the claims was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.the district court adopted the report and recommendation,and this appeal followed.
this court granted the following certificate of appealability 
the application for a certificate of appealability is granted as to these issues whether appellant sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated where trial counsel stipulated that the fingerprint on the showerhead belonged to the appellant without having the assistance of a qualified fingerprint expert to examine the fingerprint and render a competent scientific opinion where he did not have qualified forensic experts in fingerprint identification and bloodstain pattern analysis to assist him and where and appellate counsel failed to raise the issue of trial counsel ineffectiveness for stipulating to the fingerprint without having the assistance of a qualified fingerprint expert to examine the finger print and render a competent scientific opinion.the parties also should address whether the pennsylvania superior court determination of these sixth amendment issues was based on an unreasonable application of strickland washington,d,or on an unreasonable determination of the facts,see d,and whether appellant is entitled to a hearing in the district court on these issues,campbell vaughn,cir.
under the and effective death penalty act aedpa,habeas relief on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to a judgment of a state court can not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the decision is contrary to,or involves an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,or is based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.aedpa thus limits a federal court authority to grant habeas relief when a state court has previously considered and rejected the federal claim on the merits.
under the unreasonable application clause of d,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.jermyn horn,cir quoting williams taylor,d.in determining whether the state court unreasonably applied supreme court precedent,the question is whether the state court application of federal law was objectively unreasonable,not whether the application was,in the judgment of the federal habeas court,erroneous or incorrect.id.at.
sixth amendment claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are governed by strickland washington,d,which qualifies as clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.taylor horn,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.according to strickland,a court deciding an ineffectiveness claim must determine whether,in light of all the circumstances,the identified acts or omissions of counsel were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.at.since strickland,the united states supreme court and this court have emphasized the necessity of assessing an ineffectiveness claim in light of all the circumstances.see taylor,at jacobs horn,cir citing supreme court and third circuit cases.
under strickland,a petitioner must also show that counsel deficient performance prejudiced the defense.see taylor,at.this requires a defendant to show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.quoting strickland,at.
we must now determine whether the pennsylvania superior court rejection of siehl ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims involved an unreasonable application of strickland,and if so,whether siehl proffer of evidence,including the macdonell report,together with the other evidence of record,entitles siehl to an evidentiary hearing on those claims in the district court.
a.the superior court decision 
the superior court found as a fact that,at the time counsel stipulated regarding the fingerprint on the showerhead,siehl did not deny that the fingerprint was his.app.at.we,of course,must and do accept that finding.in the court view,this meant that counsel had a reasonable basis for making the stipulation.id.at.the reasonableness of this view,and the court further view that there was no prejudice from the stipulation and from the failure to secure an expert to assist at trial,depends on the soundness of a single failure to challenge brant identification of the fingerprint can not have prejudiced siehl because he was a frequent visitor to the apartment and his fingerprints were throughout the apartment.app.at.this foundational proposition was not an objectively reasonable one,however,becau
