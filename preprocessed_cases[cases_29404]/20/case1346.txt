at on september,a house burned down in battle creek,michigan,within minutes after andrew babick,left it.two young boys died in the blaze.a jury in michigan state court later convicted babick of one count of arson and two counts of felony murder.the state trial court sentenced babick to two terms of life imprisonment without possibility of parole.babick argues here,as he did in the district court,that his convictions were tainted by ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct.but congress has made clear that there are limits to our power to grant habeas relief and babick claims,for the reasons stated below,lie beyond them.we therefore affirm the district court denial of his petition.
shortly before midnight on september,babick left his home to buy crack cocaine.he walked to grove street,a house where he had bought crack before.luquentine caldwell was on the porch when he arrived.luquentine at first denied having any crack,but eventually sold babick a small rock for,which was double its street value.babick took the rock to his sister house and smoked it.he then went back to the grove street house,where he pounded on the door.the pounding woke belinda sutton,who was sleeping in one of the upstairs bedrooms with lyndon caldwell.sutton went downstairs and answered the door.she says that babick was angry and that he accused luquentine of selling him bad crack but babick says he simply wanted to buy more crack.in any event,sutton told babick that luquentine had left the house and that she did not know when he would return.she locked the door and went back to sleep.according to sutton trial testimony,it was about then.babick says he spent the next minutes on the house front porch,dozing on a sofa and smoking a cigarette.at some point he went home.
at approximately,a smoke alarm woke sutton and lyndon.lyndon tried to reach the other bedroom,where jacqueline caldwell two and sons were sleeping,but was turned back by thick smoke in the hallway.he and sutton jumped from a rear window and went to a neighbor house to call for help.the battle creek fire department received that call at firefighters arrived about three minutes later to find the front of the house engulfed in flames.they doused the fire and made their way upstairs,where they found the boys charred bodies.
at about that night,babick tried to return to the scene a third time,but was unable to get there because the street was blocked by emergency vehicles.the following afternoon,police officers went to babick house and asked him to come to the station for an interview.he agreed.the officers did not place babick under arrest,but detective timothy hurtt did inform him of his miranda rights.hurtt also told him that the interview was being videotaped.babick answered questions for a while,but invoked his right to counsel and ended the interview after hurtt accused him of starting the fire.
the police also interviewed the residents of the grove street house and several neighbors.officers walked a canine through the house to sniff for accelerants and took numerous floor and carpet samples for laboratory analysis.they also executed a search warrant at babick residence and seized a pair of shoes to which the canine alerted.meanwhile,the fire department brought in an investigator from the fire marshal division of the michigan state police,in addition to the department own investigator.
the police eventually referred the matter to the calhoun county prosecutor office.the prosecutor agreed that the fire was arson,but thought there was a lack of evidence that babick was the person who set it.the michigan attorney general office disagreed,however,and charged babick with arson of a dwelling house and two counts of felony murder.
the trial court appointed alma to represent babick.she obtained court orders allowing her to seek reimbursement from the state for the costs of an arson expert and a private investigator.but she hired only the latter her strategy was to concede that the fire was arson,but to argue that there was insufficient evidence that babick was the person who set it.babick case went to trial before a jury,which found him guilty on all counts.the court then imposed a mandatory sentence of two terms of life imprisonment without possibility of parole.
babick twice moved for a new trial after sentencing.the trial court denied both motions.babick also filed a direct appeal in which he raised six issues.the michigan court of appeals rejected his arguments and affirmed his conviction.see people babick,wl.over a dissent,the michigan supreme court denied leave to appeal.see people babick.the united states supreme court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari.see babick michigan.
babick next filed a motion in the trial court requesting relief from the judgment.he presented several new claims,including claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and prosecutorial misconduct.he also said that his appellate counsel had been ineffective for failing to assert those claims earlier.the trial court denied the motion on grounds.the michigan court of appeals and the michigan supreme court both denied leave to appeal.
babick then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.four of his claims are relevant here first,that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to consult with an arson expert second,that his counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain a television schedule for purposes of impeaching belinda sutton at trial third,that the prosecutor committed misconduct by allegedly interfering with efforts to retain an arson expert and fourth,that the prosecutor again committed misconduct by commenting,during closing arguments,on babick request for an attorney.
a magistrate judge concluded that babick had procedurally defaulted these claims by failing to present them during his direct appeal,but that his appellate counsel ineffectiveness established cause and prejudice to excuse those defaults.the magistrate then concluded that babick was entitled to relief on the merits of each claim,and so recommended that the district court grant the writ.the district court rejected that recommendation and denied the petition on the merits.see babick berghuis,wl.jan.the court also denied babick a certificate of appealability.he then sought one from this court,which we granted.
this appeal followed.
we review de novo a district court denial of a habeas petition.see joseph coyle,cir.babick procedurally defaulted his claims in state court.to obtain relief on them here,therefore,he must establish cause and prejudice for the defaults.see yukins,f d,cir.he must also show that the claims are meritorious.we cut to the merits here,since the analysis adds nothing but complexity to the case.see generally hudson jones,cir.so to the merits we now turn.
to prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claims,babick must first show that his trial counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.strickland washington.babick must then establish prejudice,which requires him to show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.see id.at.
babick argues that his trial counsel representation was deficient because she should have at least consulted an arson expert before abandoning a defense at trial.we evaluate decisions not to investigate for reasonableness in all the circumstances,applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel judgments.id.at.
babick argument has some force,particularly when considered in isolation.but a reasonably competent lawyer could have concluded that the prosecution evidence of arson was the strongest part of its case.the state was prepared to produce several fire investigators,the commanding firefighter on the scene,and a canine show the fire was intentionally set.the state theory,as set forth by two fire experts at trial,was that someone had poured flammable liquid on the front porch and then into the house through the front door and up the staircase.the state would further show that laboratory analysis had confirmed the presence of an accelerant at one of the locations where the dog had,the cement steps leading from the porch into the house.the state was also prepared to show that several common causes of accidental fires could be positively ruled out,since the fire had not affected the kitchen,the basement electrical panel,the furnace,or the water heater.
the evidence that babick was the arsonist appeared weak by comparison.all of the witnesses who fingered him were admitted crack dealers testifying under immunity.moreover,the house a crack insured the house and was behind on her payments,which arguably gave her a motive to burn it down.
this case is therefore a negative image,rather than a copy,of richey bradshaw,cir,upon which babick principally relies.there,the evidence tying richey to the fire was nearly insurmountable the apartment owner had recently told richey that she was leaving him for another man richey himself had made threats that night that he would torch the place and numerous witnesses placed him in the burned apartment building at the time of the fire.id.at.a defense was richey only real chance for acquittal,and we faulted his counsel for failing to pursue it.but that does not mean that we must do the same thing here,where the respective strengths of the two,and reversed.
but the simplest ground on which to decide babick claim is prejudice.he has shown none as a result of his trial counsel failure to produce an arson expert in support of his defense.indeed,his counsel in this federal habeas our decisions show to be effective made the same omission even now.we do not attribute that to oversight babick appellate counsel in state court contacted an arson expert in,but that expert refused to offer an opinion on the fire cause.babick says that refusal was because most of the evidence had been destroyed by then.maybe so but even the internet articles upon which babick relies make clear that,in different cases with different facts,arson experts have criticized the prosecution case on a cold record.babick offers no such criticism here.
what babick does offer,instead,are three articles,none of them specific to his case.see pet.supp.ex.two of the articles contain nothing more than general criticism of the arson evidence used to obtain convictions in two texas cases from the late and early.moreover,both articles were written in and emphasize the superiority of modern forensic of course would not have been available to an expert in.the third article helps babick even less,given that it is overwhelmingly positive about the use of canines and cautions only against relying on a dog alert as the sole indication that an accelerant was used.that caution is irrelevant here,since the alerts were corroborated by several other two different investigators analyses of the burn patterns at the scene,and a positive laboratory result.on this record,at least,three generic internet articles are not enough to set aside the final judgment of a state court.there is simply no way for us lawfully to hold that babick has made the requisite showing of prejudice to prevail on his claim.
there is a coda,however.in response to questioning at oral argument before this court,babick asked that we remand the case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing regarding his claims.but there are several reasons why we can not do that either.as an initial matter,babick did not make any such argument in his brief,so the argument is forfeited.see blatter,cir en banc.
the argument fails on the merits as well.babick requested an evidentiary hearing in the district court,albeit as an afterthought in a supplemental brief in support of his petition.the court considered the request and carefully explained its reasons for denying it.see babick,wl,at.we review that denial for an abuse of discretion.see schriro landrigan.at the outset,there is a serious question as to whether babick request is categorically barred by e,which generally prohibits a federal court from holding an evidentiary hearing where the petitioner has not been diligent.see williams taylor.but here again the argument fails on simpler grounds babick lacked any witnesses to put on at the hearing.on this record,we can not hold that the district court abused its discretion by denying babick request for a hearing.see getsy.mitchell,cir en banc affirming the district court denial of a hearing to explore petitioner unsupported speculation hutchison bell,cir same,where the petitioner never indicated what evidence he would have presented.
babick also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate the basis of belinda sutton testimony regarding the time of babick second visit to the house that burned down.sutton said that babick arrived at about,based on the program on her television when his pounding woke her.but that program actually aired from midnight until,a fact that babick trial counsel never uncovered.had his counsel obtained a television schedule,babick argues,she could have used it to impeach sutton testimony and to put more time between his arrival and the start of the fire.
this failure to investigate was regrettable.babick counsel knew from the police report that sutton time estimate was based on the program and she knew from the preliminary sutton had initially said rather than sutton estimate was shaky.moreover,distancing babick from the time of the fire was important to her defense.
but babick own statements undermine any showing of prejudice.according to what he told detective hurtt,babick first arrived at the grove street house around midnight.he stayed for a few minutes,bought a rock of crack,and then walked one mile back to his sister house.that walk,according to hurtt,takes about minutes.babick said that he entered his sister house through a window,spent about an hour there smoking the crack,and then walked back to the grove street house.babick own statements,then,place him at the grove street house at about,just minutes before the fire began.
babick argues that his own time estimates could have been wrong and that his walking speed or route could have differed from hurtt.but babick initial arrival time was corroborated by five witnesses,so that variable is hardly in play.moreover,hurtt took a direct route between the houses,and was sober when he did babick was admittedly kind of drunk even before smoking the crack.so we doubt that babick traveled any faster than hurtt did.the remaining variable is babick time at his sister house.unless he spent almost no time there at all,however,he simply could not have returned to the grove street house before sutton television program ended.so the reasonable conclusion,based upon all of the other evidence in the case,is that sutton was wrong about the television program,rather than about babick arrival time.we see no reasonable probability that the outcome of babick trial would have been different had his counsel obtained the television schedule and that means his claim fails.
babick criticisms are not limited to his own counsel performance.he also claims that the prosecutor committed misconduct at trial.we turn to those claims.
babick argues that assistant attorney general mark blumer wrongfully interfered with efforts to retain an arson expert.after the trial court authorized her to seek reimbursement for the costs of an arson expert and a private investigator,she sent a letter to blumer office stating that she would be sending the bills to him.blumer replied that any such bills would be returned unpaid,that she instead should seek reimbursement through a state administrative board,and that,if the board denied reimbursement,her only recourse would be to sue the state.
that message,babick says,violated what he regards as his right to a expert witness.he assumes that the right recognized in ake oklahoma,to a psychiatrist assistance in support of an insanity to experts as well.but the supreme court has treated that question as open.see caldwell mississippi.the circuit courts have not reached consensus on the question.see,baxter thomas,cir no extension recognized yohey collins,cir extension recognized,but with additional barriers little armontrout,cir en banc extension recognized in full.our own precedent is unclear.compare terry rees,cir per curiam stating,without explanation,that a criminal defendant was entitled to a pathologist assistance with tinsley million,cir questioning a defendant claimed entitlement to a expert.
but we need not join that debate today.babick has not shown that the letter had the effect he says it had.the letter did not bar payment of an expert fees,but referred to another state agency for payment.one might criticize that message on grounds,but not,we think,on federal constitutional ones.moreover,went on to hire a private investigator and to obtain reimbursement for his services,even though the letter spelled out the same procedure for obtaining reimbursement of those fees as it did for fees.on the record,therefore,there is no basis to conclude that the letter had any effect on decision not to retain an arson expert.
babick also contends the refusal to pay effectively deterr ed a defense witness from testifying by intimidation or threat.that is facially not true.and neither has babick shown,as generally discussed above,that the absence of an arson expert rendered his trial fundamentally unfair.see darden wainwright,alleged misconduct must infect the trial with unfairness.we therefore reject this claim.
babick argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by commenting on his request for an attorney.the request first came to the jury attention,however,when babick trial counsel insisted on playing the unedited videotape of babick police interview.then,during closing argument,the prosecutor said babick had asked for an attorney only after it became clear that the police did not believe his statements to them.babick contends that this comment violated his fourteenth amendment right to due process,as described in doyle ohio.
under doyle,the government may not first induce a defendant silence by warning him of his miranda rights and then use his invocation of those rights to impeach him at trial.see id.at.doyle thereby protects defendants who have relied on the government assurances that they will not be punished for exercising their miranda rights.see wainwright greenfield.but babick did not rely on any such assurances here to the contrary,he waived his miranda rights and voluntarily gave a statement.see anderson charles,per curiam a defendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving miranda warnings has not been induced to remain silent.he therefore lacks the predicate for a doyle claim.see wainwright,at accord united states,cir united states harris,cir.
finally,babick contends that the prosecutor comments violated his fifth amendment privilege against compelled.see griffin california.but babick never made this argument in the district court,so the argument is forfeited.see byrd collins,cir.
we have no lawful basis to set aside the state court judgment in this case.the district court denial of the petition is affirmed.
an egregious mistake has been made in this case.the petitioner,babick,got convicted of arson on the basis of pure junk science in a case the local district attorney in battle creek,michigan,refused even to and magistrate judge ellen carmody below would have reversed in a writ of habeas corpus.district judge wendell miles reversed judge carmody,and we now have before us this strange junk science case brought for undisclosed reasons by an assistant attorney general of the state instead of the local district attorney.i agree with the local and judge carmody that the case should never have been prosecuted.the evidence of arson is based on expert testimony inconsistent with the clear standards set out in the bible of arson forensic science,the nfpa national fire protection association,guide for fire and explosion investigations and eds.the case has gotten this far through a combination of the state refusal to provide the defense with an arson expert,and defense counsel failure to understand fully and explain persuasively the need for such an expert,and the consequent failure of judges and jurors along the way to recognize that the scientific evidence on which the jury based its verdict is bogus.
as perhaps the worst example of the junk science nature of the case,take the evidence offered by expert witness jeff austin,who told the jury that his dog,samantha,was times more effective at detecting fire starters or liquid accelerants than a laboratory test on burnt material.the lab testing of the materials from the house had not found accelerants in the house and samantha evidence was then used to rehabilitate or contradict the negative lab tests.the jury was misled into trusting samantha over the arson forensic lab.the authoritative fire guide is unequivocal that canine evidence requires lab corroboration in order to be considered reliable.research has shown that canines have been alerted to pyrolysis products that are not produced by an ignitable liquid,and a positive alert by a canine that is not confirmed by a forensic lab should not be considered validated.fire guide describing the role of canine investigation as assisting with the location and collection of samples for laboratory testing.the evidence is so unreliable that,in a recent case,the federal judge even granted a defendant motion in limini to prohibit expert testimony of a canine handler because the alert had not been confirmed by lab testing and hence conflicted with the fire guide and did not meet the daubert standards for relevancy and reliability.united states myers,wl.july.
the remainder of the evidence used to convict babick is expert testimony of a similar nature that the national standards condemn as unreliable.fire expert wayne etue told the jury that char marks on the porch were evidence of an accelerant,that a line of demarcation burn pattern on a carpet was suspicious because it should not have burned the carpeting on these jagged edges,and repeated that the burns were not normal and were unnatural,trial transcript,volume,at.fire expert joan tuttle also told the jury that low burning and that other unnatural patterns indicated the presence of accelerant.both etue and tuttle direct contrast to the nfpa they were so confident in their reading of burn patterns that the absence of any laboratory confirmation of accelerant had no effect on their testimony,trial transcript volume,at.
chapter of the national guide sets out the standards for determining whether a fire was an incendiary fire,defined as a fire that has been deliberately ignited under circumstances in which the person knows the fire should not be ignited.fire guide at.the interpretation of burn patterns is too subjective to stand unless corroborated by laboratory testing.while irregular patterns may indicate the presence of an ignitable liquid,t he investigator should ensure that samples are taken from any area where ignitable liquids are suspected to be present and confirmed by lab testing.fire guide at.the guide also addresses burn patterns called trailers that may be visible connecting separate fire sets,again stating that samples of possible liquid accelerants should be collected and analyzed.id.the guide instructs investigators not to draw conclusions from irregular burn patterns irregularly shaped objects on the floor may provide protection to the floor,resulting in patterns that may be inaccurately interpreted.the guide offers a warning to investigators 
investigators may form an opinion that the speed of fire growth or the extent of damage was greater than would be expected for normal fuels however these opinions are subjective what an investigator may consider as excessive,unnatural,or abnormal can actually occur in an accidental fire,depending on the geometry of the space,the fuel characteristics,and the ventilation of the compartment the investigator is strongly cautioned against using subjective opinions to support an incendiary cause determination in the absence of physical evidence.
fire investigators took eighteen samples from inside and outside the house and sent them to the lab for testing.only the sample from the cement stoop outside the the owners kept their grill and frequently positive for accelerant.the seventeen oth
