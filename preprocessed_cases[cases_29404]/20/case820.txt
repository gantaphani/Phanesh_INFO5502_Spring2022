opinion of the court 
joseph george nara appeals the district court dismissal of his petition for writ of habeas corpus as untimely.nara argues that the statute of limitations under d should have been tolled under d,because his motion to withdraw his guilty plea nunc pro tunc was a properly filed application for state or other collateral review that was pending.alternatively,nara argues that this court should apply equitable tolling principles because of extraordinary circumstances in his case.
facts and procedural history 
the parties do not dispute the facts of this case.on january,nara shot and killed his wife and.after nara was arrested,he underwent a psychiatric evaluation during which he described himself as being severely depressed after his wife left him in december.the commonwealth of pennsylvania charged nara with two counts of criminal homicide.on june,nara pled guilty in the pennsylvania court of common pleas to two counts of first degree murder and later was sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment.he did not appeal his sentence.
the record shows that nara mental condition deteriorated while he was in prison.shortly after he arrived at the state correctional institution at pittsburgh,he was placed in the institution hospital for psychiatric reasons.app.at.nara was transferred to farview state hospital after being diagnosed as having suicidal ideation of severe proportions.app.at.although he was returned to prison,he was hospitalized again after attempting to commit suicide in february by overdosing on drugs.a psychiatrist diagnosed nara as severely mentally disabled and a clear and present danger to himself.at.after another lengthy hospital stay for approximately months,he was transferred to the state correctional institution at huntingdon,pennsylvania in,where he is incarcerated to this day.there is nothing in the record of nara mental condition after.
on april,nara filed his first petition for relief under the pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra.ann.et.in the accompanying pro se brief,nara stated,inter alia,that he was not mentally competent when he pled guilty and that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to assess his mental competence at the time of the crimes and when he pled guilty.after a hearing at which nara was represented by counsel,the trial court denied the petition.the trial court opinion and order,however,addressed only the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the superior court of pennsylvania affirmed,and the pennsylvania supreme court denied review in.
on may,nara filed a second pcra petition.he argued that his plea should be withdrawn because he was mentally incompetent when he entered it.the trial court appointed new counsel and held a hearing on november,at which a forensic psychiatrist testified that nara was psychotic and depressed at the time of his guilty plea and therefore was not mentally capable of entering a plea.app.at.based on this testimony,the trial court found that nara guilty plea was not valid and granted nara petition.the commonwealth appealed.the superior court reversed and reinstated the plea,ruling that the issue of nara competence had been waived because nara had failed to raise it in his first hearing the superior court stated in a footnote that nara waived his right to request withdrawal of his guilty plea by failing to file a motion to withdraw the plea pursuant to.that rule provided,in part a a motion challenging the validity of a guilty plea,or the denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea shall be in writing and shall be filed with the trial court within ten days after imposition of sentence.in,the pennsylvania supreme court denied nara petition for allowance to appeal.the united states supreme court denied nara petition for certiorari.
on december,nara filed a third pcra petition,alleging,inter alia,that he was incompetent to enter the guilty plea.the trial court appointed attorney phyllis jin to represent nara,and held a hearing on april.at this hearing,nara agreed that he had previously litigated the issues in his pcra petition.nara therefore asked to withdraw his pcra petition in favor of filing a motion to withdraw his guilty plea nunc pro tunc pursuant to rule.the court allowed nara to withdraw the petition and issued a briefing schedule for the motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
after the submission of briefs,the trial court issued an opinion and order on september,denying the motion.the court found that nara had been advised at his sentencing in of his right to move to withdraw the plea within days and noted that nara did not give a compelling reason why he waited years to ask to withdraw his guilty plea.the superior court affirmed on july,and the pennsylvania supreme court denied nara petition for allowance to appeal on december.nara did not file a motion for reconsideration to the pennsylvania supreme court nor did he file a petition for certiorari to the united states supreme court.
nara then filed the present petition for writ of habeas corpus.the certificate of mailing indicates that the prison mailed the petition on december.however,his habeas petition is signed and dated december,and his cover letter to the petition is dated december.
the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge,who recommended that nara petition be dismissed as untimely and that a certificate of appealability be denied.in analyzing the applicability of the statute of limitations under d and the tolling provision under d,the magistrate judge determined that the latest date on which nara application for state or other collateral review was pending was december,when the pennsylvania supreme court denied his petition for allowance of appeal with respect to his nunc pro tunc motion.thus,according to the magistrate judge,the statute of limitations would have begun on that date and would have run until december.therefore,even with the benefit of the mailbox rule which would recognize filing of nara habeas petition on december,his petition was untimely.the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendations,dismissed nara habeas petition as untimely,and denied the certificate of appealability.
nara filed a timely appeal to this court.
discussiona.jurisdiction and standard of review 
on february,a motions panel of this court issued a certificate of appealability under c on the following 
the issues of whether the district court correctly concluded that nara habeas petition was untimely filed under the statute of limitations,d,see burns morton,cir,and whether nara was entitled to any tolling of the limitations period pursuant to either d,see lovasz vaughn,cir,or the principles of equitable tolling,see jones morton,cir miller new jersey state dep t of corrections,cir.in particular,the parties should address whether nara motion to withdraw his guilty plea nunc pro tunc was a properly filed application for state or other collateral review within the meaning of d.if that motion tolled the limitations period,the parties should address whether nara is also entitled to tolling for the period following entry of pennsylvania supreme court order on december,when nara could have petitioned for certiorari review in the united states supreme court.

b.the requirements of d 
a state prisoner must file his or her habeas corpus petition within one year after the completion of the state court proceedings.d,enacted as part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,provides,in relevant part 
a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.the limitation period shall run from the latest of 
a the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review 
the time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.
the inquiry under d encompasses both when the judgment of the state court became final and when the properly filed application for state or other collateral review was pending.nara must satisfy the provisions of d because he is in custody pursuant to the judgments of pennsylvania courts.nara pled guilty on june,and was sentenced on july.nara did not file a direct appeal,so his conviction and sentence were final on august,when the time during which he could have appealed days lapsed.because we have implied from the statute a grace period for those petitioners whose convictions became final before the effective date of aedpa,and aedpa was effective april,nara had up until,and including,april,to file a timely petition under d.see burns morton,cir we agree that applying d to bar the filing of a habeas petition before april,where the prisoner conviction became final before april,would be impermissibly retroactive.however,nara did not file his federal habeas petition until december,
the principal issue on appeal is whether the statute of limitations under d should be tolled for any reason.nara argues that his motion to withdraw his guilty plea nunc pro tunc tolled the statute of limitations as provided by d,making his habeas petition timely.the commonwealth disputes whether nara nunc pro tunc motion can be considered a properly filed application for state or other collateral review within the meaning of d.the magistrate judge determined,and the district court agreed,that it was not necessary to resolve this issue because even if the motion was construed as such,nara habeas petition was still untimely.
it is the commonwealth position that a nunc pro tunc motion can never be a properly filed application for state or other collateral review because the nunc tunc pro characterization is a concession that the movant failed to request relief in a timely manner.the commonwealth urges us to hold that a nunc pro tunc motion in state court does not trigger the tolling provision in order to prevent state prisoners from using such motions in an attempt to preserve their right to file federal habeas petitions and thereby abuse the writ.the commonwealth cites to a footnote in our decision in swartz.see at.we do not read that opinion as holding that a nunc pro tunc motion or request is not a properly filed application for state or other collateral review under d by virtue of its nunc pro tunc character.
our opinions suggest a much more flexible approach.in jones morton,cir,we stated that d covers various forms of state review,but did not specify the forms of state review that qualify for tolling.in lovasz vaughn,cir,we considered whether a second or successive petition for state relief was a properly filed application.we defined properly filed application as one that is submitted according to the state procedural requirements,such as the rules governing the time and place of filing.id.at.we further rejected the notion that a meritless pcra petition can not properly filed application under d.id.at.therefore,we treated lovasz second pcra petition as a properly filed application under d.
indeed,a recent supreme court decision supports this flexible approach.in artuz bennett,d,the court considered whether the prisoner pro se motion to vacate his judgment of conviction could toll the statute of limitations under d.the court stated that an application is properly filed when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings.these usually prescribe,for example,the form of the document,the time limits upon its delivery,the court and office in which it must be lodged,and the requisite filing fee.id.at emphasis omitted footnote omitted.t he question whether an application has been properly filed is quite separate from the question whether the claims contained in the application are meritorious and free of procedural bar.id.at emphasis omitted.thus,the court upheld the second circuit determination that the statute of limitations was tolled during the time when the state court was considering the prisoner motion to vacate his conviction,despite the fact that the claims in the motion were procedurally barred under new york law.see id.at.
other courts of appeals have held similarly.see,dictado ducharme,cir personal restraint petitions dismissed in state court as repetitive and untimely were still properly filed applications within the meaning of d emerson johnson,cir motion to the texas court of criminal appeals entitled suggestion that the court reconsider on its own motion the denial of the application for writ of habeas corpus was a properly filed application under d villegas johnson,cir petition dismissed in state court as successive or an abuse of the writ was nevertheless a properly filed application which tolled the statute of limitations under d.
we find these cases to be informative for the case at hand.nara motion to withdraw a guilty plea nunc pro tunc is certainly akin to an application for state or other collateral review.the pcra trial court accepted the motion,allowed the parties to brief the motion,and made a full consideration of the record before denying it.indeed,nara notes that his motion merely followed what the superior court suggested when that court disposed of nara second pcra petition.see br.of appellant at.lastly,nara contends that it is not uncommon for pennsylvania courts to accept motions to withdraw guilty pleas nunc pro tunc.see,commonwealth clark.thus,we hold that nara motion to withdraw his guilty plea nunc pro tunc was a properly filed application for state or other collateral review within the meaning of d.
we turn next to determine how long nara motion was pending under d.the district court agreed with the magistrate judge that the latest date it was pending was december,the date on which the pennsylvania supreme court denied nara petition for allowance of appeal.it followed that the last date on which nara could have timely filed his habeas petition was december,making his actual filing on december,untimely.
on appeal,nara argues that his motion was pending at least until expiration of the time to seek reconsideration by the pennsylvania supreme court days,if not until expiration of the time for petitioning the united states supreme court for certiorari days.in support of this contention,nara cites our decision in kapral united states,cir.in that case,we considered,the habeas provision for federal prisoners which requires that a motion challenging a sentence be filed within one year of the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.the district court had ruled that kapral motion was untimely because it was filed more than one year after the court of appeals affirmed the defendant conviction and sentence.we reversed,stating that the judgment of conviction does not become final until the time for seeking certiorari review expires because o nly when the time for seeking certiorari review has expired is it appropriate for a defendant to commence a collateral attack on the conviction and sentence.kapral,at.we stated that any holding to the contrary would invite simultaneous proceedings in the supreme court and district court which would only impair the orderly administration of criminal proceedings.id.at.we noted that the same reasoning applied to the definition of final judgments under d limitation.id.at.
the issue in kapral was different than the one before us now.in kapral,we considered when a judgment is final under d,not how long a state application for collateral review is pending for the purposes of d.in our subsequent opinion in swartz,we turned to the definition of pending.see at.a trial court denied swartz pcra petition and the superior court affirmed on october.swartz did not file a timely petition for allowance of appeal to the pennsylvania supreme court,but instead filed a motion for permission to file a petition for allowance of appeal nunc pro tunc,which was denied by the pennsylvania supreme court on may.swartz then filed a habeas petition under on october.the district court dismissed the habeas petiti
