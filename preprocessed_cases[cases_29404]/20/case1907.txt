dwayne coulter case has been traveling through the state and federal judicial systems for twenty years.coulter was convicted of murder and conspiracy to commit murder by an illinois state court in.illinois coulter,d,coulter i.his case first arrived in federal court more than a decade ago,in,when he petitioned for habeas corpus relief.throughout these proceedings,coulter,who is,has been contending that the state use of its peremptory strikes during the jury selection process violated his rights under the equal protection clause of the constitution.see batson kentucky,d.although the jury in coulter criminal trial included three jurors who were,the state used nine of the ten peremptory strikes it exercised to exclude venirepersons.
in,the district court issued coulter a conditional writ and this court affirmed that decision.coulter gramley,coulter gilmore,cir coulter ii.our decision gave the state the choice of releasing him or holding a new batson hearing not surprisingly,it opted for the latter.after that hearing,the state trial court found that the prosecution reasons for its use of peremptory strikes were the state appellate court affirmed.illinois coulter,d,coulter iii.coulter then returned to federal court in,purportedly reinstating his earlier habeas corpus petition.the district court concluded that the batson problem remained and issued the writ,again with a stay designed to permit the state to retry him within days.coulter battaglia,wl,dist.lexis.on july,this court issued a stay of the district court order directing that coulter be released,pending resolution of this appeal.
we conclude that coulter petition must be evaluated under the standards set forth in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.on that basis,we conclude further that while the state court explanation of its findings leaves something to be desired,we can not say that its decision is either contrary to or an unreasonable application of batson.we therefore reverse and remand so that judgment may be entered in favor of warden mccann.
given the lengthy history of this case,a brief summary of the underlying facts and proceedings is in order before addressing the merits of coulter petition.
in,coulter was riding in a car with his two codefendants when the vehicle was stopped by officer michael ridges of prospect heights,illinois,because it had no visible license plates.officer ridges called in the traffic stop.shortly after the stop,another call reported that an officer had been shot at that location.the first officer to respond to the second call found ridges already dead with a bullet wound to the head.investigators found the driver license of one of coulter on the scene.later that day,coulter and his were spotted and pulled over.
coulter was charged with two crimes the murder of ridges and conspiracy to commit the murder of a robert fischer.during the jury selection process for coulter trial,the prosecution exercised ten of its allowed peremptory challenges.of the ten,it used nine to strike prospective jurors.it used the tenth strike against a juror who said that he could not impose the death penalty against a criminal defendant.coulter attorney moved three times for a mistrial on the ground that the state use of peremptory challenges violated the equal protection clause.each time,the trial judge denied the motion.the final jury consisted of eight caucasians,one hispanic and three.the two alternates were also.
at trial,coulter defense centered around his claim that the shooting was an accident that occurred when he slammed the gun on top of the hood of the stopped car after he became angry while talking to ridges.this was not enough to raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the jury,which convicted him.the court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment automatically when the jury did not authorize the death penalty.
on direct appeal,coulter raised his batson claim,among many others.in,the illinois appellate court,while retaining jurisdiction over coulter appeal,ordered the trial court to clarify the record regarding the jury selection process.four months later,in early,the issue was briefed,attorneys appeared again before the trial court,and the trial court concluded that there was no batson violation.when the case returned to the illinois appellate court,it affirmed the trial court even though it viewed the trial court procedure as less than ideal.coulter i,at.the supreme court of illinois denied coulter petition for leave to appeal.illinois coulter.
coulter then successfully petitioned in federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus based on the alleged batson violation.coulter gramley.at.on appeal,we agreed with the district court that the state court had not followed the proper procedure for assessing coulter batson claim.we also found troubling the prosecution stated reasons for striking prospective jurors melvin igess,jeanell hicks,melanie pinkins,and marcina.id.at.in the end,we affirmed the district court judgment,but we modified its order to issue the writ unless within days the state chose to return to state court for a new batson hearing.coulter ii,at.we also described the appropriate methodology for such a hearing 
i n addition to reviewing the reasons given for striking each individual prospective juror,the trial court must consider the totality of the circumstances and compare the prosecutor strikes against against its treatment of similarly situated caucasians.
the state opted for the new batson hearing.in,the state trial court conducted a new hearing,at which it considered all of coulter arguments and assessed on the record some of the reasons given by the prosecution for striking some of the potential jurors in coulter trial.the court concluded that the prosecution reasons for its strikes were credible and not pretextual.the trial court also volunteered its opinion of the prosecutors unhelpful step in this particular case,given the fact that the trial judge had no experience with those individuals as prosecutors in coulter or any other person trial.the supreme court of illinois has allowed the consideration of a prosecutor character in a batson analysis,but in a much more limited way and not at the expense of full consideration of the required factors.see illinois andrews,holding that the trial judge experience with local prosecutors and knowledge of local conditions are relevant factors in a prima facie batson case analysis,but this court has never intimated that such considerations are dispositive of this issue.
on appeal from the trial court reaffirmation of its earlier conclusion that batson was not violated,the state appellate court affirmed.coulter iii,at.the supreme court of illinois again denied coulter leave to appeal.illinois coulter.the supreme court,however,granted coulter petition for certiorari and vacated the state appellate court decision.coulter illinois,d.the court instructed the illinois appellate court to reconsider its decision in light of cockrell,d i.
the state appellate court took up the case again,but it decided that i shed no new light on coulter claims.once again,it held that coulter batson rights had not been violated.illinois coulter,d,coulter iv.meanwhile,coulter state court petition for relief was making its way through the illinois courts,resulting in two additional decisions from the illinois appellate court on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,a remand by the supreme court of illinois,and a denial of certiorari by the supreme court.
on november,after the state courts reached their final decision on the merits of coulter challenges to his batson hearing,coulter filed a motion in federal court asking to reinstate his federal habeas corpus petition.the district court granted the motion,apparently on the assumption that it had never really relinquished jurisdiction over the case during the new round of batson proceedings triggered by the conditional writ issued after coulter ii.this time,coulter argued that he was entitled to relief based not only on batson but also on i and the supreme court subsequent decision in dretke,d ii.the latter decision is the supreme court last word on the use of peremptory strikes against members of a specific race.the district court granted coulter petition,coulter battaglia,wl,dist.lexis at,and the state has appealed.
in batson,the supreme court wrote that t he standard we adopt under the federal constitution is designed to ensure that a state does not use peremptory challenges to strike any black juror because of his race.batson,at.we have interpreted that to mean that the exclusion of even a single prospective juror based on race violates the defendant constitutional rights.splunge clark,cir.
the supreme court decisions in i and ii reaffirmed the court core substantive holding in batson.the court also described succinctly the process for evaluating claims that a prosecutor used peremptory challenges in violation of the equal protection clause 
first,a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race second,if that showing has been made,the prosecution must offer a basis for striking the juror in question third,in light of the parties submissions,the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.
i,at.internal citations omitted.the burden is on the defendant to show that her rights have been violated.id.at.
the trial court must consider all relevant circumstances as it assesses the first step.the batson court elaborated as follows 
for example,a pattern of strikes against black jurors included in the particular venire might give rise to an inference of discrimination.similarly,the prosecutor questions and statements during voir dire examination and in exercising his challenges may support or refute an inference of discriminatory purpose.these examples are merely illustrative.
at.in the end,the defendant must simply present evidence that gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.id.at.
in ii,the court clarified the way in which jurors of different races should be compared.it called for direct comparisons between similarly situated venirepersons of different races.ii,at.the ii court rejected the standard put forth by the dissent in both cases that s imilarly situated does not mean matching any one of several reasons the prosecution gave for striking a potential means matching all of them.id.at.the court explained that 
n one of our cases announces a rule that no comparison is probative unless the situation of the individuals compared is identical in all respects,and there is no reason to accept one a per se rule that a defendant can not win a batson claim unless there is an exactly identical white juror would leave batson inoperable potential jurors are not products of a set of cookie cutters.
id.it is in this pragmatic light that the state court had to assess the potential jurors in coulter case.
at the second step,the prosecutor may set forth any reason for the use of a strike against a prospective juror,even if it is not a persuasive,or even plausible reason.purkett elem,d.as justice breyer noted in his concurrence in ii,under purkett even something as foolish as the notion that mustaches and beards look suspicious could satisfy the second step.at.breyer,concurring quoting purkett,at.the point of batson is to avoid invidious distinctions based on race or other protected characteristics it is not to ensure wise decisions.
the third step requires the court to weigh the evidence and determine whether the prosecution nondiscriminatory reason for the strike is credible or if the defense has shown purposeful discrimination.as the court put it in ii,i f a prosecutor proffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to an nonblack who is permitted to serve,that is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination to be considered at batson third step.ii,at.
the ii court also had before it evidence that the local prosecutor office had used a particular process to manipulate the racial composition of the jury in the past.id.at.this is different,we note,from a judge personal testimonial to the character of the state attorney in a particular case,which seems to be what happened here.at no point in batson,i,or ii did the court endorse anything like this.we realize that judges need to make credibility determinations,but it is very troubling to base such decisions on personal relationships outside of the courtroom.i provides the better way in which to approach the credibility question,by calling for an assessment of how reasonable,or how improbable,the prosecutor explanations are and whether the proffered rationale has some basis in accepted trial strategy.i,at.
although we assessed coulter claim under the version of the last time this case was before us in coulter ii,and the parties have not challenged that approach,we have concluded that circumstances have changed enough at this stage that the correct law to apply is the standard.coulter original petition was filed before aedpa effective date april,and that is the petition that was before us in.as a result of our decision,however,a conditional writ of habeas corpus issued.as of that time,there was nothing pending before either this court or the district court.there is no authority in the habeas corpus statute for a federal court to remand or transfer a proceeding to the competent state court.this would have been clear if the state had decided to allow coulter to go free.it would also have been clear if the state court had concluded after the hearing that batson was violated the state court then would have been entitled to order a new trial for coulter.it is just as true in the situation that unfolded,in which the state accepted the option of holding a new batson hearing,and the state court decided that coulter conviction could stand.when coulter returned to federal court in november,there was nothing to reinstate.what he filed was in substance a new petition for a writ of habeas corpus from the new holding.we note that this was not a successive petition,because he was challenging a new ruling of the state court.since he filed the new petition long after april,his case falls under the current version of.
as the supreme court noted in carey musladin,d,an application for a writ of habeas corpus may not be granted to a state prisoner whose claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state court either reached a decision that was contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or it unreasonably applied such a law.id.at see d.citing williams taylor,d,the court also underscored the fact that clearly established federal law in d refers to the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of this court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision,at.at.
even if the batson hearing that the state court undertook in response to our conditional grant of the writ was flawed,there can be no doubt that this was the option the state chose.when coulter challenged the outcome through his new petition for habeas corpus relief,the federal district court was free to evaluate the state court proceeding on the merits though,as we have just said,this should have been done with the aedpa standards in mind.if the ultimate conclusion of the state court was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,batson,then coulter would be entitled to another the usual one in which the state is given the choice between release and a full retrial.if the outcome of the state court proceedings meets the standards set forth in,as interpreted by the supreme court of the united states,then coulter petition must be denied.our review of the district court judgment in coulter favor is de novo,since we are assessing as a matter of law the question whether the state court stayed within the generous boundaries that aedpa establishes.
in his brief to this court,coulter claims that his rights were violated because prospective jurors were excused for reasons that applied with equal force to who were not excused.he focuses on three of the prospective jurors whom the prosecutors struck,melvin igess,melanie pinkins,and marcina adams,to demonstrate the prosecution purposeful discrimination.although the state argues th
