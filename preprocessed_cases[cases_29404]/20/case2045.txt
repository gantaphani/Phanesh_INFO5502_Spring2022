reuben adams was committed to the custody of the wisconsin department of health and social services after a jury found him eligible for confinement pursuant to the state sexually violent person commitments statute.stat.ch.adams then petitioned for a writ of federal habeas corpus,see,but the district court denied relief.we affirm.
background 
adams history of sexual misconduct dates back to,when he received a probationary sentence after being convicted of sexual assault on a girl.eight years later adams was arrested again after he engaged in repeated sexual acts with his stepdaughter.for that offense he pleaded guilty to sexual assault of a child and was sentenced to four years in prison.adams extensive criminal history also includes nonsexual offenses such as robbery,intimidation of a witness,battery,and burning and damaging property.almost all of his offenses involved female victims.
in august the state of wisconsin filed a petition alleging that adams was eligible for confinement pursuant to the sexually violent person commitments statute.stat.ch.chapter requires the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the subject of the petition is a sexually violent person,which is defined as a person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense,has been adjudicated delinquent for a sexually violent offense,or has been found not guilty of or not responsible for a sexually violent offense by reason of insanity or mental disease,defect or illness,and who is dangerous because he or she suffers from a mental disorder that makes it substantially probable that the person will engage in acts of sexual violence.stat.a mental disorder is defined in turn as a congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes a person to engage in acts of sexual violence.id.
in april a milwaukee county circuit judge held,like many had before her,that chapter was facially unconstitutional and thus dismissed the state petition.see state post,abrahamson,dissenting noting that approximately of the wisconsin circuit court judges who had considered the constitutionality of chapter had found the statute invalid.the wisconsin court of appeals summarily reversed,however,based on intervening wisconsin supreme court decisions that upheld chapter against constitutional challenge.see post,state carpenter.on remand a jury trial was held during which the state presented the testimony of two expert witnesses kenneth diamond,a senior staff psychologist for the wisconsin department of corrections,and ronald sindberg,a psychiatrist at mendota mental health institute.diamond testified that adams suffers from antisocial personality disorder apd,which is generally characterized by impulsiveness,inability to show remorse,and inability to learn from experience.this diagnosis,coupled with adams long and chronic history of sexual violence against females,his refusal to participate in sex offender treatment programs,and the fact that his time in prison had not changed his behavior,led diamond to conclude that adams was a risk and it highly probable that he would recommit and reoffend.thus,in diamond opinion,adams qualified as a sexually violent person under chapter.
sindberg did not personally examine adams because adams refused to be interviewed by him but,after reviewing the medical records,concurred with diamond diagnosis of apd.sindberg testified that adams had no remorse and was indifferent to the fact that he had sexually assaulted others.then,based on his evaluation of risk factors,sindberg concluded that there was a substantial probability that adams will reoffend or recommit a sexually violent act.substantial probability,according to sindberg,meant much more probable than not.
at the conclusion of trial,during which adams did not present any expert testimony of his own,the jury found that adams met the criteria for commitment as a sexually violent person under chapter.adams appealed,claiming among other things that chapter was unconstitutional as applied because antisocial personality disorder is too imprecise a category to pass due process muster.in re adams.the wisconsin court of appeals rejected his argument 
t he fact that antisocial personality disorder,standing alone without any other diagnosis or evidence,could never lead to a finding that a defendant,without a history of sex offenses,is a sexually violent person,does not mean that that condition,in combination with evidence satisfying the additional criteria of,can not constitutionally support that finding it is that additional coupling that,in justice kennedy words,offer s a solid basis for concluding that civil detention is justified.
id.at quoting kansas hendricks,d kennedy,concurring.thus,the court held,the inclusion of antisocial personality disorder as,potentially,a condition qualifying as a mental disorder under the statute does not render the statute unconstitutionally imprecise.id.at.
adams also urged the appeals court to find the evidence insufficient because neither of the state experts gave testimony that would allow the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he was substantially likely to commit another sexually violent offense.id.the court rejected this argument as well 
the evidence,largely undisputed,included information about adams history of sexually violent crimes,history of crimes and antisocial behavior,failures under supervision,denial of responsibility,refusal to participate in sexual assault treatment programs and treatment programs,and his sexual offense recidivism.further,the psychologists testimony was more supportive of the state position than adams claims.diamond testified that adams is a risk and it highly probable that he would recommit and reoffend.sindberg testified that,based on his evaluation of risk factors,there was a substantial probability that adams will reoffend or recommit a sexually violent act,and that,in his analysis,he considered substantial probability to mean much more probable than not.
thus,as the state argues,the psychologists testimony,standing alone,may very well have satisfied the standard.unquestionably,however,their testimony in combination with the other evidence provided a sufficient basis for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that adams is dangerous because he suffers from a mental disorder that renders him substantially probable to engage in acts of sexual violence.
id.at.footnote omitted.the wisconsin supreme court denied adams petition for review.
in march adams petitioned for federal habeas corpus under,alleging that his commitment violated due process.the district court appointed counsel for adams and ordered briefing plus supplemental briefing following the supreme court decision in kansas crane,d.in august the court denied adams petition but granted him a certificate of appealability on the following issues 
whether the state court of appeals decision rejecting the petitioner due process challenge to his commitment under chapter of the wisconsin statutes was an unreasonable application of kansas hendricks,d or foucha louisiana,d and 
w hat impact,if any,kansas crane,d,has on the analysis of the petitioner constitutional claims.
ii.discussion 
for adams to obtain federal habeas corpus relief,he must show that the wisconsin court of appeals decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court.d.the state court ruling must be objectively unreasonable,which means something more than just incorrect or erroneous.lockyer andrade,d.
the essence of adams claim is that it is a violation of due process to civilly commit a person based solely on the fact that he is a previously convicted sex offender with apd.according to adams,that is precisely what wisconsin is doing in his case,in contravention of both foucha and hendricks.in response the state asserts that adams was confined not only because he committed prior crimes and because he has apd,but also because the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he is dangerous beyond his control
