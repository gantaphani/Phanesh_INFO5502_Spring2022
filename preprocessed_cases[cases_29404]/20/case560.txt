respondent christopher artuz,superintendent of green haven correctional facility,dutchess county,new york,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york nina gershon,judge granting petitioner eric jenkins petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.in granting jenkins petition,the district court engaged in de novo review because it concluded that the appellate division,second department,of the new york supreme court had not,on direct appeal,adjudicated the federal constitutional claim on the merits under d.subsequent to judge gershon decision,however,we clarified the meaning of adjudicated on the merits.see sellan kuhlman,cir.we hold that under sellan,jenkins claim was adjudicated on the merits,and the more deferential standard of review set forth at d therefore applies to the state court decision.we hold nonetheless that the writ should issue because the appellate division denial of jenkins federal due process claim relating to the use of false testimony against him was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states.
background 
at about on april,michael reese was killed by gunshot wounds inflicted on him while he stood at or near a shelter on guy brewer boulevard in the borough of queens,new york.on may,police arrested jenkins and charged him with the killing.
state court proceedings 
a.the suppression hearing and the first trial 
in a march,pretrial hearing,jenkins moved to suppress identification testimony from two potential witnesses,garvey napoleon and rollie carter.new york supreme court justice john leahy rejected jenkins motions without explanation.
jenkins proceeded to trial before supreme court justice joseph rosenzweig on may.on may,queens county assistant district attorney ada solomon landa,who was prosecuting jenkins case,entered into an oral plea agreement with a prosecution witness,david morgan,who was to testify later that day.morgan had been arrested twice for selling crack cocaine in a matter unrelated to the jenkins case and had been charged with possession thereof with intent to sell.under the agreement,morgan accepted six months imprisonment and five years probation.later that day,in court,jenkins counsel objected that he had not been warned of morgan plea bargain.justice rosenzweig declared a mistrial the following day based on ada landa prosecutorial misconduct in hold ing back exculpatory information that is,morgan plea as long as possible from defense counsel.
b.the second trial 
ada therese lendino replaced landa as the prosecutor in the case.on september,jenkins second trial began before supreme court justice william giaccio.lendino acknowledged to the court at the trial outset that the state and morgan had entered a plea agreement,as a condition of which he had agreed to cooperate and testify truthfully and fully,and that she expect ed it w ould come out on direct examination.
the state presented eight witnesses,six of whom provided no evidence directly linking jenkins to reese murder.four police,ritter,casella,and about the crime scene and the gathering of evidence.medical examiner josette montas testified as to the cause of death.and reese mother testified as to her identification of the body.
garvey napoleon also testified for the prosecution.he gave a purported eyewitness account of the murder,saying that at the time of the killing he was talking to his girlfriend using a pay phone on guy brewer boulevard across from where reese stood at the bus stop.napoleon testified that he saw jenkins,accompanied by two others,approach reese and shoot him.
napoleon testimony contained a number of inconsistencies.for example,napoleon gave two different names for his and jennifer.he also alternated between saying he had and had not been speaking to her at the moment when morgan was shot.he also failed at first to report seeing jenkins gun.finally,at the first trial,he claimed to have walked across guy brewer boulevard toward reese body after the shooting,but denied doing so at the second trial.
david morgan then testified for the prosecution.he said that the day before the murder he had witnessed a fight between jenkins nephew,cecil saddler,and the murder victim,reese.morgan testified that jenkins later approached morgan and asked about reese,and that jenkins stated that he was sick of people bothering his nephew.morgan also testified that he learned of the murder soon after it occurred,found the victim mother,and brought her to the murder scene.
in the course of direct examination,ada lendino asked morgan no questions about his plea agreement with the state as she had previously suggested she would.during the defense counsel,however,morgan falsely denied its existence 
q and before you testified,your attorney and landa the prosecutor in the first trial worked out a deal is that correct 
a no,that is not correct.
q that not correct 
q did you and your attorney work out a deal that for these two class b felonies you were going to take a plea is that right 
q that not true 
a no,it not.
q before you testified in the proceedings on may,you were promised and got an offer from the assistant district attorney landa that if you pled guilty to those charges you would get six months in jail and probation 
before morgan could answer,ada lendino objected that the question had been a sked and answered.the court overruled the objection,and defense counsel continued 
q that was a deal you worked out 
a it was no deal.that what they offered me.
q that the first time you got an offer on these two charges 
a no,it was.i had got a three months and a yo youthful offender status the first time.
q you mean on the first case.
a no.they put them together and that what they gave me and i had took sic it to court and they gave me six months and five years they gave me six months and five years probation.
q on both charges 
a yes.and i took that.
q but you got that offer while you were in this building,in this court,on may.
a no,i did.
q do you recall in may of that you were sworn to tell the truth in these proceedings 
q and do you remember being asked certain questions and giving certain answers 
q and you were sworn to tell the truth.do you remember being asked this question question okay,now did i tell you today in the presence of your lawyer what kind of deal you would get answer yes.do you recall being asked that question and giving that answer 
a when i was in here before,i was nervous 
q do you recall being asked that question and giving that answer,sir 
a yes,i guess so.i forgot really.
q i have no further questions.
on redirect examination,ada lendino did not seek to correct her witness testimony about the existence of a plea agreement.instead,she reenforced the impression that no agreement existed 
q david,have i ever met with you before today 
q did you make any deals with me 
the prosecution then rested.
alnita saddler and her former husband cecil saddler testified for the defense.they said that they were with jenkins in alnita apartment on the night that reese was killed,celebrating their son cecil saddler,birthday.they admitted,however,that jenkins and their son left for alabama a week after jenkins was questioned by police about reese murder.defense counsel also called a telephone company employee who testified that the pay phone at the crime scene where napoleon asserted he had received a call from his girlfriend could not receive calls.finally,defense counsel called two police detectives,and gibbons,to attempt to show contradictions in napoleon and morgan testimony.
later,in the course of her summation,ada lendino reminded the jury of morgan testimony on the absence of a deal between them.she stated that morgan sold drugs twice,he got arrested,he pleaded guilty,he went to jail.never met me before he testified,never made a deal with me.ada lendino posed a series of rhetorical questions about morgan motives why should david lie what is the motive for david to lie you did hear anything about any bad blood between david and the defendant.why lie if there no reason to lie jenkins counsel failed either to object or to raise morgan plea agreement in his summation.instead,defense counsel impugned morgan credibility by describing him as a drug dealer.
the jury convicted jenkins of murder in the second degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the second decree.see penal law.he received concurrent prison sentences of fifteen years to life for the murder conviction,and three to nine years for the weapons possession conviction.
state appellate proceedings 
before the appellate division,jenkins claimed,inter alia,that he had been denied due process by the state failure to correct morgan false testimony,that his right to confront witnesses had been abrogated,and that his right to effective assistance of counsel had been denied.in his brief,jenkins cited napue illinois,d,as support for the proposition that his due process rights had been violated.napue addresses the federal constitutional implications of a witness false testimony that the state did not promise leniency in exchange for his truthful testimony.in dismissing all of jenkins claims,however,the appellate division discussed only jenkins claim of impermissibly suggestive identification.the court dismissed jenkins remaining claims,including prosecutorial misconduct,simply by denying them as without merit.people jenkins,dep t.leave to appeal to the court of appeals was denied.people jenkins,smith.the appellate division thereafter dismissed jenkins petition for a writ of coram nobis claiming ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.people jenkins,dep t.
ii.federal habeas corpus proceedings 
on january,jenkins,acting pro se,filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.in his petition,he contended that napoleon identification testimony was tainted by impermissibly suggestive pretrial identification procedures his appellate counsel was ineffective for not arguing ineffective assistance of trial counsel on the basis of his failure to reopen the pretrial suppression hearing he was denied the right to confront witnesses and effective assistance of trial counsel by the trial court curtailment of defense counsel of napoleon and the ada failure to correct morgan false testimony about his plea bargain and her reinforcement of this testimony constituted prosecutorial misconduct in violation of his fourteenth amendment right to due process.judge gershon appointed counsel to brief the fourth claim.
in its opinion on jenkins direct appeal,as we have noted,the appellate division did not discuss the issue of prosecutorial misconduct.under the rule of washington schriver,cir,the district court held that the appellate division had therefore not adjudicated jenkins federal constitutional due process claim on the merits and that the rule of deference to state court determinations of federal constitutional issues contained in d was thus inapplicable.the district court therefore reviewed the issue de novo.it concluded that ada lendino behavior during the second trial was improper and,when considered cumulatively,severe,insofar as the prosecutor failed to correct morgan omission from his testimony of his plea bargain with ada landa.jenkins artuz,op.at may.the court also concluded that lendino engaged in a pattern of misconduct that was designed to conceal the existence of that same cooperation agreement during that trial.id.at.the court declined to find that defense counsel failure to respond to these errors required dismissal of the petition.rather,the court held that it was merely one factor to be taken into consideration,particularly because the record suggested that jenkins counsel did not know the plea agreement details.id.at.finally,the court observed that justice giaccio knew of the plea bargain but failed to address the issue,and that absent morgan testimony,only weakly probative evidence against jenkins remained.id.
the district court granted the writ on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct.the respondent now appeals.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of a writ of habeas corpus de novo.lurie wittner,cir maldonado scully,cir.but w e review a district court factual findings for clear error.morris reynolds,cir.
ii.the standard of review of state court judgments in habeas proceedings 
jenkins habeas corpus petition is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,because he filed his petition after april,the aedpa effective date.see pavel hollins,cir.the aedpa states in pertinent part 
an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states 
the aedpa place d a new constraint on the power of a federal habeas court to grant a state prisoner application for a writ of habeas corpus,but only with respect to claims adjudicated on the merits in state court.williams taylor,d opinion of.when the district court entered judgment in the instant case,washington schriver,cir,provided this court definition of adjudicated on the merits.under this version of schriver,deference to a state appellate court was only due when it,for example,discuss ed or at least cite d supreme court case law or state court decisions which refer to federal law.id.at.subsequently,after the decision by the district court in the case now before us,we withdrew that version of schriver and substituted a new opinion in which we declined to reach the issue of d standard of review because nothing turn ed on it.washington schriver,cir concluding that irrespective of whether or not deferential review applied,the district court properly denied the writ.
two months later,we revisited this issue.we decided that a state court adjudicates a claim on the merits when it disposes of the claim on the merits,and reduces its disposition to judgment even if the state court does not explicitly refer to either the federal claim or to relevant federal case law.sellan kuhlman,cir.to determine whether a state court disposition is on the merits,we ask what the state courts have done in similar cases whether the history of the case suggests that the state court was aware of any ground for not adjudicating the case on the merits and whether the state court opinion suggests reliance upon procedural grounds rather than a determination on the merits.id.at quoting mercadel cain,cir accord morris,at.
the appellate division dismissed jenkins assertions under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,including the claim of prosecutorial misconduct,as without merit.jenkins,at,at.in sellan,we found that an even more concise appellate division word denied triggered aedpa deference.sellan,at.the appellate division in this case therefore adjudicated the due process question on the merits.because it also reduced its ruling to judgment,we apply aedpa deference to its decision.
iii.clearly established federal law 
initially,we must determine whether jenkins claim is based on federal law clearly established by the supreme court.sellan,at see also williams,at.opinion of stevens,asking whether application of a particular rule is dictated by a supreme court decision internal quotation marks omitted.we are constrained to apply clearly established federal law,as determined by the holdings,not dicta,of the united states supreme court.morris,at.
the district court premised its grant of the writ upon two supreme court holdings that indeed suffice to meet the clearly established law standard of.first,it relied upon darden wainwright,d,for the proposition that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment is violated when prosecutorial misconduct so infect s the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.id.at.quoting donnelly dechristoforo,d internal quotation marks omitted.second,it relied upon napue illinois,d,which holds that a conviction obtained through use of false evidence,including evidence going to a witness credibility known to be such by representatives of the state,must fall under the fourteenth amendment.we also note that the supreme court has established that only evidence material under brady maryland,d,that could in any reasonable likelihood affect the judgment of the jury precipitates due process scrutiny.giglio united states,d quoting napue,at.internal quotation marks omitted accord mills scully,cir.
iv.the unreasonable application standard 
habeas corpus relief under is warranted only when the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from the supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case or the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from supreme court precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.williams,at.opinion of.in asking whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively unreasonable,id.at,we search for s ome increment of incorrectness beyond error.francis stone,cir.this increment need not be great otherwise,habeas relief would be limited to state court decisions so far off the mark as to suggest judicial incompetence.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
we conclude for reasons stated below that jenkins has indeed identified an unreasonable application of federal law in the appellate division denial of relief under napue and giglio.we thus need not address whether what the district court recognized to be the more stringent standard of darden and donnelly would be met under aedpa deference to the appellate division decision.
v.the unreasonable application of napue and giglio 
d eliberate deception of a court and jurors by the presentation of known false evidence is incompatible with rudimentary demands of justice.giglio,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted accord united states agurs,d t he supreme court has consistently held that a conviction obtained by the knowing use of perjured testimony is fundamentally unfair,and must be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.internal citations omitted napue,at.a conviction obtained through use of false evidence,known to be such by representatives of the state,must fall under the fourteenth amendment.citations omitted mooney holohan.condemning deliberate deception of court and jury by the presentation of testimony known to be perjured brady,at.noting that nondisclosure by a prosecutor violates due process when the suppressed evidence is material to guilt.
the principle that a state may not knowingly use false evidence,including false testimony,to obtain a tainted conviction,implicit in any concept of ordered liberty,does not cease to apply merely because the false testimony goes only to the credibility of the witness.the jury estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence,and it is upon such subtle factors as the possible interest of the witness in testifying falsely that a defendant life or liberty may depend.
the appellate division unreasonably applied these holdings because the prosecution knowing use of morgan false testimony could reasonably have affected the trial outcome.any doubts we might have about the existence of an increment of incorrectness beyond error,francis,at,are eliminated by ada lendino summation,which placed the state credibility behind morgan untruthful testimony.
morgan cross examination and 
napue involved a witness who had falsely testified that he had been promised no consideration for his testimony.napue,at.the witness testified falsely that a prosecutor had not promised to recommend a reduction of his already imposed sentence.id.at.
the case at bar presents similar facts.while we can not determine on the record before us precise details of morgan plea or the underlying crimes to which he pled,the respondent concedes that an agreement was made and,of course,that it knew of the agreement during the second trial.on cross examination,morgan denied any deal with the state 
q and before you testified,your attorney and landa the prosecutor in the first trial worked out a deal is that correct 
a no,that is not correct.
only when confronted with his previous testimony did morgan concede the plea existence,but still he maintained it was no deal,only what they offered me.that tepid admission tended more to preclude than to suggest a quid pro quo exchange of testimony for leniency.reasonable jurors would have had to make a considerable inferential leap to conclude from that exchange that morgan testimony was the subject of a bargain with the state.we think it far more likely that jurors would have concluded that jenkins counsel tried but failed to establish that a deal had been made.the respondent suggestion on appeal that jenkins counsel effectively drew forth the plea agreement existence is without support.
ada lendino did nothing to correct this false impression.to the contrary,she further misled the jury.during,she sought to foreclose defense counsel inquiry into the plea agreement by objecting on the ground that his questions about it had already been asked and answered.on redirect examination,her questions,while eliciting technically accurate testimony,were phrased so as to reenforce the false impression that no deal had been made 
q david,have i ever met with you before today 
q did you make any deals with me 
that testimony was probably true but surely misleading.ada lendino did not follow up by eliciting testimony that although morgan had made no deal with her,he had indeed reached one with another member of the district attorney office.as the district court correctly observed,the jury was left with the mistaken impression that morgan had no cooperation agreement with the state jenkins,op.at.
b.the prosecutor summation 
standing alone,a prosecutor comments upon summation can so infect a trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.darden,at.quoting donnelly,at.internal quotation marks omitted see also mills,at t here may be a deprivation of due process if the prosecutor reinforces the deception by capitalizing on it in closing argument.the darden court declined to find so fatal a flaw in the proceedings it reviewed,in part because the prosecutor argument there did not manipulate or misstate the evidence,and in part because the prosecutor objectionable the defendant as an animal and wishing that he had been shot during the invited by or were responsive to the opening summation of the defense.at.see also united states young,d explaining the invited response rule.
ada lendino,by contrast,bolstered morgan credibility in the course of her summation by falsely suggesting the absence of a deal between morgan and the prosecution.he sold drugs twice,he got arrested,he pleaded guilty,he went to jail.never met me before he testified,never made a deal with me.noting that there was no bad blood between morgan and the defendant,she asked the jury to conclude that morgan had no reason to lie.that a statement standing alone is factually correct obviously does not mean that it can not mislead based on the natural and reasonable inferences it invites.ada lendino attempt to hide morgan plea agreement from the jury and to use the false impression of its absence to bolster his credibility leaves us with no doubt that her behavior violated jenkins due process rights.
we need not determine whether ada lendino summation independently abridged jenkins due process rights.it plainly sharpened the prejudice resulting from the use of morgan initial untruthful testimony.the advocacy shown in the record at hand has no place in the administration of justice and should neither be permitted nor rewarded young,at.
c.the cumulative effect of false testimony 
there is a reasonable likelihood that morgan false testimony affected the judgment of the jury.agurs,at.as the district court noted,morga
