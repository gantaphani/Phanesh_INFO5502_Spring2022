during the second trial,the prosecution made three statements concerning petitioner failure to testify in his closing argument.the prosecutor stated 
again these are his words.and the words that you heard from these folks supplied by him are unrefuted,and they are uncontroverted.there has been no evidence offered to say that these people are incorrect.none at all.
the prosecution asserted that with respect to the source of the cyanide,the defendant had no less than three occasions to tell the police that he had ordered the cyanide.last,the prosecutor stated 
ladies and gentlemen,we do have to tell you how it was introduced into her system.we know that it was ingested.and there is only one person that can tell you how it was introduced,and that the defendant.

ii.substantive facts 
this court relies on the facts as they were found by the state appellate court on direct review.see,bell bell,cir see also e in a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court,a determination of a factual issue made by a state court shall be presumed to be correct.the applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.in this case,the facts as stated by the ohio court of appeals are as follows 
d efendant and decedent lived in a house that adjoined the funeral home where defendant worked as a funeral director and embalmer.on the morning of september,defendant and several others began driving back from chicago to parma after having assisted in moving defendant brother.decedent remained at home,being scheduled to work at noon that day.when she did not arrive at work on time,a coworker telephoned the funeral home and expressed her concern over decedent unusual tardiness.a funeral home employee noticed decedent car in the driveway,so he checked the house.the employee found the screen door open and called into the house.when decedent failed to respond,he entered the house and discovered her body slumped over in the bathtub.
the police found no evidence of foul play nor any obvious sign of suicide.a razor floating on the bath water,a hot curling iron resting on a nearby dressing table,and the couples dog roaming in the yard led the police to conclude that decedent had died suddenly while bathing.because the police could not readily determine a cause of death,they transported the body to the coroner office for an autopsy.
during the autopsy,the coroner office noted no obvious cause of death.the coroner did find an undigested meal of pasta salad in decedent stomach,and recognized lividity or reddening of the skin which would typically be found in a person exposed to carbon monoxide.carbon monoxide testing,however,showed no significant levels.the coroner listed no cause of death.
around september,defendant telephoned the police and told them that he had found a note,by decedent,which might explain her death.the undated note stated,i hate cleveland.i hate my job.i hate myself.defendant explained that he found the note underneath some papers in his brief case.he told police that decedent had been despondent over their recent move to the cleveland area.she had difficulty finding work and worried that she had a weight problem.defendant also told the police that decedent suffered three miscarriages and had been trying to come to grips with the thought that she might not be able to bear children.
at about the same time,the coroner ordered department toxicologists to perform additional tests on body fluids taken from decedent,specifically asking them to detect the presence of any poisons.an initial test for the presence of potassium cyanide had to be discarded when the toxicologist discovered that reagents used in the testing process had been compromised.new reagents were obtained and the toxicologist obtained a positive result for cyanide at about twice the minimum lethal dose.the coroner verified this result by asking the franklin county coroner office to test for the presence of cyanide by using a different methodology.the franklin county coroner obtained virtually identical results.the coroner then listed the cause of death as homicide.
the police returned to defendant house and executed a search warrant,pointedly telling defendant that they were looking for cyanide or other poisons.defendant cooperated with the search,but the police found nothing.the police questioned the funeral home operators about the possible use of cyanide in the embalming process,but found no evidence that the funeral home had received cyanide from any of its suppliers.a funeral home director later recalled a conversation with defendant in which they discussed how the police investigated funeral home supply shipments for deliveries containing cyanide and defendant said,that is not where i got it from.
the evidence did not show that the police had any suspects until they broadcast a plea for assistance with a television crime watch service.as a result of that broadcast,defendant commanding officer in the army reserves came forward in january with information that she had sent defendant two grams of potassium cyanide.she explained that defendant knew that she worked as a chemist in her civilian job and that in the spring of,he asked her if she could supply him with a small amount of cyanide for use in controlling groundhogs on his property.the commanding officer did not immediately send the cyanide.she later discovered that defendant had left his business card on her desk.a notation on the card,in defendant handwriting stated,thank you for your help.in the lower corner of the card defendant wrote kcn,the chemical abbreviation for potassium cyanide.the card reminded the commanding officer of defendant request,so she sent a couple of grams of cyanide to the funeral home address listed on defendant business card.the commanding officer explained that she came forward with the information after learning that defendant wife had died as a result of cyanide poisoning.
when confronted with evidence that he had obtained cyanide,defendant told the police that he had used the cyanide to control groundhogs on the property.a funeral home employee,however,insisted that he had no knowledge of a groundhog problem,and produced records showing that squirrels were the only pest control problem on the property.the city pest control officer stated that he had no complaints about groundhogs.a representative from a pest control company conceded that cyanide might have been used for pest control well in the past,but that in ten years of business,she had not used any products containing cyanide.
other persons came forward with information that soon corroborated police suspicion on defendant.a business associate recalled a conversation in which defendant abruptly interrupted her to ask if she could show him the measurement of a gram.when the business associate asked why he needed this information,defendant said that he needed to measure some medicine for his dog food.defendant veterinarian,however,stated that he prescribed no medication for the dog that would require any kind of measuring.
a colleague at the funeral home described a conversation in which he said that defendant had told him that decedent committed suicide.when the colleague wondered how decedent could procure cyanide,defendant responded that she probably got it down on west street where she worked because she came in contact with a lot of low lifes.in a subsequent conversation,the colleague again wondered how decedent could have obtained the cyanide,and this time defendant said,someone at the coroner office probably spilled some of it because they keep it there.
another funeral home colleague testified that when the ambulance came to transport decedent body,defendant yelled to the drivers that they should take the body to parma general hospital.the police learned that defendant had previously worked for the lorain county coroner.his experience there would tell him that all deaths occurring without any known natural cause would ordinarily be investigated by the coroner office,which ordinarily performed more complete autopsies than hospitals.
the police also began to question decedent motivation to commit suicide.several close friends told the police that they had spoken with decedent shortly before her death and found her in good spirits.the friends found nothing unusual about her behavior and noted that decedent was looking forward to moving into a house she and defendant recently purchased.one friend did,however,say that she had met with defendant shortly before decedent death and he told her that decedent was depressed about living in cleveland.this statement contradicted the friend perceptions.just three days before her conversation with defendant,the friend spent the weekend with decedent and defendant and found nothing unusual about decedent demeanor.
the state settled on two factors motivating the murder.first,it discovered that defendant had had a fitful affair with another woman who would not continue the affair as long as defendant remained married.defendant and the woman first became involved for a short period in,but the woman broke off the affair because she had discovered defendant lying about his marital status with a previous wife.the affair resumed briefly in either or,but ended shortly by mutual agreement.it resumed again in february.defendant told the woman that he was married,but that he and his wife were divorcing and expected to finalize the divorce in july.the intimate portion of their relationship ended in late may,although they remained in contact for several more months.defendant stipulated that he was not a party to any divorce action.
defendant called this woman shortly after decedent death and informed her that decedent had died from an aneurysm.they spoke twice thereafter and,in the early part of october,the woman received an early morning telephone call from defendant in which he said,miss bethea,this is robert girts.we have to put the decorating of my house on hold.something really bizarre has happened.when the woman asked what happened,defendant replied,i being investigated for my wife death.he then hung up.the woman found this conversation unusual because defendant had never referred to her as miss and because,while she had worked as an interior designer,she had not discussed decorating the interior of defendant house.
the woman then called the police and informed them of her conversation with defendant.defendant telephoned her late that evening.when he heard that she had telephoned the police and that they would be coming to question her,he said there was no harm in her doing design work for him and she should be brief during questioning.
the second motivating factor arose from defendant financial status.defendant stipulated that he had received just over as proceeds from life insurance policies taken on decedent life.the state tied this money to defendant purchase of a house and his desire to invest and become a silent partner in another funeral home.
defendant case consisted primarily of evidence showing that he had been in chicago at the time of decedent death a fact the state did not dispute and expert testimony rebutting the state findings relating to the manner and cause of death.
defendant testified that she ate from a bowl of pasta salad she had found in defendant refrigerator and suffered no ill effects.
defendant expert testified that he would have listed the cause of death as undetermined because in his opinion the level of cyanide found in decedent body did not correspond with the classic signs of cyanide poisoning that he would have expected to find.the expert testified that cyanide basically poisons all the cells in the body to the point where they can not use oxygen.because the cells can not use oxygen,the blood becomes superoxygenated,thus giving the body its reddish appearance.the cyanide victim can breathe,but nonetheless experiences the sensation and effects of asphyxiation.the onset of cyanide poisoning is marked by dizziness or faintness with rapid breathing.convulsions,palpitations,or seizures may follow before the victim falls into a coma and dies.
the outward indicia of cyanide ingestion include burning around the mouth and throat area,uniform lividity of other major internal organs,petechiae or small bleeding points usually found in the stomach,involuntary release of both urine and fecal matter,and collection of fluid in the lungs.of these signs,only the lividity and collection of fluid in the lungs were present.the expert thought that the lividity and collection of fluid,however,could be explained by other factors,such as the immediate refrigeration of the body after being taken from warm water.
discussion 
standard of review 
in a habeas corpus proceeding,this court reviews the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.miskel karnes,cir citation omitted.
ii.legal framework 
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,a writ of habeas corpus petition may be granted if a state court decision 
was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.the supreme court has found that 
a decision involves an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from th e supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case.second,a decision also involves an unreasonable application of th e supreme court precedent if the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from our precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.
williams taylor,d citation omitted see also early packer,d hill hofbauer,cir.
a federal court is generally barred from considering an issue of federal law arising from the judgment of a state court if the state judgment rests on a ground that is both independent of the merits of the federal claim and an adequate basis for the state court decision.frazier huffman,cir quoting harris reed,d see also coleman thompson,d.in general,a federal court may not consider a claim for habeas corpus relief if the claim was procedurally defaulted in state,if the last state court to render a judgment in the case rejected the claim because it was not presented in accordance with the state procedural rules.yukins,cir citing harris,at.
a procedurally defaulted claim may be considered in federal habeas corpus proceedings only if the petitioner either shows cause for his failure to comply with the state procedural rules and prejudice resulting from the alleged violation of federal law or shows that the federal court refusal to consider the claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.id.quoting coleman,at.the district court application of the cause and prejudice rules must be reviewed de novo.id.citing lucas,cir.
to determine whether a claim has been procedurally defaulted,this court applies a test 
first,the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner claim and that the petitioner failed to comply with the rule second,the court must decide whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction third,the court must decide whether the state procedural forfeiture is an adequate and independent state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim once the court determines that a state procedural rule was not complied with and that the rule was an adequate and independent state ground,then the petitioner must demonstrate that there was cause for him to not follow the procedural rule and that he was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.

iii.procedural default 
adequate and independent state ground 
this court has found that a procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on either direct or habeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case clearly and expressly states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar.harris,at.citation omitted.to constitute an adequate and independent state procedural rule,a rule must be firmly established and regularly followed,and can not rely on federal law.smith ohio dep t of rehab,cir.i f it fairly appears that the state court rested its decision primarily on federal law,this court may reach the federal question on review unless the state court opinion contains a plain statement that its decision rests upon adequate and independent state grounds.harris,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also clinkscale carter,cir bowling parker,cir.
in clinkscale,a case where the state court decision did not clearly and expressly indicate reliance on a state procedural rule,this court found that 
a lthough the decision unquestionably mention ed the state procedural rule and its requirements,it also emphasize d and relie d upon the fact that petitioner ineffective assistance claim had already been raised on direct appeal.
at.this court held that i t was unclear on what ground,or grounds,the state court judgment rested,and that u nder th ose circumstances,this court is unable to say that the state court decision clearly and expressly states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar.id.quoting harris,at.the court concluded that the claim was not procedurally defaulted and addressed the merits of the claim.
similarly,in bowling,this court found that t he language used by the state court in its opinion reveal ed that it did not clearly rely on petitioner procedural default to dismiss the claims raised in his supplemental motion.at.after noting that the claims were raised only in the struck supplemental pleadings,the state court in bowling consider ed the merits of those claims,stating,notwithstanding that his supplemental motion was struck by the trial court,in the interest of judicial economy we will review the seven additional claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised in the motion.id.citation omitted.this court found that the state court opinion was ambiguous and vague with respect to the procedural bar,and proceeded to consider the petitioner claims on the merits.the court found that there must be unambiguous reliance on a procedural default for it to block our review.id.citing gall parker,cir see also harris,at.noting the fact that the state court clearly went on to reject the federal claim on the merits makes it less clear that the state court actually relied on the procedural bar.if the adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the state court opinion,this court may presume that there is no independent and adequate state ground for the state court decision.coleman,at.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in the instant case,eighth district opinion appears to be ambiguous.while the judgment appears to rest on a state procedural bar,see girts,at,the court expressly found that a federal constitutional right was involved and cited griffin california,d,for the proposition that the state may not comment on an accused failure to testify at trial,girts,at citations omitted.as in clinkscale and bowling,it is not clear whether the opinion expressly states that the judgment is based on an adequate and independent state law ground.however,we do not have to make a determination with respect to the adequacy and independence of a possible state law ground because petitioner conceded at oral argument that the state court conducted only a plain error review of the underlying claims.this concession is significant.this court has found that plain error review by a state appellate court does not constitute a waiver of state procedural default rules.seymour walker,citation omitted.petitioner attempts to distinguish this case from seymour arguing that,unlike seymour,this case involves a federal constitutional claim.even assuming arguendo that the claims in seymour were exclusively based on ohio substantive law,the proposed distinction between federal and state claims is unsupported by case law.petitioner can not point to case law that supports distinguishing between claims based on state substantive law or federal constitutional law.simply put,there is no exception to seymour for cases concerning federal constitutional claims.since petitioner conceded that the state court performed a plain error review,in light of seymour,we can not find a waiver of the state procedural default rules.therefore,we find petitioner underlying due process claim to be procedurally defaulted.
cause and prejudice 
this court has found that a procedural default may be overcome by demonstrat ing cause for the procedural default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law,or demonstrat ing that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.smith ohio dep t of rehab,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also ege yukins,cir.for the reasons set forth below,we find that petitioner meets the cause and prejudice exception to the procedural default because his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the prosecution statements during closing argument.
the prosecutor statements 
in this case,the prosecutor made three statements during closing argument about petitioner failure to testify.in pertinent part,the prosecutor stated 
again these are his words.and the words that you heard from these folks supplied by him are unrefuted,and they are uncontroverted.there has been no evidence offered to say that these people are incorrect.none at all.
emphasis added.this comment points directly to petitioner failure to testify and suggests to the jury that petitioner had an affirmative obligation to refute witness testimony.the statement suggests that the exercise of the fifth amendment right to remain silent negatively impacted the evidence presented at,witness testimony went unrefuted and uncontroverted.
the prosecutor also stated that with respect to the source of the cyanide,the defendant had no less than three occasions to tell the police that he had ordered the cyanide.emphasis added.again,this statement focused on petitioner fifth amendment right to remain silent.
last,the prosecutor stated 
ladies and gentlemen,we do have to tell you how it was introduced into her system.we know that it was ingested.and there is only one person that can tell you how it was introduced,and that the defendant.
emphasis added.as the district court noted,this statement is anything but a comment on the evidence.by indicating that petitioner was the only one person who could explain the crime to the jury,the prosecutor highlighted the fact that petitioner did not testify,and attached a negative connotation to the exercise of the fifth amendment right to remain silent.
the prosecutor three statements were improper,misleading and highly prejudicial because they implied that petitioner was obligated to testify and to speak to the police.in the words of the district court,the prosecution can not take the deficiencies in its own case,which the defense has every,every point out,and utilize those deficiencies against petitioner.id.nevertheless,trial counsel failed to object to the prosecutor improper statements during closing argument.the failure to object to the improper and prejudicial statements constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
when a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel assistance,the defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.strickland washington,d see also keith mitchell,cir united states foreman,cir.the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.see also keith,at foreman,at.
in order to avoid trial counsel strategic decisions,review of counsel performance is highly deferential.foreman,at.a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that is,the defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.strickland,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a reviewing court must judge the reasonableness of counsel actions on the facts of the defendant case,viewed from counsel perspective at the time,higgins renico,cir,and strategic choices must be respected if they were made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options,id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.a defendant has the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment,id.quoting strickland,at.unless the accused receives the effective assistance of counsel,a serious risk of injustice infects the trial itself.united states cronic,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
under strickland,petitioner must establish prejudice to bring a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim.at.petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.petitioner must demonstrate that counsel errors were serious enough to deprive him of a proceeding the result of which was reliable.glenn tate,cir.t he prejudice prong is satisfied if there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance.hamblin mitchell,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.prejudice may be presumed if petitioner counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing.millender adams,cir quoting cronic,at.
in this case,trial counsel failure to object allowed the prosecutor improper and prejudicial statements to reach the jury uncontested and without the proper admonition from the trial court.this inaction simply can not be characterized as litigation strategy.there was no conceivable benefit to be derived from failing to challenge the prosecutor improper statements.t he prejudice resulting from counsel lawyering is patent.groseclose bell,cir.counsel performance was so inept as to amount to a constructive denial of counsel,relieving petitioner of the need to show prejudice.id.if trial counsel had raised an objection,the trial court would have reprimanded the prosecutor and issued a prompt curative instruction to the jury.in turn,the jury would have heard from the judge that the prosecutor comments called for an improper and impermissible negative inference for petitioner exercise of his fifth amendment rights.certainly,if an objection had been raised to the prosecutor first statement,the prosecutor would not have been permitted to continue to overstep with subsequent comments.trial counsel failure to object exacerbated the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor statements.we find that there is a strong likelihood that at least one juror would have changed his mind if the improper and prejudicial statements would not have been made,especially because the prosecutor presented weak and limited evidence at trial.trial counsel clearly rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to the prosecutor statements 
this court has recognized that ineffective assistance of counsel may be used to satisfy the cause prong of the procedural default exception.see,hofbauer,at see also ege,at.attorney error may constitute cause if it rises to the level of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.gravley mills,cir see also bell,at noting that attorney error can only be considered cause if the error meets the threshold of ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the sixth amendment.because trial counsel failure to object rises to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel,petitioner has established cause to overcome the state procedural bar.petitioner has also established prejudice to overcome the state procedural bar.as discussed above,trial counsel failure to object prejudiced petitioner and aggravated the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor improper and highly prejudicial statements.ege,at.since petitioner presents a successful ineffective assistance of counsel claim,and has established cause and prejudice to overcome the state procedural bar,we will address the merits of the petitioner claims below.
iv.the prosecutor statements violated petitioner fifth amendment rights and were sufficiently flagrant to warrant re
