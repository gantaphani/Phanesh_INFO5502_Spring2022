after a massachusetts superior court jury convicted wayne of first degree murder for the death of cynthia reid,he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.having exhausted his state court appeals,petitioned the federal district court for habeas corpus relief under,claiming that the trial court violated the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment by allowing him to waive his right to be present at his trial the district court denied the petition,and we affirm.the decision of the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc affirming his conviction was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.
background 
in its opinion on direct appeal,the sjc summarized the following facts,which the jury could have found to be true.see commonwealth.on april,after they had ended their romantic relationship,the petitioner returned cynthia reid bicycle to her and asked her to give him a ride back to his house.once there,reid waited in her car while the petitioner went into his house to look for a receipt for a gift he had given her.returning to her car with a survival knife,the petitioner stabbed reid repeatedly in the neck,back,chest,lungs,and heart.he drove her car to the central parking lot at logan airport and parked it there,leaving her body inside covered with towels.he then fled to new york,kansas,oklahoma,and finally nevada,where the arrested him.
after being indicted for murder,the petitioner moved to suppress certain statements he had made to the police,as well as physical evidence that had been seized from his truck.at a pretrial hearing on this motion,held a few days before the trial began,the petitioner had an emotional outburst,after which he refused to return to the courtroom.id.at.the court psychiatrist evaluated the petitioner.based on this evaluation,the judge found that the petitioner was competent to waive his right to presence,and she permitted him to remain outside the courtroom for the rest of the suppression hearing.id.on the next day of court,which was set for jury empanelment,the petitioner again asked to be excused from the courtroom.the judge conducted a colloquy with the petitioner,and again determined that his waiver of presence was knowing and voluntary.she then excused the petitioner,and empaneled a jury in his absence.id.on the next court day,the petitioner again appeared in court and requested that a new jury be empaneled in his presence.the judge agreed,and empaneled and swore in a new jury.as soon as that process was completed,the petitioner again asked to be excused from court.the judge again agreed,after determining that the petitioner was intelligently waiving his right to presence.id.
on each subsequent day of the trial,the petitioner appeared in court and asked if the court would excuse him from the proceedings.every day the same procedure was repeated,with the judge conducting an extensive colloquy with the petitioner regarding his desire to absent himself from his trial.she asked him to sign a written waiver notice.every day,the judge found was voluntarily and intelligently waiving his right to be present,and excused him from court.id.the judge also instructed the jury not to speculate on the reasons for the petitioner absence from the courtroom,telling them it had nothing to do with disruptive behavior and that it should have no effect on their determination of the petitioner guilt or innocence.id.at.the jury found guilty of first degree murder.
the petitioner appealed his conviction to the sjc,claiming that he could not waive his right to be present at a capital trial the court affirmed his conviction,holding that the trial judge was correct in accepting the defendant waiver of his right to be present during trial.id.at.petitioner filed a timely habeas petition in the district court for the district of massachusetts,asserting the sixth amendment argument.the court held that the sjc decision was neither contrary to,nor an unreasonable application of,federal law,and therefore found no grounds to issue the writ.petitioner now appeals.
ii.the habeas standard 
a federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner if it finds,inter alia,that the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law d.subsection defines two categories of cases in which a state prisoner may obtain federal habeas relief with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court.williams taylor,d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases.id.at.a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from supreme court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the prisoner case,or if the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from supreme court precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.id.at.in either case,the state court determination can not simply be must be unreasonable.id.at.
the threshold question under d is whether the petitioner seeks to apply a rule of law that was clearly established at the time his conviction became final.id.at.the petitioner claims that under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment,he could not waive presence at his capital trial.after reviewing the supreme court decisions on the scope of the confrontation clause,we conclude that the supreme court has not clearly established an unwaivable right of presence at a capital trial.by contrast,we conclude that the supreme court has clearly established the principle that a defendant in a non capital case can waive his right to be present at trial.we explain below the significance of these conclusions for the habeas analysis.
iii.the confrontation clause 
a.the sjc decision 
on direct appeal,the sjc addressed the petitioner argument that he could not waive his right to be present at his capital trial.in his argument to that court,relied on two supreme court cases,lewis united states,and hopt utah,which suggested that there is a nonwaivable right of presence generally in a criminal case,for his argument that the right to presence is not waivable in a capital case.in response,the sjc found that the supreme court had rejected those holdings in subsequent noncapital cases.it then took notice of the court observation in snyder massachusetts,that the privilege to confront one accusers may be lost by consent or at times even by misconduct,at quoting snyder,at.on this basis,the sjc found that there was no supreme court case holding that a defendant in a capital trial can not also waive his right to presence,at.
looking to other courts that had addressed the same argument,the sjc agreed with the ninth circuit decision in campbell wood,cir,that t here is no principled basis for limiting to noncapital offenses a defendant ability knowingly,voluntarily,and intelligently to waive the right of presence,at quoting campbell,at internal quotation marks omitted.it therefore concluded that the trial judge did not err when she allowed to absent himself voluntarily and knowingly from his trial 
contrary to clearly established federal law 
the sixth amendment states that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him const.amend.vi.consequently,o ne of the most basic of the rights guaranteed by the confrontation clause is the accused right to be present in the courtroom at every stage of his trial.illinois allen,d citing lewis united states.this right,however,is not absolute.in snyder,as already noted,the court held that a defendant may lose his right to personally confront witnesses by consent or at times even by misconduct.at.addressing the loss of this right in a number of factual situations,the court held that the defendants involved could con
