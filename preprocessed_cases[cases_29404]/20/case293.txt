paul chappius,superintendent of the elmira correctional facility,appeals from the april,order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york katherine polk failla,judge granting brian carmichael petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to the order granting the writ,stayed pending this appeal,would invalidate carmichael custody imposed pursuant to a december,judgment of the supreme court of the state of new york,new york county robert straus,justice,following a jury trial and conviction 
after an unsuccessful direct appeal of his conviction as well as a failed motion to vacate his conviction based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel carmichael sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal court on grounds that the state trial court misapplied the decision by the supreme court of the united states in batson kentucky and that carmichael received ineffective assistance of counsel.on july,magistrate judge andrew peck filed a report and recommendation proposing that the district court reject both of carmichael arguments and deny his petition the district court declined the recommendations of magistrate judge peck and granted carmichael petition,holding that the new york state appellate division,first department,had unreasonably applied batson and its progeny when it affirmed the state trial court finding that carmichael failed to make a prima facie case showing that the prosecution used its peremptory challenges in a discriminatory manner 
we hold that the district court incorrectly applied the standard for evaluating a state court rulings set forth in the and effective death penalty act of the aedpa,d.we further hold that the appellate division order affirming the trial court denial of carmichael batson challenge was not an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.
accordingly,we vacate the district court april,order granting carmichael the writ of habeas corpus and remand the cause to the district court for such further proceedings as may be appropriate and consistent with this opinion.
background 
jury selection in carmichael trial 
on september,jury selection began in brian carmichael criminal trial before justice robert straus of the supreme court of the state of new york the court tasked the parties with selecting a jury from three separate panels,each composed of venirepersons.both carmichael and the people of the state of new york,represented by the new york county district attorney office the state,received twenty peremptory challenges for use during jury selection.the parties could use their peremptory challenges to remove potential jurors from the venire.both parties also received six additional peremptory challenges,which they could use only to strike potential alternate jurors.this appeal concerns the state use of its peremptory challenges during the process of jury selection.
after questioning of the venirepersons on the first panel concluded,the court asked the parties if they wished to exercise any of their peremptory challenges against the first twelve potential jurors.the state exercised five peremptory challenges and counsel for carmichael exercised three.then,the court asked the parties to consider the next twelve venirepersons.when the state struck four more potential jurors,defense counsel raised his first batson challenge 
defense counsel told the court that he fe lt compelled to make a batson challenge because we had two african americans in the jury pool and the state has challenged both of them.specifically,the state used two of its peremptory challenges to strike shackwanna boiken and charmaine hamilton,both black females.the court denied defense counsel challenge finding that the removal of two black jurors by itself does not constitute a prima facie showing of a pattern of use of strike s in a discriminatory way.
following the denial of defense counsel first batson challenge,the state declined to use any more strikes on venirepersons in the first panel.defense counsel,however,struck all six of the remaining potential jurors.
the parties next considered the second panel of potential jurors.the state and defense counsel combined to strike eleven of the first sixteen individuals in this group.notably,neither party struck bettina boyd,a black woman during consideration of the next five venirepersons,however,the state struck dina grant,another black female.this strike prompted defense counsel to raise his second batson challenge.
defense counsel stated,a lthough the state has allowed bo yd to remain on the jury,the lone black juror selected so far i believe out of the four african american jurors we have considered on the panel,the state has challenged three of them.the court responded by noting that boyd,a black female,remained on the jury,and that defense counsel struck another venireperson,yalira velarde,whom the court believed to be a black female.a disagreement then ensued between defense counsel and the court over whether velarde was hispanic or.specifically,the court told defense counsel,i am not saying you are right and i am wrong or the opposite.i am only making a record as to race because it sometimes necessary to do so when there a batson challenge.ultimately,the court denied defense counsel challenge,holding again that the statistical basis is not sufficient alone to raise a discriminatory use of a free peremptory challenge under new york law.
the parties resumed their consideration of the remaining venirepersons on panel two.defense counsel used one peremptory challenge and the state used two.one of the two venirepersons struck by the state was jessica simmons,a black female.in response,defense counsel raised his third batson challenge.
defense counsel argued that,simmons is african american and it now four out of five.we had probably people that we considered in two days,only five african americans have come before us in this case.the court calculated that four out of six black potential jurors had been struck,including velarde.the court also repeated its prior refrain that challenges based on statistical evidence,such as defense counsel challenges,are generally not sufficient to raise or create an inference or create a prima facie case of discriminatory use of p ere mptory challenges.defense counsel responded that he could not see any potential basis for a batson challenge other than the numbers.accordingly,the court denied defense counsel third batson challenge.
after the state struck the last remaining venireperson in panel two,the parties considered the potential jurors in the third and final panel.at this point,the parties had selected nine jurors and were aiming to fill only three outstanding seats before choosing alternates.the state struck the first venireperson in the third panel,but the parties accepted the second and third individuals as jurors.diana duggins,a black female,was one of the two persons thus selected for the jury.the parties filled the final open seat with the sixth individual on the third panel.ultimately,two black women boyd and duggins were seated on the jury.
with the jury of twelve selected,the parties turned their attention to picking alternate jurors.each side had six peremptory challenges to use during this part of the process.the state began by striking three potential alternates,two of whom were black.consequently,defense counsel raised his fourth and final batson challenge.
defense counsel explained his position as follows 
it seems again that the state is exercising its challenges to exclude african americans.i do note that as we proceeded with selection the state did not challenge duggins who was the sixth in my view african american that we have considered but when we got to the alternates he challenged sanders,a black female,and now he also challenging pratt who is a male black,so i see a clear pattern of challenging african americans,your honor.i make my batson challenge on that basis.four of the six we have considered have been challenged.we have been through three panels so approximately have come into this courtroom.w e have considered in total eight african americans and six of those have been challenged by the state in my view 
the court denied defense counsel final batson challenge.it reiterated that the statistical analysis by itself does not provide for this court that level of challenge,does create a prima facie case requiring us to go on to step two of the analysis so the challenge must be denied.as a result,the court did not require the state to articulate any nondiscriminatory reasons for its use of the challenged peremptory strikes.the parties then selected the final alternate juror and carmichael case proceeded to trial.
on october,the jury convicted carmichael on three counts of second degree criminal sale of a controlled substance.two months later,justice straus sentenced carmichael to three concurrent terms of imprisonment 
ii.procedural history 
on september,carmichael appealed his conviction to the new york state appellate division,first department.one of the grounds for carmichael direct appeal is relevant here his claim that the trial court erred in finding that he failed to establish a prima facie case that the state used its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner.the crux of carmichael argument on direct appeal was that the trial court had misinterpreted the new york court of appeals decision in people brown,by concluding that statistical evidence of a discriminatory pattern in the use of peremptory strikes is never sufficient to set forth a prima facie case of discrimination.the appellate division affirmed the judgments of the state trial court,holding that 
t he trial court properly denied defendant applications made pursuant to batson kentucky.viewing jury selection as a whole,we conclude that defendant did not meet his burden at step one of the inquiry.defendant did not produce evidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination ha d occurred in the exercise of peremptory challenges johnson california.while numerical evidence may suffice,in this case it did not warrant an inference of discrimination 
after the new york court of appeals denied carmichael leave to appeal and after the supreme court of the united states denied carmichael petition for a writ of certiorari carmichael filed a motion to vacate his judgment of conviction in the state trial court on grounds that he received ineffective assistance of counsel justice roger hayes denied carmichael motion carmichael appealed justice hayes order to the appellate division,first department,which affirmed the denial the new york court of appeals denied carmichael leave to appeal 
thereafter,carmichael filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court.he raised two claims the jury selection process violated his rights as set forth in batson and its progeny,and he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney lacked knowledge of the standard for establishing a prima facie batson case under new york law.on april,the district court declined the recommendations of the magistrate judge and granted carmichael petition.
the district court reviewed the appellate division judgment affirming the state trial court denial of carmichael batson challenge because it was the last reasoned decision to address carmichael claim it then concluded that the appellate division had unreasonably applied batson and its progeny when it affirmed the state trial court finding that carmichael did not make out a prima facie showing that the state used its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner according to the district court,evidence of the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges was so abundant for example,the state struck twice the number of black jurors than one would expect,and to of the black jurors under consideration that it had no choice but to conclude that the appellate division had applied batson and its progeny in an unreasonable manner.having determined that the appellate division erred in affirming the trial court batson finding,the district court did not reach carmichael claim.the state timely filed a notice of appeal as of right and the district court granted the state application for a stay pending this appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court order granting a petition for a writ of habeas corpus section of title of the code,as amended by the aedpa,prohibits federal courts from granting a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on the basis of a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in a state court proceeding unless the adjudication of the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.in this case,we are concerned only with the first of the two enumerated bases for granting habeas relief 
the supreme court has instructed that section d contrary to and unreasonable application of clauses have independent meaning a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court when the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent,on the other hand,occurs when a state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.the district court here concluded that the appellate division had applied supreme court precedent to the facts of carmichael case in an unreasonable manner.
to merit federal habeas relief under the unreasonable application prong of section d,a petitioner must show that the state court ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.in other words,a federal court may not issue a writ of habeas corpus simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.in determining whether a particular state court application is reasonable under the circumstances presented,a habeas court must be guided by the level of specificity of the relevant precedent holding.when the applicable rule is more general,state courts will have more leeway in reaching outcomes in determinations.
ultimately,this represents a highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings,which demands that decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.
ii.the batson standard 
the supreme court precedent relevant here is,of course,batson kentucky.in batson,the supreme court established a framework for the evidentiary inquiry into whether a peremptory challenge is.in the first step,the objecting party must set forth a prima facie showing that the circumstances give rise to an inference that a member of the venire was struck because of his or her race.if the objecting party makes the requisite showing,the burden shifts to the party striking the potential juror to come forward with a neutral explanation for its peremptory challenge finally,if the party striking the juror tenders a neutral explanation,the trial court has the duty to determine if the objecting party has established purposeful discrimination.
an objecting party can establish a prima facie case of discrimination by offering a wide variety of evidence,so long as the sum of the proffered facts gives rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.for example,in batson,the supreme court explained that a pattern of strikes against black jurors included in the particular venire might give rise to an inference of discrimination.in addition,the prosecutor questions and statements during voir dire examination and in ex
