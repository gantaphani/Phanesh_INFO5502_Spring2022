inmate jerald thomas filed this action alleging that a prison guard retaliated against him for exercising his first amendment rights.the district court concluded that if thomas won his case,the victory would shorten his period of custodial detention.accordingly,the district court concluded that the habeas exception to barred thomas complaint,which the district court dismissed sua sponte.because a victory for thomas would have at most the potential to decrease his period of detention and because thomas has alleged adequately the elements of a first amendment retaliation claim,we reverse the district court judgment and remand this case for further proceedings.
background 
factual background 
thomas is imprisoned at baraga maximum correctional facility in baraga,michigan.on october,an exchange occurred between thomas and corrections officer eby,whose first name is not presently known.their accounts of the incident vary wildly.
according to thomas,he was asleep in his cell at on october,when eby kicked the door to his cell.after awakening thomas,eby told him that she was going to teach him a lesson for writing a grievance against another corrections officer named grieke.joint appendix at compl.at.additionally,eby told him,you people are as dumb as you look,which thomas interpreted as a slur against.
eby,by contrast,claims that when she came to thomas cell,he was already awake and was standing in the o bservation window with his penis exposed masturbating.at major misconduct rpt.additionally,she claims that thomas had heard her speaking to another inmate before she arrived at thomas cell,so thomas must have known that she was on that wing of the facility.she took this act as an attempt to degrade her.id.
eby memorialized her version of the exchange in a major misconduct report,a copy of which was delivered to thomas at on october.the following day,thomas filled out a grievance form with his version of the events.
administrative proceedings 
on november,a hearing officer held a hearing regarding the major misconduct report,and found thomas and his version of the exchange not credible.the hearing officer concluded that thomas had intentional ly expos ed his sexual organ to officer eby,and that eby had no reason to fabricate the misconduct.at major misconduct hr g rpt.accordingly,the hearing officer upheld the charge.thomas requested a rehearing on november,but the prison hearings administrator denied this request on february.
on november,prison officials performed the first level of review step of thomas grievance against eby,which was handled separately from thomas challenge to the major misconduct report.after an interview with thomas,the officials rejected the grievance.thomas refused to sign off at that level of review.at grievance form.thomas further appeals also proved fruitless,and on january,the responsible prison official issued a final denial of thomas grievance appeal.
legal proceedings 
in april,thomas filed a petition for judicial review of his misconduct conviction in the ingham county court.in an order dated may,the state court informed thomas that he was required to pay from his institutional account as an initial partial filing fee,and that if he failed to do so within days,the court would dismiss his suit.thomas failed to pay the filing fee,and the state court dismissed his action.
on october,thomas filed a pro se complaint against eby in the district court for the western district of michigan,which granted his motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.thomas complaint alleges that eby filed the misconduct report against him in retaliation for his earlier grievance against another corrections officer.according to thomas,eby retaliation violated his first amendment rights,and accordingly is actionable under.thomas complaint requests in compensatory damages,another in punitive damages,and that the sexual misconduct ticket be removed from his prison file.at compl.at.
on december,before eby had been served with a copy of the complaint,the district court dismissed thomas complaint sua sponte,pursuant to e,b,and c.the district court concluded that edwards balisok,d,bars thomas claim because his misconduct conviction led to the forfeiture of credits,which his suit seeks to restore.at dist.op.at.thomas now appeals the district court judgment.
thomas filed a pro se appellate brief on july.on november,we appointed counsel for thomas and requested both thomas and nonparty michigan department of corrections mdoc to brief two issues whether a retaliation claim is subject to the rule of edwards balisok,and whether the provision in michigan law imposing a loss of credits for thomas misconduct is sufficient to trigger the application of balisok.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over thomas claim.we have jurisdiction over thomas appeal from the district court final judgment.
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint under e and b.brown bargery,cir.dismissal of a complaint for the failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted is appropriate only if it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.id.at.we must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accept all factual allegations as true.trzebuckowski city of cleveland,cir reviewing dismissal under federal rule of civil procedure b.further,we hold pleadings filed by a pro se litigant to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers,haines kerner,d,and may not uphold the dismissal of such a pleading simply because we find the plaintiff allegations unlikely.denton hernandez,d.
iii.analysis 
mdoc argues that the doctrine bars thomas claim.under the doctrine,federal courts lack jurisdiction over cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.coles granville,cir quoting exxon mobil saudi basic,d.courts appl y the doctrine only when a plaintiff complains of injury from the state court judgment itself.id.at.
we conclude that the doctrine does not apply.thomas complains of injury resulting from alleged retaliation,not from the state court judgment.also,the only judgment at issue here is the ingham county court dismissal,for failure to pay the filing fee,of thomas action seeking review of his misconduct conviction.the state court never had occasion to determine any issues relevant to this case,as it never reached the merits.moreover,thomas can win his retaliation claim without invalidating any aspect of the state court judgment.see dlx,kentucky,cir rejecting bar when the federal court could find for plaintiff without concluding that the state court decided any issue wrongly,cert.denied,d.for all these reasons,the doctrine does not bar thomas claim 
applicability of the habeas exception to 
thomas claim alleges that eby issued the misconduct ticket in retaliation for a previously filed grievance,and asks that the finding of misconduct be set aside in addition to including a request for damages.the district court concluded,and mdoc now argues,that such a claim is not cognizable under and must instead be brought through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
federal courts have long recognized the potential for prisoners to evade the habeas exhaustion requirements by challenging the duration of their confinement under,rather than by filing habeas petitions.consequently,the supreme court recognized a habeas exception to in preiser rodriguez,d,when it held that suits challenging the fact or duration of confinement fall within the traditional scope of habeas corpus and accordingly are not cognizable under.the court expanded the habeas exception to in heck humphrey,d,and edwards balisok,d.in heck,the court determined that,unless a prisoner conviction or sentence were previously set aside by a separate legal or administrative action,would not countenance claims for damages if a finding for the plaintiff would necessarily invalidate a conviction or sentence.and in
