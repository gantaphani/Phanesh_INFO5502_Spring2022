ralph pruitt asks this court to reverse the district court decision and grant his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under,contending that his state conviction for sexual assault and attempted armed robbery was procured in violation of the constitution.pruitt argues that the prosecution engaged in impermissible gender discrimination in violation of the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause by using its peremptory challenges to strike only males from the venire.he also argues that he was denied a fair trial when the prosecution,in violation of its duty under the due process clause,withheld from him information that the prosecution chief witness appeared to testify against him only after a judge imposed an appearance bond,raising the threat of forfeiture of the bond and arrest if she failed to appear.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court denial of his petition.
on november,pruitt was sentenced to natural life imprisonment,under illinois habitual offender statute,after a cook county,illinois jury found him guilty of the aggravated criminal sexual assault and attempted armed robbery of naomi sims.the evidence against pruitt offered at trial consisted primarily of the testimony of sims,who told the jury that pruitt had put a knife to her throat,attempted to rob her,and then raped her in an abandoned building.
pruitt concerns with the fairness of his trial began early in the proceedings.immediately following the selection of the jury,pruitt objected to the prosecution use of its peremptory challenges,arguing that prosecutors were impermissibly exercising the challenges to strike prospective jurors based on their gender.the trial court ruled that pruitt had failed to make out a prima facie showing of discrimination by the prosecution,and the case proceeded to trial.
also prior to the trial,the prosecution had a rather difficult time in finding sims and securing her presence at various proceedings.it appears that prosecutors located her only after learning that she had been arrested on an unrelated prostitution charge.the assistant state attorney prosecuting pruitt then had sims brought before a judge,where she signed an agreement providing for the execution of a appearance bond.under illinois law,should sims have then failed to appear at trial,she would have forfeited the and would further have been subject to arrest and imprisonment.neither the existence of the agreement nor the appearance bond was disclosed to pruitt in fact,his attorney only learned of its existence after pruitt had been convicted.
pruitt unsuccessfully appealed his conviction and sentence to the illinois appellate court,challenging the prosecution use of its peremptory challenges during jury selection.because pruitt learned about the existence of the appearance bond after his direct appeal had been taken,he raised the nondisclosure issue in a separate challenge.the illinois appellate court consolidated the direct appeal and the petition,ultimately denying relief on both grounds.the illinois supreme court denied him leave to appeal either issue.
on march,pruitt filed this petition for habeas relief in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois,challenging the legality of his conviction on four grounds that the evidence against him was insufficient to support his conviction that he was denied the right to a speedy trial under the sixth amendment that the prosecution improperly used its peremptory challenges to strike prospective jurors on the basis of gender in violation of the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause and that the prosecution failed to disclose that the key witness against him was compelled to appear at his trial by a appearance bond.after briefing by both parties,the district court denied pruitt petition on all grounds save the third.united states ex rel.pruitt page,c,wl,dist.lexis,at,as for the nondisclosure of the appearance bond,the court held that the illinois appellate court decision was not contrary to federal law.id.at,wl.it noted that w hile the evidence of sims bond would have been relevant,in context it was not material under the supreme court decision in united states bagley,d.pruitt,dist.lexis,at,wl.
the district court did rule that the illinois appellate court had unreasonably applied federal law,as identified by the supreme court in batson kentucky,d,and alabama ex rel,d,by finding that pruitt had failed to make out a prima facie case of gender discrimination in the prosecution use of its peremptory challenges.pruitt,dist.lexis,at,wl.the court held that pruitt had,in fact,made such a showing and was entitled to a hearing on the issue.rather than conditionally granting pruitt petition by providing for his release unless the state held a hearing on his batson claim,the court decided that it would conduct the hearing itself,evaluate the evidence,and determine whether the peremptory challenges were exercised for discriminatory reasons.id.at,wl.
the evidentiary hearing was held on november.the district court heard from the two assistant state attorneys who prosecuted pruitt,joe howard and laura morask,who testified as to their reasons for using six of their seven peremptory challenges to strike only men from the venire.as the district court later noted in its order,the hearing was held some nine years after pruitt trial,and the prosecutors testimony was based in part on their review of the voir dire transcript and morask contemporaneous notes.united states ex rel.pruitt page,c,slip op.at.nevertheless,the district court found that the two witnesses had sufficient recall of the trial to testify adequately and sincerely as to the reasons they had for striking each of the six male venire members.id.at.
after hearing testimony from the two prosecutors,the district court issued its order denying pruitt habeas relief on the issue.id.at.while the court found that pruitt had established a prima facie case of gender discrimination,it held that the prosecution witnesses had articulated neutral reasons that were clear,specific,related to the case at hand,and sufficient to rebut pruitt prima facie case.id.at.the court went on to hold that,based on its review of the record and its evaluation of the demeanor of the witnesses,the prosecution proffered reasons for the use of peremptory challenges were credible and not simply a pretext for impermissible gender discrimination.id.at.the court therefore denied pruitt petition,disposing of his last remaining ground for relief.pruitt timely appealed to this court for a review of the district court decision on two of the original four grounds he had asserted.
in reviewing the district court decision to deny pruitt habeas petition,w e review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions as well as mixed questions of law and fact de novo.harding walls,cir.the and effective death penalty act aedpa,however,significantly constrains federal court review of state court decisions.under that statute,habeas relief should only be granted if a state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.once the clearly established governing legal principles are identified,we must then determine whether the illinois appellate court decision in pruitt case was either contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of those legal principles.
nondisclosure of the appearance bond 
we begin with pruitt claim that he was denied a fair trial,as guaranteed by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,because of the state failure to disclose the existence of the appearance bond guaranteeing sims presence at his trial.the supreme court has made clear that the due process guarantee includes protection against the nondisclosure to the defense of favorable and material evidence in the possession of the prosecution.see brady maryland,d t he suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.the court has further explained that i mpeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence,falls within the brady rule.bagley,at.citing giglio united states,d.
the brady duty to disclose favorable evidence does not mean that the prosecution is required to turn over its entire case file to the defense.bagley,at.rather,the key to triggering the duty to disclose is the materiality of the evidence to the question of guilt we do not,however,automatically require a new trial whenever a combing of the prosecutors files after the trial has disclosed evidence possibly useful to the defense but not likely to have changed the verdict.a finding of materiality of the evidence is required under brady.a new trial is required if the false testimony could in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury.giglio,at.quotations and citations omitted.in bagley,the supreme court further sought to clarify this concept of materiality,noting that a constitutional error occurs only if the evidence is material in the sense that its suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.at.the court went on to explain that evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.blackmun,id.at.white,concurring in that sentence.
in this case,pruitt argues that evidence of the appearance bond guaranteeing sims presence at trial was both favorable and material to his therefore should have been disclosed by the prosecution.he contends that sims testimony,as the state chief complaining witness,was central to the prosecution case against him,and that evidence of the agreement could have been used to impeach her testimony.he directs our attention to crivens roth,a case in which we held that the prosecution withholding of the criminal history of its key trial witness was a sufficient ground on which to grant the defendant habeas petition,cir.in that case,we stated that w hen the credibility of a witness plays a pivotal role in a conviction,it may become an issue upon which we will reverse a conviction.id.at.pruitt argues that because sims testimony was critical to the prosecution case against him,any evidence that bore on her credibility was therefore material to the question of his guilt or innocence.he further argues that the existence of the appearance bond could have been used to expose what he believes was sims perjurious testimony regarding her motivation for testifying against him,when sims stated at trial that she was testifying because she want ed to.tr.
in addressing pruitt claim,the illinois appellate court noted that while it did not condone the state failure to disclose to defendant the existence of the agreement,in this case,the failure to do so did not result in prejudice to defendant nor deny him a fair trial.people pruitt,slip op.at.important to the court analysis were the facts that the record failed to indicate that sims had been promised leniency in exchange for her testimony or that she had been required to testify in any particular manner,and that material witness bonds and the penalties for violating them were authorized under state law id.at.the illinois court therefore denied relief on the nondisclosure issue.
on habeas review,we consider whether the illinois appellate court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of federal law.the district court concluded that while evidence of the appearance bond may have been favorable to pruitt,it was nevertheless not material to the question of his guilt or innocence.pruitt,wl,dist.lexis,at.the court observed that d efense counsel knew that sims had failed to appear in the past,giving him an opening to bring out her reluctance to testify,and he did so.it would have been clear to the jury that sims had to be pressured to testify.had they also been told that she knew she would be subject to arrest and bond forfeiture if she failed to appear,it is unlikely that it would have made a difference in their appraisal of the evidence.id.at wl,at.the court,concluding that the nondisclosure of the evidence did not undermine its confidence in the outcome of pruitt trial,held that the illinois appellate court decision was not contrary to federal law.
we agree that the illinois court resolution of this issue was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of the brady disclosure rule.the evidence of the appearance bond was certainly favorable to pruitt,in the sense that it would have given him another basis on which to question the motivation for sims testimony against him.but when the defense was already aware of sims reluctance to testify and had full opportunity to question her about it at trial see tr,this additional piece of evidence was not material,as the supreme court has explained that term in bagley,so much as it was cumulative on the issue of motivation.united states milan,cir finding no brady violation in part because the additional evidence would have been merely cumulative citations omitted.we do not believe that giving pruitt the opportunity to inform the jury that the prosecution had invoked the illinois code of criminal procedure to ensure sims presence would have raised a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different.bagley,at.rather,like the evidence at issue in giglio,the evidence of the appearance bond was possibly useful to the defense but not likely to have changed the verdict.giglio,at.
finally,pruitt claims that evidence of the appearance bond was material because it would have provided a basis on which he could have questioned the veracity of sims statement that she was testifying b ecause she want ed to.this statement,he argues,demonstrates her propensity to testify pruitt reminds us that this court has previously stated that evidence of a habit of lying to police and judges could have a negative impact on a witness credibility,potentially undermining confidence in the outcome of a trial.see crivens,at.but we,like the district court,are not convinced that sims statement was necessarily appearance bond may have been merely a more forceful reminder of her obligation to pruitt already had ample information on which to question the veracity of her statement,as he was well aware of her repeated reluctance to testify at prior proceedings.at trial,he did,in fact,question sims about her failure to appear voluntarily on prior occasions and her evasion of police attempts to locate her.as the district court put it,had pruitt attorney been able to point out that her appearance at trial had been secured by an appearance bond and the threat of arrest,the jury would hardly have been surprised.pruitt,wl,dist.lexis,at.
while full disclosure by the prosecution of the means it had employed to secure sims presence at trial would have been the better course here and may have avoided questions regarding the prosecution compliance with its ethical duties,we do not believe that had the existence of the agreement been disclosed to the defense,the outcome of pruitt trial would have been different.therefore,the illinois appellate court decision was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of the federal law established by the supreme court in brady,bagley,and giglio.
gender discrimination in jury selection 
pruitt next argues that the district court erred in holding that the prosecution had not violated the equal protection clause in using its peremptory challenges to strike only men from the venire,finding instead that the prosecution had offered credible,reasons for each challenge.pruitt initially raised this objection at the completion of jury selection at the outset of voir dire,the venire consisted of individuals,at least of whom were male the prosecution says.the prosecution exercised six of its seven peremptory challenges to strike potential of whom were male.pruitt jury ultimately was comprised of nine men and three women,with one male and one female selected as alternate jurors.
after pruitt raised his objection,the state trial court ruled that pruitt had failed
