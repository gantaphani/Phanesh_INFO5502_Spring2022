petitioner sherman wagner,billy lynn wagner,appeals the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.in his various state and federal appeals relating to his state murder trial,wagner has made numerous claims of violations that he claims warrant reversal of his conviction.wagner certificate of appealability in this court has been limited to the following claims prosecutorial misconduct based on the prosecutor reference to unrelated murder investigations of petitioner prosecutorial misconduct based on the prosecutor failure to correct perjured testimony ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel failure to object to the prosecutor reference to the prior murder investigations ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel failure to challenge the testimony of witness antonio edwards ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel failure to challenge the testimony of witness thelyus johnson and ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel inappropriate remarks during closing argument.for the reasons which follow,we find three of wagner claims to be unexhausted therefore,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
because we resolve this case on procedural grounds,a long recitation of the facts is not necessary.instead,we refer verbatim to the relevant facts relied upon by the michigan court of appeals,facts which are presumed correct on habeas review.e 
according to the testimony at trial,kiley moss and thelyus johnson arranged to purchase drugs from antonio edwards in detroit.the two men took a bus from lansing to detroit,where edwards met them.edwards did not immediately have the drugs available.eventually,edwards and sol bryant took the men to a house where they met deshawn lucci.the men began to set up a scale to weigh the drugs,but moved to a back room because that was the only room with a light.while the men were in the back room,another man,whom johnson identified as wagner,came into the room,pointing a gun.johnson claimed that wagner shot and robbed him,and also shot moss.johnson pretended to be dead and was able to leave the house after the others left.moss,however,died from his gunshot wounds.his body was later burned when the house was set on fire.

standard of review 
we review de novo the district court decision.hall vasbinder,cir.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,a federal court may only grant habeas corpus relief for a given claim if the state court adjudication of that claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.in applying these standards,we examine the holdings of the supreme court as they existed at the time of the relevant decision.hall,at quoting williams taylor,d.we may also examine the decisions of other courts,including our own decisions,to determine if a legal principle was clearly established by the supreme court.id.citing smith stegall,cir.
a federal court may not grant a writ of habeas corpus unless the applicant has exhausted all available remedies in state court.b a.to be properly exhausted,each claim must have been fairly presented to the state courts.see,frazier huffman,cir.this includes a requirement that the applicant present the issue both to the state court of appeals and the state supreme court.see hafley sowders,cir citing winegar corr.dep t.fair presentation requires that the state courts be given the opportunity to see both the factual and legal basis for each claim.see,id.citing alley bell,cir newton million,cir.this does not mean that the applicant must recite chapter and verse of constitutional law.slaughter parker,cir.but the applicant is required to make a specific showing of the alleged claim.finally,a federal court can not grant habeas relief if there still is a potential state remedy for the state courts to consider.see b b.put otherwise,if a state remedy is no longer available at the time of the federal petition,the exhaustion doctrine poses no bar to federal review.see engle isaac,d.
although the exhaustion doctrine is not a jurisdictional matter,rockwell yukins,cir,it is a threshold question that must be resolved before we reach the merits of any claim.see harris lafler,cir.furthermore,as a general matter,a federal court may not grant a writ even on a mixed petition,one containing claims that the petitioner has pressed before the state courts and claims that he has not.id.therefore,each claim must be reviewed for exhaustion before any claim may be reviewed on the merits.in this case,the state has challenged three of petitioner claims on exhaustion grounds the prosecutorial misconduct claim relating to the use of evidence of uncharged homicides the prosecutorial misconduct claim relating to the elicitation of false testimony and the ineffective assistance of counsel claim relating to the failure to challenge the prosecutor use of evidence of uncharged homicides.upon review of each,we find that none of these claims has been properly exhausted.
prosecutorial of prior murder evidence 
the government argues that petitioner has not exhausted his first claim of prosecutorial misconduct,that the prosecutor impermissibly implicated petitioner during trial in the unrelated murders of kamal logan and william moody.in response,petitioner cites to three sections in his state court briefs in an attempt to show that this claim was
