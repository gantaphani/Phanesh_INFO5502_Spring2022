johnbull osagiede,a nigerian national,pleaded guilty to one count of heroin distribution and was sentenced to more than eight years in federal prison.on april,he filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the northern district of illinois.see a.he claimed,inter alia,that he was denied his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel,see strickland washington,d,because his lawyer sought no remedy for the government failure to notify him of his right to consular assistance under the vienna convention on consular relations,april.the government conceded that it had failed to inform osagiede of his right,in clear violation of the article.nevertheless,the district court dismissed osagiede petition without an evidentiary hearing.see b.the district judge reasoned that any attempt by osagiede lawyer to remedy the article violation would have been futile.
osagiede then filed a pro se application for a certificate of appealability.see c.we construed osagiede petition liberally and determined that he had made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.c.we framed the relevant issue as follows whether osagiede counsel was ineffective for failing to seek a remedy for the article violation.
the vienna convention is an international treaty that governs relations between individual nations and foreign consular officials.oregon,d breyer,dissenting.the adoption of the vienna convention by the international community was the single most important event in the entire history of the consular institution.luke lee,consular law and practice ed.when the united states ratified the treaty in,it became the supreme law of the land.const.art.vi,cl.
the convention contains articles,many of which address the rights of local consulates and consular officials,the respective obligations of sending and receiving nations and matters such as status and legal immunity.article,however,is unique it is phrased in terms of the detained foreign national and his or her individual rights.see jogi voges jogi ii,cir.article imposes three separate obligations on a detaining authority inform the consulate of a foreign national arrest or detention without delay forward communications from a detained national to the consulate without delay,and inform a detained foreign national of his rights under article without delay.vienna convention,b.although this third obligation might be more properly termed a right to notification,the right embodied in article as a whole is commonly referred to as the right to consular assistance.the right to consular assistance has been codified in federal regulations promulgated to ensure compliance with article.see requiring the department of justice to comply with article e requiring the immigration and naturalization service to comply with article.further,federal law enforcement agencies have also long been instructed by the state department that they must comply with the requirements of article.see department of state,pub,consular notification and access instruction for federal,state and local enforcement and other officials regarding foreign nationals in the united states when foreign nationals are arrested or detained,they must be advised of the right to have their consular officials notified.
article furthers an essential consular function protecting the interests of the sending state and of its nationals.vienna convention,a,e,at.this protective function is one of the most important functions performed by a consulate.lee,consular law and practice.foreign nationals who are detained within the united states find themselves in a very vulnerable position.separated from their families and far from their homelands,they suddenly find themselves swept into a foreign legal system.language barriers,cultural barriers,lack of resources,isolation and unfamiliarity with local law create an aura of chaos around the foreign detainees,which can lead them to make serious legal missteps.linda malone,from breard to atkins to malvo legal incompetency and human rights norms on the fringes of the death penalty,mary bill rts.
in these situations,the consulate can serve as a cultural bridge between the foreign detainee and the legal machinery of the receiving state.william aceves,murphy netherland,am.int l.of course,we assume that lawyers here are equipped to deal with language barriers we also assume they are familiar with the law.sometimes,however,the assistance of an attorney can not entirely replace the unique assistance that can be provided by the consulate.the consulate can provide not only an explanation of the receiving state legal system but an explanation of how that system differs from the sending state system.see linda jane springrose,note,strangers in a strange land the rights of under article of the vienna convention on consular relations,geo.immigr.this assistance can be invaluable because cultural misunderstandings can lead a detainee to make serious legal mistakes,particularly where a detainee cultural background informs the way he interacts with law enforcement officials and judges 
obviously,the consulate can also assist in more practical ways.the consulate can do more than simply process passports,transfer currency and help contact friends and family back home.the consulate can provide critical resources for legal representation and case investigation.indeed,the consulate can conduct its own investigations,file amicus briefs and even intervene directly in a proceeding if it deems that necessary.lee,consular law and practice.importantly,the consular officer may help a defendant in obtaining evidence or witnesses from the home country that the detainee attorney may not know about or be able to obtain.springrose,strangers in a strange land,geo.immigr.at.many of the protective functions performed by the consulate will come to bear later in the present case.
on august,osagiede met a man named michael braxton in a sears parking lot in chicago,illinois.osagiede handed braxton a clear plastic bag containing grams of heroin.braxton handed him in cash.unbeknownst to osagiede,braxton was already in trouble with the law and had agreed to cooperate with federal law enforcement agents.the august,transaction was the second of two controlled buys that had been arranged by federal agents who had placed the participants under surveillance.federal agents arrested osagiede on march.the government faxed a consular notification form to the nigerian consulate on the same day.the government concedes,however,that it never notified osagiede of his right to contact the nigerian consulate,as article and federal regulations require.
five days later,osagiede and two braxton and henry hicks were charged in a superseding indictment with four counts of heroin distribution and conspiracy to distribute heroin in violation of a.attorney kenyatta tatum served as osagiede counsel for most of the proceedings.tatum never informed osagiede of his vienna convention rights and never raised the issue with the government or with the presiding judge.on january,after tatum insisted that osagiede would face only an sentence,he pleaded guilty plea to one count of distributing grams of heroin.see a.
the base sentencing level for the felony distribution of grams of heroin was.the government,however,planned to rely on testimony and nine wiretapped recordings to establish that osagiede had actually distributed grams of heroin in similar drug transactions.this relevant conduct would increase osagiede base offense level to,creating a sentencing range of to months.in a sentencing proceeding before judge lefkow,braxton and hicks both testified against osagiede.braxton,who had closer contact with osagiede than did hicks,estimated that he had bought approximately grams of heroin from osagiede.braxton also admitted,however,that when he was asked by federal agents to identify osagiede in a photo,he mistook osagiede for his cousin,akeem lasisi,with whom braxton also dealt.there were also questions about whether the phone number called by braxton to set up the deals belonged to osagiede or lasisi.lasisi had apparently returned to nigeria and was nowhere to be found.the government had made little or no effort to find him,despite his connections to the case.
because of the inconsistencies in braxton testimony,it was important that the government have corroborating evidence.the voices on the tape recordings,however,were difficult to decipher because the men had strong nigerian accents.osagiede vigorously denied that it was his voice on the tapes.tatum told osagiede that the only way to dispute the accuracy of the tapes was to hire an expert.osagiede family scrounged up the money,and tatum sent the tape recordings to a voice analysis expert.for reasons that are somewhat unclear,the expert was only able to properly analyze one of the nine tapes.the analyst determined that the one recording that was properly analyzed did not contain osagiede voice.tatum offered the analyst report to the district judge at the sentencing hearing.surprisingly,the government admitted that osagiede was not the man speaking on the ninth tape recording.the other recordings,however,appear to have been allowed in as evidence.the district court then found by a preponderance of the evidence that osagiede had committed the relevant conduct and determined his base offense level to be.
osagiede was finally sentenced on may,in a proceeding before judge kocoras.osagiede explained that he had fallen in with the wrong crowd since his arrival in the united states.what he really wanted to do was to pursue an family has a proud tradition of academic he vowed to set himself back on track.the district judge noted that the evidence of relevant conduct presented a close call.that issue,however,was already decided.the district judge sentenced osagiede to months in prison,which was below the recommended sentencing guidelines range.osagiede did not appeal.
on april,osagiede filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the northern district of illinois,contending,inter alia,that he was denied his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.see strickland,d.osagiede asserted that the government failed to notify him of his right to consult with the nigerian consulate as mandated under the vienna convention.he argued,correctly,that the rights conferred by the vienna convention were individual rights.he also argued,correctly,that counsel failure to know the laws applicable to his case could constitute constitutionally deficient performance.osagiede then analogized the right to consular assistance to miranda rights and claimed that dismissal of the indictment was the remedy that his counsel should have sought.but dismissal would not,in fact,have been an appropriate remedy.
on december,judge korcoras denied the petition without holding an evidentiary hearing.the district judge did not revisit the close call on relevant conduct or the problems with the tape recordings.judge lefkow had been the presiding judge at the relevant conduct hearing.judge korcoras explained that dismissal of the indictment had never been recognized as a remedy for an article violation.thus,it would have been extremely unlikely that a motion to dismiss the indictment by osagiede attorney would have been successful.osagiede counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise an argument likely to fail.
osagiede then filed a pro se application for a certificate of appealability on january,which we must accord a liberal construction.see bruce united states,cir burris united states,cir wilson phend,cir.w e can hardly demand of a layman and pauper who draws his petition behind prison walls the skill of one trained in the law.tomkins missouri.pro se petitioners will,at times,confuse legal theories or draw the wrong legal implications from a set of facts.see barnett hargett,cir.but we do not treat every technical defect as grounds for rejection.
of course,osagiede is required to construct his basic argument and to allege facts sufficient to support it.here,osagiede alleged a recognized and undisputed violation of his rights,under the federal regulation if not under the convention itself.see galbraith united states,cir aleman united states,cir.osagiede legal argument about why his counsel was ineffective may have referred to the wrong form of relief dismissal of the indictment but he nonetheless alleged the essential fact that the government denied him consular assistance and his lawyer did nothing about it.see hall bellmon,cir.as b suggests,a district court will sometimes have to look beyond the face of the motion to the record,see united states,cir,and treat unincluded allegations of apparent facts as part of the petition,see williams griswald,cir internal quotation omitted.as we shall explain more fully later,the record shows evidence of possible prejudice.thus,the basic structure of osagiede argument is clear.
on may,we issued a certificate of appealability to osagiede,finding that he had made at least a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right under the sixth amendment.c.osagiede is entitled to an evidentiary hearing unless the files and the records of the case conclusively show that he is entitled to no relief.see b.
ineffective assistance of counsel claims are,of course,brought to vindicate the sixth amendment right to counsel,since the right to counsel is the right to effective counsel.see strickland,at,d.it has long been established that foreign nationals within the territory of the united states are protected by the sixth amendment.see wong wing united states.while osagiede sixth amendment claim centers on his lawyer failure to raise an article violation,we must bear in mind that he is seeking relief under the under the convention.see,at,d ginsburg,concurring noting that the defendant did not include a,claim along with his direct vienna convention claim in his initial habeas petition.
the government has taken the rather extreme position that osagiede ineffective assistance of counsel,any ineffective assistance of counsel claim based upon an article strickland as a matter of law.the government asserts that no court has ever recognized that article confers individual rights in a criminal proceeding.even if such rights were to exist,the government argues,the vienna convention provides no remedy for their violation.instead,the sole means of enforcing the convention are through political and diplomatic channels.at oral argument,the government even suggested that it would be inappropriate for us to entertain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on an article violation.that would be tantamount to recognizing a remedy for a vienna convention violation,something the government believes to be verboten.
we must take a moment here to unpack the government argument.to begin,we believe that the government has failed to fully appreciate the distinction between claims and constitutional claims.because this is a sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claim,it is controlled by strickland and its familiar test.whether rights and remedies are available under article of the vienna convention is relevant only to the extent that it helps prove or disprove one of these elements.as we know,the distinction between rights and remedies is often a slippery one.for simplicity sake,we will discuss the question of individual rights under the deficient performance prong and the question of remedies under the prejudice prong.as we shall explain,we have always assumed that article confers individual rights,even in the criminal setting,and we stand by that position today.further,we believe that there was a viable and simple remedy for the article violation alleged in this case counsel could have informed osagiede of his right to consular assistance and the violation could have been raised with the judge presiding at trial.
before proceeding to our strickland analysis,however,we must address the government argument that forecloses foreign nationals from bringing ineffective assistance of counsel claims based on article violations.a close reading of suggests otherwise.while the court rejected the argument that the treaty itself required suppression as a remedy,the court stressed that there were other means of vindicating vienna convention rights,at,d.specifically,the court stated that a defendant could raise an article violation as a part of a broader constitutional challenge,such as a challenge to the voluntariness of a statement under the fifth amendment,d see also united states ortiz,cir.
more importantly,the court suggested that the sixth amendment could also serve as a vehicle for vindicating article rights.in a telling passage,the court noted that an attorney failure to raise an article violation would not be cause for overriding a state procedural default rules,unless the attorney overall representation falls below what is required by the sixth amendment,at,d emphasis added.the court went on to explain that the attorneys in that case were aware of their clients vienna convention rights and had made a strategic decision not to pursue them.id.thus,nothing had prevented the defendant from raising an claim predicated on his trial counsel failure to assert the state violation of those rights.id.at.ginsburg,concurring.because the defendants had abandoned their ineffective assistance of counsel claims,however,the issue was not before the court id.at.the inclusion of this discussion in the court opinion was no accident the viability of ineffective assistance of counsel claims had been discussed extensively at oral argument.indeed,justice ginsburg stated that it was critical for her that the defendant did not raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim along with his direct vienna convention claim.see,at,d ginsburg,concurring.through ineffective assistance of counsel claims,full effect could be given to article.id.
thus,we reject the notion that forecloses foreign nationals from bringing ineffective assistance of counsel claims based on article violations.in fact,appears to express a preference for subsuming vienna convention claims in broader constitutional attacks,rather than basing relief entirely on the treaty itself.with this general matter settled,we move to our strickland analysis 
to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,osagiede must show that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness when measured against prevailing professional norms,and but for the deficient performance,there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at,d.we scrutinize each claim in light of the totality of the circumstances,see,after engaging in an individualized analysis.williams taylor,d.
we review the denial of an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion.see bruce,at.when reviewing a decision to deny a petition for habeas corpus,we review factual issues for clear error and legal issues de novo.see galbraith,at.the district court provided purely legal arguments in dismissing osagiede petition on the first prong of strickland our review is thus largely de novo.
an evidentiary hearing on a motion is required unless the record conclusively show s that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.b.ineffective assistance claims often require an evidentiary hearing because they frequently allege facts that the record does not fully disclose.see shaw united states,cir.further,they generally require an evidentiary hearing if the record contains insufficient facts to explain counsel actions as tactical,see united states leonti,cir,or if further factual development might demonstrate prejudice,see ivory jackson,cir.we examine each of the prongs in turn.
effective performance by counsel representing a foreign national in a criminal proceeding is reasonable performance under prevailing professional norms.strickland,at,d.we must reconstruct the situation faced by osagiede counsel as it would have appeared to a reasonably competent lawyer representing a foreign national in illinois in.id.at.lilly gilmore,cir.we look to various sources in our attempt to reconstruct the situation including statutes,regulations,case law and professional guidelines but none of these sources alone is dispositive.strickland,at,d.
osagiede claim is a common one in sixth amendment cases.in essence,osagiede argues that his lawyer should have been aware of his legal rights under article and should have acted to protect them all lawyers that represent criminal defendants are expected to know the laws applicable to their client defense.julian bartley,cir accord dixon snyder,cir mason hanks,cir freeman lane,cir.the government does not contest the fact that it failed to notify osagiede of his right to contact his consulate.this failure to notify violated article of the vienna convention,as well as federal regulations promulgated to ensure compliance with article see.the law was on the books the violation was clear.simple computer research would have turned it up.
the government argues,however,that article does not create any individual rights that could have been invoked by counsel as a basis for relief.osagiede counsel was not objectively deficient,the government argues,because any argument she might have raised would be futile.see rodriguez united states,cir.in support of its argument,the government asserts that no court had ever held that the vienna convention created individually enforceable rights in the criminal setting.this is simply incorrect numerous courts had held by that article created individual rights,even in the criminal setting the courts that did not hold that article created individual rights almost invariably assumed that article did confer individual rights in fact,a reasonable illinois lawyer would have known that this court has never held that article did not create individual rights instead,we have always assumed that it did see united states lawal,cir united states,cir.thus,it was clearly established across the country that either the vienna convention created individual rights or courts would proceed as if it did 
we also believe that an illinois lawyer,in particular,would have known to raise the article violation.in the wake of breard,three district courts in illinois had squarely held that the vienna convention created individually enforceable rights.see madej schomig,c,wl,at coar,muro,d at mills,d at scott.in,the central district of illinois held unequivocally that foreign detainees had an individual right to consular notification under article,d at.when the issue of individual rights arose again in muro,the central district stated flatly that it had already addressed the issue in and reiterated that the defendant had a private right to consular notification.muro,d at.
after and muro were decided,the international court of justice issued two landmark decisions holding that article did,in fact,provide the detained foreign national with individual rights.see lagrand case germany united states,june,case concerning avena other mexican nationals mexico united states,march.the dramatic legal and political developments that led up to the lagrand and avena cases drew widespread attention at local,national and international levels shortly after lagrand,the northern district of illinois ruled that lagrand had settled the issue of whether the vienna convention conferred individual rights.see madej,wl,at.its language was clear after lagrand,no court can credibly hold that the vienna convention does not create individually enforceable rights.id.madej itself was discussed within the chicago legal community.see patricia manson,judge expands rights of foreigners,chicago daily law bulletin,september,at.the government failure to notify osagiede of his vienna convention rights occurred only months after madej was handed down,and osagiede sentencing hearing was held in the northern district.in this situation,we believe that the article violation should have rung a bell with a reasonable attorney.
further,at the time of osagiede sentencing,the illinois institute for continuing legal education guide for defending illinois criminal cases stated in unequivocal terms attorneys should advise all clients that they have the right to consular notification of their arrest under the vienna convention and that such notification request should be made part of any assertion of rights to silence and counsel a ttorneys representing clients should advise them t
