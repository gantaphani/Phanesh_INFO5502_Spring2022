a south carolina jury convicted william henry bell of the armed robbery and murder of dennis hepler.on the jury recommendation,the state trial court sentenced bell to death.after exhausting his state remedies,bell filed a petition for federal habeas relief,challenging his convictions and death sentence on numerous grounds.the district court denied habeas relief,but granted a certificate of appealability on all claims.finding no error,we affirm the denial of federal habeas relief.
on direct appeal,the supreme court of south carolina upheld bell conviction and sentence.see state bell.in doing so,that court described the facts of this case as follows 
the victim in this case,dennis hepler,was the principal of west franklin street elementary school in anderson,south carolina.his body was found outside the school around on september.he had been shot twice with a caliber pistol,once in the back and once in the back of the head.appellant fingerprints were found on the victim red car which was parked on the street in front of the school.two witnesses from a nearby apartment complex placed appellant in the area between and on august with john glen and kevin young.
appellant was arrested on the night of september.that night,he gave police officers the first of four statements in which he denied ever having been at the west franklin street school.on september,appellant asked a guard at the detention center to contact the arresting officers.appellant then gave a second statement.he stated he was walking near the school with john glen and kevin young.appellant stopped to talk with a girl.when he rejoined his friends,john glen was inside a red car that was parked in front of the school and was trying to remove a cassette player.at glen request,appellant held the car door open.a man came out of the school and shouted at them.kevin young stepped from behind a wall in front of the school and shot the man in the back.while appellant and glen ran from the scene,they heard a second gunshot.when young caught up with them,the three obtained a ride with a fourth youth.young still had the gun.the next day,young threw the gun into some bushes in front of his house.
on september,appellant gave two more statements.first,he told police officers that he,young,and glen were walking on the school grounds on the night of august.appellant and glen attempted unsuccessfully to get the cassette player out of the car.they heard the sound of a door opening and joined young behind a wall near the school building.young said,the man probably has a wallet.when a man came out of the school,young moved behind him and told him to relinquish his wallet.the victim complied and young shot him in the back.the gun jammed.the victim begged them not to shoot him again.young shot again.the three fled the scene and obtained a ride with a fourth youth.they split from the wallet,for each of the three and for the driver of the car,and threw the wallet out of the car.
finally,appellant gave a fourth statement essentially identical to the third except that it states he took the gun from young after it jammed,unjammed it,and shot the victim himself.all four statements were admitted into evidence after an extensive jackson denno hearing.appellant did not testify at either phase of the trial.

after the supreme court of the united states denied bell petition for a writ of certiorari,bell south carolina,d,bell filed an application for state relief.the state pcr court permitted discovery and held an evidentiary hearing but denied relief in a lengthy written order.the supreme court of south carolina denied review.
bell then petitioned the district court for federal habeas relief,challenging his convictions and sentence on grounds.a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation,finding all claims either procedurally barred or without merit.the district court,after conducting a de novo review and correcting certain legal errors,issued a comprehensive,opinion denying all federal habeas relief.bell applied for a certificate of appealability on all claims presented in his petition,which the district court granted.see c west supp.
on appeal,bell raises numerous challenges to his convictions and sentence.he argues that the state court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing on two different juror partiality claims.bell also maintains that the state unlawfully based its decision to seek the death penalty on his race and the race of his victim.he similarly asserts that the prosecutor peremptorily struck a potential juror because of her race.additionally,bell contends that he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel because of his lawyer failure to request a certain jury instruction.finally,bell asserts that the district court applied an incorrect standard of review in evaluating his claims.we consider each of these arguments,beginning with the challenge to the standard of review 
we conduct de novo review of a district court decision on a petition for writ of habeas corpus based on a state court record.spicer roxbury corr,cir.under d,as amended by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,a federal court may grant an application for habeas relief on a claim that has been previously adjudicated on the merits in state court only if that adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.the supreme court has directed that u nder d unreasonable application clause a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.williams taylor,d.bell contends that the district court erred in choosing to apply d deferential standard of review,and that this case must be remanded to the district court for a de novo review of the facts and law with respect to every claim for relief.brief of appellant at footnote omitted.bell bases his claim on the fact that the state pcr court,after receiving briefs,invited proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law from both parties it received none from bell and largely adopted the state proposed memorandum and order.in response to bell challenge to this procedure,the state pcr court noted that the proposed order was examined line by line and considered with the entire record but acknowledged that a substantial portion of the state proposed order was adopted by the court,explaining that this was due to the states cogent reasoning and thorough treatment of the issues.
although we do not applaud this practice,circuit precedent dictates that it does not provide any basis for applying de novo review.indeed,we recently rejected precisely this claim by kevin young,one of bell.see young catoe,cir.young maintain ed that the standard of review mandated by the aedpa amendments should not govern his ineffective assistance claim,inasmuch as the pcr court order of dismissal adopted almost verbatim the state legal memorandum which evidences the lack of a considered decision within the meaning of paragraphs and of d.id.in rejecting young claim,we held that the disposition of a petitioner constitutional claims in such a manner is unquestionably an adjudication by the state court.if that court addresses the merits of the petitioner claim,then d must be applied.id.citations omitted.
recognizing young force here,bell attempts to distinguish the case.he asserts that young primarily involved a challenge under d,with young claiming that the signing of a party proposed order was not an adjudication while in bell case d is implicated,not just d and d requires that is reliable and reasonable.brief of appellant at.the distinction fails.as the district court noted,in young we stated that the petitioner was proceeding under both prongs of and did not differentiate between those prongs in rejecting his argument.young,at.in sum,young forecloses bell de novo standard of review argument.thus,the district court correctly applied deferential standard of review to bell claims,as will we.
bell argues that his sixth amendment right to an impartial and competent jury was violated because,during the evening,the sequestered jurors consumed alcohol and part ied with the south carolina law enforcement division sled officers,who guarded the jury but did not testify at trial,which lessened the jury sense of responsibility.brief of appellant at.bell contends that he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on these claims.
after the trial,sled conducted an investigation and issued a report on these allegations.bell moved for a new trial based on this report.the supreme court of south carolina denied the motion.the state pcr court,however,permitted bell to attempt to secure substantiation of these allegations by taking limited depositions of jurors and alternates.bell deposed and produced affidavits from multiple jurors,as well as sled officers,a patron at the hotel bar,and a defense investigator.the discovery indicated that,while the sequestered jurors and sled officers may have consumed alcohol together at the hotel during the evenings after trial days,sled officers did not influence or attempt to influence the verdict in any way.
for example,alternate juror bobbie sue smith,who made the majority of the allegations,initially stated that some jurors drank excessively during the evenings and that she suspected another alternate juror who did not deliberate was having an affair with a sled officer.however,smith later admitted in one of many discrepancies between her affidavit and deposition testimony that she did not know if the two had sexual relations so the word affair then may very well need to be taken off.smith also later acknowledged that none of the jurors appear ed to be under the influence of alcoholic beverages when they left the hotel in the morning to go to court.another juror stated that jurors drank during meals and in the evening but n o one,however,was incapacitated or incompetent to be a juror because of drinking.still another juror,donald brock,testified that sled agents did not purchase alcohol for jurors,although they would bring in alcohol brought by family members to the hotel parking lot for jurors to drink in the evenings.he stated that the sled officer identified by smith acted professional ly,and that he did not suspect or have any information that the officer was romantically involved with any juror.
the parties also deposed james smith,a hotel bar patron,who had telephoned bell defense counsel after the trial and reported that he had observed jurors drinking in the hotel.smith was in the hotel bar during two nights of the jury sequestration.he testified that he observed a person he believed to be a juror purchasing and consuming an excessive amount of alcohol at the bar.he also related that he had glanced a couple of times for maybe five seconds into a room that he thought contained jurors,who were drinking.in addition,bell proffered that the hotel bartender would testify to things very similar to smith,that is that jurors came in and obtained drinks on various nights,several nights,three trays with to drinks per tray,and would then take it back to the day room.finally,a defense investigator authored a hearsay affidavit relating asserted interviews with various jurors.none of those hearsay statements indicated that sled agents attempted to talk to the jurors about the case prior to or during jury deliberations.
after discovery,the state filed a motion in limine to exclude the deposition testimony of all jurors.the state pcr court held a hearing,at which it found that before it could go behind a jury verdict,there has to be strong and clear evidence that jurors were corrupted in some fashion.failing to find such evidence,the court concluded that the further testimony of any juror as subpoenaed would be held inadmissible under rule of the south carolina rules of civil procedure evidence.the court also excluded the testimony of bar patron smith and the hotel bartender because of the lack of any suggestion in that testimony that alcohol affected jury deliberations 
the state pcr court order,made pursuant to south carolina rule of evidence b,which is identical to the federal rule,was not contrary to clearly established federal law.federal rule of evidence b prohibits juror testimony regarding any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other juror mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict or concerning the juror mental processes but permits juror testimony on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror.
in tanner united states,d,the supreme court construed rule b in considering a defendant argument that a trial court erred in not ordering an additional hearing at which jurors would testify concerning drug and alcohol use during the trial.unlike this case,in tanner,the jurors allegedly used drugs and consumed alcohol during the lunch breaks at various times throughout the trial,causing them to sleep through the afternoons.id.at.the supreme court held that,under rule b,juror intoxication is not an outside influence about which jurors may testify to impeach their verdict.id.at.under tanner,the juror testimony offered by jurors consumed alcohol during the evening hours at the hotel,possibly with the assistance of and in the company of sled clearly inadmissible.indeed,tanner held that much more serious allegations of juror drinking during trial lunch breaks and drug use during the trial did not render juror testimony admissible.
although bell also proffered evidence of juror alcohol consumption from nonjurors the hotel bar patron and bartender evidence permitted under tanner,at.state pcr court reasonably found this evidence did not indicate any outside influence on the jury verdict.importantly,bell has produced no evidence that sled officers attempted to influence the verdict in this case at any time prior to or during deliberations.thus,the state pcr court decision was not contrary to clearly established federal law.
bell next argues that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claim that the husband of the only juror,deborah williams,received a threatening phone call at home during the trial,and that he told his wife williams about the threat.
the state pcr court permitted bell to take discovery on this claim as well.bell again bases his claim on the allegations of alternate juror bobbie sue smith,who testified that deborah williams called home to her husband who said there had been some phone calls to their home.smith did not remember williams mentioning specifics about what they said,or what they were going to do to them or anything of that nature.she indicated that they were threats.smith testified that williams looked shaken,surprised,and frightened.she further testified that three other jurors heard williams discuss the phone calls to her home.
the parties also deposed the juror,williams,who directly contradicted smith testimony.williams testified that,although she received a phone call from her husband,she did not tell the other jurors about it rather she only reported it to one of the sled officers guarding the jury.moreover,she described the call as follows all i told him the sled officer was that somebody called asking was i there,and that was it,you know.i guess he wrote it down.that was all there was to it.it was nothing to it.her husband did seem to be concerned about it,because they did say anything.her husband did get any threatening phone calls and she never received any threats whatsoever.according to williams,the caller also did not mention the bell case.finally,williams testified that nothing happened during the trial that made her feel pressured or coerced as a juror.
after reviewing the depositions,the state pcr court refused to permit additional testimony because there ha d been no suggestion that williams actually felt threatened or coerced to the point that it affected her deliberations.in its final written order,the state pcr court reiterated that this claim was without merit because it was refuted by the deposition testimony of this juror.
we must presume that the state court correctly determines factual issues.see e.bell has the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.id.he has not carried that burden in this case given williams sworn deposition testimony that her husband did not receive any threatening phone calls,that the caller merely asked if she was home and did not mention the bell case,and that she did not feel coerced or pressured in any way during the trial.in the light of this record and the state court factual findings,the state pcr court did not err in denying bell an evidentiary hearing.
bell,an,also argues that he is entitled to relief under mccleskey kemp,d,because the state solicitor decision to seek the death penalty rested on racial animus.bell bases this claim on a study conducted for the defense by professor theodore eisenberg,who examined the solicitor patterns of seeking the death penalty where the defendant was black and the victim was white,versus cases where both the defendant and victim were black.brief of appellant at.
at the outset of the mccleskey court fourteenth amendment analysis,it noted that to prevail under the equal protection clause,mccleskey must prove that the decisionmakers in his case acted with discriminatory purpose.id.at.emphasis in original.the court acknowledged that it ha d accepted statistics as proof of intent to discriminate in certain limited contexts,such as and title vii cases.id.at.however,it distinguished capital sentencing decisions on a number of grounds,including the fact that e ach jury is unique in its composition,that any decision to impose the death penalty r ests on consideration of innumerable factors that vary according to the characteristics of the individual defendant and the facts of the particular capital offense,and that,whereas in and title vii contexts,the decisionmaker has an opportunity to explain the statistical disparity,in the capital sentencing context,the state has no practical opportunity to rebut such studies given the prohibitions against questioning jurors on the motives and influences that led to their verdict.id.at.citations omitted.
in capital sentencing cases,moreover,the policy considerations behind a prosecutor traditionally wide discretion suggest the impropriety of our requiring prosecutors to defend their decisions to seek death penalties,often years after they were made.id.at.internal quotation marks,footnotes,and citation omitted.thus,absent far stronger proof,the court held that it is unnecessary to seek such a rebuttal,because a legitimate and unchallenged explanation for the decision is apparent from the record mccleskey committed an act for which the united states constitution and georgia laws permit imposition of the death penalty.id.at.footnote omitted.in conclusion,the court held that b ecause discretion is essential to the criminal justice process,we would demand exceptionally clear proof before we would infer that the discretion has been abused.id.at.
in mccleskey,at,the court also cited with approval our decision in shaw martin,cir.there,the habeas petitioner argued,based on a study,that south carolina prosecutors were more likely to seek the death penalty if a defendant had killed a white victim than if he had killed an victim.shaw,at.we found the study flawed because it included cases in which the prosecutor had no discretion to seek the death penalty did not adequately compare murders of similar atrocity and failed to take into account many other factors entering prosecutorial discretion,such as the willingness of the defendant to plead guilty or whether the prosecutor has sufficient evidence to prove a defendant guilty.id.at.we held that the proffered evidence would not have been of sufficient probative value on the issue of discriminatory intent to have required response,and,thus,no evidentiary hearing was required.id.at citation omitted.
with these principles in mind,we turn to bell contention.
bell argues,based on professor eisenberg study,that race was a significant factor in the prosecution of homicide cases by george ducworth,the solicitor who chose to seek the death penalty against bell.brief of appellant at.bell asserts that the study exposed significant disparity in the prosecutor decision to seek the death penalty where the defendant is black and the victim was white,versus cases where both the defendant and victim were black.id.at.thus,based on the compelling statistical evidence and the facts of this case,the illegitimate factor of race infected the prosecutor decision to seek the death penalty against bell,in violation of the fourteenth amendment.id.at.
the state pcr court carefully considered professor eisenberg study,in which he analyzed data compiled by researchers associated with bell counsel.in an evidentiary hearing before the state pcr court,professor eisenberg explained that there seems to be a correlation between race of defendant and race of victim and prosecutorial decisions to issue notices of intent to seek death in anderson county in particular when a black defendant is charged with the murder of a white victim.specifically,the researchers found data on eleven cases in which anderson county prosecutors sought the death penalty from.defendants were charged with killing white victims in six cases,and the anderson county prosecutors issued a notice of intent to seek death in four of the cases.in the other murder cases involving other racial combinations,prosecutors issued a notice in seven cases.
applying mccleskey and shaw,inter alia,the state pcr court found the eisenberg study flawed for a number of reasons,including the study was unable to account for the existence or lack of statutory aggravating circumstances,without which the prosecution may not seek the death penalty,and also was unable to account for the existence or lack of mitigating circumstances the study was unable to compare murders of a similar aggravating nature and to consider other factors pertinent to the decision to seek the death penalty,such as the defendant role in the murder,his prior record,his willingness to plead guilty and the sufficiency of the evidence and the study included and cases,although ducworth was not elected until.
the court further concluded that ducworth,like the prosecutor in mccleskey,had a legitimate reason for seeking the death penalty,namely that bell committed a crime that permitted the death penalty under the united states constitution and south carolina law.finally,the pcr court held that,even if bell had made a prima facie showing of discriminatory intent,the solicitor credible testimony at the relief hearing clearly rebut ted any claim of discrimination.at the hearing,ducworth explained that he sought the death penalty in bell case based on,inter alia the strength of the state case the existence of aggravating circumstances the desires of the victim family and bell role in the murder.
the state pcr court application of mccleskey was not unreasonable.in mccleskey,the court set forth very exacting standards for entitlement to constitutional relief based on statistical evidence of and effects.sexton french,cir.the eisenberg study,which suffers from some of the shortcomings we identified in shaw,does not constitute the exceptionally clear proof demanded by mccleskey at.see also sexton,at.moreover,the state pcr court reasonably considered the fact that bell committed a crime punishable by death,mccleskey,at,and ducworth explanation of his reasons for seeking the death penalty in bell case.
bell next contends that the state peremptorily struck a prospective juror,katherine galloway,for racially discriminatory reasons in violation of his equal protection rights and batson kentucky,d.he argues that the prosecutor stated grounds for striking galloway,namely her views on the death penalty,cons
