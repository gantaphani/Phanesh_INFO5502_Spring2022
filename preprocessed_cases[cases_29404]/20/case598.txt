appellee han tak lee was convicted of murdering his daughter based primarily on scientific evidence that,as the commonwealth now concedes,is discredited by subsequent scientific developments.lee thus filed a habeas petition claiming his conviction violated due process.the district court granted habeas relief,and we affirm.
lee daughter,ji yun lee,suffered from severe mental illness throughout her life,experiencing both suicidal and homicidal ideation.she lived with her family in new york during the summer of.in the early morning of july,police officers found lee retrieving personal items from the street that his daughter had thrown out the window.the officers entered the house and found ji yun in a manic state,arguing with family members who were urging her to take her medications.the officers observed no evidence of violence against her.
at the suggestion of his pastor,lee took his daughter the same day to camp hebron,a religious retreat in monroe county,pennsylvania.her erratic behavior continued.soon after arriving,ji yun went for a walk and returned several hours later soaking wet,having jumped into a body of water.later that day,she became agitated and had to be physically restrained.a few hours after midnight,a fire began in the lees cabin.han tak lee escaped,but his daughter died.
the commonwealth charged lee with arson and murder.during an trial,it relied heavily on and evidence to argue that lee intentionally set the fire to kill his daughter.the defense countered that she set the fire as a suicidal act.lee was convicted on both charges and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
on direct appeal,the superior court of pennsylvania remanded for an evidentiary hearing on claims.during that hearing,the court also received evidence about developments in the field of fire science that,according to a prior panel of our court,provided ample reason to question the reliability of the arson investigation.lee glunt,cir.the trial court nonetheless denied lee claims,the superior court affirmed,and the pennsylvania supreme court denied appeal.
in lee filed a pro se petition in state court.the commonwealth did not comply with the court order to respond,and the petition remained pending until when the attorney who is now representing lee filed leave to amend the petition.he submitted an amended petition in,arguing that lee was entitled to a new trial because of newly discovered and exculpatory scientific evidence,and appellate counsel was ineffective on direct appeal by failing to raise a claim of exculpatory evidence.the court of common pleas denied the petition for relief,the superior court affirmed,and the supreme court of pennsylvania denied appeal.
lee filed a habeas petition in the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania,claiming that his conviction violated due process because it was based on inaccurate and unreliable evidence and his continued incarceration also lacked the due process due him because newly developed scientific evidence showed he was probably innocent the district court denied lee petition and request for an evidentiary hearing because claims of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence are never grounds for federal habeas relief absent an independent constitutional violation.lee tennis,wl.
a panel of our court reversed on appeal.explaining that lee petition raised a claim rather than a innocence claim,lee,at,we ordered the district court to grant discovery and then reconsider whether to hold an evidentiary hearing.id.at.we instructed that lee must show that the admission of the fire expert testimony undermined the fundamental fairness of the entire trial because the probative value of the fire expert evidence,though relevant,is greatly outweighed by the prejudice to the accused from its admission.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted,alteration in original.we also implied that habeas relief should be denied if there is ample other evidence of guilt.id.at quoting albrecht horn,cir.
on remand,magistrate judge carlson held an evidentiary hearing and issued a report recommendation r r finding that the admission of the fire expert testimony undermined the fundamental fairness of the entire trial because the verdict rest ed almost entirely upon scientific pillars which have now eroded.lee tennis,wl,at june,hereinafter r r.it also found that the commonwealth failed to show other ample evidence of guilt upon which the jury could have relied.id.at quoting albrecht,at.
along with a memorandum,the commonwealth filed three objections to the r r before the district court 
it underplayed the strength of the commonwealth case in general.
it overstated the importance of the differences between the spectrographs for lee pants and shirt,and the jug and the glove found at the fire scene.
lee has not been exonerated by the new fire science evidence.
the district court rejected the third objection because,as explained in our prior opinion in this case,lee claim does not require a showing of innocence.lee tennis,wl,citing lee,at.in addition,the court rejected the first and second objections because the commonwealth failed to identify with specificity any legal or factual errors in the r id.in the absence of any proper objections,the district court reviewed the r r for clear error and adopted it without changes.id.at.it then issued an order granting habeas relief unless the commonwealth retr ied or release d lee within days.id.at.
the local rules in the middle district of pennsylvania require filing a notice of appeal electronically.the district electronic filing system requires that the moving party simultaneously pay a filing fee.as the credit account for the county of monroe limits payments to,the commonwealth was unable to pay the fee by credit card.instead,it mailed a notice of appeal along with a check on september.the district court clerk office received the package on september,exactly days after entry of judgment.the docket initially indicated that the notice was filed the next day,september,but a few weeks later the clerk office noted on the docket that the f iled date for the notice of appeal has been corrected to reflect the date of,the date it was received by the court.
ii.jurisdiction 
a certificate of appealabilty is not required when a state appeals a grant of habeas relief.fed.b see also lambert blackwell,cir.we thus have appellate jurisdiction under and a if the commonwealth filed a notice of appeal within days after the entry of judgment.
lee first argues that the notice of appeal was untimely because the clerk office did not file it until days after entry of judgment.this is a.under federal rule of civil procedure d,a notice of appeal is filed by delivering it to the clerk,and is delivered when received by the clerk,parissi telechron,per curiam t he clerk receipt of the notice of appeal within the day period satisfied the requirements of.united states solly,cir the date of receipt by the clerk office controls,rather than the date it is filed by the clerk personnel.the parties and the clerk office all agree that the notice was received on the day.that it was not filed officially until the day after is irrelevant to our jurisdiction.
lee next argues that the notice of appeal can not confer appellate jurisdiction because its format did not comply with local rules.as he points out,under federal rule of civil procedure d a court may allow papers to be filed by electronic means and may require electronic filing if reasonable exceptions are allowed.id.emphasis added.local rule in the middle district of pennsylvania states that a ny document required or permitted to be filed shall be filed electronically.according to lee,the commonwealth notice of appeal is invalid because it was submitted on paper in violation of the local rules.
once more we disagree.the federal rules require that a notice of appeal a specify the party taking the appeal b designate the judgment being appealed and c name the court to which the appeal is taken.fed.c.courts employ a commonsense,purposive approach to determine whether a notice of appeal complies with the rules.gov t of the virgin islands mills,cir.indeed,imperfections in noticing an appeal should not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about who is appealing,from what judgment,to which appellate court.becker montgomery,mills,at see also id.at a s long as the judgment the party intends to appeal is fairly discernible,a notice of appeal will be deemed sufficient even though it references the wrong case number or the wrong judgment date.citations omitted.lee does not argue that the notice of appeal failed to answer any of these three critical questions.following the ninth circuit,we thus reject the argument that the notice of appeal was invalid simply because it violated a local electronic filing requirement see klemm astrue,cir a notice of appeal is filed when it is received by the clerk,notwithstanding deficiencies in form that violate local rules,including failure to comply with the local electronic filing rules.
federal rule of civil procedure d supports our conclusion.it states that the clerk must not refuse to file a paper solely because it is not in the form prescribed by these rules or by a local rule or practice.d.in addition,federal rule of appellate procedure c provides that an appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form of the notice of appeal.our conclusion is further supported by lee failure to argue that the paper submission prejudiced him in any way.mills,at while a lack of prejudice will not save a notice that totally fails to comply with the rules,courts understandably are more willing to overlook a notice flaws in the absence of prejudice to the opposing party.citations omitted sanabria united states,a mistake in designating the judgment appealed from is not always fatal,so long as the intent to appeal from a specific ruling can fairly be inferred by probing the notice and the other party was not misled or prejudiced.
lee jurisdictional challenge is unpersuasive for another reason as well.in parissi,the supreme court held that a clerk office can not reject a notice of appeal simply because the filing fee has not been paid at u ntimely payment of the fee did not vitiate the validity of petitioner notice of appeal.we have similarly instructed the clerk offices in the third circuit to accept and retain every notice of appeal tendered whether or not accompanied by the filing fee.gould members of the div.of water pol y and supply,cir.this rule applies whether a human clerk or an electronic filing system receives the notice.see farzana.dep t of,cir the software that operates an system acts for the clerk as far as rule is concerned a step forbidden to a person standing at a counter is equally forbidden to an automated agent that acts on the court behalf.royall ass of letter carriers,t he electronic case filing system failure to docket royall timely submitted notice of appeal can not be treated as a failure on his part to file timely.his situation is akin to one in which the clerk office misplaces a filing and then later makes the docket entry when the filing is found.
the parties agree that the middle district electronic filing system rejects notices of appeal that lack a simultaneous fee payment.appellant br.at appellee br.at.if lee were correct that under local rule parties can not establish appellate jurisdiction by submitting a paper notice of appeal,then the commonwealth could not have submitted a notice of appeal without simultaneously paying the required filing fees.this arrangement would clearly violate parissi.if so,local rule would violate the federal rules by failing to provide a reasonable exception to the local electronic filing requirement.d,and the commonwealth could not be held responsible for its violation.
as we have appellate jurisdiction,we proceed to the merits.
iii.standard of review 
aedpa deference 
e of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa requires federal habeas courts to afford considerable deference to state courts legal and factual determinations.palmer hendricks,cir.a panel of our court previously held,however,that deference does not apply here.lee,at we therefore review the case without deference.
plain error 
the district court rejected the commonwealth first and second objections to the r r because they failed to identify with specificity any factual or legal errors.it thus reviewed the r r for clear error rather than conducting a de novo review.on appeal,the commonwealth does not challenge this legal conclusion.w here a party fails to file timely objections to a magistrate judge r r in a habeas proceeding,and the district court then adopts the r r,we only review the r r for plain error.nara frank,cir.lee argues that plain error thus applies because the district court,in effect,decided that the commonwealth failed to file any proper objections at all.as the commonwealth concedes,its briefing does not dispute that plain error review applies.oral argument tr.at at oral argument we asked why plain error review is inappropriate,and the only response was that the commonwealth had provide d some citations to the r r when it raised its objection with regard to magistrate judge carlson characterization of the evidence.id.in our own review of the objections,we find no such citations to the r furthermore,a few citations would not have addressed the district court more fundamental concern that the commonwealth objections had no basis in law or fact contained in the r r to be called into question.lee,wl,at.as the commonwealth fails to challenge this determination on appeal and fails to give any meaningful reason why plain error review is inappropriate,that is the review we undertake.
we therefore reverse only if there is an error,that is plain,that affects substantial rights,and that seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.nara,at internal quotation marks omitted.
a panel of our court previously held that lee must show that the admission of the fire expert testimony undermined the fundamental fairness of the entire trial because the probative value of that evidence,though relevant,was greatly outweighed by the prejudice to the accused from its admission.lee,at alteration in original citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the district court accepted magistrate judge carlson conclusion that the admission of and evidence at lee trial met this standard and the commonwealth does not challenge this determination on appeal.instead,it merely argues that the district court erred by accepting magistrate judge carlson conclusion that the trial lacked ample other evidence of guilt.id.at citing albrecht,at.we now turn to the evidence presented at trial,including for the sake of completeness the now discredited evidence.
unreliable evidence at trial 
fire science evidence 
the commonwealth does not object to magistrate judge carlson assessment of the evidence presented at trial.he described it as follows.state police fire marshal thomas jones testified that the fire was caused by arson based on two sources of evidence.first,he found patterns of deep charring,alligator charring charring shaped like alligator skin,and crazed glass finely fractured glass,all of which were consistent with a fire deliberately started with accelerant fluids.r r at.second,he found at least eight separate points of origin located throughout the cabin.according to the r r,this was powerful evidence that someone intentionally started eight different fires in the cabin in rapid succession.id.that one of the points was located at the cabin door suggested that the arsonist had acted in a particularly calculated fashion,setting fire to the escape path in the cabin,and effectively entombing ji yun lee within a wall of flames.id.at.jones cited no other independent scientific evidence that arson caused the fire.id.
fire protection specialist daniel aston also testified on behalf of the commonwealth.relying on the same evidence discussed by jones,aston opined that the fire was set deliberately and with an accelerant.id.he stated that the last fire was set at the front door of the cabin and that the arsonist left the structure and probably lit the cabin from the outside at that point.id.based on the s
