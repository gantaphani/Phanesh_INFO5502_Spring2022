after linscott was indicted on two counts of gross sexual imposition,he initially pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.upon entry of his plea,the ohio trial court ordered linscott to undergo a psychiatric evaluation pursuant to ohio revised code.a final report of the psychiatric evaluation,which was conducted by a psychodiagnostic clinic,was addressed and sent to the trial judge.the report indicates that linscott was informed that the results of the evaluation would not be confidential and would be summarized in a report to the court.the record does not reflect whether linscott received a miranda warning prior to the evaluation.

on january,linscott was discharged from the voa program because of several violations and an inability to adjust to the program.on february,the trial court held that linscott had violated the terms of his community control and sentenced him to serve two consecutive prison terms.at the hearing,the trial judge again noted that the psychiatric evaluation had been considered.the trial court also noted that it had considered a report that the voa program had prepared after discharging linscott.
linscott timely appealed both his sentence and his sexual predator classification in state court.the ninth district court of appeals of ohio consolidated these appeals,in which linscott raised five assignments of error.linscott second assignment of error,which forms the basis of his federal habeas petition,challenged the use of the,psychiatric evaluation during sentencing.on january,the ninth district court of appeals ruled on the appeal.the appellate court denied linscott first assignment of error,which pertained to a denial of rights to which linscott claimed he was entitled because of his mental disabilities.upon reaching the second assignment of error,which concerned the use of the psychiatric evaluation,the court stated that,pursuant to ohio appellate procedure,this court disposition of the first assignment of error renders defendant second assignment of error moot and accordingly,it will not be addressed.state linscott,wl,ohio.the appellate court did sustain linscott third assignment of error,which concerned sentencing,and his fourth assignment of error,which concerned the sexual predator classification,and remanded the case for resentencing and redetermination of the sexual predator classification.

linscott has asserted in his first assignment of error that the trial court erred in considering the psychodiagnostic report which was compiled as a result of his not guilty by reason of insanity plea,and the voa termination report,in sentencing and adjudicating him a sexual predator.linscott previously raised this argument with respect to the psychodiagnostic report in his first appeal.see linscott i,supra,at.this court declined to address the issue in linscott i,finding it moot based upon the disposition of another assignment of error.it appears that linscott has attempted to argue that this court should now address the issue because in linscott i we did not state this court reasons for finding the assignment of error moot.as this court decisions in linscott i are now the law of the case,we decline the invitation to revisit the issue.see nolan nolan,ohio,explaining that the doctrine of the law of the case provides that the decision of a reviewing court remains the law of that case in a case on the legal questions involved for all subsequent proceedings in the case at both the trial and reviewing levels.
