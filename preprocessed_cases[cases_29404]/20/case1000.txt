appellant raymond dayle rowsey was convicted by a north carolina jury of murder on the bases of premeditation and deliberation and felony murder,as well as robbery with a firearm.he was sentenced to death for the murder.after exhausting state remedies,rowsey petitioned the united states district court for the middle district of north carolina for a writ of habeas corpus under.the district court denied his petition,and rowsey now appeals.we affirm in part and dismiss in part.
on the evening of march,rowsey and his half brother,raymond lee steele,were hanging out at steele house,playing cards and listening to the radio.shortly after midnight,the two men decided to walk to a local circle k convenience store.they arrived at the store around 
once at the store,the men obtained some change from the store clerk,howard rue sikorski,and played several dollars worth of video games.next,they went to the back of the store to look at the movie display.rowsey then decided he wanted to buy a snack.steele gave rowsey two dollars and rowsey picked up two bags of and paid for them at the counter.rowsey then pulled a gun out of his coat,pointed it at sikorski,and clicked the gun without firing it.he turned and smiled at steele,telling steele that he had scared the store clerk with a water gun.
the gun,however,was not a water gun.rowsey turned back towards the victim and shot him in the face.after the victim fell to the floor,rowsey leaned over the counter and shot him again.rowsey then ran around the counter,fired at least two more shots,and kicked the victim three or four times in the back of the head.
steele ran out of the store and rowsey ran out after him,still carrying the gun in one hand and something else underneath his arm.during the walk home,steele asked rowsey why he shot the victim.rowsey said he was initially just playing,but he thought that he saw the victim reaching underneath the counter for a gun.rowsey later told steele that he kicked the victim to ensure that the victim died.he also told steele,however,that the victim was still alive and gasping for air when rowsey ran out of the store.
back at steele house,rowsey counted the cash that he had taken from the circle k cash register.he told steele that he had grabbed the money to make the shooting look like a robbery and to make the shooting worthwhile.in total,rowsey took in cash and several adult magazines from the store.steele would not accept half of the money,but did accept a bill that had been taken from the register.he also cleaned the murder weapon for rowsey and provided rowsey with bullets to reload the gun.
the victim body was discovered at approximately on march.an autopsy revealed six gunshot wounds one to the face,one to the back of the neck,one to the right side of the head,and three to the back.the autopsy also revealed several injuries to the victim head and neck area.
store managers determined that in cash and several adult entertainment magazines were missing from the store.among the missing cash was a bill.the store had a record of the serial number of that bill which allowed police to track it.on the afternoon of march,steele attempted to make a purchase with the marked bill and was arrested shortly thereafter.
steele initially made several false statements denying any involvement in the murder,but he eventually admitted that he was present during the murder.rowsey was arrested later that day and subsequently charged with murder and armed robbery.steele pled guilty to murder and robbery with a dangerous weapon in exchange for his testimony at trial.
at trial,rowsey tried to finger steele as the shooter.rowsey questioned steele regarding a letter that steele had written to rowsey that allegedly concluded with the phrase even though you did do it.steele admitted to writing the letter,but denied writing the concluding line.rowsey also introduced testimony from two jail inmates who testified that they overheard conversations between rowsey and steele during which steele acknowledged that he,not rowsey,had killed the victim.the state countered this testimony,however,with substantial evidence indicating that rowsey was the shooter.the state introduced evidence of rowsey shoe prints in the blood around the victim head,and evidence that rowsey possessed the murder weapon both before and after the murder.furthermore,steele provided extensive testimony recounting the events of the murder and bolstering the state claim that rowsey was the shooter.
given the weight of the evidence,the jury concluded that rowsey was indeed the shooter and convicted him of both murder and armed robbery.at sentencing,rowsey introduced evidence indicating that he had come from a broken home and suffered a difficult childhood.the state introduced evidence that rowsey had broken into a church and stolen worth of items only weeks before the murder.the state also introduced evidence of rowsey prior criminal record,which included fifteen counts of injury to personal property in,one count of possession of a malt beverage by a minor in,and two counts of misdemeanor larceny in.
the jury returned a recommendation of death.on october,the trial judge entered judgment and sentenced rowsey to death.the supreme court of north carolina affirmed the conviction and sentence,state rowsey,and the united states supreme court denied certiorari,rowsey north carolina,d.
rowsey then filed a motion for appropriate relief mar in north carolina state court.see.the state mar court entered an order directing discovery and denying rowsey the right to proceed ex parte for the purpose of seeking a mitigation expert.the state mar court heard arguments from counsel but did not hold an evidentiary hearing.by order dated october,the state court denied rowsey mar,and the north carolina supreme court denied certiorari on june.
next,rowsey filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the middle district of north carolina.a united states magistrate judge reviewed rowsey petition and recommended dismissal.on february,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation.rowsey lee.the district court also declined to issue a certificate of appealability coa.id.rowsey now appeals.
unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability,an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court.c a.a coa may issue only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.id.
a court determination of a petitioner claims is guided by the principles set forth in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,which limits federal review of collateral attacks on state convictions.under d,federal courts may not grant a writ of habeas corpus when a state court has already resolved the merits of a claim,unless the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases.williams taylor,d.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established supreme court precedent if the state court confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of the supreme court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from that precedent.id.at.a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if it correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case.id.at.
if the district court applies the deferential aedpa standard and rejects a petitioner constitutional claims on the merits,the petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.slack mcdaniel,d.otherwise a coa will not issue.
after oral argument in this case,the supreme court elaborated on this requirement in cockrell,d.
as mandated by federal statute,a state prisoner seeking a writ of habeas corpus has no absolute entitlement to appeal a district court denial of his petition the coa determination under c requires an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.we look to the district court application of aedpa to petitioner constitutional claims and ask whether that resolution was debatable amongst jurists of reason to that end,the supreme court opinion in slack held that a coa does not require a showing that the appeal will succeed.accordingly,a court of appeals should not decline the application for a coa merely because it believes the applicant will not demonstrate an entitlement to relief.
id.at internal citation omitted.
on the other hand,the supreme court made clear that its holding should not be misconstrued as directing that a coa always must issue.statutes such as aedpa have placed more,rather than fewer,restrictions on the power of federal courts to grant writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners it follows that issuance of a coa must not be pro forma or a matter of course.id.at internal citation omitted.
in this case,rowsey argues that rowsey due process rights were violated by the bias and partiality of the trial judge the state unconstitutionally applied its capital sentencing statute by arbitrarily deciding to seek the death penalty in rowsey case rowsey right to effective assistance of counsel was violated when his trial counsel failed to seek a clarification of a juror response to questions during the jury poll and rowsey due process and equal protection rights were violated by the imposition of a death sentence when the trial jury did not return a unanimous death verdict.we address each argument in turn under the above standards.
first,rowsey argues that his due process rights were violated by the trial judge bias and partiality against him.both the mar court and the district court denied this claim.in order to determine whether a coa should issue,we ask whether jurists of reason could have resolved this claim differently.at.while we grant the coa,we affirm the district court judge dismissal of the claim.
rowsey alleges that the trial judge made nineteen separate comments that demonstrate unconstitutional bias.these comments included statements that the trial judge was never going to try another capital case that the judge did not like any individual voir dire that if individual voir dire was granted the judge would go back to durham and wait three weeks and counsel should call him when they were through that any delay or what he considered delay would affect trial counsel compensation and that if the jury returned a death sentence,the defendant should be taken from the courthouse to the circle k where the murder occurred,shot six times and stomped in the head.rowsey argues that these comments,taken together,prove that the judge was not impartial in his case.for his part,the judge had no recollection of making the alleged statements.
while a fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process,not all claims of bias rise to a constitutional level.withrow larkin,d quoting in re murchison.in order to prevail in a deprivation of due process claim,a defendant must show a level of bias that made fair judgment impossible.liteky united states,d.the state mar court reviewed the entire record and found that the trial judge conducted the trial in a fair and impartial manner and the district court agreed.given the nature of some of the comments,however,we recognize that reasonable jurists might find the district court assessment debatable.we therefore issue a coa on this claim and proceed to the merits.the question now turns to whether the state mar court decision was contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.see williams taylor,d.
o pinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings,or of prior proceedings,do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a favoritism or antagonism liteky,at.most of the comments rowsey alleges the trial judge to have made demonstrate expressions of impatience,dissatisfaction,annoyance,and even anger,and do not rise to the level of impermissible judicial bias.id.at.we do agree with the district court that some of the alleged remarks,such as the suggestion that the victim was gay and the defendant was probably a latent homosexual,push ed private judicial commentary to its ethical limit.all of the alleged comments,however,were made outside the presence of the jury.rowsey points to nothing the trial judge said or did in the jury presence that would portray a biased outlook on his case.it was the jury,not the trial judge,that found rowsey guilty and recommended a sentence of death.therefore in order to argue that he was deprived of a fair trial,rowsey must also show that the trial judge bias somehow affected the outlook or deliberations of the jurors.
the district court extensively reviewed the trial record and found that the trial judge went to considerable lengths to ensure that rowsey obtained a fair trial.as the district court pointed out,the trial judge repeatedly made discretionary rulings in favor of rowsey.for instance,during voir dire the trial judge granted rowsey challenges for cause several times,and even hesitated to dismiss a potential juror who stated that he would automatically vote against the death penalty.at trial,the judge ordered a redaction of rowsey statement to the police that he had brandished a gun at a restaurant one day prior to the murder,and over a hearsay objection allowed testimony by an inmate to the effect that the inmate had heard steele admit to being the shooter.
despite these numerous rulings in rowsey favor,rowsey argues that the trial judge bias played a role in the judge decision to submit,over rowsey objection,the statutory mitigating circumstance that rowsey had no significant history of prior criminal activity.under north carolina law,if the evidence presented might support a statutory mitigating circumstance then the judge must submit that circumstance,even over the defendant objection.rowsey,at citing state ingle.on direct review the north carolina supreme court held that because rowsey prior convictions consisted of mostly property crimes and no felonies,a rational juror could have concluded that rowsey did not have a significant prior criminal history,and that the submission of the mitigating factor was mandatory.id.at.we agree with the north carolina supreme court and find no basis for the assertion that the trial judge decision was motivated by improper bias.
rowsey has offered no evidence that the trial judge alleged partiality in any way affected rowsey right to a fair trial.like the district court,we can not conclude that the state mar court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law in holding that rowsey received a fair trial.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of this claim.
next,rowsey argues that,north carolina capital sentencing statute,was applied to deny him his equal protection rights.rowsey argues that his steele was as culpable as he was.because steele was permitted through a plea bargain to avoid the possibility of a death sentence,rowsey contends north carolina decision to try him capitally was arbitrary and in violation of the sixth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.the state mar court denied this claim and the district court found that the mar court decision was not contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.we inquire only whether the district court resolution was debatable amongst jurists of reason.at.
t he decision to prosecute is particularly to judicial review.wayte united states,d.the government therefore retains broad discretion in prosecutorial decisions,so long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute,and the decision to prosecute is not deliberately based u
