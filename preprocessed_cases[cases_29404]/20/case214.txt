james michael kater,who is serving a life sentence for murder and kidnapping,appeals from the district court denial of his petition for habeas corpus relief under.our review is subject to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat.kater habeas petition raises,inter alia,a due process claim based on the introduction of a prior bad act for the purpose of establishing identity,an unusual voir dire claim,and a claim under the confrontation clause related to the introduction of testimony by previously hypnotized witnesses.we reject kater claims,affirm the district court denial of the petition,and resolve one issue of first impression for this court.
we address kater assumption that in a federal habeas proceeding on de novo review of a state court judgment under fortini murphy,cir,we may apply a new rule of law,which was not clearly established by existing precedent at the time the state conviction became final.our circuit law has not yet addressed this aftermath issue to fortini,which held that,preserved federal constitutional claims on habeas would be reviewed de novo,when such claims were not adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings.d fortini,at.while we consider such claims de novo,that does not mean we review those claims as an original matter,as if the claims were raised on direct appeal.rather,the claims of habeas petitioners,even on de novo review under fortini,continue to be limited by the principles laid out in teague lane,d,and its progeny,which generally bar claims that require the application or announcement of new rules of law.
this case has an over history in the courts of massachusetts.we begin with a thumbnail sketch of that history to set the stage.
kater was indicted in in massachusetts for the kidnapping and murder of a girl,mary lou arruda.he was convicted in,but the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc reversed the conviction because certain hypnotically aided testimony had been introduced at trial.commonwealth kater kater i.the sjc ordered the trial court on remand to hold a hearing and to admit only such testimony as was based on memories.commonwealth kater kater ii.after two more trials ended inconclusively kater was tried for a fourth time kater was convicted after his fourth trial,in this conviction was upheld by the sjc.commonwealth kater kater vii.it is the affirmance of his conviction at his fourth trial which is at issue here.
before the fourth trial began,the state trial court ordered that the testimony of previously hypnotized witnesses be limited to facts that had been documented in the record before the witnesses had been hypnotized.id.at.this was more favorable to kater than the sjc directive that testimony be separated from hypnotically aided testimony.id.the trial court also ruled,at motion in limine before trial,that the prosecution could introduce evidence of kater state conviction for a similar kidnapping,for the purpose of establishing kater identity id.at.the sjc affirmed this ruling.id.at.
at jury selection,on kater motion and with the commonwealth agreement,the state trial court asked potential jurors individually a second round of questions.after describing kater prior conviction,the judge asked whether knowledge of that conviction would affect the jurors ability to accept and understand the presumption of innocence and the limitation on the use of prior bad act evidence to the issue of identification.id.seven of fifteen jurors were struck based on their responses to these questions.
the trial court later decided that voir dire on the prior bad acts was inappropriate,and excused the previously selected jurors.id.it did so for two reasons.first,it found that if evidence of other crimes were admitted,it would not be extraneous within the meaning of.laws ch,and voir dire would not be authorized.id.the court referred to state law provid ing that a trial judge must,for the purpose of determining whether a juror stands indifferent in a case,conduct an individual voir dire of each prospective juror if it appears that a substantial risk exists that an extraneous issue might affect the outcome of the case.id.citing.laws ch.the sjc said that,under massachusetts law,a n extraneous issue is one that goes beyond the record and raises a serious question of possible prejudice.id.at.second,the trial court found that if the evidence of prior bad acts were ultimately not admitted at trial,the questions would have then contaminated the jury.id.at.jury selection then began anew without any inquiry as to kater prior conviction.
the sjc affirmed the reasoning of the state trial court on the voir dire issue on state law grounds.id.at kater obstacle is that the issue of his prior similar crime was not extraneous here,the issue of kater prior similar crime did not lie beyond the record.evidence of the prior similar crime was fully relevant and probative on the issue of kater identity as the perpetrator.
we briefly recount the facts as found by the state court,which are detailed in kater vii,at.arruda disappeared in september while riding a bike near her home in raynham,massachusetts.her bike was found the same day nearby was a benson hedges cigarette and a car tire track with an acceleration mark and an abnormal tread wear pattern.two months later,in november,arruda clothed body was found tied to a tree.a pathologist testified that arruda had been tied to the tree while conscious,but that she lost consciousness and that the weight of arruda head against the restraint around her neck strangled her.id.at.
around the time arruda disappeared,five individuals saw a green car with a black or silver stripe speeding through the neighborhood where arruda had been abducted.id.four of these witnesses were hypnotized during the course of the investigation into arruda disappearance.kater i,at.at trial,the five witnesses testified that kater car was similar in color,size,and markings to the car they had seen on the day of arruda disappearance.kater vii,at.one person described the driver of the car as a white male with dark curly hair and glasses.police developed a composite sketch of the driver based on eyewitness accounts.id.at.
while arruda was still missing,kater was interviewed by the police.the police noted that kater smoked benson hedges cigarettes,and that his appearance matched both the composite sketch and the description of the driver given by one witness.kater allowed the police to search his car,a bright green opel with a black racing stripe.the right front tire tread of the car had a unusual wear pattern consistent with the tire track found near arruda bicycle.in the car the police found two cartons of benson hedges cigarettes and two pairs of glasses.in the trunk of the car,under some luggage,the police found two newspapers,each open to articles about arruda disappearance.kater made a statement to the police as to his whereabouts at the time of arruda disappearance,but the sjc found kater alibi to have been inaccurate.id.at.
kater,in,had pled guilty to a crime which the sjc stated was strikingly similar to the one perpetrated against arruda.id.at.evidence of this prior conviction was introduced at kater fourth trial for the purpose of establishing kater identity as the perpetrator of the crime against arruda.kater had abducted a girl,jacalyn bussiere,who was walking her bicycle on a secluded street.he forced her into his car and drove her to a wooded area.kater hit bussiere over the head and tried to force her face into a stream.after bussiere fought back,kater forced bussiere into the car again and drove her deeper into the woods,where he tied her hands,ankles,torso and neck against a tree this was similar to how arruda body had been found tied.bussiere lost consciousness for some time,but eventually managed to free herself and report the crime to the police.id.she identified kater as her assailant.id.at.
kater was convicted of the kidnapping and murder of arruda,and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.id.at.
it is a fundamental principle of the law of federal habeas corpus in cases that no habeas claim is stated as to state court criminal convictions unless the alleged errors are violations of the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.estelle mcguire,d see also c,a.errors based on violations of state law are not within the reach of federal habeas petitions unless there is a federal constitutional claim raised.estelle,at.
indeed,the question of whether anything at trial violated state law in a case is no part of a federal habeas court review of a state conviction.id.at.this reflects the reality under the constitution that the states are free to adopt any number of different rules for criminal proceedings so long as the application of those rules does not violate federal constitutional requirements.see id.at.cases in this court have long proceeded on the premise that the due process clause guarantees the fundamental elements of fairness in a criminal trial but it has never been thought that such cases establish this court as a rule making organ for the promulgation of state rules of criminal procedure.internal quotation marks omitted quoting spencer texas,d.
the commonwealth argues for dismissal of the petition on the basis that only claims are asserted.we agree with the commonwealth that if nothing other than questions of compliance with state law were at issue,no habeas petition would lie.there are,though,no clean and clear dividing lines for the federal courts as to when a state court ruling about state law,on evidentiary or other grounds,may transgress the constitution.the habeas petition here is framed in terms of violations of federal law,and we deal only with the federal questions presented.
the supreme court has defined the category of infractions that violate fundamental fairness very narrowly.dowling united states,d.the petitioner argues that his state trial was so fundamentally unfair as to violate due process of law under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution.kater argues that it was unconstitutional to admit certain types of evidence and not to conduct voir dire.he argues that evidence about his prior crime for which he was convicted in,which was admitted under the exception to the exclusion for prior bad acts evidence for evidence tending to show identity,was constitutionally barred.he also argues that his trial was fundamentally unfair because the trial judge refused to ask voir dire questions describing the evidence of the prior crime,already determined to be admissible,and asking whether the potential jurors would remain unaffected by the evidence.this failure to ask the voir dire questions,he says,resulted in a jury biased against him,in violation of the sixth and fourteenth amendments.kater also argues that it was unconstitutional to admit testimony from witnesses who were once hypnotized.finally,he says,the federal constitution was offended,under jackson virginia,d,when the jury convicted him based on insufficient evidence.
all of these issues were presented in federal constitutional terms to the sjc.the sjc ruled on the sufficiency of the evidence and admission of the prior bad acts in federal constitutional terms,see kater vii,at,and so we address these claims through the lens of the deferential statutory standards under aedpa.see d.as to these claims,kater must show the sjc decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.mccambridge hall,cir en banc quoting d.
as to the admission of evidence from witnesses and the voir dire issue,the sjc did not address those issues in federal constitutional terms,so our review is de novo.dibenedetto hall,cir see also fortini,at aedpa imposes a requirement of deference to state court decisions,but we can hardly defer to the state court on an issue that the state court did not address.before tackling the merits of kater claims,it is important to correct a flawed assumption,present in kater argument on the voir dire point,as to what de novo review under fortini means and to clarify our standard of review.
in the end,none of these purported dire,introduction of evidence,or sufficiency of a plausible claim of denial of federal constitutional rights,notwithstanding the very able advocacy by kater counsel.
de novo review in habeas cases 
in arguing that voir dire on the effect of prior bad act evidence is constitutionally mandated,kater points to state court cases,and argues that these cases suggest the way the supreme court would rule.kater wrongly assumes that de novo review after aedpa,which applies when the state court did not adjudicate the presented federal constitutional issue on the merits,see fortini,at means that this court can decide the issue as an original matter,whether or not the result would be the announcement of a new rule that has not yet been clearly established by existing precedent.not so.de novo review under fortini does not eliminate the need for a habeas court to engage in the analysis mandated by teague lane,d.
teague and its progeny remain good law after aedpa.teague analysis applies in habeas cases filed before aedpa effective date.see schriro summerlin,d.teague analysis applies even in cases to which the aedpa standard of review,d,applies.see horn banks,d per curiam noting that the aedpa and teague inquiries are distinct see also sepulveda united states,cir requiring teague analysis for claims of federal habeas petitioners under.kater a federal court engaged in de novo review does not ask whether a particular claim is based on already clearly established federal lead to an around the teague doctrine.
in its canonical form,teague generally bars habeas claims based on retroactive application of new rules announced after a state conviction has become final at.plurality opinion.this rule has also been interpreted to mean that habeas claims requiring the announcement of new rules are also generally barred.see saffle parks,d as petitioner is before us on collateral review,we must first determine whether the relief sought would create a new rule under teague.if so,we will neither announce nor apply the new rule sought by petitioner unless it would fall into one of two narrow exceptions.citations omitted.
to apply the paradigm of nonretroactivity required by teague,we must determine when the petitioner conviction became final and whether a state court considering the petitioner claim at the time his conviction became final would have felt compelled by existing precedent to conclude that the rule he seeks was required by the constitution.curtis duval,cir emphasis added quoting saffle,at.in other words,a rule is new under teague if it is not compelled by existing precedent.see also beard banks,d question under teague is whether,as of the time the conviction became final,the rule was dictated by precedent quoting lambrix singletary,d.
the teague analysis,while different than the aedpa standard,is related to aedpa review in at least one sense.that is because,under aedpa,the inquiry on habeas is whether the habeas claim is based on clearly established federal law.d see also williams taylor,d.whatever the differences between the teague analysis and the standard of review in aedpa,the focus of both is,in essence,on the substantive standards set by clearly established federal law.whether habeas review is under the deferential standard provided in d or under the de novo standard of fortini,state habeas petitioners may not seek release on federal law grounds which have yet to be clearly established.thus,in this case,it is irrelevant whether as the petitioner asserts the supreme court might someday recognize a constitutional right to voir dire on prior bad acts evidence.the question,under teague,is whether such a constitutional right was clearly established by existing precedent at the time the state conviction became final.
claims related to kater prior conviction 
we start with what may be the most important issue to arguments based on use of evidence of his prior conviction.it is commonly said that mere errors under state law in the admission of evidence are not cogni
