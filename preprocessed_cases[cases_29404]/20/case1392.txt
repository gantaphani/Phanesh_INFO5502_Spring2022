in this death penalty case,the state of ohio,through the respondent,warden margaret bagley,appeals the district court new trial order granting william montgomery petition for a writ of habeas corpus under,and its subsequent denial of the state motion to reconsider that order.see montgomery bagley,d.the district court issued the writ based on a finding that the state,in violation of brady maryland,d,withheld an exculpatory,pretrial police report that would likely have altered the outcome of the pretrial report that several witnesses had seen one of montgomery purported victims alive four days after the state alleged that he had killed her.montgomery the district court denial of his petition on several alternative grounds,including the state trial court failure to grant a change of venue despite negative pretrial publicity,the state failure to disclose certain other brady material,and the trial court failure to dismiss an incompetent juror.
the key issue for us to resolve under brady is whether the withheld police report is material to montgomery jury conviction or the jury imposition of the death sentence when viewed in light of the other evidence presented at trial.the warden argument that the withheld police report is not material has two components first,given the strength of the other evidence at trial implicating montgomery,the introduction of the police report would have made no difference in the outcome of the trial.second,in affidavits submitted to the habeas court years after the jury trial and seven weeks after the court had issued the writ,the state now claims that several of the pretrial witnesses have retracted their earlier statements,which now proves that the exculpatory report could neither be effectively used in a new trial to cast doubt on the state case,nor could it have led to such evidence in the past.
montgomery argues that the evidence at trial implicated his,glover heard,as the trigger man so that introduction of the withheld police report would have given the jury reasonable doubt as to his guilt.alternatively,on the issue of death,montgomery also contends that the police report would probably have created enough doubt in at least one juror mind to raise a question about his role as the trigger man,resulting in that juror rejection of the death penalty for montgomery.under ohio law,if only one juror rejects the death sentence,a life sentence would be imposed.ohio ann.d.
the law under brady follows the common sense proposition that the state must disclose the material exculpatory evidence to the defendant before trial,not afterward.see dist.attorney office for the third jud.dist.osborne,d emphasis added.it directs us not to retry the case by weighing the existing evidence against the excluded evidence,but rather to determine whether the excluded evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.kyles whitley,d.the brady due process rule concerning disclosure of exculpatory evidence complements and supports the sixth amendment rule requiring that in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,by an impartial jury of the state.the brady rule contemplates the ultimate trial of factual issues in a contemporary trial by a jury,not by a subsequent trial in federal habeas court.see kyles whitley,at.explaining that the criminal trial is the chosen forum for ascertaining the truth about criminal accusations.
in this capital case,the state is unable to effectively rebut three crucial propositions that control the outcome the withheld report is exculpatory and should have been disclosed before trial,it is material because,if true,it would likely change the outcome of the trial,and the ultimate determination concerning the truth of the withheld,what actually for the state courts to resolve.because,like the district court,we believe that the withheld,exculpatory report undermines confidence in the verdict as to both the guilt and sentencing phases of montgomery trial,we hold that montgomery deserves a new trial where all of the relevant evidence is considered by the jury.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court issuance of the writ and later denial of the state motion to reconsider.we pretermit the remaining issues raised in montgomery.
ii.facts found by state courts and procedural background 
a.the underlying crime 
the ohio court of appeals summarized the facts of the underlying crimes as follows 
on march,the lucas county grand jury returned a two count indictment charging montgomery with the aggravated murders of debra ogle and cynthia tincher while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery,in violation of b 
on september,the case proceeded to a jury trial at which numerous witnesses testified,including glover heard,who was also indicted for the aggravated murders of ogle and tincher but who pled guilty to one count of complicity to murder.through those witnesses,the following key evidence was presented.on february,montgomery purchased a bursa automatic handgun from cleland gun shop in toledo,ohio.this gun was subsequently identified as the weapon that was used to kill both ogle and tincher.at approximately on march,after an apparent argument with his girlfriend,montgomery went by taxi with glover heard to an apartment shared by ogle and tincher.montgomery was acquainted with the victims but heard was not.at this time,montgomery was wearing a dark blue pinstriped suit jacket that he had borrowed from randolph randleman,his uncle.subsequently,montgomery asked ogle to give him a ride home.after ogle agreed,she,montgomery and heard left in her car.before arriving at the destination,however,montgomery had ogle stop the car.he then walked her into a wooded area along hill avenue in toledo,ohio,while heard remained in ogle car,and then,for no apparent reason,montgomery shot ogle three times with the fatal wound inflicted while the gun was in direct contact with the top of her forehead.montgomery then returned to the car and he and heard drove back to the girls apartment.montgomery instructed heard to take ogle car.heard took the car but then abandoned it approximately one block from his residence.montgomery returned to the girls apartment and shortly thereafter left with cynthia tincher in her car.after leaving the apartment,montgomery had tincher pull to the side of the road and thereupon shot her through the head from a range of twelve inches or less.several witnesses testified that they saw a man of approximately montgomery height and weight leaving tincher car on the morning of march,at approximately.those witnesses testified,however,that the person they saw was wearing a dark jacket with a hood pulled up around his face.tincher body was discovered in her car at the corner of wenz and angola roads in toledo,ohio at approximately on march.montgomery lives approximately mile from that location.thereafter,at approximately noon on march,montgomery,heard and two friends,sidney armstead and eric wilson,got together to go to a mall.montgomery,however,was carrying a plastic bag and directed armstead to first drive him to a dry cleaner.armstead drove appellant to one hour martinizing where montgomery got out of the car with the bag.although they were unable to identify montgomery,employees of the laundry testified that on march,a black male showed them a soaking wet dark blue suit jacket that he wanted cleaned in one hour.the employees explained that the jacket would have to dry out before it could be cleaned.they then hung the jacket to dry.one employee testified that as it dried,the jacket made a brownish dripping mess on the floor.she further testified that the jacket was badly stained and that she had to clean the jacket three times using a chemical cleaner.she could not identify,however,what the stains were.subsequently,the jacket was picked up.several days later,police officers obtained the jacket from randolph randleman who identified the jacket in court as the one which he had loaned to montgomery.
as stated above,on march,at approximately,tincher body was discovered in her car at the corner of wenz and angola.soon thereafter,ogle was listed as missing.the following day,however,ogle car was discovered behind an abandoned house at norwood.thereafter,on march,crime stoppers received a telephone call from a michael clark who was at that time incarcerated in the lucas county jail.upon interviewing clark,officers obtained the name of glover heard.officers located heard and from heard they obtained the name of montgomery.officers then gained permission from montgomery mother to search her home,where appellant also lived.that search revealed a black leather jacket with a hood and the manual to the bursa handgun.subsequently,on march,officers went to randolph randleman home in an attempt to locate montgomery.at approximately noon,montgomery arrived at the home and told officers that he knew the officers were looking for him and he wanted to talk about the homicide.he was then arrested and taken to the police station for questioning.during the interrogation,montgomery initially stated that heard had killed both girls with his,montgomery,gun.he then changed his story but ultimately admitted that he had gone to the girls apartment for a ride home.he continued to insist,however,that heard had killed the girls and that he did not know where ogle body was.finally,however,montgomery admitted that he might be able to show officers where ogle body was and stated that it was on hill avenue near a market.officers then took montgomery to hill avenue and ultimately to a wooded area that appellant identified as the location.several officers began searching the area while sergeant larry przeslawski stayed in a patrol vehicle with montgomery.after the officers searched one wooded area for a few minutes,montgomery told sergeant przeslawski to direct the officers to search a different wooded area.within five minutes,the officers located the body of debra ogle.
at the conclusion of the trial,the jury found montgomery guilty of the aggravated murder of debra ogle with the specifications that said action involved the purposeful killing of two or more persons and that montgomery was the principal offender while attempting to commit aggravated robbery.the jury further found montgomery guilty of the lesser included offense of murder of cynthia tincher.at the conclusion of the mitigation phase,the jury recommended that montgomery be sentenced to death.the trial court agreed with the jury recommendation and ordered that appellant be executed

relief in state court 
after montgomery conviction was upheld on direct appeal,he began pursuing relief in state court.montgomery submitted seventy claims for relief to the state trial court,but his petition for relief was swiftly denied after the state successfully moved for summary judgment.the ohio court of appeals reversed and remanded,holding that the trial court neglected to give montgomery an adequate opportunity to respond to the state motion.on remand,the trial court permitted montgomery to respond,only to later reject his claims for a second time.the ohio court of appeals affirmed the denial of relief,and the ohio supreme court declined to review that decision.
relief in federal court 
having exhausted his available means for relief in state court,montgomery filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.this time,he alleged grounds for relief.after a comprehensive review of the matter,the district court denied all of montgomery claims except the alleged brady violation arising out of the state withholding of the aforementioned police report.in pertinent part,the police report read as follows 
david ingram stated that he and several friends were at the oak hill apartments on hill when they saw a blue ford escort with debbie ogle driving around the complex.later they again saw her as a passenger in the same auto.debbie ogle waved to them as they knew her from rogers high school.she was with a white male with long sideburns.she did not appear distressed.
the report was exculpatory in nature and important because the sighting of ogle took place at on wednesday,march,four days after the state had argued that montgomery murdered her.id.at.the district court not only concluded that the report was exculpatory but also found that there was no doubt that the state had refused to disclose the,it only emerged after a formal request for police records some six years after montgomery trial.id.at.finally,the district court considered whether the report was material under brady,that is,whether there was a reasonable probability that the outcome of montgomery trial would have been different had he been privy to the police report.finding that the police report met this standard,the district court issued the writ.
after the district court issued the writ,a toledo newspaper ran a story about the case and noted that the district court decision was based on the withholding of the police report.the news soon reached three of the people responsible for the police report,including david ingram,the man who called in the report shortly after seeing a woman he and his friends said was debra ogle.upon hearing the news,each of the witnesses telephoned the toledo police department to retract their earlier statement.they claimed that the woman they had seen turned out to be dianna ogle,the victim younger sister,a claim they had not made at the time of trial or subsequently.at the behest of the police,the witnesses quickly signed sworn affidavits to this effect.the state then filed the affidavits in the district court along with a rule e motion to reconsider the writ based on this new evidence.without passing on the materiality of the police report in light of the affidavits,the district court denied the rule e motion.it held that the affidavits were not properly before the court because they did not qualify as newly discovered evidence under rule,and therefore the court could not justify altering or amending a final judgment on the merits.
there are two distinct questions before our court.first,was the district court correct to grant the habeas petition and second,was the district court correct in refusing to consider the affidavits under rule e we answer both in the affirmative.
iii.the habeas petition 
the state challenges the issuance of the writ on three grounds.first,the state argues that the district court did not give due deference to the findings of the ohio state courts.second,the state argues that the police report did not qualify as evidence under brady because it would have been inadmissible at trial.and third,the state argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in determining that the withheld evidence was material under brady.
the deference issue necessarily turns upon the adequacy of the review of montgomery brady claim in state court.the ohio court of appeals determined that such information developed during an ongoing investigation was not sufficiently exculpatory to require disclosure under brady and limited its discussion only to the following conclusion 
montgomery asserted that the state wrongfully withheld exculpatory evidence that on march,at approximately,debra ogle was seen alive in the parking lot of her apartment complex by seven witnesses who went to high school with her.montgomery supports this claim with a police report taken at approximately on march.at that time,debra ogle was still considered missing although her car had been discovered abandoned behind a home several blocks from the home of the glover heard.that report reads in relevant part 
david ingram stated that he and several friends were at the oak hill apartments on hill when they saw a blue ford escort with debbie ogle driving around the complex.later they again saw her as a passenger in same auto.debbie ogle waved to them as they knew her from rogers high school.she was with white male with long side burns.she did not appear distressed.
the lower court concluded that this isolated information,recorded in the course of an ongoing investigation when all of the facts were still being pieced together and in the face of overwhelming evidence presented at trial that ogle had been killed on march,did not undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.we agree and conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing the fiftieth claim for relief.
montgomery,wl,at.
the district court characterized this review as cursory and commented that the issue warrants detailed analysis.montgomery,d at.it then went on to discuss the question of deference under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa in a detailed footnote 
section d constrained standard of review only applies to claims adjudicated on the merits in the state court proceeding.clinkscale carter,cir.when a state court does not assess the merits of a petitioner habeas claim,the deference due under the aedpa does not apply.newton million,cir maples stegall,cir.in such a case,the habeas court is not limited to deciding whether that court decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,but rather conducts a de novo review of the claim.maples,at benge johnson,d.
while the ohio court of appeals addressed this claim,it failed to explain why the fact that the investigation was ongoing and still being pieced together was sufficient cause for the state failure to disclose it to the defense.this cursory sic may not be construed as an adequate sic to explain its reasoning.moreover,to the extent that the court of appeals analysis of this claim is an adjudication on the merits,the court finds its application of brady to be unreasonable because it failed to provide more than a conclusory statement regarding the materiality of the withheld report.
the state attacks the district court ruling on deference by directing our attention to maldonado wilson,cir.in maldonado,we held that where a state court decides a constitutional issue without extended discussion,the district court must conduct an independent review,but that its inquiry remains the aedpa standard of whether the state court result is contrary to or unreasonably applies clearly established federal law.id.at quoting in part harris stovall,cir.the district court did not stray from this procedure here.after determining that the ohio court of appeals gave montgomery brady claim unduly short shrift,the district court rightly went on to perform an independent review.when that review led to a different conclusion,the district court upheld it only after finding as is required under aedpa that the state court determination to the contrary represented an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.
the state argument that the withheld police report is not evidence under brady because it was inadmissible hearsay is not well taken.the police report would have been inadmissible because it was hearsay,but evidence affecting credibility falls within the general rule requiring disclosure.giglio united states,d.the evidence would have seriously undermined the testimony of the state main witness,glover heard.on its face,the report years ago would have led to witnesses who would have cast serious doubt on the state case.failure to disclose such reports not only deprives the defense of certain evidence,but also has the effect of representing to the defense that the evidence does not exist causing defense counsel to abandon lines of independent investigation,defenses,or trial strategies that it otherwise might have pursued.united states bagley,d the reviewing court may consider directly any adverse effect that the prosecutor failure might have had on the preparation or presentation of the defendant case.the report qualifies as exculpatory evidence,and we,therefore,must assess the possible effect of the report and its materiality at the time of the jury trial years ago when defense counsel had to prepare and try the case.
materiality 
the state challenges the district court finding on materiality on two grounds.first and foremost,the state argues that its case in trial court was so strong that any potential testimony of witnesses claiming to have seen debra ogle alive on march would not have changed the outcome.the district court responded to this argument as follows 
m uch of the state case was made through heard,who gave police four different versions of his knowledge of the murders,and then testified to a fifth version at trial.while the state theory was that montgomery committed the murder to rob ogle,heard admittedly wound up with ogle car and wallet and testified that he was planning to take ogle car even in the absence of montgomery instruction to do so.under the circumstances,where the state theory was that tincher was killed to cover up ogle murder,the withheld police report revealing information suggesting that ogle was seen alive four days after she was allegedly murdered would have severely undercut heard credibility and destroyed the state timeline of the case.
montgomery,d at.this conclusion makes sense.the police report strikes at the heart of the state case in directly contradicting heard testimony.with heard sufficiently impeached,there was a reasonable probability that the jury may have disbelieved his testimony that montgomery was involved in the murders and,moreover,was the triggerman in both killings.the police report was thus material to the jury finding on guilt,giving rise to a violation of montgomery right to due process.see cone bell,d brady,at.
the report was also material to the jury later decision to impose the death penalty,giving rise to due process and eighth amendment violations.in lockett ohio,d plurality opinion,and its progeny,the supreme court established that the eighth amendment guarantees a capital defendant the right to introduce all relevant mitigating evidence in the penalty phase.the court noted that the eighth and fourteenth amendments require that the sentencer,in all but the rarest kind of capital case,not be precluded from considering,as a mitigating factor,any aspect of a defendant character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.id.emphasis in original see also eddings oklahoma,d.
the supreme court has also held that the due process clause requires that a state rules of evidence not be applied mechanically when doing so would preclude the defendant from introducing highly relevant evidence at the penalty phase.green georgia,d citing lockett,at.per curiam.following lockett and eddings,the exclusion of hearsay testimony at the penalty phase of a death penalty case violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment where t he excluded testimony was highly relevant to a critical issue in the punishment phase of the trial,and substantial reasons existed to assume its reliability.id.in green,the court reversed the death sentence based upon the trial court application of georgia hearsay rule to prohibit a witness testimony that the defendant accomplice in the capital murder had confessed to shooting and killing the victim after ordering the defendant to run an errand.the court held that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment may require the admission of mitigating evidence even if state law rules of evidence would exclude it.see green,at.
the government star witness,glover heard,testified that montgomery was the triggerman in both deaths.that damning testimony undoubtedly played a significant role in the jury decision to impose the death penalty on montgomery.had the jury heard testimony from the witnesses that they saw debbie ogle alive in the early hours of march,long after the state contends she was killed by montgomery,it may have raised enough doubt in the mind of one juror to sway that juror,even if he or she had voted to convict montgomery of the murders,to reject the death penalty.if even one juror had rejected imposition of the death sentence,a life sentence would have been imposed.ohio ann.d.the fact that there may have existed even one juror with a doubt about montgomery guilt or the nature of his participation in the crime leads us to question the reliability of the verdict as to the sentence and to conclude that the police report was material to the sentence imposed.
our dissenting colleague argues in her footnote that the withheld police report is irrelevant and unacceptable as a mitigating factor at the capital sentencing or mitigation phase of the trial because she characterizes it merely as the kind of residual doubt evidence that may not be considered on the issue of death by the jury under ohio law.the dissent proposed procedural rule forbidding the jury consideration of the police report in assessing evidence at the sentencing phase of the case excludes crucial evidence from the jury consideration of death.it violates both state and federal law for at least three reasons.
the dissent does not recognize that her residual doubt argument necessarily presupposes that the exculpatory evidence concerning the nature of the crime was offered in evidence in the first place and assessed by the jury at the guilt phase of the trial.she does not notice that the ohio statute,ohio b,expressly requires at sentencing that the 
trial jury shall consider,and weigh the nature and circumstances of the offense,the history,character and background of the offender,and all the following factors 
if the offender was a participant in the offense but not the principal offender,the degree of the offender participation in the offense and the degree of the offender participation in the acts that led to the death of the victim 
any other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death.
c the defendant shall be given great latitude in the presentation of evidence of the factors listed in division b of this section and of any other factors in mitigation of the imposition of the sentence of death.
in the instant case we are dealing with original,not residual,concealment of evidence at both stages of the trial.it was impossible for the jury to consider the exculpatory evidence at any phase of the or the state had completely concealed the statutorily allowed evidence concerning the circumstances of the offense,and the degree of the defendant participation in the offense.
eighth amendment law is not unclear or on this subject.eddings oklahoma says that states must allow any relevant mitigating evidence,d.franklin lynaugh,d,cited by the dissent,supports this rule.it merely holds that a state court did not have to give a residual doubt instruction to the jury.id.at.there was no brady exculpatory evidence involved in the lynaugh case.no evidence was concealed.the supreme court there makes it clear that the state trial court placed no limitation whatsoever on petitioner opportunity to press the residual doubts question with the sentencing jury.id.consequently,it is difficult to see how the rejection of these instructions denied petitioner the benefit of any residual doubts about his guilt.id.the supreme court repeats and again makes it clear that the mitigating evidence rule is mandatory 
our edict is that,in a capital case,the sentencer may not be precluded from considering,as a mitigating factor,any aspect of a defendant character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense.eddings oklahoma,d quoting lockett,at.
franklin,at.second emphasis added.
even if the question for the jury at sentencing could somehow be classified as an issue of residual doubt,the materiality inquiry in this brady claim is necessarily backward looking.we must determine whether there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different,united states bagley,d,and whether the withheld evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the death verdict,kyles whitley,d.as our dissenting colleague acknowledges,montgomery was entitled to rely upon such evidence as a mitigating factor at the time of his conviction and sentence in.see state watson,ohio,residual doubt of a capital defendant guilt may properly be considered in mitigation.in fact,at that time,the supreme court recognized the residual doubt strategy as an extremely effective argument for defendants in capital cases.lockhart mccree,d.thus,whatever language the dissent may use to characterize or denigrate the concealed report,the failure of the state to turn it over violated federal law at the time and is inconsistent with the present state statute quoted above,b,enforcing the admissibility at sentencing of evidence concerning the nature and circumstances of the offense and the degree of the offender participation.
at oral argument,the state took the position that police and prosecutors must determine what is material for the purposes of brady disclosures and,moreover,that this decision is immune from hindsight review by the courts.at oral argument,the following exchange took place 
court i think the state position is that it up to the prosecutor and the police to decide whether such evidence as this the withheld police report is true or not true.and depending on whether the prosecutor decides that the evidence is true or not true turns the brady materiality.
state your honor,that what i saying.that the position.
oral argument,june.the state offers no support for this proposition and betrays a fundamental misunderstanding by the attorney general of the law the state must follow.under brady,it is incumbent upon the state to turn over all favorable exculpatory evidence.it is not the sole arbiter of what must be turned over.see kyles,at.
as a secondary argument,the state contends that the police report was immaterial because it would not have led to the discovery of exculpatory evidence.for support,it relies on the three retraction affidavits filed years later.the affidavits do not undermine the brady claim until they become admissible and eligible for consideration.
iv.denial of the rule e motion to alter or amend 
the state appeals the district court denial of its rule e motion based on the three affidavits.rule e permits the amendment,alteration,or vacation of a judgment after its entry.see wright,miller,kane,federal practice and procedure ed.it is an extraordinary remedy and is therefore used sparingly.id.rule e motions may be granted upon a showing of newly discovered or previously unavailable evidence.id.to constitute newly discovered evidence,the evidence must have been previously unavailable.gencorp,amer.int l underwriters,cir.this requires a showing that the evidence could not have been discovered previously with due diligence.see wright,miller,kane,federal practice and procedure ed the moving party must have been excusably ignorant of the facts despite using due diligence to learn about them.see also bogart chapell,cir upholding the denial of a rule e motion where the movant presented no legitimate justification for failing to timely submit the evidence and had advance notice of the issues.infusion,minimed,cir a e motion to reconsider should not be granted unless the facts alleged could not have been discovered earlier by proper diligence.committee for first amendment campbell,cir t he movant must show either that the evidence is newly discovered and if the evidence was available at the time of the decision being challenged,that counsel made a diligent yet unsuccessful effort to discover the evidence.chery bowman,cir same.
the district court denied the state rule e motion based on a finding that the affidavits did not qualify as newly discovered evidence.it explained 
the state clearly can not establish that it exercised due diligence in procuring this evidence as is apparent by the addresses listed on their affidavits,the three affiants still reside in the toledo,ohio area.the state has not shown any reason why these witnesses could not have been contacted prior to the court issuance of the march,memorandum of opinion granting montgomery petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
we review the district court denial of the rule e motion for abuse of discretion,betts costco wholesale,cir,and find no such error in this case.the district court correctly noted that each of the affiants still lived in the toledo,ohio,area.what is more,the police report itself listed the name,address,and telephone
