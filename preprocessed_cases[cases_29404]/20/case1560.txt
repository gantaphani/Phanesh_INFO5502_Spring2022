romell broom broom appeals the district court denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to.broom was sentenced to death in ohio in for aggravated murder.we review the following six issues raised by broom brady violation,admission of other acts testimony,ineffective assistance of counsel at the mitigation phase,prosecutorial misconduct,denial of a continuance,and denial of the suppression of a identification.broom brady claim is based upon the fact that certain police reports were not made available to broom counsel prior to the trial but were later obtained as a result of ohio public records act requests and as a part of federal habeas discovery.the state argues that broom brady claim is procedurally defaulted due to the fact that the police reports were not used and the brady claim was not presented during broom state postconviction relief proceedings.broom responds that ohio case law prevented him from using the police records at issue and that he has demonstrated the requisite cause and prejudice such that his claim may be reviewed in spite of the procedural default.
for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the district court judgment denying broom habeas relief.
background 
on september,tryna middleton middleton,tammy sims sims,and bonita callier callier were at a high school football game.middleton was fourteen years old at the time,and she was a student at the high school.after the football game,the three girls began walking home,and they noticed a car that they thought looked suspicious.they walked away from the car and down a different street.a car without its lights on then came towards the girls and stopped in front of them the driver exited the car and ran past the girls.once the girls passed by the parked car,they heard footsteps behind them and then an assailant tried to grab all of them.in the course of the struggle with the girls,the assailant said,come here,bitch,and he pulled out a knife.middleton was not able to get away from the assailant,but sims and callier escaped.they ran to a nearby house,where the homeowner allowed them to call their mothers and the police.sims and callier described the car and the assailant to the police.approximately two hours later,middleton body was found in a parking lot she had been stabbed in the chest and abdomen and there were sperm cells found in her rectum and vagina.sims and callier were shown a series of photographs,but were unable to identify a suspect at this point.
there were two other incidents in the same area involving young girls.on september,venita mckenney mckenney was walking home when a car passed her and then stopped.when mckenney walked past the car,the driver got out and grabbed her.he also threatened mckenney with a knife,and he called her a bitch.residents who lived nearby heard the noise,and mckenney was able to escape into their home.the other incident occurred on december,involving melinda grissom grissom.a car was following grissom as she was walking home,and as she turned a street corner,a man passed her and then grabbed her from behind.the assailant began hitting grissom,and he threw her into his car.grissom younger sister observed what happened and summoned the girls mother,who ran outside and grabbed the car door.as her mother held on to the car,grissom was able to escape through the passenger door.two witnesses were able to get the license plate number of the car,which the police traced to william broom,broom father.when the police arrived,broom admitted that he had been driving the car.the police then took broom to the hospital,where both grissom and her mother identified him as the assailant.the other two witnesses to the incident also identified broom in a.
the similarities between these three incidents led the police to bring in the witnesses from the mckenney and middleton cases to view a.the victims and witnesses each independently identified broom from the sims and callier also identified him in a photo array.the police discovered that broom had been driving his girlfriend car before it was wrecked on november,and sims identified broom girlfriend car as the one from the night of the middleton incident.callier stated that it was the same kind and color as the car used during the incident.tests revealed that the sperm discovered in middleton vagina belonged to a person with type b blood,which is the blood type of approximately twelve percent of the population broom blood is type 
a cuyahoga county grand jury issued an indictment charging broom with the following aggravated murder of middleton with specifications for murder committed during the course of a kidnaping and rape rape of middleton kidnaping of middleton kidnaping of sims kidnaping of callier kidnaping of grissom kidnaping of mckenney and felonious assault of grissom.ii joint appendix at indictment.counts six through eight were severed,and broom was tried on the first five counts in proceedings that began on september.the jury found broom guilty on each of the charges,and at the end of the penalty phase,recommended a sentence of death.ii at op.the state trial judge sentenced broom to death in october,for aggravated murder.ii at journal entry.in addition,broom was sentenced to years of incarceration for the remaining counts.ii at journal entry.the state appellate court affirmed broom conviction,state broom,wl ohio.july,and the state supreme court affirmed the appellate court judgment,state broom,ohio.broom filed a petition for postconviction relief,which was dismissed on april.iv at entry.the state court of appeals affirmed the dismissal,state broom,wl ohio.may,and the state supreme court denied broom leave to appeal,state broom,ohio,table.
on june,broom filed a federal habeas petition in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio.i at pet r romell broom pet.for a writ of habeas corpus.the district court held an evidentiary hearing in january on the claim and the brady claim.xviii at evidentiary hr g tr.the district court filed an order and opinion on august,in which it denied habeas relief as to each of the issues presented.i at mem.order at.a certificate of appealability was granted as to the following issues admission of other acts testimony,ineffective assistance of counsel during the mitigation phase,brady violation,inadequate time for broom counsel to prepare for trial,and denial of the suppression of the identification by the grissoms.i at mem.order at.broom filed a timely notice of appeal.we issued a certificate of appealability for the additional issue of prosecutorial misconduct.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court findings of law,and we review for clear error its findings of fact.seymour walker,cir,cert.denied,d.broom filed his habeas petition after april,effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa and the provisions of that act thus apply in this case.lindh murphy,d.if a claim was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings,a writ of habeas corpus may be granted pursuant to aedpa if the adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or if it resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.in applying d,we adhere to the following guidelines set forth by the supreme court in williams taylor,d 
under the contrary to clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by this court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than this court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.under the unreasonable application clause,a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.
a federal habeas court may not find a state adjudication to be unreasonable simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.harris stovall,cir quoting williams,at,cert.denied,d.
broom claims that the state violated his due process rights according to the doctrine set forth in brady maryland,d,by failing to reveal material gathered by the police in the course of investigating the middleton case brady established that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment,irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.id.at.the supreme court has explained that there are three components of a true brady violation 
the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence must have been suppressed by the state,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice must have ensued.
strickler greene,d.broom did not present his brady claim to the ohio state courts,and the state asserts that the claim is procedurally defaulted appellee br.at.before we can analyze the merits of this issue,we must first determine whether broom failure to raise the claim in the state court proceedings precludes federal court review.
exhaustion 
broom first argues that his brady claim should not be barred because ohio did not have an available corrective procedure for presenting a brady claim revealed for the first time in public records obtained under the ohio public records statute.br.appellant at.this argument is based on the ohio supreme court case state ex rel.steckman jackson,ohio,which held that a defendant in a criminal case who has exhausted the direct appeals of his or her conviction may not avail herself or himself of to support a petition for postconviction relief.it is true that a failure to exhaust will not prevent a federal court from addressing a claim in a habeas case if there is an absence of available state corrective process.b b i.however,broom argument conflates exhaustion and procedural default,and it fails to recognize that procedural default may prevent him from raising his claim in federal court even if exhaustion does not technically bar the claim.
the supreme court has explained that the problem of waiver is separate from the question whether a state prisoner has exhausted state remedies.engle isaac,d see also thomas woolum,cir procedural default is distinct from the exhaustion requirement,an additional requirement added on top of exhaustion.the court explained that section b requires habeas applicants to exhaust those remedies available in the courts of the state.this requirement,however,refers only to remedies still available at the time of the federal petition.engle,at.in engle,the respondents were in essentially the same position as broom,because they completed their direct appeals and they were prevented by ohio law from raising a claim that could have been litigated before judgment or on direct appeal.id.citing ohio revised code a.the court concluded as follows since respondents could have challenged the constitutionality of ohio traditional instruction at trial or on direct appeal,we agree with the lower courts that state collateral relief is unavailable to respondents and,therefore,that they have exhausted their state remedies with respect to this claim.id.the engle opinion instead analyzed whether or not there was cause and prejudice to excuse the petitioner procedural default.id.at.as in engle,broom is unable to satisfy the narrow requirements to bring a second postconviction petition in the ohio state courts,and there is no longer an available state court remedy i at mem.order at.thus,exhaustion is not an issue before us,and we need only analyze broom brady claim with regard to procedural default.
procedural default 
we have explained the doctrine of procedural default as follows 
when a habeas petitioner fails to obtain consideration of a claim by a state court,either due to the petitioner failure to raise that claim before the state courts while remedies are still available or due to a state procedural rule that prevents the state courts from reaching the merits of the petitioner claim,that claim is procedurally defaulted and may not be considered by the federal court on habeas review.
seymour,at citing wainwright sykes,d.broom was entitled to raise his brady claim in the ohio state courts pursuant to ohio revised code a a,and because he did not do so,the claim is procedurally defaulted.procedural default may be avoided only by showing that there was cause for the default and prejudice resulting from the default,or that a miscarriage of justice will result from enforcing the procedural default in the petitioner case.seymour,at citing sykes,at.
the sykes opinion plainly implied that default of a constitutional claim by counsel pursuant to a trial strategy or tactical decision would,absent extraordinary circumstances,bind the habeas petitioner even if he had not personally waived that claim.murray carrier,d citing sykes,at.the carrier court elaborated on the meaning of cause we think that the existence of cause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel efforts to comply with the state procedural rule.id.at.the court not ed that a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel,or that some interference by officials,made compliance impracticable,would constitute cause under this standard.id.internal citations omitted.ineffective assistance of counsel may constitute cause,but a claim of ineffective assistance must generally be presented to the state courts as an independent claim before it may be used to establish cause for a procedural default.id.at.
broom offers several arguments as to why there was cause for the procedural default of his brady claim.we will discuss each of these arguments in turn below.
first,broom argues that the ohio supreme court decision in steckman foreclosed the use of records that were obtained while broom petition for state postconviction relief was pending in steckman,the ohio supreme court analyzed various aspects of litigation in the context of criminal proceedings one of the issues in the case involved a defendant effort to acquire police records for purposes of seeking postconviction relief.steckman,at.the court stated that the records in question were exempt from disclosure based upon the work product exception of the statute.id.at.steckman concluded that a defendant in a criminal case who has exhausted the direct appeals of her or his conviction may not avail herself or himself of to support a petition for postconviction relief.steckman,at.
there are two ohio court of appeals decisions interpreting steckman s rule to be a strict bar against any use of public records in the course of seeking postconviction relief these cases therefore support broom assertion that steckman prevented his use of the police records in his possession.see state walker,ohio app d,t he police reports which figure prominently in walker second petition could not have been considered by the trial court even had it elected to entertain walker petition because walker had obtained those reports through the public records act.state storer,wl,at ohio,w e believe that the rule of steckman requires us to reject materials obtained through an public records request as a basis for a motion for new trial.as the district court noted,b oth walker and storer,out of the second district,cursorily rejected any use of these public records to support a petition for relief.i at mem.order at.
however,the state contends that steckman did not preclude broom from using the records in his postconviction relief proceedings for several reasons,namely that broom had received all of the relevant records prior to the decision in steckman and that ohio case law did not bar claims based on records obtained prior to steckman.appellee br.at.with regard to the first of these arguments,the state claims that steckman is irrelevant because broom still fails to account for the accumulation of pages of public records that he had an unquestionable right to use.appellee br.at.however,only pages of this were the relevant east cleveland police department ecpd reports and these pages were apparently received a matter of months before steckman broom argues that he can not be held to have defaulted his brady claim,for failing to file it in the substantially smaller window of opportunity left to him once the state began to trickle out the discoverable records.appellant br.at.broom may be correct that he should not be penalized for failing to file another petition based on the police reports prior to steckman however,we are still left with the question of whether steckman was sufficient cause for his failure to do so at a later point.the state the district court ohio law was unsettled as to the question of whether or not broom could have filed another petition or amended his pending petition,and we turn now to that key issue.
the state and the district court both relied on state apanovitch,ohio app d,as support for the fact that broom was not barred from bringing his claim in the ohio state courts appellee br.at i at mem.order at.in apanovitch,the petitioner argued that the state trial court had improperly prevented him from seeking further discovery in the course of his postconviction relief,and the state court of appeals found that apanovitch previous request pursuant to barred him from seeking the same materials because the issue had already been litigated.apanovitch,at.the apanovitch court noted the steckman and walker decisions,but concluded that w e have no occasion to consider the import of these decisions,since the successor petition for postconviction relief predated steckman,and law permitted the use of the public records act.apanovitch,at.broom distinguishes apanovitch on the basis that the petitioner in that case had already filed his claim based on public records at the time that steckman was decided,whereas broom had not filed a claim based on the police records at that time.appellant br.at.the state responds that the timing of apanovitch filing does not necessarily show that it predated the ohio supreme court september,steckman decision.appellee br.at.this statement is based upon testimony of a prosecutor,who worked on the apanovitch case,that was given during the federal evidentiary hearing in broom case xviii at evidentiary hr g tr.at frey test.
regardless of the timing of the filing in the apanovitch case,that case supports the general proposition that steckman may not bar the use of records already in the petitioner possession.rather,steckman may only bar efforts to obtain new information pursuant to the statute during postconviction proceedings.because steckman does not directly address this issue,there was a reasonably available legal basis for broom either to file another petition for postconviction relief or to amend the petition that he had already filed.carrier,at.a ohio court of appeals decision highlights the ambiguity of the steckman rule because it held that steckman addresses only the duty to respond to defendant request for certain documents,it addresses not at all,the admissibility of information contained in these documents at hearing.state larkins,wl,at ohio.in larkins,the petitioner request for a writ of mandamus seeking police records was denied but a third party obtained the relevant records through a request.id.at.the petitioner then used the police records to file a motion for a new trial,and after the motion was granted,the state argued that this was incorrect in light of steckman.id.the court of appeals affirmed the trial court,explaining that steckman is inapplicable to the instant case.id.at.although broom argues that r easonable counsel,like the ohio courts of appeal that applied it,read steckman as a prohibition,appellant br.at,the supreme court has stated that the mere fact that counsel failed to recognize the factual or legal basis for a claim,or failed to raise the claim despite recognizing it does not constitute cause for a procedural default,carrier,at.we thus conclude that the steckman decision does not constitute cause for broom procedural default of his brady claim.
state delay 
broom argues that t imely release by the state would have allowed discovery of the brady issue long before steckman was decided.appellant br.at.broom had pages of the relevant material in his possession prior to steckman,even if by only a few months.xviii at evidentiary hr g tr.at vickers test.broom counsel conceded at our oral argument that the relevant information was present in the pages,but he asserted that broom postconviction counsel did not realize the extent of the evidence available.the fact that there might have been more information available is insufficient to establish cause for failing to bring a brady claim in the state courts.furthermore,we note that because steckman should not have prevented broom counsel from filing a claim on his behalf,the fact that the pertinent information was received shortly before the steckman decision is irrelevant 
postconviction judge instructions 
the lawyers involved in broom postconviction proceedings testified at the evidentiary hearing to the fact that state trial judge matia clearly expressed his displeasure over the fact that broom postconviction counsel had filed a number of pleadings in the case.appellant br.at see also iv at vickers aff.it appeared to me that judge matia seemed distressed that we had filed numerous pleadings.the inference that i drew from this meeting was that judge matia was displeased with the manner in which we were litigating broom case.based on the meeting i formed the opinion that it would be futile for us to file any future legal documents on broom behalf.broom concedes that judge matia remarks may have been merely informative.appellant br.at.even if such remarks could constitute cause for failing to present a claim to the state court,this argument is precluded by the fact that judge matia had left the state court to take a position on the federal bench by,well before the relevant records were received in.xviii at evidentiary hr g tr.at vickers test.
due diligence of counsel 
finally,broom argues that d ue diligence does not require counsel to file pleadings or seek relief in direct contradiction of the law.appellant br.at.this is merely a restatement of the steckman argument,which we discussed above.
as broom has not shown the requisite cause to excuse the procedural default of this claim,we will not examine whether he has shown the requisite prejudice,nor will we proceed to the merits of broom brady claim.see smith murray,d we need not determine whether petitioner has carried his burden of showing actual prejudice from the allegedly improper admission of pile testimony,for we think it that he has failed to demonstrate cause for his noncompliance with virginia procedures.we affirm the district court judgment denying habeas relief as to this issue.
other acts evidence 
the state trial court permitted the introduction of evidence regarding the incidents involving venita mckenney and melinda grissom broom asserts that this admission of other acts evidence denied him his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.appellant br.at.
in huddleston united states,d,the supreme court discussed the circumstances under which the admission of other acts evidence is proper 
we share petitioner concern that unduly prejudicial evidence might be introduced under federal rule of evidence b we think,however,that the protection against such unfair prejudice emanates not from a requirement of a preliminary finding by the trial court,but rather from four other sources first,from the requirement of rule b that the evidence be offered for a proper purpose second,from the relevancy requirement of rule enforced through rule b third,from the assessment the trial court must make under rule to determine whether the probative value of the similar acts evidence is substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice and fourth,from federal rule of evidence,which provides that the trial court shall,upon request,instruct the jury that the similar acts evidence is to be considered only for the proper purpose for which it was admitted.
huddleston,at.internal citations omitted.in reviewing this claim,we note that t rial court errors in state procedure evidentiary law do not rise to the level of federal constitutional claims warranting relief in a habeas action unless the error renders the proceeding so fundamentally unfair as to deprive the petitioner of due process under the fourteenth amendment.mcadoo elo,cir.citing estelle mcguire,d,cert.denied,d.generally,evidentiary rulings can not rise to the level of due process violations unless they offend some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.seymour,at quoting montana egelhoff,d.
the ohio supreme court began its discussion of this issue by stating as follows 
we note that appellant was positively identified either in a lineup or a showup and in the courtroom by both of the victims and numerous witnesses to those two incidents.the jury was given a carefully drafted limiting instruction to explain that the evidence concerning those two incidents was admitted only for the purpose of considering whether those acts tended to show intent,motive,scheme,plan or system for the september and kidnapping,rape,and murder of tryna middleton and attempted kidnapping of tammy sims and bonita callier 
broom,at.at trial,broom asserted that this was a case of mistaken identity because he allegedly was with someone else the night that tryna died.broom,at.the state supreme court explained that i f the other act does in fact tend to show by substantial proof any of those things enumerated,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity or absence of mistake or accident,then evidence of the other act may be admissible.id.the issue of identity,although not listed in,has been held to be included within the concept of scheme,plan,or system.id.at citing state curry,ohio.in curry,the ohio supreme court explained that 
one recognized method of establishing that the accused committed the offense set forth in the indictment is to show that he has committed similar crimes within a period of time reasonably near to the offense on trial,and that a similar scheme,plan or system was utilized to commit both the offense at issue and the other crimes.
curry,at.in broom case,the state supreme court applied the test set forth in curry and concluded as follows 
all three incidents occurred within a few months of each other,within a few miles of each other,and all involved young girls between the ages of eleven and fourteen walking along a street after dark.the method in all three incidents was identical a lone driver in a car passed the victims,parked the car and then attacked them from behind,trying to get the victims into the car while using the same scurrilous language.two of the incidents involved the same car and a knife.we view the evidence of the other incidents as admissible because it is relevant to the issue of appellant defense of mistaken identity.
the district court stated that w hile the c ourt has some concerns about the decision to admit this evidence,the c ourt can not say that the state court view of it was directly probative of the credibility of broom alibi unreasonable.i at mem.order at.in addition,the district court found that in light of the substantial other direct evidence tying broom to the tryna middleton eyewitness admission of this other act evidence did not so materially affect the outcome of the trial as to render it fundamentally unfair.i at mem.order at citing brecht abrahamson,d.we agree with the district court that the state court decision was not objectively unreasonable,and we affirm the district court judgment denying habeas relief as to this issue.
ineffective assistance of trial counsel 
broom argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective during the mitigation phase of his trial appellant br.at.as support for this claim,he states that his counsel did not adequately investigate his background that the mitigation expert assigned to his case did not provide any services for him that no effort was made to secure further psychiatric evaluation after broom did not open up to the psychiatrist who was sent to interview him that his counsel made him appear dishonest and predatory by allowing evidence of his prior convictions to be introduced through of his father and that his counsel attempted to use residual doubt as a mitigating factor even after it no longer made sense to do so.appellant br.at.
the benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial can not be relied on as having produced a just result.strickland washington,d.in strickland,the supreme court articulated a test for determining whether counsel was constitutionally ineffective 
first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.
strickland,at.a counsel failure to make a reasonable investigation of a defendant psychiatric history and family background,and to present mitigating evidence to the jury at sentencing,can constitute ineffective assistance.clark mitchell,cir citing wiggins smith,d.
the district the strickland that although broom may have benefitted from some psychiatric explanation of the impact of his upbringing on his psyche,his counsel were not objectively unreasonable in failing to present this testimony because most,if not all,was presented in some form during mitigation.i at mem.order at.the district court elaborated that w ith the exception of parental drug and alcohol abuse,all other physical violence,marital infidelities,the inconsistent forms of discipline,and the fact that broom was forced to drop out of school to care for his younger all presented during trial.i at mem.order at.furthermore,during the federal evidentiary hearing,broom habeas counsel were unable to articulate what further factual mitigation would have been proferred.i at mem.order at.the district court concluded that the state postconviction court did not unreasonably deny broom claim of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to strickland i at mem.order at.we agree with this conclusion.
to establish deficient performance,a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.wiggins,at.quoting strickland,at.in assessing the reasonableness of an attorney investigation a court must consider not only the quantum of evidence already known to counsel,but also whether the known evidence would lead a reasonable attorney to investigate further.id.at.in preparation for broom trial,broom attorneys set up an appointment for broom to meet with a psychiatrist,they spoke with members of broom family,and they collected records from the welding school that broom attended as well as from the prison.xviii at evidentiary hr g tr.at brusnahan test.one of broom trial attorneys explained that the main goals of the defense at mitigation were to keep the fact of broom prior rape conviction from the jury,and to establish that 
romell was the product of a very dysfunctional familiarly sic background that he had a very difficult early childhood that he had witnessed a number of things that were very unpleasant to say the least about the relationship between his mother and his father when he was growing up that he was quite a reserved young man that he did very well when he applied himself.
xviii at evidentiary hr g tr.at brusnahan test.to that end,the jury heard testimony from broom mother,father,and a counselor from the welding school.xviii at tr.at.one of his attorneys testified at the federal evidentiary hearing that there were more sources of information to explore,but that there was no time to do so in light of the state trial court denial of their request for a continuance.xviii at evidentiary hr g tr.at brusnahan test.
it is clear,as stated above,that broom counsel could have gathered additional information in order to present a more complete picture of broom difficult background.however,we are not convinced that his counsel performance was constitutionally inadequate.this is not a case in which counsel was or should have been alerted to additional probative evidence about the petitioner,and the counsel then failed to research the evidence.see,rompilla beard,d counsel fell short here because they failed to make reasonable efforts to review the prior conviction file,despite knowing that the prosecution intended to introduce rompilla prior conviction not merely by entering a notice of conviction into evidence but by quoting damaging testimony of the rape victim in that case.a comparison to our decision in harries bell,cir,illustrates this difference as well.in harries,we held that 
w e can not escape the conclusion that harries counsel failed to conduct a constitutionally adequate investigation.counsel limited their investigation to contacting by telephone harries mother and brother,sending requests for information to some of the institutions in which harries had been confined,and interviewing harries,harries codefendant,and two state witnesses.although counsel requested two competency evaluations,they declined to seek the assistance of a mental health expert or conduct a thorough investigation of harries mental health,even after harries mother alerted them that harries suffered from mental illness.nor did counsel adequately investigate harries family background,despite indications of harries troubled childhood.
id.broom counsel did not do a great deal more than counsel in harries,but they also did not refuse expert assistance or ignore signs of mental illness.rather,broom counsel attempted to obtain psychological testimony as well as the services of a mitigation expert,in addition to contacting his family members,his school,and the prison.their actions were not objectively unreasonable.
even if broom counsel performance at the mitigation phase of his trial was deficient,he can not satisfy the prejudice prong of the strickland test.to satisfy the prejudice prong,a petitioner must prove that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.harries,at.the additional evidence that broom identifies elaborates his difficult childhood as was described by his mother at the trial we have held that the failure to present additional mitigating evidence that is merely cumulative of that already presented does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.clark,at hill mitchell,cir,cert.denied,d smith mitchell,cir,cert.denied,d.t o establish prejudice,the new evidence that a habeas petitioner presents must differ in a substantial strength and subject the evidence actually presented at sentencing.clark,at quoting hill,at.
broom argues that a psychological evaluation,social history,and thoughtful preparation would have allowed a mitigation case to be presented that explained broom prior conviction for rape and the other acts evidence admitted at trial in the context of his life history.appellant br.at.in martin mitchell,cir,cert.denied,d,the defense counsel did not produce expert testimony to draw conclusions from the facts presented by two witnesses family members,but we noted that the underlying facts and occurrences were all presented to the jury and the petitioner counsel was therefore not constitutionally ineffective.we agree that broom counsel should have taken greater pains to provide some context for the jury however,the additional evidence that could have been presented simply does not substantially differ from the evidence actually presented so as to undermine confidence in the outcome of broom trial 
the district court also noted that broom claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to the examination of his father and broom prior rape conviction is without merit because of the court conclusion that there was no constitutional violation in the trial court decision to permit of william broom.i at,mem.order at.the state points out that the jury was already aware that broom had spent time in prison,and broom himself referenced his prior rape conviction in his unsworn statement given during the mitigation phase.xviii at,tr.at.regardless of whether or not it was error for broom counsel to open the door to this testimony,appellant br.at,broom can not satisfy the prejudice prong of the strickland test because the information regarding his prior rape conviction was independently revealed to the jury.
prosecutorial misconduct 
broom claims that t he prosecutorial misconduct in this case was egregious,pervasive and prejudicial.br.appellant at.he first lists several examples of statements from the guilt phase of his trial,including a statement that the prosecutor was not withholding evidence the characterization of broom as a serial killer,the description of the sexual conduct evidence as proof of the victim rape,and a false statement that middleton was raped vaginally and anally.appellant br.at broom then lists a variety of improper statements made during the sentencing phase of his trial appellant br.at.
in analyzing a claim of prosecutorial misconduct,the relevant question is whether the prosecutors comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.darden wainwright,d quoting donnelly dechristoforo,d.in order to satisfy the standard for prosecutorial misconduct,the conduct must be both improper and flagrant.bates bell,cir,cert.denied,d.in determining whether the statements listed above were proper,there are several guidelines available.first,a dvocates have an obligation to put forth only proper arguments based on the evidence in the record.id.also,they must obey the cardinal rule that a prosecutor can not make statements calculated to incite the passions and prejudices of the jurors.gall parker,cir quoting united states solivan,cir,cert.denied,d.finally,we have held that a prosecutor may not make improper comments designed to completely undercut the defendant sole mitigation theory,effectively denying him fair jury consideration.depew anderson,cir,cert.denied,d.once conduct is held to be improper,there are four factors that we consider in determining flagrancy 
the likelihood that the remarks of the prosecutor tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant whether the remarks were isolated or extensive whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made and the total strength of the evidence against the defendant.
bates,at.we must adhere to the harmless error standard in reviewing the state court determination regarding prosecutorial misconduct.see id.an error is found to be harmless unless it had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.quoting brecht,at.
with regard to the statements in the course of the prosecutor closing argument,the ohio supreme court held as follows 
generally,parties have been granted wide latitude in closing arguments.although we can hardly approve of comments such as,he kills in the community and it going to go on and on and on,they do not constitute a denial of due process.a complete review of the prosecutor closing remarks belies the conclusion that the state improper arguments in any way affected the jury verdict.
broom,at internal citations omitted.the state supreme court also concluded that the statements made during the mitigation phase did not deny broom due process.id.at.the court noted that the prosecutor comment about broom unsworn statement was impermissible in light of an ohio supreme court case decided after broom trial however,the court concluded that the totality of the prosecutor remarks is harmless error in light of the overwhelming nature of the aggravating circumstances compared to the mitigation factors.id.
several of the improper remarks were made during the prosecutor closing argument at the mitigation phase.importantly,in the death penalty context,we must distinguish between evidence of the defendant guilt of the underlying criminal charge and evidence of any attendant aggravating and mitigating circumstances.bates,at.when a prosecutor actions are so egregious that they effectively foreclose the jury consideration of mitigating evidence,the jury is unable to make a fair,individualized determination as required by the eighth amendment.id.at quoting depew anderson,cir internal quotation omitted.
the prosecutor behavior was clearly improper in this case.however,we do not believe that the comments were sufficiently flagrant to justify reversing the ohio supreme court determination.our conclusion is supported by a comparison of the comments made in broom case to those made in bates.the prosecutor remarks in broom case could certainly have prejudiced broom or misled the jury,especially with regard to the misrepresentation of the rape evidence moreover,the statements appear to have been made deliberately.however,most of the prosecutor comments were general attacks on broom overall mitigation case rather than pointed attacks at his witnesses or the defense attorneys as in bates.id.at.also,the prosecutor in broom case improperly discussed the circumstances of the rape as well as implied that broom would commit future rapes if he was released from prison,but he did not appeal to the jury fears and emotions to the same extent as in bates.in bates,for example,the prosecutor went on at great length and detail as to why a vote for life imprisonment would make the jurors accomplices to future murders.id.at.
the statements were also not as frequent as in bates,where both prosecutors laced their entire closing argument with personal opinion,attacks on opposing counsel,and undignified and unprofessional appeals to hatred and fear.id.at.finally,we do not believe that the improper remarks were so egregious as to preclude the jury proper consideration of mitigation.id.at.we do not in any way condone the clearly improper remarks that were made in this case,but we do not think that these improper statements injected such vitriol into the proceedings,as to question the fairness of the entire sentencing hearing.id.
in sum,we agree with the district court conclusion that t he ohio supreme court analysis is not an unreasonable application of darden and donnelly w hile some of the comments were certainly undesirable,they were not frequent or flagrant enough to undermine a court confidence in the outcome of the trial.i at mem.order at.
denial of continuance 
broom claims that the state trial judge denial of a continuance was unreasonable and that his counsel was unable to advocate effectively on his behalf because of the lack of time allowed for preparation.appellant br.at.broom trial counsel were appointed in july,after his previous counsel withdrew.xviii at evidentiary hr g tr.at brusnahan test.the trial court granted a continuance to move the trial from august to september.xiii at pretrial tr.at.at this point,the trial judge stated that t here will be no more continuances.xiii at pretrial tr.at.nonetheless,broom counsel sought another continuance on september,which the trial court denied.xviii at evidentiary hr g tr.at brusnahan test.
the supreme court addressed the issue of continuances in ungar sarafite,d,which states 
the matter of continuance is traditionally within the discretion of the trial judge,and it is not every denial of a request for more time that violates due process even if the party fails to offer evidence or is compelled to defend without counsel.contrariwise,a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay can render the right to defend with counsel an empty formality.there are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process.the answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case,particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied.
internal citations omitted.we have held that t he denial of a defendant motion for continuance amounts to a constitutional violation only if there is an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.united states king,cir quoting united states gallo,cir internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.to demonstrate reversible error,the defendant must show that the denial resulted in actual prejudice to his defense.id.at quoting gallo,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in requesting the continuance,broom attorneys informed the state trial court that they had difficulty in obtaining records and other information,which is necessary for a mitigation hearing,xviii at evidentiary hr g tr.at brusnahan test,and that they were also having difficulty in establishing a working relationship with broom,xviii at evidentiary hr g tr.at brusnahan test.both the ohio supreme court and the district court found that broom failed to demonstrate how he was actually prejudiced in the mitigation phase of his trial by the denial of the continuance.broom,at i at mem.order at furthermore,the district court stated that t he trial court is not required to grant multiple trial continuances where the need for those continuances is prompted solely by the defendant own refusal to cooperate with counsel trial preparation efforts.i at mem.order at see also united states crawford,cir because crawford contributed significantly to his own counsel lack of preparedness,and because counsel represented that he was in fact prepared to provide crawford with a defense,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying crawford motion to continue the trial date.the ohio supreme court reasonably applied ungar in concluding that broom was not denied due process when his motion for a continuance was denied,and we affirm the district court judgment as to this issue.broom,at.
identification 
immediately after the incident involving melinda grissom,the police took broom for purposes of identification to the hospital where grissom was being treated.appellant br.at.because broom was the only suspect presented to the grissoms at the hospital,he argues that this show up procedure used with both melinda grissom and janet grissom was unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification.appellant br.at quoting kirby illinois,d.
in analyzing this issue,the ohio supreme court stated 
we agree that the showup of the defendant at the hospital,where he was identified by the grissoms,was both unnecessary and suggestive therefore,our concern with the reliability of the identification,deterrence of police misconduct,and the effect on the administration of justice requires us to examine the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the confrontation was so suggestive that there was a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.
broom,at quoting neil biggers,d.the supreme court has set forth the following factors to be considered in determining whether there was in fact such a likelihood of misidentification the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime,the witness degree of attention,the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal,the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation,and the time between the crime and the confrontation.manson brathwaite,d.the ohio supreme court found that all of these factors were favorable in this case both grissoms had ample time to view appellant and their attention was completely focused as the mother tried to rescue her daughter.the descriptions given to the police prior to the confrontation matched the appellant.finally,the identification was emphatically positive,and it occurred very shortly after the crime.broom,at.
broom contention that the ohio supreme court application of manson and neil was unreasonable is without merit,and we affirm the district court judgment denying relief as to this claim.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons discussed above,we affirm the district court judgment denying broom habeas relief.

justice stevens elaborated on the difference between the two doctrines in his dissenting opinion in boerckel,d.the exhaustion doctrine requires federal courts to ask whether an applicant for federal relief could still get the relief he seeks in the state system.if the applicant currently has a state avenue available for raising his claims,a federal court,in the interest of comity,must generally abstain from intervening.boerckel,at.stevens,dissenting.justice stevens concluded thatthe presence or absence of exhaustion,in sum,tells us nothing about whether a prisoner has defaulted his constitutional claims.exhaustion is purely a rule of timing and has played no role in the series of waiver decisions that foreclosed challenges to the composition of the grand jury,evidentiary rulings at trial,instructions to the jury,and finally,counsel inadvertent error in failing to file a timely appeal from a state court denial of collateral relief.the court reasons for progressively expanding its procedural default doctrine were best explained in the cases that arose in a trial setting.by failing to raise their constitutional objections at trial,defendants truly impinge state courts ability to correct,or even to make a record regarding the effect of,legal.at.stevens,dissenting.see also id.at.majority w e do not disagree with justice stevens description of the interplay of these two doctrines.

according to ohio revised code a,broom is unable to submit a second petition for relief unless the following two requirements are satisfied a either the petitioner shows that the petitioner was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which the petitioner must rely to present the claim for relief,or,subsequent to the period prescribed in division a of section of the revised code or to the filing of an earlier petition,the united states supreme court recognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively to persons in the petitioner situation,and the petition asserts a claim based on that right.b the petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error at trial,no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted or,if the claim challenges a sentence of death that,but for constitutional error at the sentencing hearing,no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner eligible for the death district court concluded that broom could not satisfy part a of this test.i at mem.order at.neither party has contested this determination.
