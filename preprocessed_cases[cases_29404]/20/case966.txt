petitioner darick demorris walker was convicted of capital murder by a jury in the circuit court for the city of richmond for the killings of stanley beale and clarence threat within a period.consistent with the jury verdict and sentencing recommendation,the trial judge imposed a sentence of death.walker conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.walker commonwealth,cert.denied,d.after unsuccessfully pursuing state relief,walker filed a federal habeas petition.the district court denied that petition,and walker appealed.on appeal,walker asserted,for the first time,that his execution would violate the eighth amendment as interpreted by the supreme court in atkins virginia,d.we construed this claim as a motion for authorization to file a successive section petition and granted walker such authorization.walker true,cir.
on june,walker filed his successive petition and accompanying exhibits in the district court.the district court dismissed walker petition,and the instant appeal followed.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the district court erred when it dismissed walker petition before holding an evidentiary hearing and,consistent with this determination,vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the procedural posture of walker claim before the district court bears on the ultimate disposition of that claim,and we therefore explore it in some detail.because atkins was decided after walker conviction and sentence became final,that claim has never been presented in state court.indeed,when we authorized walker to file a successive petition to raise his atkins claim,we noted that the district court was free to dismiss it without prejudice to afford the commonwealth of virginia the first opportunity to assess walker atkins claim.walker.at.but after our decision authorizing walker to file his successive petition,virginia enacted a statutory framework addressing the presentation of a claim of mental retardation by persons sentenced to death before april.that framework provides that petitioners,such as walker,who have completed both a direct appeal and a state habeas corpus proceeding shall not be entitled to file any further habeas petitions in the supreme court and the sole remedy shall lie in federal court.id.emphasis added.
as a consequence of virginia statutory framework,walker presented his atkins claim for the first time before the district court.accordingly,that claim is not subject to deference under d because it has never been adjudicated on the merits in state court.the district court appeared to review walker claim de novo,and we do the same.see hudson hunt,cir because the claim was not adjudicated on the merits,our review is de novo.
the district court disposed of walker petition by granting the state motion to dismiss in ruling on such a motion the district court was obliged to assume all facts pleaded by walker to be true.rouse lee,cir holding that such a standard is required in a section proceeding when the district court grants the state motion to dismiss.instead of assuming the facts pleaded in walker petition to be true,however,the district court found that walker had failed to meet his burden of proof in presenting his claim of mental retardation,emphasis added,explained in detail this conclusion by relying on material that was not included in walker petition and by either ignoring or discounting the factual allegations in the petition.indeed,even the state admits that the district court ruling was in the nature of a grant of summary judgment.respondent br.at.but such a ruling can not be upheld where,as here,the facts alleged in walker petition and supported by his accompanying exhibits demonstrate that several material facts remain disputed 
while walker claim ultimately derives from his rights under the eighth amendment,whether he is mentally retarded is governed by virginia law.as the supreme court observed in atkins,t o the extent there is serious disagreement about the execution of mentally retarded offenders,it is in determining which offenders are in fact retarded not all people who claim to be mentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom there is a national consensus.as was our approach in ford wainwright,d,with regard to insanity,we leave to the states the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences.at.emphasis added accordingly,whether walker has stated a claim in his petition depends on whether he has set forth facts that,if true,would demonstrate that he is mentally retarded under virginia law.
under virginia law,walker bears the burden of establishing that he is mentally retarded by a preponderance of the evidence.mentally retarded is defined as 
a disability,originating before the age of years,characterized concurrently by i significantly subaverage intellectual functioning as demonstrated by performance on a standardized measure of intellectual functioning administered in conformity with accepted professional practice,that is at least two standard deviations below the mean and ii significant limitations in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual,social,and practical adaptive skills.
id.with respect to the standardized measure of intellectual functioning referenced in subpart i,the virginia code provides that the commissioner of mental health,mental retardation and substance abuse services shall maintain an exclusive list of standardized measures of intellectual functioning generally accepted in the field of psychological testing.b emphasis added thus,walker must allege that his disability originated before the age of eighteen,and that it is characterized concurrently by a score two standard deviations below the mean on an approved standardized test and that there exist significant limitations in his adaptive behavior.
walker has set forth facts that,if true,satisfy the elements of virginia definition of mentally retarded.specifically,walker petition refers to affidavits where,after recounting evidence of his subaverage intellectual functioning,the limitations in his adaptive behavior,and the developmental origin of his disability,experts conclude that walker satisfies the statutory definition.see declaration of weinstein concluding that b ased on my testing of walker and my review of his school records it is my professional opinion that walker is mentally retarded according to the criteria set forth in the commonwealth of virginia in its new statute.id.declaration of sautter concluding that darick cognitive deficits are consistent with mental retardation as that disability is defined by the commonwealth.
with respect to the intellectual functioning component of the definition,walker has presented the results from the wechsler intelligence scale for that he was administered in when he was eleven years old.according to walker,the full scale score he two standard deviations below the mean.id.walker has also submitted his full scale score of on the general ability measure for adults test gama that was administered in may of.that score is indisputably two standard deviations below the mean.
walker has also set forth facts pertaining to the limitations in his adaptative behavior both before and after he was eighteen years old.with respect to his conceptual skills,walker has identified deficiencies in language,reading,and writing,referencing school records,an inability to handle money,difficulty dealing with unstructured time,and inordinate dependence on others.with respect to his social skills,walker has identified testimony from his family which suggests that he never had friends who were his peers and school records which indicate that darick has a low frustration tolerance and an inadequate control over basic impulses and that due to emotional immaturity,learning difficulties,and inability to control his own behavior,darick appears to be in need of special education as a child with specific learning disabilities as well as emotional disturbance.with respect to his practical skills,walker has identified family member testimony which indicates that darick never rented an apartment or paid a bill,that he did not hold a job,and that he was dependent on family members for transportation because he did not have a drivers license and did not take the public bus.
based on the foregoing,we conclude that the facts alleged in walker petition,if true,would establish that he is mentally retarded and that his execution is therefore prohibited by the eighth amendment.
the district court did not suggest that walker had failed to state a claim rather,it concluded that the evidence presented by walker is insufficient to conclude,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he is mentally retarded.the district court based this finding exclusively on its determination that all three of walker scores on the,the only iq test he was administered that is accepted in virginia,are above the level of mentally retarded.id.emphasis added.notably,at the time of the district court initial ruling,the gama test was not on virginia list of acceptable measures of intellectual functioning.the addition of the gama test to that list formed the basis of petitioner motion to amend the original judgment.the district court denied that motion,finding that the gama test was administered to petitioner in may of when petitioner was years old.the test,therefore,does not support a manifestation of retardation before the age of.
as the foregoing references reveal,in ruling on virginia motion to dismiss,the district court did not assume the facts alleged by walker in his petition to be true.the district court judgment could not be affirmed,however,even if its determination had been in the context of summary judgment,as the state suggests it should be construed,because the district court resolved factual disputes in favor of the moving party.
specifically,the district court found that walker wisc score and his wais score demonstrated that he was not retarded.but walker vigorously protested such conclusions in his petition.as to the wisc test,he alleged that his score of actually supports his petition because it is two standard deviations below the mean,even though only scores of or lower represent an iq two standard deviations below the mean walker claim is based upon expert affidavits describing the flynn effect,which posits that iq scores rise over time and that iq tests that are not to adjust for rising iq levels will overstate a testee iq.under this theory,a score of on a test that has recently been will be two standard deviations below the mean of,while a score on the wisc given in had last been in overstates a testee iq by over points,or of a point per year.thus,according to walker,his score of on the wisc should be viewed as a.
but even walker score of does not necessarily indicate that he has perform ed on a standardized measure of intellectual functioning two standard deviations below the mean as set forth under the virginia statute.on a properly normed iq test only scores of or lower are two standard deviations below the mean.walker nonetheless maintains that is a qualifying score because,he claims,any iq test score must be considered in the context of the standard error of measurement.see.according to the affidavits submitted by walker experts,the american association on mental retardation aamr and the american psychological association apa recognize that iq tests have a measurement error of plus or minus five points.expert testimony that the aamr and the apa require measurement error to be taken into account when iq test scores are considered.walker experts therefore suggest that is a qualifying score because the aamr and apa concur that the iq criteria for falling two standard deviations below the mean iq means that individuals who have a measured iq of to or lower may be considered to be mentally retarded if there is evidence of poor adaptive functioning.id.the state,of course,may contest walker experts particular suggestions on remand and may also contest the applicability of measurement error to the inquiry of whether a petitioner has performed at least two standard deviations below the mean under the virginia statute.
the district court,without much explanation,did not consider the flynn effect or the measurement error,stating that such evidence does not provide a legal basis for ignoring walker wais test scores.but,as the virginia statute makes clear,the relevant question is whether walker scored two standard deviations below the mean,a question which is directly addressed by walker expert opinion as to the flynn effect.thus,not only did the district court resolve a factual dispute against to the claims in his petition and where the facts remained materially also refused to consider relevant evidence,namely the flynn effect evidence.therefore,on remand the district court should consider the persuasiveness of walker flynn effect evidence.and if the district court does credit that evidence,it should then consider whether the virginia statute permits consideration of measurement error in order to determine whether walker purported score of is two standard deviations below the mean as set forth under that statute.
as to walker wais test,walker claims that his score of is highly unreliable for multiple reasons because it was administered by an inexperienced intern who now claims she made errors in the administration and scoring of the test.id.at.the district court rejected walker characterization of the test,and concluded that if all of the administrator errors were added together,walker would have been left with a score of,above the.but walker claims that his score can not be reconstructed in the manner proposed by the district court,petitioner reply br.at,and,moreover,has presented an affidavit from his expert stating that the test results are so unreliable that they should be discarded.in the face of this uncontested expert opinion,the district court of walker score was error.
the district court also rested its judgment on the results of walker march,test,administered by sautter,where walker received a full scale score of.while walker does not contest the validity of the results of this test,sautter has submitted an affidavit,explaining that after an opportunity to review a more comprehensive set of darick records i conclude that darick cognitive deficits are consistent with mental retardation as that disability is defined by the commonwealth in its recently enacted statute.moreover,walker maintains that his score of on the gama test in may score that is indisputably more than two standard deviations below the accurately reflects his disability 
in some circumstances an atkins claim may properly be dismissed where a petitioner has iq scores that are above the of the intellectual functioning measurement set forth in virginia definition and where uncontested expert opinion verifies that such scores are an accurate measurement of a petitioner intellectual functioning.see,walton johnson,d,dismissing an atkins claim where petitioner only accepted iq scores were before the petitioner was and and where the expert that administered the latter iq exam testified that petitioner was definitely not retarded.johnson commonwealth,holding that petitioner atkins claim was frivolous because petitioner had received a and and because his own expert witness stated that he was not retarded morrisette commonwealth,rejecting an atkins claim where petitioner iq scores were and and where the evaluating psychiatrist opined that petitioner intelligence was roughly below average.where,as here,however,a petitioner has received iq scores above and below two standard deviations below the mean and where uncontested expert opinion suggests that he is mentally retarded under the commonwealth definition,dismissal is inappropriate.accordingly,in this case further proceedings are necessary to determine whether the preponderance of the evidence suggests that walker lower scores are an accurate reflection of his intellectual functioning or whether,as the state suggests,his higher scores are dispositive.
while we conclude that the district court erred in dismissing walker claim,we can not conclude,on the basis of the record before us,that walker execution would violate the eighth amendment.rather,further proceedings are necessary to determine whether,after consideration of all relevant evidence,walker has established that he is mentally retarded as defined by the commonwealth of virginia.walker maintains that further proceedings should be before a jury or,in the alternative,seeks an evidentiary hearing before the district court.
walker contends that he is entitled to a jury under both the virginia statutory scheme and ring arizona,d.we disagree.
walker is not entitled to a jury under the virginia statute.section of the virginia code sets forth the procedural framework for the resolution of atkins claims filed by petitioners,such as walker,who were sentenced to death before april.the relevant portion of that statute provides as follows 
a person proceeding under this section shall allege the factual basis for his claim of mental retardation.the supreme court shall consider a claim raised under this section and if it determines that the claim is not frivolous,it shall remand the claim to the circuit court for a determination of mental retardation if the claim is before the supreme court on direct appeal and is remanded to the circuit court and the case wherein the sentence of death was imposed was tried by a jury,the circuit court shall empanel a new jury for the sole purpose of making a determination of mental retardation.
if the person has completed both a direct appeal and a state habeas corpus proceeding under subsection c of,he shall not be entitled to file any further habeas petitions in the supreme court and his sole remedy shall lie in federal court.
emphasis added.as the emphasized sections make clear,the virginia statute does not provide for a jury for claims raised in federal court.
walker nonetheless contends that he is entitled to a jury under section c,which provides that in any case in which the offense may be punishable by death and is tried before a jury,the issue of mental retardation shall be determined by the jury as part of the sentencing proceeding.walker claims that his entitlement to a jury under this section can not be severed from the other applicable portions of the section namely the definition of mentally retarded and the defendant burden of proof.but the portion of the virginia statute that refers to a jury determination does so in the context of the appropriate procedure at sentencing in state court.it does not bear on the appropriate federal procedure governing walker eighth amendment claim that is based,in part,upon virginia definition of mentally retarded.
walker further contends that his proposed interpretation of the virginia statutory scheme is supported by the canon of constitutional avoidance.according to walker,an interpretation of virginia statute that deprives him of a jury would violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment because there is no rational basis for treating petitioners who have completed their state habeas proceedings differently than those who have not.as set forth above.permits petitioners whose convictions are final but who have not sought state habeas relief to pursue their atkins claims in state court where a jury is required for all claims.on the other hand,petitioners,such as walker,who have completed state habeas review must pursue their claims in federal court.walker claims that such a distinction is arbitrary.
walker equal protection challenge to the virginia statute is not sustainable.as noted by the state,under the relevant supreme court precedent the standard applicable to walker challenge is whether the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.city of cleburne cleburne living center,d.just as the federal habeas statute treats petitioners filing an initial habeas petition differently than it treats those who are filing a successive petition,see,so too may virginia differentiate between petitioners who have not yet presented claims under and those who have completed their proceedings.as with the distinction at the federal level,virginia differentiation is reasonably related to the state interest of efficient utilization of its judicial resources and satisfies the deferential standard set forth in cleburne.this is especially so,given that walker is entitled to present his federal claim in a federal forum 
nor can walker establish entitlement to a jury under ring arizona.as an initial matter,ring was decided after walker conviction became final and is not retroactive on collateral review.see schriro summerlin,d ring announced a new procedural rule that does not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review.walker suggests schriro is inapplicable because he is not seeking to vacate a factual decision already made by a judge in favor of having that factual decision made by a jury rather,he is presenting his atkins claim for the first time in his petition and is therefore not seeking retroactive application of ring.petitioner reply br.at.
but even if walker is not seeking retroactive application of ring,he is not entitled to a jury.the operative language of ring provides that 
the dispositive question is one not of form,but of effect.citation omitted.if a state makes an increase in a defendant authorized punishment contingent on the finding of a fact,that matter how the state labels be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.a defendant may not be exposed to a penalty exceeding the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone.
at.see also id.at.i believe that the fundamental meaning of the guarantee of the sixth amendment is that all facts essential to imposition of the level of punishment that the defendant the statute calls them elements of the offense,sentencing factors,or mary be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.scalia,concurring.
walker maintains that the factual determination of is required to impose the death penalty.the virginia statute authorizing punishment for conviction of felony lends some support to this view.it provides that t he authorized punishments for conviction of felony are a for class felonies,death,if the person so convicted was years of age or older at the time of the offense and is not determined to be mentally retarded.but the finding of mental retardation does not increase the penalty for the crime beyond the statutory.rather,a defendant facing the death penalty may avoid that penalty if he successfully raises and proves by a preponderance of the evidence that he is mentally retarded.e and c.the state does not have a corollary duty to prove that a defendant is not retarded in order to be entitled to the death penalty.accordingly,an increase in a defendant sentence is not predicated on the outcome of the mental retardation determination only a decrease.see also in re johnson,cir t he absence of mental retardation is not an element of the sentence any more than sanity is an element of the offense.walton johnson,d,a finding of mental retardation precludes the state from carrying out the death sentence.thus,it is analogous to the question of competency to be executed in death penalty cases,which need not be decided by a jury.
walker contends that even if he is not entitled to a jury,he must,at a minimum,receive an evidentiary hearing in the district court on his atkins claim.petitioner br.at.we agree.
walker entitlement to an evidentiary hearing is not addressed by the federal habeas statutes.section e does not apply because walker has not failed to develop the factual basis of his claim in state court.see williams taylor,d a failure to develop the factual basis of a claim is not established unless there is lack of diligence,or some greater fault,attributable to the prisoner or the prisoner counsel.because atkins was decided after walker conviction became final,neither he nor his counsel can be faulted for failure to develop the factual basis of that claim.
under supreme court and circuit precedent,an evidentiary hearing is required if walker alleges facts that,if true,would entitle him to relief and estab
