this appeal is the latest in an line of cases trailing in the wake of congress enactment of a limitation period for the filing of federal habeas petitions.see,delaney matesanz,cir neverson bissonnette,cir gaskins duval,cir per curiam.the limitation period is part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat.the statute of limitations for federal review of state prisoners habeas applications is codified at d.
under this provision,a period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.d.with exceptions not relevant here,this limitation period starts to accrue on the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.id.applying this formulation,the united states district court for the district of maine dismissed as a habeas application filed by daniel donovan,a state prisoner donovan now invites us to reinstate his application.we decline the invitation.
background 
on february,a jury convicted the petitioner of gross sexual assault.see.ann.tit,supp.the trial judge sentenced him to a term of twenty years five suspended and ordered him incarcerated.maine highest court the law court affirmed the conviction on august.state donovan,me.
on february,the petitioner delivered to state correctional authorities a pro se petition for relief.that petition was docketed in the state superior court five days later.the court appointed counsel and,after an evidentiary hearing,concluded that the petition was groundless.the petitioner filed a notice of appeal which,under maine law,doubled as a request for a certificate of probable cause cpc.see.ann.tit.on december,the law court denied the cpc,thus terminating the appeal 
on september,the petitioner,acting pro se,delivered to prison authorities an application seeking federal habeas relief.see.this application was docketed in the federal district court three days later.citing the limitation period,the court rejected it,but granted a certificate of appealability.id.c.this appeal ensued.before us,the petitioner is represented by counsel.
framing the issues 
any discussion of timeliness must start with the law court rejection of the petitioner direct appeal on august.giving the petitioner the benefit of the grace period for seeking certiorari review by the united states supreme court,c,the district court ruled that the statute of limitations began to accrue on the day after this grace period ended november.the court counted forward days and then stopped the accrual process as of february,date on which the petitioner filed for state relief.see id.d tolling the limitation period for such time as a properly filed application for state or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment is pending see also neverson,at explaining the operation of this tolling provision.
noting that the law court denied a cpc and,thus,ended the petitioner quest for state relief on december,the court resumed the count as of december.at that point,there were days left within which to seek federal habeas review.the court determined that this window closed on september.the petitioner federal habeas application is deemed filed,under the prisoner mailbox rule,on september.see nara frank,cir explaining that if an inmate is confined in an institution,his notice of appeal or federal habeas petition will be timely if it is deposited in the institution internal mail system on or before the last day for filing see also houston lack,d united states,cir per curiam.the petitioner did not act until after that date.thus,the court considered his federal habeas action twelve days late absent a showing of some sufficiently excusatory set of circumstances.discerning none,the court dismissed the application.
the petitioner charts two routes to a potential safe harbor.first,he questions the count itself,saying that his application for federal habeas review would have been adjudged timely had the court given him the benefit of all excluded periods.second,he asseverates that equitable tolling should apply to extend the limitation period and assigns error to the district court rejection of that asseveration.we follow each of these routes to its logical conclusion.
timeliness 
the petitioner argument for timeliness hinges on his contention that the district court made three separate computational errors.first,the petitioner maintains that he delivered his state petition for review to prison authorities on february,and that under the prisoner mailbox rule,the district court should have given him the benefit of the five days that elapsed between that date and the date on which his petition was docketed in the state superior court.second,he attempts to invoke federal rule of civil procedure e,arguing that,inasmuch as he received notice of the denial of his direct appeal by mail,the district court should have given him the benefit of three additional days in calculating the expiration of the time for seeking certiorari review in the united states supreme court.finally,he asserts that his petition for state review was pending until he received notice of the denial of the cpc,and that the district court should have given him the benefit of the five days that elapsed from the effective date of the law court order december,to the date of receipt of notice december.since no two of these contentions yield the twelve days needed to bring the petitioner federal habeas application within the limitation period,the petitioner must prevail on all of them to succeed on his timeliness initiative.
we need not tarry.because we find the petitioner second and third contentions meritless,his timeliness argument fails.consequently,it is unnecessary for us to express an opinion on the applicability vel non of the prisoner mailbox rule to a petition for relief 
additional time due to mailing 
citing federal rule of civil procedure e,the petitioner theorizes that three days should be added to the deadline for filing his federal habeas application his thinking runs along the following lines.as the district court recognized,section d provides for tolling during the period in which the petitioner would have been allowed to ask the united states supreme court to grant certiorari to review the law court denial of his direct appeal the fact that the petitioner did not seek certiorari is immaterial.the petitioner concludes that this period did not expire on november,as determined by the district court,but,rather,on november.in support of this conclusion,he notes that notice of the adverse judgment was mailed to him and suggests that,due to this circumstance,the habeas court should have invoked rule e and waited three days before starting to count the period.the respondent counters that this claim was not raised below and urges us to hold that it has been forfeited.see,clauson smith,cir.
because the forfeiture question is murky,we choose to address the claim.we recently have recognized t he prevailing view that rule e does not apply to statutes of limitation.berman united states,cir.this is because rule e,in terms,is centrally concerned with what a party does and a party operates within the framework of an existing case.by contrast,statutes of limitation govern the time for commencing an action.id.that rationale is dispositive here.
d,in conjunction with supreme court rule,merely establishes a interval within which an aggrieved litigant may file a petition for certiorari following entry of a judgment of a state court of last resort neither the certiorari statute nor the implementing supreme court rule triggers the prophylaxis of rule e because neither of them,in the language of that rule,requires a party to take any action within a prescribed period of time after the service of a notice upon the party.rather,both unambiguously require filing within ninety days after entry of a judgment.given this structure,rule e can not serve to enlarge the time period for filing a petition for certiorari following entry of a judgment affirming a criminal conviction.see james moore,moore federal practice at ed exp
