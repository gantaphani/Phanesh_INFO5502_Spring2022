in atkins virginia,d,the supreme court held that the eighth amendment prohibits the execution of mentally retarded persons.relying on atkins,virginia capital inmate darick demorris walker filed a petition for federal habeas corpus relief seeking to prevent his execution.finding that walker failed to prove that he is mentally retarded under virginia law the district court denied the petition,and he now appeals.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in,the commonwealth of virginia convicted walker of capital murder for the killings of two men within a period.walker was sentenced to death,and his conviction and capital sentence were affirmed.walker commonwealth,cert.denied,d.the underlying facts of his crimes,which are not pertinent to this appeal,are set forth in the state supreme court opinion.see at.
after unsuccessfully pursuing state relief,walker filed the first of two petitions for habeas corpus relief in the district court.the claims involved in walker first habeas petition are not before us in this appeal.see walker kelly,cir affirming the denial of walker first habeas petition.
while walker first habeas petition was pending in the district court,the supreme court decided atkins.concluding that a national consensus had developed against the execution of the mentally retarded,the court held that the eighth amendment bars their execution.in doing so,the court noted 
to the extent there is serious disagreement about the execution of mentally retarded offenders,it is in determining which offenders are in fact retarded not all people who claim to be mentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom there is a national consensus.
atkins,at.however,the court did not provide definitive procedural or substantive guides for determining when a person who claims mental retardation will be so impaired as to fall within the class of defendants ineligible for capital punishment.bobby bies,d internal punctuation omitted.instead,the court expressly left to the states the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences.atkins,at.quoting ford wainwright,d.states have responded to that challenge by adopting their own measures for adjudicating claims of mental retardation.schriro smith,d.
the virginia general assembly responded to atkins by enacting a statutory scheme to determine capital defendants claims of mental retardation.pertinent to this case,the general assembly mandated that a capital defendant has the burden of proving mental retardation by a preponderance of the evidence,c,and it defined the term mentally retarded as 
a disability,originating before the age of years,characterized concurrently by i significantly subaverage intellectual functioning as demonstrated by performance on a standardized measure of intellectual functioning administered in conformity with accepted professional practice,that is at least two standard deviations below the mean and ii significant limitations in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual,social and practical adaptive skills.
a.for a capital defendant such as walker who had completed his direct appeal and state habeas proceeding as of the effective date of the legislation,the general assembly specified that he shall not be entitled to file any further habeas petitions in the virginia supreme court and his sole remedy shall lie in federal court.
walker initially presented his atkins claim in his appeal from the denial of his first federal habeas petition.construing his atkins claim in that appeal as a motion for authorization to file a successive habeas corpus petition,we granted walker authorization.see walker true,cir.walker true i,vacated on other grounds,d.walker then filed his second federal habeas petition which is now before us,and the commonwealth moved to dismiss that petition.the district court granted the commonwealth motion and entered judgment against walker.
on appeal,we vacated the judgment,concluding that the district court erred by dismissing the petition without holding an evidentiary hearing consequently,we remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing to address whether walker is mentally retarded under virginia law.see walker true ii,at.however,although we ruled in walker favor concerning his right to have an evidentiary hearing,we rejected his contention that he was entitled to have a jury decide whether he is mentally retarded.as we explained 
t he portion of the virginia statute that refers to a jury determination does so in the context of the appropriate procedure at sentencing in state court.it does not bear on the appropriate federal procedure governing walker eighth amendment claim that is based,in part,upon virginia definition of mentally retarded.
on remand,the district court held a evidentiary hearing without a jury,during which the parties introduced a substantial amount of evidence on the issue of walker mental retardation.this evidence included walker scores on various standardized tests documentary evidence from school,prison,and medical records and declarations from his family,acquaintances,and fellow inmates.the court also heard testimony from several witnesses,including designated experts who testified on the issue of walker mental retardation.eventually,the court denied walker petition.this appeal followed.
in accordance with virginia law,walker presented his atkins claim only in federal court therefore,the standard of review mandated by aedpa does not apply.see walker true ii,at.instead,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.green johnson,cir,cert.denied,d.because the determination of mental retardation involves a question of fact,atkins commonwealth,we review the district court finding that walker is not mentally retarded for clear error,holladay allen,cir.when we review factual findings under this standard,
our scope of review is narrow we do not exercise de novo review or substitute our version of the facts for that found by the district court.instead,i f the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.thus,facts found by the district court are conclusive on appeal unless they are plainly wrong.a factual finding by the district court may be reversed only if,although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.
walton johnson,cir en banc citations omitted.
to prevail on his atkins claim under virginia law,walker must meet the comprehensive definition of the statutory term mentally retarded.green,at.thus,he must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he has a disability that originated before the age of,and that the disability is characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning as demonstrated by performance on a standardized measure of intellectual functioning administered in conformity with accepted professional practice,that is at least two standard deviations below the mean the prong and significant limitations in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual,social,and practical adaptive skills the adaptive prong.although walker devotes much of his appeal to the district court analysis of the prong,it is unnecessary for us to address those arguments because we conclude that the court did not clearly err in rejecting his claim on the adaptive prong.see green,at recognizing that the failure to prevail on the adaptive prong necessarily defeats an atkins claim.
as noted,the adaptive prong focuses on whether a person can prove significant limitations in adaptive behavior and it measures such behavior by looking to the person conceptual,social,and practical adaptive skills.conceptual adaptive skills involve skills pertaining to language,reading and writing,money concepts,and social adaptive skills are measured by interpersonal skills and responsibility,gullibility and naivete,and ability to follow rules and obey laws and practical adaptive skills involve activities relevant to daily living,occupational skills,and maintenance of a safe environment.green,at during the evidentiary hearing the parties presented a substantial amount of evidence pertaining to walker adaptive behavior.we now turn to a brief summary of that evidence.
as evidence of his conceptual limitations,walker pointed to his difficulties reading and writing.he presented evidence that he never reads or looks at books or magazines,and he also claimed that he relies on other inmates to help him read,write,and fill out forms.moreover,affidavits from family members note that walker would ask others to read letters to him,and his brother affidavit related a particularly telling moment when i was in ninth grade and darick was seventeen years old,i remember coming back from school to find darick at home with a bunch of blank job applications.i had to fill them out for him.
walker also pointed to his inability to handle money and his heavy reliance on others to get by in the world.his family members noted that,while growing up,walker never knew what to do with money.moreover,his fellow inmates claimed that he relies on them for help in maintaining his account with the prison commissary.his experts also observed that a fter leaving home,walker consistently relied on others to help him negotiate the basics of everyday life,and that even in prison he is dependent on others to support and intercede on his behalf.there was also evidence that walker relies on others for help in seeking medical attention.
finally,walker pointed to evidence of his lack of direction and inability to deal with unstructured time.he claimed that he lacks interest in any activities,other than watching television.during interviews with his experts,walker could not state who the president of the united states was,had not heard of hurricane katrina which had just recently occurred,and misstated his age as when he had in fact turned two months prior.
the commonwealth took a different tack with respect to walker conceptual skills.while admitting that walker possessed conceptual skills that are below average,the commonwealth expert,hagan,opined that these limitations did not significantly impair his capacity to adapt to the requirements of life including transportation,use of communication technology,planning,scheming,dealing with reasonably foreseeable contingencies,self advocacy,mechanisms,and selective portrayal of facts and circumstances.in support of this assertion,the commonwealth and hagan pointed to several events that purport to showcase walker conceptual skills.
in particular,the commonwealth focused on walker extensive criminal history as evidencing his conceptual abilities.the commonwealth referenced a fraudulent scheme concocted by walker,whereby he arranged to sell a vehicle to an individual,told the individual that some money was needed to correct problems with the title,and absconded with the money.hagan opined 
this conduct clearly demonstrates walker capacity to develop a plan,consider various contingencies in connection with that plan,promote the plan to an unsuspecting person,and pull off the ruse by affecting sic his departure without being detected at least for the time being.he not only had to put the plan together,but also had to fool his victim into going along with the plan without arousing suspicion.this reflects considerable conceptual capabilities.
hagan also considered how walker reacted when he was being investigated for an armed robbery and drew the following conclusions 
walker gave a statement to law enforcement on age in connection with the virginia beach armed robbery charge.walker had sufficient conceptual grasp of his situation to deny any involvement in or knowledge of the offense.this was designed to protect his liberty interest.after a law enforcement official advised walker of additional information provided by a witness,walker then made an adjustment in his story to deal with this contingency.this reflects a degree of executive functioning and conceptual reasoning in that walker had entered the interview with one strategy in mind and then changed that strategy based on immediately unfolding circumstances.he then gave a written statement which,although marked by misspelling and grammatical error,reflected a linear thought process with no oddities or illogical reasoning.the statement,which if believed,would have furthered his liberty interest.
the commonwealth also introduced court transcripts that contain examples of walker testifying as to historical events and even correcting prosecutors as to the timeline of his various arrests.
in addition,the commonwealth presented evidence of walker ability to read and write.for example,the commonwealth provided several examples of walker writing ability,including prison forms and the written statement that he prepared in connection with an armed robbery charge.hagan noted walker admission that he would use a fellow inmate to write letters,not because i can not find the words,but because it easier for him to do it.thus,according to hagan,walker reason for having others write letters for him was less a matter of inability and more a matter of convenience.
in attempting to prove significant limitations in his social skills,walker presented evidence that he is a loner who has always had difficulties maintaining appropriate relationships with his peers.in particular,walker presented school records replete with observations of his social and behavioral difficulties.his records describe his behavior variously as aberrant,inappropriate,disruptive,and deviant.one report from walker school years notes that he would threaten smaller children and tease other students cruelly.walker also presented evidence that this behavior continues to this day,in the form of affidavits from fellow inmates that he will flood his cell when he gets upset.
however,the commonwealth presented its own evidence suggesting that walker deficits in social skills are not significant.first,although walker school records generally indicate his difficulties getting along with peers at school,other records from the same time period suggest that he was capable of developing and maintaining social relationships outside of the classroom.for example,his mother responses to a virginia department of education social behavior checklist indicate that walker had plenty of friends and got along well with adults.among his favorite activities,his mother listed sports,church activities and talking to adults.moreover,a psychiatric evaluation noted 
there is no history of school avoidance or separation difficulties.patient states that in classroom he is made fun of and called retarded by his classmates.he states that they get jealous when he makes and they get c and d on their tests.he states that they will not let him play any games with them and so then goes to play with the sixth graders.he and his mother both report that he is able to get along with neighborhood children without problems.he and his mother both report that he is the and this may bring some attention to him in addition to his hyperactive type behavior in the classroom and might set him up to be the.
further,some of walker school records indicate his ability to maintain appropriate social intercourse.classroom reviews from note his very appropriate classroom behavior and his ability to get along with his peers.
additionally,hagan pointed to reports from prison officials of walker behavior as indicative of social skills.prison officials reported that walker never had difficulty communicating his needs and interests and was cordial and conversational.prison mental health services screenings of walker note that he was clean,cooperative,and capable of engaging in extensive conversations about family and security complaints.his behavior during these screenings was variously described as polite and cooperative.moreover,hagan noted walker ability to ingratiate himself to women and establish intimate relationships with them in a relatively short period of time as evidence of his social skills.
walker presented evidence suggesting that he suffers from limitations in his practical adaptive skills.for example,he pointed to evidence that he is incapable of performing the basic tasks incidental to an independent life,such as renting an apartment,managing money,and paying bills.his mother affidavit portrays him as a man who just would have been able to read and understand a bill or a lease,and his brother averred that walker never knew how to handle money.the commonwealth expert agreed that there is no evidence that walker ever had a bill in his name.
walker also introduced evidence that he was unable to obtain a driver license and was wholly dependent on others for transportation.his brother averred that walker never had a driver license.i never saw him take a public bus.if darick wanted to get somewhere,me or another relative would have to drive him.another relative stated that walker had a tough time understanding easy directions.i used to work straight down the street from my apartment.i told darick exactly how to get from one place to the other,but he could find his way home even though it was right down the street.
finally,walker put forth evidence that he has a very limited job history and was unable to maintain steady employment prior to his incarceration.according to one of his experts,walker did not have a regular job or even stable employment.walker expert considered these facts important because a critical adaptive behavior domain for adults is employment and.
on the other hand,the commonwealth presented a considerable amount of evidence illustrating walker practical skills.for example,the commonwealth presented walker own testimony from his trial for armed robbery.that testimony included the following exchanges 
q and when you were stopped by officer hamilton,you were coming out of howard road 
a yes,i was,that my apartment number.
the court walker,how did you get from richmond down to chesapeake 
witness derrick sic walker well,sir,um,the person car that i had,i returned the car,and that person wanted to know why did i want a ride to the tidewater area.i explained to that person what i had did.i just did want to take the car and go to the tidewater area and then have that person without a car,so she gave me a ride and dropped me off at my brother house.
at.according to hagan,these exchanges showcased walker ability to remember addresses,his ability to make his way from one place to another,and his ability to drive.hagan also pointed to records from walker case file on his carnal knowledge conviction that relate instances of walker driving a car,using a pager,and renting a hotel room.
in addition,hagan testified as to his interviews with one of walker girlfriends,kelly walker white.white related that walker shared an apartment with her for a period of time,during which walker babysat her son,cared for the apartment,and cooked from scratch.during the evidentiary hearing,hagan gave the following testimony 
and it was just that he took on these tasks,he did them effectively,he did them repeatedly,he did them consistently.she would come home from work,the child was clean,was dressed,was powdered,bathed and not with a whimper of discontent from the child,and dinner was ready.and she was very pleased to have his able assistance.
moreover,hagan noted that,with respect to walker employment history,there was no evidence that walker was ever discharged from employment due to an inability to perform the duties of the job.in his report,hagan observed 
although his experts declare that walker was not able to secure and maintain a job,his own statement is that he found several jobs,but quit them at his own election,just as he quit job corps.he left because he did not have family support he said he left long john silver in richmond after months because he wanted to go home and help his mother who had an unconfirmed heart condition.this was voluntary unemployment.
hagan went on to explain that walker elected lifestyle,including chronic involvement in criminal activities,did not lend itself to mainstream employment,but there was no indication of an actual inability in that regard.
finally,there is evidence in the record tending to show that walker is able to adequately care for himself.for example,walker washes his own clothing in prison in order to avoid skin irritation which he attributed to the soap used in the prison laundry.hagan report also relied on statements from prison officials that they had never observed hygiene problems with regard to walker and that walker had never had any trouble communicating his needs and concerns to prison officials.
ultimately,four experts testified that walker skills limitations are significant,basing their conclusions on school and medical records,clinical interviews,prior psychological evaluations,declarations from individuals familiar with walker,and other records concerning his background,as well as the results of a standardized measure called the adaptive behavior assessment system,second edition.in contrast,the commonwealth expert,hagan,testified that walker does not suffer from significant limitations in his adaptive behavior.he based his conclusions on a clinical interview with a collateral informant,review of interview summaries by trial defense investigators and mitigation specialist,observation of walker interviews with three psychologists on two occasions,numerous reports of psychological testing including iq scores as well as a review of educational,correctional and vocational records.in his report,hagan also concluded that walker experts reliance on the to determine walker adaptive behavior was not sound practice.
apparently crediting hagan testimony over walker experts testimony,the district court concluded that walker failed to meet his burden of showing significant limitations in his adaptive behavior 
petitioner has failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he has significant limitations in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual,social,and practical adaptive skills.see ann.a.while petitioner has presented evidence that he suffers from below average mental intelligence,struggles to perform some basic activities,exhibits behavior,and obtains financial support from others,petitioner has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that he has significant limitations in adaptive behavior.petitioner has committed various crimes requiring the ability to relate to others,associated himself with women on a personal and intimate level,engaged in homemaking activities,seduced girls,used others to help him avoid authorities,independently invoked his miranda rights,used his brother identity to obtain a driver license,and obtained goods for himself while in prison.therefore,while p etitioner has below average mental intelligence and some limitations in adaptive behavior,the court finds that petitioner has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that he is mentally retarded as defined by virginia law.
in challenging these findings as being clearly erroneous,walker argues that the district court holding could only result from a complete failure to consider his overwhelming proof,appropriately weigh it,and make specific findings to explain the basis for its ruling.brief for appellant darick demorris walker,at.he further contends that the court general findings lack evidentiary support and are consistent with the definition of mental retardation.id.we find no merit to these contentions.
as we have summarized above,the district court was presented with conflicting evidence concerning walker adaptive skills,and it had the opportunity to assess the various witnesses who testified.unfortunately for walker,the court was not persuaded by his evidentiary presentation,and it concluded that he failed to meet his burden of proving the necessary fact that he suffers from significant limitations in adaptive behavior although the court finding in this regard may not be compelled by the evidence in the record,there is certainly evidence in the record to support it.applying our limited standard of appellate review,we can not conclude on the record presented that the court clearly erred.see anderson city of bessemer city,d where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.see,green,at affirming district court finding that the petitioner failed to prove significant limitations in adaptive behavior under virginia law notwithstanding conflicting evidence 
walker also claims that he was entitled to a jury determination of his mental retardation and that the district court erred by failing to empanel a jury.although we previously rejected this claim in walker ii,he contends that our prior decision is erroneous based on what he perceives to be an intervening change in the law.we disagree.
section of the virginia code sets forth the framework for the resolution of atkins claims filed by petitioners,like walker,who were sentenced to death before april.it provides 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,any person under sentence of death whose sentence became final in the circuit court before april,and who desires to have a claim of his mental retardation presented to the supreme court,shall do so by one of the following methods i if the person has not commenced a direct appeal,he shall present his claim of mental retardation by assignment of error and in his brief in that appeal,or if his direct appeal is pending in the supreme court,he shall file a supplemental assignment of error and brief containing his claim of mental retardation,or ii if the person has not filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under subsection c of,he shall present his claim of mental retardation in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under such subsection,or if such a petition is pending in the supreme court,he shall file an amended petition containing his claim of mental retardation.a person proceeding under this section shall allege the factual basis for his claim of mental retardation.the supreme court shall consider a claim raised under this section and if it determines that the claim is not frivolous,it shall remand the claim to the circuit court for a determination of mental retardation otherwise the supreme court shall dismiss the petition.the provisions of and shall govern a determination of mental retardation made pursuant to this section.if the claim is before the supreme court on direct appeal and is remanded to the circuit court and the case wherein the sentence of death was imposed was tried by a jury,the circuit court shall empanel a new jury for the sole purpose of making a determination of mental retardation.
if the person has completed both a direct appeal and a habeas corpus proceeding under subsection c of,he shall not be entitled to file any further habeas petitions in the supreme court and his sole remedy shall lie in federal court.
we explained in walker ii that on its face the virginia statute does not provide for a jury for claims raised in federal court.at.we also held that c,which provides that in any case in which the offense may be punishable by death and is tried before a jury,the issue of mental retardation shall be determined by the jury as part of the sentencing proceeding,does not entitle walker to a jury determination because that section reference to a jury determination is in the context of the appropriate procedure at sentencing in state court.id.at.
walker now argues that a subsequent virginia case,burns warden of sussex i state prison,constitutes an intervening change in the law that establishes his right to a jury.the issue in burns was whether the jury provisions of apply to a determination of mental retardation when the atkins claim is brought in a state habeas corpus proceeding.specifically,in burns the commonwealth argued that only provides for a jury determination of an individual mental retardation claim when that claim is raised to the virginia supreme court on direct appeal.at.the virginia supreme court rejected that argument,however,interpreting as requiring that the jury provisions of apply whether the claim is raised in a direct appeal or as a habeas corpus petition.at.
walker claims that burns has somehow clarified that the jury provisions of are a substantive component of his rights under atkins that must be applied to his case.we disagree.burns squarely holds that the jury provisions of apply to mental retardation claims that proceed in state court,regardless of whether they are raised on direct review or in a state habeas proceeding.this is wholly consistent with the language of,which expressly states that t he provisions of and shall govern a determination of mental retardation made pursuant to this section referencing claims brought in state court.burns does not address the language that our panel found to be controlling when walker originally raised this,the provision providing that if the person has completed both a direct appeal and a habeas corpus proceeding under subsection c of,he shall not be entitled to file any further habeas petitions in the supreme court and his sole remedy shall lie in federal court.
in short,burns merely clarifies that the jury provisions of apply to all atkins claims brought in a state court proceeding,both on direct review and state habeas review.this does not affect our prior determination that walker is not entitled to a jury in this case because he is in federal court.accordingly,the district court did not err by refusing to empanel a jury to determine walker mental retardation claim.
based on the foregoing,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
in atkins virginia,d,the supreme court held that the imposition of the death penalty on individuals with mental retardation violates the eighth amendment.while the supreme court le ft to the states the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences,id.at.quoting ford wainwright,d internal quotations omitted,it surely set some floor for determining who is mentally retarded.
the supreme court found that b ecause of their disabilities in areas of reasoning,judgment,and control of their impulses,mentally retarded persons do not act with the level of moral culpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal conduct.moreover,their impairments can jeopardize the reliability and fairness of capital proceedings against mentally retarded defendants.id.at.thus,there is a substantive component of the eighth amendment that must not be eviscerated by judicial interpretation of state definitions of mental retardation.yet,today result allows the commonwealth to defeat any mental retardation claim,no matter how compelling in its entirety,by cherry picking evidence relevant to a single component of virginia definition.this does satisfy atkins mandate.
while i agree that both prongs of the virginia definition must be satisfied for a defendant to prove mental retardation,i depart from the majority assertion that each component of the definition may always be read in isolation.the virginia statute itself states that the defendant must prov e that he is mentally retarded by a preponderance of the evidence and not that the defendant must prove each component by a preponderance of the evidence.ann.c hereinafter section.furthermore,though we are guided by state law,this court has an obligation to fulfill the federal supreme court directive from atkins that persons with mental retardation shall not be executed.the spirit of atkins can not be upheld by an interpretation of a mental retardation definition that ignores vast quantities of relevant evidence as well as blatant constitutional violations that prevent a petitioner from presenting his claim.for example,it must not be that a court tasked with following atkins may find it immaterial that the defendant was diagnosed as mentally retarded by scoring more than two standard deviations below the mean on an test,regardless of how low the score,simply because a defendant can have intimate relations with a woman or obtain a driver license.
the majority cites to our decision in green johnson,cir to support its conclusion that it is unnecessary to reach walker intellectual functioning arguments.in green,we found that under virginia law,green must prove both prongs of virginia statutory definition for mental retardation in order to establish that he is mentally retarded.id.at citation omitted.we then affirmed the district court dismissal of petitioner atkins claim based on evidence relevant to the adaptive functioning prong of virginia definition of mental retardation.id.at.
i believe green comes perilously close to the substantive floor set in atkins by seemingly analyzing the two prongs of the virginia definition independently in green,however,we affirmed the dismissal of the mental retardation claim only after finding that the district court and magistrate judge consideration of the evidence relevant to petitioner adaptive functioning was thorough.id.the magistrate judge set forth in detail the expert testimony presented by both sides at the evidentiary hearing and explained its findings and conclusions with respect to petitioner adaptive skills.thus,although close,the constitutional floor set in atkins was protected by a thorough and complete review of petitioner evidence of mental retardation.the same can not be said of the case before us now.
in this capital case,a case that has generated an appellate record of over pages,the district court opinion spanned fewer than ten pages.in particular,the district court consideration of the evidence on the adaptive functioning prong in this case amounted to at most three sentences.based on this record,we can not have the degree of confidence required to affirm the district court dismissal of walker atkins claim by looking exclusively to the adaptive functioning prong.
furthermore,this court in green was not faced with serious errors by the district court that affected the petitioner ability to present his mental retardation claim in the first instance a blatant due process violation affecting walker ability to present evidence of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and a failure by the district court to consider walker evidence of generally accepted professional practices in interpreting the results of intellectual functioning tests.these errors can not be harmless,as the majority finds,when the floor set by atkins is not secure.
nor did we face in green a case in which the district court specifically failed to adhere to a previous order from this court.in walker true ii,cir,we described the nature of the evidentiary hearing that walker should have been afforded on remand walker is entitled under law both to an evidentiary hearing in which he is afforded an opportunity to fully develop the factual basis of his mental retardation claim and to consideration by the courts of all of the evidence that is relevant to that claim under virginia statutory framework.id.at internal citations omitted emphasis added.if our decision in walker true ii is to have any significance,we must remand this case so that walker may receive the consideration to which he is entitled.
because i find that the district court committed clear error by not properly considering walker evidence of significant limitations in adaptive behavior,i also consider walker claims on the intellectual functioning prong.on that prong,i find both that the district court violated walker procedural due process rights and erred in failing to consider walker evidence of generally accepted professional practices in interpreting the results of intellectual functioning tests.based on these errors,this court should remand for the district court to consider all evidence relevant to walker atkins claim.moreover,i do not read our precedent to mean that any evidence on one prong,no matter how slight,may always be cited by the district court to preclude our review of a petitioner full atkins claim under virginia law.atkins requires a reasonable appellate review to uphold the constitutional proscription of the use of capital punishment on offenders who are mentally retarded.thus,i respectfully dissent from section ii of this opinion.
on this record,i would find that the district court committed clear error by not properly considering walker evidence of significant limitations in adaptive behavior.based on this error alone,i believe this court has an obligation to consider walker claim that his due process rights were violated and his claim that the district court failed to follow this court previous decision and consider walker evidence of generally accepted professional practices in interpreting intellectual functioning tests results.
the majority finds that walker atkins claim fails because walker possesses some adaptive skills.however,the district court made no finding that walker was unequivocally functioning at such a level that he could not be classified as a person with mental retardation.the district court simply parroted several findings of the commonwealth expert that should have been considered along with all other evidence proffered on the issue of adaptive functioning.this reasoning by the district court should not withstand any level of scrutiny.
while the district court acknowledged that walker suffers from below average mental intelligence,struggles to perform some basic activities,exhibits behavior,and obtains financial support from others,the court dismissed walker claim by citing evidence that he has committed various crimes requiring the ability to relate to others,associated with women on a personal and intimate level,engaged in homemaking activities,seduced girls,used others to help him avoid authorities,independently invoked his miranda rights,used his brother identity to obtain a driver license,and obtained goods for himself while in prison.
although the clear error standard under which we review the district court findings is quite deferential,this court may reverse the district court where its determination was made without properly taking into account substantial evidence to the contrary.miller mercy,cir.thus,the question here is whether the district court properly took into account walker expert testimony regarding his limitations in adaptive behavior.
in its decision,the district court did not specifically discuss any of walker evidence instead,it merely summarized the testimony of the warden expert,hagan.on its face,this seems like a classic battle of the experts,and thus it would be extremely difficult to find that the district court erred in believing one expert testimony over another however,the district court did not purport to lend more credence to hagan testimony than to walker experts.rather,the court apparently found that hagan testimony somehow negated walker showing of significant limitations in adaptive behavior.but as walker experts testified,the activities cited by the district court are entirely consistent with mental retardation this adheres to the logic that the american association on mental retardation aamr says one must follow when applying the definition of mental retardation 
within an individual,limitations often coexist with strengths.this means that people with mental retardation are complex human beings who likely have certain gifts as well as limitations.like all people,they often do some things better than other things.individuals may have capabilities and strengths that are independent of their mental retardation.
aamr,user guide mental retardation definition,classification,and systems of support ed.in particular,individuals with mental retardation can have intimate relationships,perform homemaking activities,craft simple lies,and invoke their miranda rights.with regard to the crime cited by hagan which purportedly demonstrated that walker had the ability to relate to others,walker expert testified that his execution of the scheme,including giving the victim his phone number,did not demonstrate a high level of cognitive or conceptual ability.
because the district court did not properly consider walker evidence of significant limitations in adaptive behavior,the district court committed clear error.this basis is sufficient for this court to proceed to walker arguments on the intellectual functioning prong.in addition,i believe that atkins requires more in this case than simply
