in this appeal,anthony guest asks us to overturn his murder conviction because of his contention that the trial judge was biased and denied him a fair trial.after extensive discovery in the district court,guest was able to produce substantial evidence indicating corruption on the part of the trial judge.however,guest has produced no evidence that the judge corruption tainted his trial.for this reason,as discussed in more detail below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
in,anthony guest was convicted of aggravated battery,unlawful use of weapons,attempted murder,and three counts of murder after a bench trial before judge maurice pompey in the circuit court of cook county,illinois.at trial,two eyewitnesses testified against guest.one of the witnesses,ferris king,was a security guard at the jewel grocery store where the crimes took place.king testified that he approached guest and identified himself as a security guard after he observed guest shoplifting toothpaste.king asked guest to come with him to the jewel store security office,which was in the store basement.when they reached the security office,guest refused to be searched and pulled a gun out of his pocket.king stated that guest could keep the items and began to walk towards the adjoining employee cafeteria,with guest following him.when the two men entered the cafeteria,three other jewel employees were already sitting bailey,marlean washington,and gary henderson.
after seeing guest pointing a gun at king,joanne bailey attempted to flee.guest shot at her and missed.king then fired a shot at guest,but missed,and guest responded by shooting king in the shoulder.guest then ran out of the cafeteria and escaped.later,the body of another jewel employee,john geever,was found in the basement,dead as a result of a gunshot wound.no witnesses saw geever being shot.
guest had entered the jewel store with a friend named john marlow,who was not involved in the shootings.marlow did not leave the store after guest fled the scene,but remained and assisted the chicago police department by identifying guest.the day after the shootings,all four of the jewel employees who had been in the cafeteria identified guest in a photo array.guest remained a fugitive for a year,but after he was apprehended,king and washington both identified him in a lineup.
at the trial,both king and bailey identified guest as the shooter,and the defense stipulated that the other two jewel employees would also identify guest as the shooter.the defense also stipulated geever had not been killed by a bullet from king gun.
judge pompey sentenced guest to death by electrocution.on appeal,the illinois supreme court affirmed guest sentence,while vacating two of his murder convictions that were legally duplicative.guest unsuccessfully petitioned the united states supreme court for a writ of certiorari,and subsequently filed various state motions.
in,guest filed a petition for habeas corpus in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois,raising various claims related to his death sentence and arguing that his right to a fair trial before an impartial judge was infringed and that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective.the district court granted guest extensive discovery on the issue of judicial bias.guest was allowed to depose judge pompey,pompey bailiff,lucius robinson,and guest attorney during his murder trial,dennis tobin.he received transcripts from the trial of a corrupt cook county judge judge thomas maloney and fbi investigation materials related to an operation to uncover judicial corruption known as operation greylord.
operation greylord uncovered extensive corruption in the illinois courts,including bribes being paid to multiple judges in exchange for dismissals.guest deposition of robinson and other evidence uncovered during habeas discovery indicated that judge pompey had taken numerous bribes in exchange for favorable rulings in criminal cases.such was the finding of judge hibbler below,who observed that e ven though judge pompey corruption was never exposed in a public trial,guest counsel has unearthed a considerable amount of distressing evidence that casts serious doubt on judge pompey integrity.
in,george ryan granted guest clemency with regard to his execution,mooting the death claims in the original habeas petition.guest filed an amended habeas petition in,asserting only the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and the judicial bias claim.the district court denied the petition on march.guest now appeals only the district court judgment on the judicial bias claim.
ii.analysis 
procedural default and exhaustion 
the respondent argues that guest judicial bias claim is procedurally barred as a result of his failure to present it in state court.under,before a state habeas petitioner is allowed to pursue his claims in federal court,he must exhaust his remedies in the state courts.see boerckel,d state prisoners must give the state courts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the state established appellate review process.in illinois,this means that a petitioner must have directly appealed to the illinois appellate court and presented the claim in a petition for leave to appeal to the illinois supreme court.see id.if a habeas petitioner has not exhausted a claim,and complete exhaustion is no longer available,the claim is procedurally defaulted.see id.at.
guest did not present his judicial bias claim to the illinois state courts and there is no longer time to do so.this means that his claim is defaulted unless he can demonstrate either cause for the default and prejudice or that ignoring the default is necessary to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice.see badelle correll,cir.the district court concluded that guest had demonstrated cause for the failure because the details of judge pompey corruption did not surface until judge maloney corruption trial,one year after guest filed his appeal to the illinois supreme court.the district court rejected the respondent argument,raised again here on appeal,that guest was put on notice by a newspaper article in that suggested corruption on the part of judge pompey,a grand jury subpoena of judge pompey records,and a statement made in a television report linking judge pompey to operation greylord.
in order to demonstrate cause for failure to exhaust,guest must demonstrate that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel efforts to comply with the state procedural rule.see mccleskey zant,d quoting murray carrier,d.the court in mccleskey identified three types of objective factors that would constitute sufficient cause interference by officials that makes compliance impractical constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel and a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel.id.the third factor is applicable here.the scattered news items and court filings identified by the respondent were insufficient to put guest on notice.we can not say that the factual basis for a judicial bias claim was reasonably available to counsel on the basis of the items cited by the respondent.a prisoner is not necessarily expected to be aware of even the most obscure news stories which might expose the basis for a claim of unconstitutional imprisonment.the district court did not address the question of actual prejudice,and we need not either since it is effectively subsumed by guest substantive claim.there is no harmless error in a judicial bias case.see bracy schomig,cir.
however,the respondent also argues that guest could have returned to the state courts after the discovery of new evidence under the illinois hearing act,ilcs et and advances this as a secondary argument for procedural default.we need not reach this argument because,as explained in detail below,even under the more liberal standard of review applicable where we address issues not adjudicated by the state courts,it is clear that guest judicial bias claim fails on the merits.
