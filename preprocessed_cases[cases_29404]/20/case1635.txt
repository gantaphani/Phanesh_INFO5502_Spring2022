this is an appeal from an order granting a writ of habeas corpus.the key issue is whether the state trial court refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing on certain ineffective assistance claims which the petitioner had asserted in a timely motion for a new trial constituted cause for the petitioner subsequent failure to assert a different ineffective assistance claim in her direct appeal.we conclude that the denial of an evidentiary hearing on the particular ineffective assistance claims that were asserted initially did not constitute cause for the delay which proved to be fatal in asserting the new ineffective assistance claim.accordingly,and because the procedural default can not be excused on other grounds,we shall reverse the grant of the writ.
after a bench trial in a michigan state court,the petitioner,kylleen,was found guilty of first degree murder and arson.the court determined that early one morning entered the home of her boyfriend while he was sleeping,stabbed him in the heart with a knife she had taken from his kitchen,and set his bed on fire.she was sentenced to life in prison.
moved for a new trial,arguing,among other things,she had been denied effective assistance of counsel by reason of the fact that her trial lawyers had neglected to move for the suppression of certain evidence and had failed to object to alleged prosecutorial misconduct.asked the court to hold an evidentiary hearing if it could not grant the requested relief on the existing record.
the prosecution opposed the motion and argued that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary.the acts or omissions of counsel cited by were already matters of record,the prosecution maintained,and the record showed they lacked merit.the trial court accepted the prosecution argument and denied the motion for a new trial without conducting an evidentiary hearing.
then appealed her conviction,asserting the same ineffective assistance claims she had raised in her motion for a new trial.she also moved for a remand to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing.the state court of appeals denied the remand motion for failure to persuade the court of the necessity of a remand at this time.the court went on to affirm conviction,holding among other things that had not established that she had been prejudiced by the alleged deficiencies in her lawyers performance.the michigan supreme court denied application for leave to appeal.
next,represented by new counsel,filed a motion with the trial court seeking relief from judgment under chapter of the michigan court rules.the motion raised a new claim of ineffective assistance of trial that acknowledged had not been raised in her motion for a new trial or in her appeal.this new claim was based on her trial counsel alleged failure to investigate the case and interview witnesses.asked the trial court to order her immediate release or,in the alternative,to allow discovery and to hold an evidentiary hearing.
the state argued,in response,that consideration of the new ineffective assistance claim was barred by d,having failed to establish good cause for not raising the claim on appeal and actual prejudice resulting from the allegedly ineffective assistance replied that she could not have raised the claim on appeal because the facts supporting that claim were not in the trial record and were not known to her at the time.
the trial court denied the motion for relief from judgment on both procedural and substantive grounds.first,the court held that fail ed to establish good cause for not raising the new ineffective assistance claim on appeal.the court then addressed the merits of the claim and rejected it on the ground that an attorney failure to investigate do es not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.the court did not hold an evidentiary hearing.
sought leave to appeal,but both the court of appeals and the supreme court denied leave on the ground that had failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr d.
then filed her federal court petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the petition asserted four grounds for relief,one of which was a tripartite ineffective assistance claim.the claim was based on trial counsel alleged failure to investigate and interview witnesses,the failure to move to suppress evidence,and the failure to object to alleged prosecutorial misconduct.with respect to the branch of the ineffective assistance claim,the state responded that the michigan courts had rejected the claim on procedural grounds and had not shown cause for her procedural default.
prior to the hearing on petition,the district court instructed counsel for both parties to be prepared to discuss what the court perceived as a.because requests for an evidentiary hearing were denied,the court said,she was not able to raise her claim on direct appeal.and because she had not raised the claim on direct appeal,she was barred from raising it in her collateral proceeding.it thus appears,the district court said,that the state procedural rules prevented petitioner from raising her claim until she reached this court.
after argument,the district court concluded that the denial of the requests for an evidentiary hearing constituted cause for procedural default.the court further concluded that was prejudiced by her trial attorneys failure to investigate.the court therefore ordered that be granted a new trial or be released from custody.the court rejected other claims for relief,including the remaining branches of her ineffective assistance claim.the state has filed a timely notice of appeal.
in general,a federal court may not consider a claim for habeas corpus relief if the claim was procedurally defaulted in state,if the last state court to render a judgment in the case rejected the claim because it was not presented in accordance with the state procedural rules.see,harris reed,d.a procedurally defaulted claim may be considered in federal habeas corpus proceedings only if the petitioner either shows cause for his failure to comply with the state procedural rules and prejudice resulting from the alleged violation of federal law or shows that the federal court refusal to consider the claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.coleman thompson,d see,harris,at.
the question presented in the case at bar is whether the district court erred in ruling that cause and prejudice excused the procedural default of claim.the district court application of the cause and prejudice rules must be reviewed de novo.see,lucas,cir.because we are reviewing a federal court application of legal rules,and not the state courts adjudication of the claim,we are not called upon to determine whether any state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law.d.such a determination would become necessary if we were to conclude that the claim is not procedurally,if we were to reach the merits of the claim.for reasons to which we now turn,however,we conclude that claim is procedurally barred.
it seems clear that the last state court to render judgment in case rejected her claim on procedural grounds,it will be recalled,did not present the claim on direct appeal before raising it in her collateral motion for relief from judgment.that omission violated a state procedural rule,michigan court rule d,which generally precludes relief from judgment if the motion alleges grounds for relief,other than jurisdictional defects,which could have been raised on appeal from the conviction and sentence the michigan supreme court,like the trial court and the court of appeals,cited d in rejecting claim.
our precedents establish that the state supreme court order saying simply that failed to meet the burden of establishing entitlement to relief under mcr d was based on an independent and adequate state procedural rule.simpson jones,cir burroughs makowski,cir,modified.cir.despite its brevity,the order constituted a reasoned judgment that adequately explained its procedural basis.because the michigan supreme court expressly stated that claim was barred by mcr d,see simpson,at,the federal courts may not review that claim absent cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice.see harris,at.
the cause standard in procedural default cases requires the petitioner to show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel efforts to raise the claim in state court.mccleskey zant,d quoting murray carrier,d.such factors may include interference by officials,attorney error rising to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel,and a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.as we have seen,the district court concluded that the denial of requests for an evidentiary hearing constituted cause for her failure to raise the claim on direct appeal.this conclusion,we believe,was erroneous.
in people ginther,the supreme court of michigan held that a criminal defendant should move for a new trial and seek to make a separate factual record in the trial court if the trial record does not cover the claims he wishes to raise on appeal.followed that procedure with respect to her original claims of ineffective,the claims that her trial attorneys should have moved to suppress evidence and should have objected to alleged prosecutorial misconduct.the trial court declined to hold an evidentiary hearing and the court of appeals declined to remand for such a hearing,presumably because the claims then in question could be disposed of on the existing record.
position seems to be that she should have been granted a ginther hearing to develop an ineffective assistance claim different from the claims she raised in her motion for a new trial and on direct appeal.we find no basis for this position in michigan law.ginther authorizes the creation of a record to support claims which the defendant wishes to urge on appeal not claims which the defendant has expressed no wish to urge on appeal.ginther,at.neither ginther nor,to our knowledge,any other michigan authority permits the use of an evidentiary hearing to illuminate claims which have not been asserted or to unearth claims of which the defendant may be unaware 
had raised the claim in her motion for a new trial,and had she requested a ginther hearing in connection with that claim,we have no reason to suppose that her request would not have been granted.under the circumstances,we believe that it was failure to raise the claim,and not any misguided action of the state courts,that caused the procedural default.never having alleged ineffective assistance on the part of her and appellate counsel,this failure does not constitute an objective factor external to her defense.carrier,at.
contends that she had no way of knowing about her claim when she filed her new trial motion she contends,in other words,that the factual basis for the claim was not reasonably available to her at that time.id.we are not persuaded.even if had no meaningful communication with her trial attorneys about the preparation of her case,she knew from her attendance at trial that the attorneys did not call any fact that might easily lead one to suspect inadequate preparation.moreover,the attorney representing after the trial could have interviewed the trial attorneys to discover any potential claims and was able to raise the claim in her motion for relief from judgment,after all,without having had the benefit of an evidentiary hearing.
we are not persuaded,in short,that the state courts refusal to order a ginther hearing constituted cause for procedural default.both cause and prejudice must be shown when a habeas petitioner seeks to excuse a procedural default,see carrier,at,so we need not decide whether has shown prejudice resulting from her trial attorneys alleged failure to investigate.see smith murray,d.
as we have said,a procedurally defaulted claim may be reviewed in habeas proceedings despite the absence of a showing of cause if such review is necessary to avoid a fundamental miscarriage of justice.see,coleman,at.the fundamental miscarriage of justice test is met only in the extraordinary case where a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.carrier,at.see schlup delo,d.to establish the requisite probability,the petitioner must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the evidence that was not presented at trial.schlup,at.
applying this standard,we are unable to conclude that has shown it probable that she is actually innocent.relies primarily on five affidavits,each of which was executed about six years after the events at issue none of the affiants testified live at the hearing on the habeas petition.
according to the affidavit of deborah smulsky,a,said on the day before the murder that the decedent,joe bernal,had proposed marriage the previous night.argues that this evidence undercuts the prosecution theory as to,that bernal had spurned.but there is no necessary conflict between smulsky testimony and the prosecution theory.could have misled smulsky.or bernal could have proposed one day and retracted the proposal the next.because smulsky testimony does not compel a finding that lacked motive,we think a reasonable factfinder could have convicted despite the new evidence.
sons,nathan and john,said in their affidavits that their mother awoke them on the day of the murder at and respectively,and that she seemed to be behaving normally then.dennis hewitt,nathan guidance counselor,similarly swore that was not upset or agitated when she met with him between and that same morning.this evidence might have aided the defense at trial by showing that was calm and composed within an hour or two after bernal bed is thought to have been set on fire.calmness does not always mean innocence,however,and the probative value of this evidence,we believe,falls short of what is required.
finally,wesley sibu,a newspaper delivery person,stated in his affidavit that he saw a man in a uniform possibly a policeman or bernal house at on the morning of the murder.the man told him that there had been a fire,but sibu did not see any police cars or fire trucks.these facts could suggest that the man in a uniform was the perpetrator.the district court found sibu affidavit especially significant because other evidence suggested that another potential suspect,former boyfriend,may have been falsely representing himself as a police officer.
there are substantial inconsistencies,however,between sibu six years after the statements he made closer in time to the murder and arson.at preliminary examination,sibu said that he saw a police car and spoke with a police officer at,and that he was not sure whether that was the day of or the day after the fire.he also said he was positive that bernal garage door was closed when he spoke with the officer in his affidavit he stated that the door was open.moreover,sibu told police on the day of the fire that when he delivered the paper at about that morning there were no cars in the driveway or the street,and he did notice anything unusual.presented with these inconsistencies,a reasonable juror could easily find sibu latest account unpersuasive.
in sum,we can not say that no juror,acting reasonably,would have voted to find guilty in the light of the proffered affidavits.schlup,at.the other evidence cited in of which directly exculpates fails to compel a finding of actual innocence we conclude that the miscarriage of justice exception does not excuse procedural default.
the order granting petition for a writ of habeas corpus is reversed,and the case is remanded to the district court for entry of an order dismissing the petition.
the question before this court is whether the district court erred in ruling that there was cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default of petitioner ineffective assistance of counsel claim.in analyzing that claim,we must consider whether the trial court erred in denying petitioner three requests for evidentiary hearings,which were needed to determine whether facts existed to support the element of petitioner ineffective assistance of counsel claim.because petitioner successfully established cause and prejudice to overcome her procedura
