opinion of the court 
wilbur richardson filed a petition for habeas corpus claiming that the pennsylvania board of probation and parole the parole board has continually denied him parole in violation of the ex post facto clause of the united states constitution.richardson asserts that,in rejecting his parole application,the parole board retroactively applied amendments to the pennsylvania probation and parole act.stat,tit,a west parole act.richardson relies on our decision in vaughn,cir,in which we found that the use of the amendments to deny a petitioner parole violated the ex post facto clause.
the commonwealth,however,contends that does not control because the pennsylvania supreme court held in winklespecht pennsylvania board of probation and parole,that the amendments did not in fact change the substantive criteria for parole.unlike thomas,richardson was denied parole at least twice after winklespecht was decided.however,the pennsylvania supreme court more recent decision in cimaszewski board of probation and parole,undermines this interpretation of winklespecht.given cimaszewski,appears to have retained vitality.nevertheless,richardson has failed to state a claim for relief.to be eligible for habeas corpus based on a violation of the ex post facto clause,a petitioner must show both a retroactive change in law or policy and that this change caused individual disadvantage by creating a significant risk of increasing his punishment.garner jones,d,at.richardson has not demonstrated that he was disadvantaged by the use of the amendments in his parole determination.therefore,we will deny his request to order the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing,and we will affirm the order of the district court denying his petition for habeas corpus.
factual and procedural background 
parole in pennsylvania 
parole decisions in pennsylvania are governed by the parole act.stat,tit,a.once a prisoner has served his or her minimum sentence,the prisoner is eligible for parole.id.a.the parole board has the exclusive power to parole and reparole prisoners sentenced to two or more years of imprisonment.id.to determine a prisoner eligibility,the parole act directs the board to consider,inter alia,the prisoner complete criminal record,conduct while in prison,physical,mental,and behavior condition and history,the nature and circumstances of the offense committed,and the general character and background of the prisoner.id.
to further aid its analysis,the parole board also looks to pennsylvania parole decision making guidelines the parole guidelines,which provide a prediction of the likelihood of parole by assigning a numerical value to certain criteria,based on past patterns of recidivism and an assessment of risk to the community.see,at.the parole guidelines include a worksheet and a formal numerical protocol the higher the numerical score,the less likely a petitioner is to be granted parole 
these considerations,however,are not binding,as the parole act confers complete discretion on the parole board to make the ultimate parole determination.id.see also rogers.bd.of prob.parole,t he general assembly,in its wisdom,has conferred upon the parole board sole discretion to determine whether a prisoner is sufficiently rehabilitated to serve the remainder of his sentence outside of the confines of prison.thus parole decisions in pennsylvania are generally not subject to judicial review unless the petitioner asserts a constitutional challenge to the denial of parole or seeks a writ of mandamus to compel the parole board to exercise its discretion.see coady vaughn,where discretionary actions and criteria are not being contested an action for mandamus remains viable as a means for examining whether statutory requirements have been altered in a manner that violates the ex post facto clause absent a change in the statutes governing parole,however,denial of parole would generally constitute a discretionary matter that is not subject to review.
section of the parole act contains a general statement of the policy and philosophy of the pennsylvania parole system.from its enactment in until,section emphasized the values of rehabilitation and restoration to social and economic life,by providing the following statement of parole policy 
the value of parole as a disciplinary and corrective influence and process is hereby recognized,and it is declared to be the public policy of this commonwealth that persons subject or sentenced to imprisonment for crime shall,on release therefrom,be subjected to a period of parole during which their rehabilitation,adjustment,and restoration to social and economic life and activities shall be aided and facilitated by guidance and supervision under a competent and efficient parole administration,and to that end it is the intent of this act to create a uniform and exclusive system for the administration of parole in this commonwealth.
act of august,formerly codified at.stat,tit,hereinafter,the parole act.
in,the parole act was modified to make public safety the primary consideration.see act of december.the policy statement under the amended parole act reads as follows 
the parole system provides several benefits to the criminal justice system,including the provision of adequate supervision of the offender while protecting the public,the opportunity for the offender to become a useful member of society and the diversion of appropriate offenders from prison.
in providing these benefits to the criminal justice system,the board shall first and foremost seek to protect the safety of the public.in addition to this goal,the board shall address input by crime victims and assist in the fair administration of justice by ensuring the custody,control and treatment of paroled offenders.
act of december,codified at.stat,tit,hereinafter,the amendments.
richardson parole history 
in,richardson was convicted in the court of common pleas of philadelphia county of third degree murder and was sentenced to years imprisonment.richardson has been denied parole each time he was considered between and.richardson was first denied parole in.the parole determination was made on december,before the effective date of the amendments,and thus fell under the parole act.the board cited several reasons for the denial,including that the instant offense was assaultive,involved a weapon,and caused injury to the victim richardson need for counseling and treatment and the unfavorable recommendation of the department of corrections.the parole board stated that it would consider in his next parole determination whether richardson participated in the prison prescriptive program plan,maintained a good conduct record,and earned institutional recommendation for parole.
the corrections staff of state correction institution dallas,where richardson was being held,first recommended richardson for parole in,and continued to recommend richardson for parole each subsequent year.notwithstanding these recommendations,the parole board continued to deny parole.the parole decision stated the same reasons as the decision,except that the decision added habitual offender as a new reason,and deleted unfavorable recommendation from the department of corrections as a rationale.
in and,the parole decision on richardson changed format in a manner that echoed the language of the amendments to the parole act.these decisions stated 
the pennsylvania board of probation and parole has determined that the mandates to protect the safety of the public and to assist in the fair administration of justice can not be achieved through your release on parole.
in and,the statement of reasons no longer mentioned the safety of the public and was limited to the terse conclusion t he fair administration of justice can not be achieved through your release on parole.you are therefore refused parole each year the parole board suggested the same considerations for the next parole determination as had been given in.
the parole board issued a modification of the decision several months after the original decision the new version of the decision stated 
following an interview with you and a review of your file,and having considered all matters required pursuant to the parole act of,as amended,et,the board in the exercise of its discretion,has determined at this time that your best interests do not justify or require you being and the interests of the commonwealth will be injured if you were.therefore you are refused at this time.the reasons for the board decision include the following 
the recommendation of the prosecuting attorney.
reports,evaluations and assessments concerning your physical,mental,and behavior condition and history.
other factors deemed pertinent in determining that you should not be paroled your prior criminal record.
the parole decision was identical to the modified decision except that two additional reasons were added 
your version of the nature and circumstances of the offense s committed.
your refusal to accept responsibility for the offense s committed.
in,richardson petitioned for a writ of mandamus in the commonwealth court of pennsylvania,arguing that the parole decisions violated the ex post facto clause of the united states constitution.the commonwealth court denied mandamus in an unpublished order,and the pennsylvania supreme court affirmed without opinion.richardson.bd.of prob.parole.richardson then filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania.the court denied his petition.
the court held that a prisoner carries the ultimate burden of establishing that the measure of punishment itself has changed,garner,at,and must show that as applied to his own sentence the law creates a significant risk of increasing his punishment.dep t of corr.morales,d.the court then found that richardson had failed to establish that the amendments affected the parole board decision.the court stated that its review of the documents in this case confirms that there is no language in the board decision implicating the amendments cited in richardson petition,and richardson has not demonstrated the role which those amendments played in the board decision.therefore,the court denied richardson petition because it concluded that the ex post facto claim in richardson habeas petition is based on speculation and conjecture.richardson has failed to link the one amended statute cited in connection with his first claim to the board decision.
ii.the ex post facto clause 
the ex post facto clause states that n o state shall pass any ex post facto law.const.art.i,cl.the clause applies to a statute or policy change which alters the definition of criminal conduct or increases the penalty by which a crime is punishable.morales,at.
the ex post facto inquiry has two prongs whether there was a change in the law or policy which has been given retrospective effect,and whether the offender was disadvantaged by the change.see weaver graham,d.to violate the ex post facto clause,a retroactive change in the law or policy must create a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered crimes a speculative and attenuated possibility of increasing the measure of punishment is not enough.morales,at.
in garner,the supreme court noted that r etroactive changes in laws governing parole of prisoners,in some instances,may be violative of the ex post facto clause.at.the court,however,acknowledged the inherent difficulty in deciding whether a retroactive change to parole policy constitutes an ex post facto violation,particularly considering the discretion generally afforded to parole boards in making the ultimate parole determination.id.the court made clear that t he presence of discretion does not displace the protections of the ex post facto clause and acknowledged the danger that legislatures might disfavor certain persons after the fact is present even in the parole context.id.at.
the court nonetheless has afforded states some measure of flexibility in making changes to their parole policy,and thus has been careful not to adopt a single formula for identifying which legislative adjustments,in matters bearing on parole,would survive an ex post facto challenge.id.at.informing this flexibility is the court observation that 
discretion,by its very definition,is subject to changes in the manner in which it is informed and then exercised.the idea of discretion is that it has the capacity,and the obligation,to change and adapt based on experience.new insights into the accuracy of predictions about the offense and the risk of recidivism consequent upon the offender release,along with a complex of other factors,will inform parole decisions.
id.at.therefore,the court cautioned that the ex post facto clause should not be employed for the micromanagement of an endless array of legislative adjustments to parole and sentencing procedures id.at.quoting morales,at,and that t he states must have due flexibility in formulating parole procedures and addressing problems associated with confinement and release.id.
iii.vaughn 
in vaughn,cir,we considered whether the amendments to the pennsylvania parole act violated the ex post facto clause.the petitioner,louis thomas,was one of the unusual prisoners who received a commutation of his life sentence,which rendered him eligible for parole in.of the prisoners whose life sentences had ever been commuted in pennsylvania,thomas was the only prisoner not to be granted parole.thomas petitioned for habeas relief arguing that the parole board denied him parole based on the amendments to the parole act in violation of the ex post facto clause.
the parole board argued in as here that the amendments did not change the board standards for determining parole.at alteration in original.we disagreed and found that the statute unequivocally has been interpreted by the pennsylvania courts to express broad and general aspirations of pennsylvania parole policy.id.citing stewart.bd.of prob.parole.we did not rely on the decided case of winklespecht pennsylvania board of probation and parole,because winklespecht was decided after the board actions on thomas parole and therefore came too late to alter the board view of the statutory amendment on the outcome of this case.at emphasis in original.
in,we held that the question is not whether the statute on its face pertains to parole decisionmaking,but whether,in practice,the new language has altered the fundament for reviewing parole applications.id.at emphasis original.we concluded that there was significant evidence that the practical effect of the amendments was to change the weight that public safety was given in the parole calculation.id.at.even though the board had always used public safety as one consideration in parole determinations,we found that,after,the board gave public safety far greater weight.id.at.this change particularly affected the chances of parole for violent offenders,who are subjected to a more stringent standard of review than under the scheme.id.quoting myers ridge.
having found that the amendments made a change in pennsylvania parole policy as a general matter,we turned to thomas specific case,and held that thomas also met the second prong of the ex post facto the change in policy adversely affected his parole decision.the panel found that there is significant evidence that the board acted upon policies that were established after thomas crime and conviction,mainly because of the board reliance on public safety,in denying thomas parole.id.at.central to this determination were the many factors that pointed toward a grant of parole,such as the parole guidelines score,the unanimous recommendation of the department of corrections,and,importantly,the fact that all prisoners whose life sentences were commuted prior to had been paroled.id.at.
given the foregoing analysis,we had no difficulty finding that the amendments substantially increased the period of incarceration by reducing the possibility of thomas release on parole.id.at.we therefore held that to retroactively apply changes in the parole laws made after conviction for a life sentence in pennsylvania that adversely affect the release of prisoners whose sentences have been commuted,violates the ex post facto clause.id.at.
iv.new law or policy 
concluded that the practica
