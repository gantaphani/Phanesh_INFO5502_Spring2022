a jury convicted ernest basden of the murder of,and conspiracy to murder,billy white,and recommended that he be sentenced to death.basden challenged his convictions and resulting death sentence in state court,unsuccessfully pursuing direct and postconviction relief.basden then filed this petition in the district court for a writ of habeas corpus,see west supp,maintaining that at his trial the state withheld exculpatory evidence and knowingly presented perjured testimony,that his counsel provided ineffective assistance,and that the indictment under which he was convicted was constitutionally defective.he now appeals the district court summary judgment denial of all habeas relief.we affirm.
the supreme court of north carolina on direct appeal described the facts surrounding white murder as follows 
the state evidence tended to show sylvia white wanted to kill her husband,billy white,for at least a year.she unsuccessfully tried to poison him with wild berries and poisonous plants.she also enlisted the help of linwood taylor,defendant nephew.taylor then approached defendant and told him he needed a hit man and asked defendant if he wanted the job.defendant initially thought the idea was crazy and refused.later,when defendant got into financial difficulty he asked taylor if the offer still stood and agreed to kill white.
taylor developed a scheme to lure white,who was an insurance salesman,to a location where he could be killed.taylor pretended to be a wealthy businessman from out of town who had bought property in jones county and wanted to buy insurance.taylor arranged for white to meet him in a wooded rural area at sunday,january.on the day of the murder,taylor and defendant drove to the designated spot and waited for white.
when white arrived,taylor got out of his car and introduced himself to white as tim conners.then taylor said he needed to use the bathroom and stepped to the other side of the road.defendant got out of the car and picked up a shotgun he had placed on the ground beside the driver side of the car.defendant pointed the gun at white and pulled the trigger.the shotgun did not fire because defendant had not cocked the hammer back.defendant then cocked the hammer and fired.white was knocked to the ground.defendant removed the spent shell casing and loaded another shell into the shotgun.defendant then approached white,who was lying faceup on the ground,and while standing over white,shot him again.at trial the pathologist testified that white bled to death from massive shotgun wounds to the right upper chest and left lower abdomen.although his aorta was nearly severed from his heart,white did not die instantly but would have remained conscious for some period of time and would have felt pain.
defendant and taylor drove back to taylor house after the shooting.taylor said he thought he left a map at the crime scene so they returned and went through white pockets taking a blank check,wallet,and gold ring.they then returned to taylor house and burned all their clothing in the backyard.they also sawed the shotgun into three or four pieces with a hacksaw,put the pieces into a bucket of cement,and threw it over a bridge into the neuse river.taylor gave defendant three hundred dollars.
prior to defendant arrest,police officers retrieved two metal base portions of spent shotgun shells which were found in ashes from the fire in taylor backyard.forensic examination indicated they were consistent with shotgun shells and could have been fired from the same weapon.officers also went to defendant repair shop in kinston and retrieved a man ring with three diamond settings from defendant,who had it in his pocket.
taylor and sylvia white were arrested for murder on february.defendant went to the jones county sheriff department where taylor told defendant that he had confessed.taylor advised defendant to turn himself in and talk to sbi agent eric smith.defendant was interviewed by agent smith and detective simms of the lenoir county sheriff department.after giving some preliminary background information,defendant told the officers that he shot white.the officers immediately read defendant his miranda rights and defendant signed a written waiver of his rights.defendant then gave a detailed confession and stated that he killed white because he needed the money.
defendant presented evidence that he suffered from depression,arthritis,kidney problems,pancreatitis,and drug and alcohol abuse.he is the youngest of ten children and thus actually a few months younger than taylor,his much older sister son.he was extremely close to his mother,who was killed in a car accident when he was fourteen years old,and he never really recovered from her death.defendant had been married once for about five years and was a good father to his stepchildren.defendant was considered by friends and family to be a loner.
don everhart,a clinical psychologist,testified that defendant has a dependent personality disorder he is lacking in and clings to stronger people,performing unpleasant tasks for them to retain their support.everhart further testified that defendant has an avoidance personality disorder he is shy and uncomfortable in social settings and is easily isolated.finally,defendant has a schizotypal personality disorder,with feelings of being disembodied and disassociated from life events.
state basden.
the state tried basden for capital murder,and the jury convicted him,less than fourteen months after he shot and killed billy white.at basden trial,the state established the details of the crime that are outlined above,through the testimony of police officers and cross examination of basden himself.two officers testified to the contents of several detailed confessions,from both basden and his,taylor.moreover,basden himself took the stand and admitted in cross examination that he was the one who actually shot white,that he agreed to do it the friday before the monday murder,and that he did it for the money.
the jury deliberated for an hour and fifteen minutes before convicting basden,and for nearly nine hours before issuing its sentencing recommendation.the jury found one statutory aggravating crime was committed for pecuniary two statutory mitigating was dominated by taylor and under the influence of a mental or emotional disturbance.the jury also found five nonstatutory mitigating and remorse,willing assumption of responsibility,religious belief and practice while incarcerated,stress at the time of the crime,confession and cooperation with law enforcement at an early stage of the investigation,and character and prior conduct inconsistent with the crime.in accord with the jury recommendation,the judge sentenced basden to death.
basden appealed his convictions and sentence to the supreme court of north carolina and after that court affirmed the verdict and sentence,the supreme court of the united states denied certiorari.see state basden,cert.denied,d.then basden filed a motion for appropriate relief,which the state postconviction court denied in january.after involved state court proceedings,basden finally won postconviction discovery in.see state basden,state basden.this discovery provided basden with a number of documents,including police reports of additional statements from taylor and a statement of one tim jones,describing facts concerning billy white death and the plan to kill him.on the basis of these documents,basden filed an amended motion for appropriate relief the state postconviction court again rejected it,and the supreme court of north carolina and supreme court of the united states denied review.see basden north carolina,d state basden,state basden.
basden then filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.the district court rejected a number of basden claims as procedurally defaulted,found the remaining claims meritless,and refused to grant basden an evidentiary hearing.basden appeals.
we conduct de novo review of a district court decision on a petition for writ of habeas corpus based on a state court record.see spicer roxbury corr,cir.applying the same standard as the district court,we can order issuance of the writ only if the state court adjudication of a claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d west.
basden raises two arguments grounded in brady maryland,d,which holds that a state violates a defendant due process rights when it fails to disclose to the defendant prior to trial evidence favorable to an accused where the evidence is material.id.at.see also united states agurs,d.under brady,evidence favorable to the accused includes impeachment as well as exculpatory evidence the suppression of such evidence is material and so violates due process if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickler greene,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
basden bases his brady claims on documents he received through postconviction discovery in,years after his conviction,sentence,and direct appeal.ten documents fall into this category drawings of the crime scene a report of jimmy britt dated february,a report of deputy jernigan dated february,a statement by timothy jones a report of surveillance activities involving jones a snitch file containing a long list of extensive informant contacts between the police and basden taylor,from september,through december,a polygraph document and statement from taylor dated february,and statements taylor gave to police officers dated june,june,and june.basden makes no argument with respect to the first three documents rather,he bases his brady claims on the taylor and jones documents.
the undisclosed taylor statements repeat much of the information contained in two other taylor confessions that the prosecution did provide to basden counsel on the first morning of basden trial.in the suppressed statements,however,taylor recounts additional details of his plot with sylvia white and,in one of the nondisclosed statements,acknowledges that he lied to police about some facts in another of the nondisclosed statements.the taylor snitch file reflects taylor extensive work for the police as a confidential informant in the months immediately prior to the murder of billy white.
the jones documents reveal that jones was a police informant,who on february,three weeks after the murder,but prior to the taylor or basden confessions,told police that six months earlier taylor had solicited him to kill billy white and shown him a photo of the intended victim and that shortly after white was murdered taylor confessed to jones,without mentioning basden,that he had killed white for and a van,and detailed the entire story of luring white to his murder.once defense counsel received these documents,they located jones,who further attested that taylor had dominated basden and that basden was not himself at the time of white murder in january.
the state postconviction court implicitly assumed that all of these documents were favorable to as exculpatory evidence or for impeachment explicitly assumed that the state had suppressed the documents.nevertheless,the postconviction court rejected basden brady claims,reasoning that the suppression of these documents was not material because basden has not shown that there is a reasonable probability that either his conviction or sentence would have been different had the suppressed material been disclosed.the court relied on basden full pretrial confession,his full confession at trial,the testimony of police officers at his trial as to the voluntariness of basden pretrial confession,and the contents of the two taylor confessions that basden received the first day of trial.basden argues that the state postconviction court decision is an unreasonable application of brady and its progeny,which constitute clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court,under d.specifically,basden maintains that,if the state had timely disclosed the taylor and jones documents,he would not have been convicted of murder,or,if convicted,would have been sentenced differently.
basden brady challenge to his conviction can not succeed because the state presented overwhelming evidence of his guilt.basden contends that if he had timely received the nondisclosed taylor and jones documents,he would never have taken the stand at his trial and confessed to the murder.even assuming that this is so,given the state other evidence,the documents on which basden relies do not render clearly unreasonable the state postconviction court confidence in his conviction.
we must reach this conclusion because none of the nondisclosed documents in any way affect the admissibility of basden detailed pretrial confession.it is undisputed that prior to his arrest basden voluntarily sought out the police officers in order to confess to them.although basden states in a postconviction affidavit that he had smoked marijuana in the morning,both police officers testified that basden did not appear to be under the influence when he confessed,and even basden does not say that the marijuana affected his judgment that day.accordingly,the state postconviction court was not unreasonable in concluding that a motion to suppress the pretrial confession would have failed.see boggs bair,cir discussing the level of intoxication necessary to render a confession involuntary.
we recognize that basden need not show that the state offered insufficient evidence to convict him without the suppressed evidence.see kyles whitley,d.but even putting aside basden confession at trial,when we consider his full pretrial confession,its consistency with the two taylor confessions that the state disclosed to basden,and the physical evidence confirming it,such as basden possession of billy white ring,we can not conclude that the state postconviction court ruling was unreasonable.
basden brady challenge to his sentence raises more difficult questions.before turning to the merits of this challenge,however,we must address a teague lane,d,argument advanced by the state 
the state contends that application of brady to basden sentencing would constitute a new rule under teague,and for this reason,in the context of sentencing,brady is not clearly established federal law for purposes of d.see williams taylor,d.the clear language of brady and its progeny renders this argument meritless.
in brady itself,the supreme court expressly stated that its holding applied not only to suppression of materials at the guilt phase of a trial,but also at the punishment phase we now hold that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment at.emphasis added see also united states bagley,d describing brady spicer,at stating that in brady the supreme court held that a state denies a defendant due process by failing to disclose to the defendant before trial evidence favorable to the defendant that is material either to guilt or to punishment emphasis added.
moreover,in strickler greene,the supreme court considered the effect of brady materials on a sentence.strickler,at.see also id.at.souter,dissenting id.at,citing strickler pruett,wl at cir.june,unpublished disposition considering a brady claim directed to a sentence.of course,because the supreme court issued its opinion in strickler after basden conviction had become final,see teague,at.noting that the date of finality is the date of exhaustion of direct appeal,if strickler application of brady to a sentence had announced a new rule for teague purposes,that rule would not constitute clearly established federal law under d.see williams,at.but in strickler,the supreme court expressly stated that in applying brady to sentencing,it was not announcing a new rule.rather,the court explained,b ecause our opinion in strickler does not modify brady,it does not announce a new rule.strickler,at.consistent with this express statement,the strickler court in applied the brady rule to strickler sentencing claim,which would have been contrary to teague if strickler had announced a new rule.
in sum,the supreme court,in first enunciating the brady rule in,declared that the rule applied to favorable evidence,which is material to guilt or to punishment.brady,at.moreover,when in strickler the supreme court itself applied the brady rule to determine if nondisclosed documents were material to they affected a court expressly stated that this application of brady did not constitute a new rule.strickler,at.see also mincey head,cir considering an asserted brady violation with respect to sentencing in a case final for teague purposes before strickler was announced jackson johnson,cir same.
we,therefore,consider basden brady claim with respect to his sentence,examining the cumulative effect of the withheld documents,collectively,not item by item.see kyles,at.
basden argues that with the suppressed documents he could have presented the jury at sentencing with a powerful argument regarding the lesser culpability of ernest basden,with sylvia white as the most culpable,lynwood as her lieutenant,and basden as the mentally ill,clinically depressed,intoxicated,manipulated,rube.the state postconviction court rejected this claim,like basden brady attack on his conviction,on the ground that basden had not shown that there was a reasonable probability that the result would have been different had the suppressed materials been disclosed.basden brady sentencing contention presents a much closer question than his conviction claim,but ultimately we can not hold,given clearly established federal law,that the state postconviction court was unreasonable in rejecting it.
at least one of the jurors,by finding that basden was dominated by taylor and affected by alcohol and drugs at the time of the killing,accepted a portion of the defense basden,in sum,that he was an intoxicated,manipulated,rube.basden argues that the suppressed documents would have permitted him to fill in the other side of the picture the leading roles and greater culpability of sylvia white and taylor.
the suppressed documents do paint a picture that a jury could find supports such a theory with respect to sylvia white,these documents show that she was obsessed with the desire to kill her husband for more than a year.her plotting involved much more than the specific requests that taylor look for poison and find a hit which the jury heard.white used various strategies to encourage taylor to take on the murder,once threatening to commit suicide,and another time explaining i t ai that hard,and boasting that she had already smothered a child without much difficulty.white supplied taylor with a map to the murder site,strongly suggesting that she had a significant role in selecting it.she provided him with pictures of her husband to assist in the identification.she even gave taylor a diamond necklace,to be pawned so that he could buy a gun.see also white,at.
the suppressed documents also show that role the state sought to minimize at basden into the murder plot with similar energy.he thought up ideas for sylvia,suggesting that she make it look like suicide which she rejected because she had already had one husband who committed suicide and another would be too suspicious.taylor continually met and plotted with sylvia white despite his purported reluctance to kill her husband.most importantly,the suppressed documents would have shown that taylor determination to kill billy white led him not only to attempt to enlist basden several times but also to try to hire at least one other hit man.the documents reveal that after basden initially rejected taylor murder for hire scheme,taylor actually tried to hire tim jones instead to murder white,going so far as to give jones a photograph of billy white.
to grant a writ of habeas corpus,however,we would have to conclude that the state postconviction court basden has not shown a reasonable probability that these materials would have yielded a different an unreasonable application of the test for materiality under brady.the problem with such a conclusion is that basden had access to almost all of the information contained in the suppressed documents 
we acknowledge that this is not uniformly the case.rather,some information in the suppressed documents was not otherwise available to basden counsel.although the two disclosed taylor confessions reveal that taylor told tim jones everything,they say nothing more about tim jones.thus,it is hard to see how defense counsel could have learned of jones status as an informant,or that taylor had attempted to hire jones to kill billy white.similarly,although a police officer testified before the jury that taylor was a police informant,none of the disclosed documents reveal taylor near daily contacts with the police in the months immediately preceding the murder,so basden had little opportunity to use the materials to highlight taylor relatively greater sophistication.
but the two disclosed taylor confessions otherwise provide a relatively full picture of the involvement of taylor and sylvia white in the plot to kill billy white.basden,therefore,had available for his use in his make the case that he was the far less culpable dupe of the plotting masterminds,taylor and sylvia in these two confessions.the jury heard that sylvia white originated the murder plot and,generally,that she persisted in urging taylor to assist her for over a year.the jury heard of the many contacts between taylor and sylvia white and his regard for her.the jury heard that sylvia white,with taylor help,attempted to kill her husband with two kinds of poison,before turning to the shooting plot.the jury heard that both taylor and sylvia white at various times claimed credit for developing the murder posing as an insurance agent to lure billy white to the murder site.the disclosed taylor confessions further revealed that sylvia white worried taylor for over a year about killing her husband,told taylor that her first husband committed suicide,provided taylor with a photograph of white,scouted the site of the murder with taylor,and egged him on to do the killing by telling him that it was easy,explaining that she had killed her stepchild.even the prosecutor,who naturally enough minimized the roles of sylvia white and taylor,had to acknowledge that the fact that his wife wanted him dead was part of the reason why billy white died.
in sum,basden counsel knew almost all of the details that were available in the asserted brady materials,and were able to get most of those details before the jury.moreover,an even more powerful argument as to the greater culpability of the other conspirators,which the brady materials might have provided,would not have eliminated the core prosecution argument that billy white died only because somebody,ernest basden,wa s willing to take the money.accordingly,we can not hold that basden has shown that the state postconviction court was unreasonable in concluding that he failed to show a reasonable probability of a different sentence 
basden also contends that the state violated napue illinois,d,which holds that a state denies a defendant due process by knowingly offering or failing to correct false testimony.a napue claim requires a showing of the falsity and materiality of testimony and the prosecutor knowledge of its falsity.perjury offered under these circumstances is material if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.agurs,at.
basden bases his napue claim on the testimony of special agent smith,who stated at trial,under oath,that he did know tim jones.in fact,postconviction discovery revealed not only that agent smith knew jones,and knew him to be a confidential informant for the police,but also that agent smith had met with jones more than once in investigating billy white murder.
no court has ever made a factual finding as to whether agent smith testimony was false or whether the prosecutors knew it was false.agent smith and the state two prosecutors have filed affidavits stating that the court reporter transcribed the wrong name,that actually agent smith was asked if he knew tim phony name taylor gave himself in luring billy white to the murder that the testimony was truthful,agent smith did not know a tim conners defense counsel,however,attest that the transcript of the trial is correct.the state postconviction court instead assumed that agent smith testimony was false and known to be false but nonetheless rejected basden napue claim,ruling that even so the testimony was not material.the court stated three reasons for its materiality ruling the jury did not hear the testimony,agent smith credibility was not an issue at trial,and basden confessed to the crime before trial and in court.
basden himself recognizes that his napue challenge is intertwined with his brady claims he maintains that the state postconviction court overlooked the brady implications of the assertedly false testimony in assessing its materiality.given that the jury did not hear the relevant part of agent smith testimony,that testimony could only have affected the jury through its brady,the falsehood kept basden from acquiring the asserted brady materials and using them in certain ways.we have,however,concluded that the state postconviction court was not unreasonable in ruling that the state did not violate brady when it failed to disclose the materials in question.given that decision,we can not conclude that the state postconviction court rejection of a napue claim based on nondisclosure of the same materials was unreasonable.
basden argues that the state denied him due process by destroying evidence that might have assisted his defense.under arizona youngblood,d,if a criminal defendant can show that the police failed to preserve potentially useful evidence with bad faith,he or she has been denied due process.id.at.however,unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police,failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.id.
basden bases his youngblood claim on the alleged destruction of evidence that might have been useful to him,including handwritten notes of police interviews later reduced to typing,tapes of conversations,and a map drawn by basden himself.he argues that this destruction violated two state court orders to preserve this evidence,and that both the violation of these orders and the false testimony he alleges in his napue claim show bad faith on the part of the state.
the district court ruled that basden raised this claim on direct appeal only as a matter of state law,thus procedurally defaulting his federal constitutional claim.the state postconviction court rejected the youngblood claim on the merits alone,however,supporting basden argument that he properly preserved it.accordingly,we consider basden youngblood claim on the merits under the deferential standard set forth in d.
basden first asserted evidence of bad of state court suffice.he argues that the destruction of evidence to which he points violated state law and specific court orders.but the state postconviction court ruled to the contrary,and we have no authority to review this ruling.
nor do we find the bad faith necessary for this youngblood claim in the alleged perjury at trial that was the basis of basden napue claim.again assuming that agent smith lied about his knowledge of tim jones,that falsity does not establish bad faith in the destruction of the largely unrelated evidence on which basden relies.only one of the items that basden tape of a conversation between jones and taylor on february,even tangentially related to the subject of agent smith assertedly false testimony.most of the destroyed evidence was memorialized in written summaries before its destruction,and a written description of the creation of the jones tape,in particular,survives.finally,the state postconviction court ruled that almost all of the alleged destruction,including the destruction of the tape involving jones,was in keeping with state law and police procedures,and basden challenges neither these rulings nor the constitutionality of the underlying state laws and procedures.we do not see bad faith here,and we therefore have no basis on which to conclude that the state postconviction court rejection of basden youngblood claim was clearly erroneous.
basden argues that his trial counsel assistance was ineffective in eleven ways,depriving him of his constitutional right to counsel.see strickland washington,d united states cronic,d.basden pursued only one of these claims on direct appeal.basden,at.the state postconviction court addressed and rejected one other claim on the merits,and found that the other ten were procedurally barred as well as rejecting them,too,on the merits.the district court addressed and rejected two of the claims on the merits,and ruled that the other nine were procedurally defaulted because of the state postconviction court ruling that they were procedurally barred under north carolina law.we begin with the claims addressed on the merits,and proceed to those deemed to have been defaulted.
basden asserts that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because of an unauthorized admission of guilt by trial counsel in his opening statement.confronting affidavits to the contrary,the state postconviction court ruled that the record reflects that the defendant concurred in the decision to admit guilt to the lesser offense in the opening statement.this asserted factual finding does not dispose of basden claim,because it constitutes a pure credibility determination made without benefit of an evidentiary hearing.for a different reason,however,we can not find that the state postconviction court conclusion was unreasonable.we have already discussed the impact of basden full,voluntary,and detailed pretrial confession on the likelihood of his conviction.for the same reason,basden can not show prejudice under strickland with respect to this claim.haynes cain,cir ruling that an unauthorized admission of guilt in an opening statement constituted constitutionally ineffective assistance in a case in which the defendant had never confessed.
basden also contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel neither understood nor protected his rights under brady.he bases this claim on an colloquy between the court,his counsel,and the prosecutor.basden trial counsel had moved,in writing,for disclosure of all records information which arguably sic could be helpful or useful to the defense.orally,in response to this motion,the prosecutor said he did not know of any evidence that we have that we intend to introduce that would be arguably subject to suppression.basden counsel did not press further.
basden did not raise this claim on direct appeal,see basden,but after postconviction discovery,the state postconviction court addressed and rejected it on the merits alone,as did the district court.both courts rejected this claim solely by reliance on their prior rulings that no brady materials were withheld.
in light of our brady analysis,we agree with the state postconviction court and the district court.we further note that basden written brady motion did ask for all brady evidence.we think it clear that everyone at the hearing understood the contours of brady,and that nothing turns on the prosecutor apparently inadvertent use of the word suppression in responding to a later oral request.we would not permit the state to hide behind the technicalities of its response to a brady request in defending a failure to disclose brady materials.see agurs,at.t here are situations in which evidence is obviously of such substantial value to the defense that elementary fairness requires it to be disclosed even without a specific request.nor will we permit basden to argue that his counsel performance was constitutionally ineffective on the basis of this sort of hypertechnical argument.basden counsel sought brady materials,and accepted the state assurance in open court that all had been disclosed.even if brady materials existed,we see no evidence that this performance was constitutionally deficient for failure to understand or protect basden rights under brady.
basden brings ni
