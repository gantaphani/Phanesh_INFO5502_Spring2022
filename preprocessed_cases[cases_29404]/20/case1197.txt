the opinion reported at cir is withdrawn and the opinion below is substituted therefor.
james eugene bigby bigby,appeals the district court denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus regarding his claim that,by declining to recuse himself after bigby assaulted him,the trial judge denied bigby his constitutional right to due process.prominent among other claims raised by bigby is his penry claim that punishment phase jury instructions prevented the jury from acting upon mitigating evidence submitted in his behalf.for the reasons assigned herein,we affirm the conviction,reverse the district court denial of a coa on bigby penry claim,grant the coa,vacate bigby sentence,and remand to the district court with instructions.
factual and procedural history 
during the early morning hours of december,grace kehler returned from work to the trailer home she shared with michael trekell and their infant son,jayson kehler.upon entering the trailer,kehler found michael trekell body on the kitchen floor.initially thinking trekell was unconscious,kehler phoned for assistance.in response to questions asked by the operator,kehler remembered that trekell was caring for jayson.she then began looking for her son and discovered him lying dead in a face down position in a sink full of water.when questioned as to possible suspects by the police,kehler implicated bigby.she noted that there were three steaks upon the table that were not there when she left for work and recalled frequent visits by bigby at the residence.
arlington police officer james greenwell arrived at the scene at approximately to perform various duties as a crime scene investigator.he took photos,developed a diagram of the layout of the trailer,performed a gunshot residue test on both the infant and trekell,and obtained postmortem fingerprints from trekell.officer greenwell also collected beer cans and a wine cooler bottle from the trash which he thereafter had checked for fingerprints.
charles harvey,deputy tarrant county medical examiner,performed the autopsies.harvey ruled that the manner of both deaths was homicide.he determined that the cause of trekell death was craniocerebral trauma due to a gunshot wound by a magnum revolver.he determined that the infant died as the result of drowning.
on december,fort worth police detective larry ansley was summoned to act as a negotiator to defuse a man standoff with police at a tarrant county motel.the person inside the motel room was bigby.shortly after detective ansley made contact,bigby cracked the door and said to the detective,i know that i am guilty and so do you.bigby surrendered without incident,and was taken to fort worth john peter smith hospital.
the following morning,fort worth police homicide detective curtis brannan interviewed bigby after advising him of his miranda rights.at about on december,bigby provided the police a written statement in which he confessed to killing trekell and the infant.the fingerprints found on the wine cooler bottle at the crime scene were later matched to the fingerprints of bigby.
bigby was tried for capital murder.during a trial recess,bigby approached the unoccupied bench of judge don leonard judge leonard,found a gun,and took it.in an apparent attempt to escape,bigby proceeded to judge leonard chambers and pointed the gun to the judge head stating let go.he was ultimately subdued.bigby counsel then moved for a mistrial,which the judge denied.
in response to bigby motion for judge leonard recusal,the matter was referred to the presiding administrative judge,who held a hearing.during the hearing,judge leonard testified that bigby assault had not prejudiced or biased him toward the defendant.after,the presiding judge concluded that judge leonard did not have to recuse himself,and the trial continued.
upon the defense resting after the phase of trial,judge leonard allowed the state,in its rebuttal,to introduce testimony about bigby attempted escape as evidence of his consciousness of guilt for the trekell murders.after the trial was completed,a jury ultimately rejected bigby asserted defense of insanity.furthermore,they found him guilty of the offense of capital murder and imposed the death penalty.the trial court entered judgment on march,in conformity therewith.
the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed the conviction and death sentence on direct appeal,and the united states supreme court denied bigby petition for a writ of certiorari.bigby state,cert.denied,d.bigby then filed a state application for writ of habeas corpus,which the texas court of criminal appeals denied.ex parte bigby.filed.
on august,counsel then filed a federal petition for writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the northern district of texas,fort worth division.adopting the findings of united states magistrate judge charles bleil,the district court denied bigby petition for habeas corpus on october.on december,however,the court granted bigby a certificate of appealability coa on the sole question of w hether petitioner was denied the right to a trial presided over by a fair and impartial judge after he assaulted the state trial judge.thereafter,all issues in the petition were fully briefed and oral argument was held in november.because of developing case law regarding the penry claim,penry johnson,d penry ii and robertson cockrell,cir,the parties have filed comprehensive supplemental briefing.we now address the coa granted issue and bigby remaining claims for which the district court did not grant a coa.
discussion 
standard of review 
to obtain a coa,a petitioner must demonstrate that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.cockrell,d.because the present case involves the death penalty,any doubts as to whether a coa should be issue d must be resolved in the petitioner favor.hernandez johnson,cir.when determining if a petitioner is entitled to a coa,we must apply the deference scheme laid out in d.moore,at.under this scheme,we review pure questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact under d,and review questions of fact under d,provided that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits.id.at citation omitted.
because bigby federal petition for habeas review was filed in,we review it under the standards articulated in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.see.under that statute,a federal court may only grant a state prisoner application for a writ of habeas corpus if his incarceration was the product of a state court adjudication that resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.gardner johnson,cir alterations in original quoting williams taylor,d.i f the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle but unreasonably applies the principle to the facts of the prisoner case,the court decision represents an unreasonable application of federal law.id.quoting williams,at.we presume that a state court factual findings are correct and defer to them unless they were based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted d.
ii.due process fair tribunal 
while this case involves novel yet disturbing facts,the fundamental underlying policies and law that these facts implicate are much less unique.stated succinctly,the cornerstone of the american judicial system is the right to a fair and impartial process.see,bracy gramley,d.therefore,any judicial officer incapable of presiding in such a manner violates the due process rights of the party who suffers the resulting effects of that judicial officer bias.see id.
t he due process clause of the fourteenth amendment establishes a constitutional floor,however,not a uniform standard.id.at.this floor clearly requires a fair trial in a fair tribunal,before a judge with no actual bias against the defendant or interest in the outcome of his particular case.id.at.citation omitted.the crux of bigby habeas corpus complaint is that his assault of judge leonard created an impermissible bias that ultimately violated bigby clearly established constitutional right to a fair trial.
in response to bigby claim,the district court adopted the magistrate judge findings,conclusions,and recommendations and recognized that bias by an adjudicator is not lightly established.valley rapides parish sch,cir.this is true because,o rdinarily,we presume that public officials have properly discharged their official duties.bracy,at.internal quotations marks and citations omitted.as such,the district court reasoned that bigby had the burden to overcome two strong presumptions the presumption of honesty and integrity of the adjudicators and the presumption that those making decisions affecting the public are doing so in the public interest.valley,at.
we note that the united states supreme court has consistently enforced the basic right to due process and found that decision makers are constitutionally unacceptable when the decision maker has a direct personal,substantial,and pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case an adjudicator has been the target of personal abuse or criticism from the party before him and a judicial or quasi judicial decision maker has the dual role of investigating and adjudicating disputes and complaints.id to demonstrate such a due process violation and secure relief based thereon,bigby was required to establish that a genuine question exists concerning judge leonard impartiality.see liteky united states,d moreover,adjudication before a biased trial judge falls within the very limited class of cases that represents a structural error subject to automatic reversal.neder united states,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
iii.recusal after a party attacks the judge 
bigby assault of judge leonard and the due process violations alleged to have occurred on the subsequent failure to recuse him present a res nova issue within the fifth circuit.nonetheless,persuasive authority from one of our sister circuits appears propitious to the instant inquiry.see wilks israel,cir.
in wilks,the petitioner became agitated and angry with the judge and threw a stamping machine and microphone at him during a pretrial hearing.id.at.when the petitioner was on the witness stand,but while the jury was not in the courtroom,he jumped from the chair and assaulted the trial judge.id.while still outside of the jury presence,the judge stated,i am going to say it for the record,he is going away for so long they are going to forget that they ever knew him,and i want any reviewing court to know what my intentions are.id.when his emotions subsided,the judge recanted from this position stating that he had had over sixty jury trials in that year and that this is just another defendant as far as he was concerned.id.the judge then proceeded to preside over the defendant trial.id.at.
discussing whether the trial judge refusal to recuse himself was in error,the court stated that t he petitioner must show that the refusal to recuse was a fundamental defect which inherently result ed in a complete miscarriage of justice id.at quoting hill united states,d.the court further reasoned that while a trial judge could be expected to react adversely to such unruly conduct,a petitioner deliberate attack on the trial judge calculated to disrupt the proceedings will not force a judge out of a case.id.citing mayberry pennsylvania,d.to conclude otherwise would implicitly sanction such attacks in desperate attempts by defendants to precipitate new trials before new judges,encourage unruly courtroom behavior,and greatly disrupt judicial administration.id.
thus,the wilks court explicitly declined to adopt a per se rule based on the mere appearance of prejudice,opting instead to examine the trial to ensure that the trial judge,despite good cause for adverse feelings toward a defendant,has conducted a fair trial.id.at.the central criterion the wilks court utilized in determining whether the trial judge had conducted a fair trial was whether the trial judge rulings presented indicia of a bias against the defendant.id.at.finding,from a review of the record,that the trial court rulings were appropriate and in no way reflected any animosity toward the petitioner,the wilks court concluded that petitioner received a fair trial free from judicial prejudice.id.
we agree with the seventh circuit approach.a per se rule of recusal would lend itself to deliberate manipulation of the judicial system.such an automatic rule would invite recusal motions from defendants whose sole purpose in attacking a judge or engaging in unruly behavior is either to manufacture constitutional due process violations or to delay trial proceedings.therefore,contrary to petitioner request,we decline to presume prejudice on the part of the trial judge simply because of the fact of the attack,but rather must examine the record for indications of actual bias on the part of the trial judge.
petitioner urges that the trial judge decision to allow evidence of petitioner attack on the judge,and his concomitant refusal to provide a limiting instruction restricting the jury consideration of the evidence to its bearing on petitioner state of mind,constitute indicia of the trial court bias.in determining whether the judge ruling on these matters indicates bias on his part,we first look to the precise nature of the evidence proffered,and then to the court stated basis,if any,for its decision to admit the evidence without a limiting instruction.
the state first proffered the testimony of bailiff tim stallings stallings,who was present in the courtroom at the time of petitioner escape attempt.stallings testified in relevant part as follows 
q.during a break earlier this morning about,where were you 
i was sitting at my desk over there.
q.who was in the courtroom as you recall at that time 
a.the defendant,and i think you were.
q.when you say the defendant,who are you talking about 
james bigby,the gentleman at the end of the table there 
q.the jury was not in the courtroom,were they 
q.while you were seated,what did the defendant do 
a.he got up like he was going to get a drink of water and then 
q.what happened at that point 
and he did get any water and he started running behind the bench.i jumped up and started after him 
q.what did he do 
a.he reached in and got to the judge desk and started reaching for the drawer,and i drew my weapon.
q.did you say anything at that point 
i told him to stop again.
no.he pointed a gun at me 
q.when you say a gun,what kind of gun are you talking about 
q.what did he do with that gun 
a.he pointed it towards me.
q.what happened at that point 
i ducked down behind the clerk desk,and then i heard a noise,sounded like the judge chair was moving.so i jumped up and saw him running,and then i came around by the court reporter desk and he pointed the gun at me again and i ducked,and by the time i could get back up,he had gone through the door into the corridor.
after the conclusion of stallings testimony,the state called bailiff barbara hackney hackney to the stand.on direct examination,she testified as follows 
q.how are you employed 
i employed by judge leonard as grand jury bailiff,tarrant county.
q.about this morning were you in his office 
do you remember anybody else who was in the office 
yes.a man came through the door to the right side of me with a gun in his hand.
do you see that person in the courtroom 
yes,i do this man over here with a suit on and hair back.
medlin your honor,may the record reflect she has identified the defendant 
the court it may so reflect 
was judge leonard in the room 
yes,he was 
q.what did the person you identified do as he walked into the judge room,office 
a.he walked into the room beside the desk he had a gun in his hand.he walked up about two steps toward the judge and he pointed it at his head and said,let go,judge.
q.what happened at that point 
a.at that point the judge looked up at him and immediately jumped up out of his chair and grabbed the gun hand,slammed it up and back against the wall.they ended up against the wall,and when they did i ran out looking for someone to help.
where did you see the person you identified point the gun at the judge at what part of the judge did he point the gun 
a.he pointed it right at his head.he was standing judge was sitting and he was standing over him,and he had it right at his head.
are you talking about judge leonard seated just to your right 
yes,sir.judge leonard was seated right in front of me.
in evaluating the potential effect of this evidence on the jury,we are persuaded that while admitting bailiff stallings testimony struck the appropriate balance between the competing concerns regarding introducing evidence of bigby skullduggery,this delicate balance swung out of kilter when the prosecution proffered bailiff hackney testimony.hackney testimony was prejudicial to the petitioner because of a jury typically high regard for a presiding judge and the probability that the jury in bigby case came to identify with the judge during the course of the proceedings.see,carolyn demarest,civility in the courtroom from a judge perspective,j urors usually identify with the judge who,like themselves,is meant to be impartial.a personal attack upon the judge is likely to turn the jury against the attacking attorney.although admission of the evidence may have itself been a violation of petitioner due process rights,because of the potential that its admission deprived defendant of a fair trial,that is a separate question from whether the trial judge admission of the testimony,and corresponding failure to give a limiting instruction,constitute indicia of bias on the judge part.because the trial court provided a basis for admission of the evidence grounded in established law,we can not conclude that such is the case.
after the state announced that it intended to proffer testimony of bigby attempted escape,defense counsel objected to the testimony on the basis that the prejudicial nature of it highly outweighs the probative value,and that it would deny bigby a fair trial.the court overruled the objection,providing the following justification for its ruling 
the court finds that the evidence tendered by the state concerning his attempted escape is admissible on the basis of guilt or innocence in trials of this state,and it may have some relevance to the jury if they consider it important of any planning he might have affecting his insanity.i do know if the jury thinks it important or not,but they will receive it.
when presented with this issue on direct appeal,the texas court of criminal appeals analyzed the admissibility of the attack evidence solely from an evidentiary standpoint.it reasoned that e vidence of flight or escape is admissible as a circumstance from which an inference of guilt may be drawn,and in bigby case the evidence of flight enhance d the state case.bigby state.thus,the court of criminal appeals concluded that the trial court ruling was within the zone of reasonable disagreement and not clearly erroneous.id.at.
in a subsequent application for state habeas corpus relief,bigby asserted that judge leonard violated his due process rights by allowing evidence of his having assaulted the court.after deciding that a hearing was unnecessary,the criminal district court characterized bigby claim as a mere evidentiary challenge that had been previously raised and rejected by the court of criminal appeals on direct appeal and summarily concluded that bigby ha d failed to plead or prove that the issue rendered his conviction void upon review,the texas court of criminal appeals found bigby due process argument similarly unavailing 
by conflating bigby due process and evidentiary claims,the texas state courts erred in their analysis of the bias issue.while the admissibility of the attack evidence and the ability of the trial judge to act as a fair and impartial tribunal are separate questions,they are necessarily interrelated.if the trial judge had no obvious support for his ruling in the law,the decision would likely reveal an illicit poisoned fount from which the ruling sprang.
while,in our opinion,the trial court erred in failing to quell the testimony regarding the attack before the jury heard bailiff hackney rendition of the petitioner taking the trial judge hostage and holding a gun to his head,we can not conclude that this alone overrides the presumption of fairness on the trial judge part and compels a conclusion that structural error inhered in petitioner trial.the judge was not without a legal basis for his ruling,as under texas law evidence of an escape is admissible if relevant.burks state.although the trial judge,as evidenced by his rulings,implicitly failed to recognize the prejudicial effect such evidence might have on the jury,he was not acting clearly outside the bounds of law or reason in a manner that would signal any bias toward the defendant.thus,we conclude that the trial court decisions in regard to the attack evidence do not,by themselves,constitute indicia of bias sufficient to declare the trial tainted by structural error.
this conclusion does not end our due process inquiry,however.we must next take up the question whether,apart from the issue of the trial judge bias,the court admission of the attack evidence and failure to provide a limiting instruction deprived petitioner of a fair trial,due to the prejudicial nature of the evidence.w hen a state court admits evidence that is so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair,the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment provides a mechanism for relief.dawson delaware,d quoting tennessee bane,d.in conducting this analysis,it is irrelevant whether the evidence was correctly admitted pursuant to state law.estelle mcguire,d.rather,our sole inquiry is whether the admission violated the constitution.id.at.
whether admission of the attack evidence,coupled with the trial court refusal to provide a limiting instruction,constitute a violation of defendant due process rights is not the sole focus of our constitutional analysis.assuming arguendo that the admission of the evidence was constitutional error,petitioner claim will still fail absent a showing that the testimony had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.janecka cockrell,cir.examining the evidence put forth during the stage of bigby trial,we find it is highly improbable that the jury would have reached a different verdict had the evidence been excluded,or had the trial judge given a limiting instruction.see id.the state presented overwhelming evidence that defendant committed the murders,including two confessions by defendant.it also elicited testimony from two psychiatric experts,including one who had been petitioner psychiatrist before his incarceration,that bigby did not suffer from a severe mental disease or defect such that he could not tell or did not know his conduct was wrong.as the court of criminal appeals concluded,w hile several of appellant experts testified that appellant could not or did not know his conduct was wrong,several did testify that appellant knew his conduct was illegal.bigby,at.furthermore,bigby statement to the police at the time of his arrest,that i know i am guilty and so do you evinces an understanding by bigby that he knew his conduct was illegal.id.we therefore conclude that,even if the prejudicial effect of the attack evidence was of a constitutional dimension,petitioner due process argument fails because he can not establish that the evidence had a substantial or injurious effect or influence on the jury verdict at the stage of the proceedings.
the effect of the attack evidence at the sentencing stage is more difficult.we decline to consider this question,however,because,as discussed below,we vacate petitioner sentence and remand this case for resentencing on the basis that the trial court committed reversible error in giving the nullification instruction to the jury during the sentencing proceedings.
iv.bigby additional claims for grant of coa 
unconstitutional jury instructions 
in his application for coa,bigby further argues that the district court jury instruction gave the jurors an option of nullifying mitigating circumstances and thus impinged his right to have an individualized assessment of the appropriateness of the death penalty in his case.according to bigby,this violated penry lynaugh,d penry i.the texas court of criminal appeals rejected this complaint when bigby raised it on direct appeal.bigby,at.relying on roberts louisiana,d,bigby reiterates his nullification argument by claiming that there is an element of capriciousness in making the jurors power to avoid the death penalty dependant on their willingness to accept an invitation to render a false verdict.
a state capital punishment scheme must do two things to meet the requirements of the eighth amendment.first,it must channel the discretion of judges and juries to ensure that death sentences are not meted out wantonly or freakishly.graham collins,d.second,it must confer sufficient discretion on the sentencing body to consider the character and record of the individual offender.id.thus,the relevant mitigating evidence can not be placed beyond the effective reach of the jury.id.at.to grant relief on a penry claim,we must determine whether the mitigating evidence has met the low threshold for relevance tennard dretke,d,and,if so,that the evidence was beyond the effective scope of the jury.madden collins,cir.
we conclude that bigby has demonstrated that reasonable jurists would find the district court assessment of his penry claim debatable.see.at.first,bigby has established the existence of relevant mitigating evidence in particular,bigby has provided testimony that he suffers from chronic paranoid schizophrenia that he argues contributed to his criminal action.second,the nullification instruction at issue in the instant case is similar to the nullification instruction that the supreme court rejected as unconstitutional in penry i,rendering the mitigating evidence out of the reach of the jurors during the punishment phase of bigby trial.thus,we reverse the district court denial of a coa on this issue and grant the coa.during the pendency of this appeal the supreme court handed down penry ii,d and the en banc court decided robertson cockrell,cir.in addition,since the issuance of the original opinion in this case,the supreme court also announced decisions in tennard dretke,d,and smith texas,d,which are relevant to the issues in this appeal.because the post oral argument briefing has to a large extent addressed these cases and because the evidentiary record is complete,we conclude that the merits of the coa penry the nullification instruction during the sentencing phase of his trial was constitutionally ripe for decision.
relevant mitigating evidence 
the supreme court recently held that a state can not preclude the sentencer from considering any relevant mitigating evidence that the defendant proffers in support of a sentence less than death v irtually no limits are placed on the relevant mitigating evidence a capital defendant may introduce concerning his own circumstances.payne,at.quoting eddings oklahoma,d quoted in tennard.at.the court defined relevant mitigating evidence as evidence which tends logically to prove or disprove some fact or circumstance which a could reasonably deem to have mitigating value.tennard.at quoting mckoy north carolina,d relevant mitigating evidence defined in the most expansive terms.furthermore,the court added that a state can not bar the consideration of evidence if the sentencer could reasonably find it warrants a sentence less than death.id.quoting mckoy,at.in view of the supreme court clarification of the relevant evidence standard applicable in death penalty cases,we now consider the evidence of record in this case.
during bigby trial,james grigson grigson,psychiatrist,was called to testify on bigby behalf.grigson stated that in his opinion,bigby suffers from chronic paranoid schizophrenia.he testified that paranoid schizophrenia is one of the more serious and severe forms of mental illnesses.when asked to explain to the jury the effects of this disease,grigson stated that usually individuals suffering from this mental condition feel that people are plotting against them or doing things to hurt them.he continued to clarify that schizophrenia means that the individual is suffering from a psychosis where there is gross impairment in terms of interpersonal relationships and reality testing,meaning that they misperceive what is going on around them.as a result,grigson stated that this paranoid disorder manifests itself in psychotic delusional beliefs.
bigby trial counsel asked grigson if bigby had suffered from any delusions or psychotic beliefs.the physician responded in the affirmative.specifically,he stated that at the time the murders occurred,bigby suffered from delusions that michael trekell was involved in a conspiracy against him.in his opinion,grigson testified that at the time of the offense bigby was suffering from this serious severe mental illness and was not aware of the difference between right and wrong.grigson concluded that there is no other explanation for bigby actions other than the fact that he suffers from a mental illness at the sentencing phase,grigson reiterated his belief that bigby suffers from chronic paranoid schizophrenia.further,evidence was adduced that bigby condition could not be adequately controlled with medication.
applying the low threshold as articulated in tennard,it is clear that the evidence submitted by bigby constitutes relevant mitigating evidence.paranoid schizophrenia is a severe mental illness.bigby has adduced evidence to show that he was suffering from this illness at the time of the murders.it is not required that he show that his condition be somehow linked to his conduct,only that it existed,and that it could lead a jury to find that a sentence other than death is warranted.see tennard.at skipper south carolina,d evidence of defendant good conduct in jail,while not related specifically to his culpability for the crime he committed,must nonetheless be allowed before the jury because such evidence would be mitigating in the sense that it might serve as a basis for a sentence less than death.thus,we find that bigby paranoid schizophrenia is relevant mitigating evidence that he must be allowed to present to the jury.
jury instructions 
we now turn to bigby contention concerning the constitutionality of the jury instructions given by the trial judge at the sentencing phase.bigby argues that the jury instructions impermissibly restricted the jury consideration of mitigating circumstances in violation of the supreme court decisions in penry i and penry ii.in penry i,the court held that penry eighth amendment rights were violated because the jury was inadequately charged with respect to mitigating evidence at penry sentencing hearing.at the conclusion of the hearing,the jury was instructed to answer three special issues whether the conduct that caused the death of the victim was committed deliberately and with a reasonable expectation that death would result whether there was a probability that the defendant would commit acts that would constitute a continuing threat to society and whether the conduct was an unreasonable response to any provocation by the victim.the supreme court held that none of these special issues were broad enough to allow the jury to consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence offered by penry that he was mentally retarded and had been severely abused as a child.
the supreme court emphasized that its ruling was not a new rule under teague lane,d.the court held that at the time penry conviction became final,it was clear from lockett ohio,d and eddings oklahoma,d that a state could not,consistent with the eighth and fourteenth amendments,prevent the sentencer from considering and giving effect to evidence relevant to the defendant background or character or to the circumstances of the offense that mitigate against imposing the death penalty.penry i,at.however,the court reaffirmed its holding in jurek texas,d,which upheld the constitutionality of the texas death penalty sentencing scheme against an eighth amendment challenge.id.at.jurek dismissed a facial challenge to the texas death penalty statute but reasoned that the statute constitutionality turns on whether the enumerated questions allow consideration of particularized mitigating factors.at.penry i held that in certain cases,texas statutory special issues,as applied,did not give the jury sufficient opportunity to consider and give effect to the mitigation evidence without appropriate additional instructions.penry i,at.additional instructions informing the jury that it could consider and give effect to the defendant mitigation evidence are required where the evidence was not relevant to the special issue questions or had relevance to the defendant moral culpability beyond the scope of the special issues questions,and the jury was otherwise unable to express its reasoned moral response to that evidence in rendering its sentencing decision.id.at.
on remand,penry was again found guilty,and the state court instructed the jury to answer the same three special issues given at his first trial.the jury was also admonished that a yes answer to any of the special issues was warranted only if supported by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,while a no answer is appropriate only if there is a reasonable doubt that the answer to the special issues should be yes.in addition,the court also provided a supplemental instruction indicating that when the jury deliberated on the special issues,it was to consider mitigating issues,if any,presented by the evidence.the instruction provided as follows 
if you find that there are any mitigating circumstances in this case,you must decide how much weight they deserve,if any,and therefore,give effect and consideration to them in assessing the defendant personal culpability at the time you answer the special issue.if you determine,when giving effect to the mitigation evidence,if any,that a life sentence,as reflected by a negative finding to the issue under consideration,rather than a death sentence,is an appropriate response to the personal culpability of the defendant,a negative finding should be given to one of the special issues.penry ii,at.
the verdict form contained only the text of the three special issues,however,and gave the jury the choice of only answering yes or no.the jury again answered all of the special issues yes and penry was given the death penalty.
in penry ii,the supreme court ruled that this supplemental instruction provided an inadequate vehicle for the jury to make a reasoned moral response to penry mitigating evidence.at.the court stated that because penry mitigating evidence did not fit within the scope of the special issues,answering the special issue questions in the manner prescribed on the verdict form was both logically and ethically impossible.id.at.specifically,the court noted that instructing the jury to answer the special issues yes only if supported by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,while at the same time instructing the jury that it could ignore these guidelines and answer one or more of the special issues no in order to give effect to any mitigating evidence presented by penry,made the jury charge as a whole internally contradictory and placed jurors in an impossible situation.in effect,the instruction allowed the jurors to change one or more truthful yes answers to an untruthful no answer in order to avoid the death sentence for penry.id.thus,if the jury desired to answer one or more of the special issues untruthfully to give credence to the mitigating evidence presented by penry,they would have had to violate their oath to render a true verdict.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the supplemental instruction thus inserted an element of capriciousness into the sentencing decision,making the jurors power to avoid the death penalty dependent on their willingness to elevate the supplemental instruction over the verdict form instructions.id.
after concluding that the supplemental instruction given penry jury was inadequate,justice further explained that a clearly drafted catchall instruction on mitigating evidence might have complied with penry id.at.the court used as a model the supplemental instruction drafted by the texas legislature after penry i,and after penry remand trial.the court noted that this supplemental instruction,currently required by the texas criminal procedure code to be given in capital cases,provided a helpful frame of reference.id.this instruction reads as follows 
the court shall instruct the jury that if the jury returns an affirmative finding to each of the first two special issues,it shall answer the following issue whether,taking into consideration all of the evidence,including the circumstances of the offense,the defendant character and background,and the personal moral culpability of the defendant,there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances to warrant that a sentence of life imprisonment rather than a death sentence be imposed.ann.e vernon supp.
the court observed that penry defense counsel conceded that he would have a difficult time arguing that this instruction did not comply with penry i.the court then concluded that a t the very least,the brevity and clarity of this instruction highlight the confusing nature of the supplemental instruction actually given,and indicate that the trial court had adequate alternatives available id.at.
recently,in smith texas,d,the supreme court again confronted substantially similar jury instructions as those present in penry ii,and the court again held that the jury instructions were unconstitutional.although the supplemental instruction in smith was not identical to the one given in penry ii,the smith court stated that the distinctions were constitutionally insignificant.smith.at.the instruction in smith read in relevant part as follows 
you are instructed that you shall consider any evidence which,in your opinion,is mitigating you may hear evidence which,in your judgment,has no relationship to any of the special issues,but if you find such evidence is mitigating under these instructions,you shall consider it in the following instructions of the court.you,and each of you,are the sole judges of what evidence,if any,is mitigating and how much weight,if any,the mitigating circumstances,if any,including those which have no relationship to any of the special issues,deserves.in answering the special issues submitted to you herein,if you believe that the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the answers to the special issues are yes,and you also believe from the mitigating evidence,if any,that the defendant should not be sentenced to death,then you shall answer at least one of the special issues no in order to give effect to your belief that the death penalty should not be imposed due to the mitigating evidence presented to you.in this regard,your are further instructed that the state of texas must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the death sentence should be imposed despite the mitigating evidence,if any,admitted before you.smith.at.
as in penry ii,the court found that the jury was faced with the ethical dilemma of either answering the special issue questions in a manner prescribed on the verdict form and ignoring the supplemental instruction,or answering the questions as prescribed by the supplemental instruction which necessarily meant ignoring the verdict form instructions.id.as in penry ii,the problem presented itself because smith mitigation evidence of organic learning disabilities and speech handicaps at an early age,a low iq,and a drug addicted criminal father apparently did not fit within the scope of the special issues.id.at and just as in penry ii,the burden of proof on the state was tied by law to findings of deliberateness and future dangerousness that had little,if anything,to do with the mitigation evidence petitioner presented.
the supreme court rulings in penry ii and smith should not be read to disturb its earlier holdings affirming the constitutionality of texas statutory death penalty sentencing scheme.see jurek,d see also franklin lynaugh,d graham collins,d johnson texas,d in re kunkle,wl cir.the court has found a supplemental instruction,like the one present in bigby trial,to be unconstitutional only where the special issue questions themselves are not broad enough to provide a vehicle for the jury to give effect to the defendant mitigation evidence.robertson cockrell,cir finding that where the texas special issues allow the jury to give mitigating effect to the proffered evidence,the presence of the supplemental instruction can not constitute error.when the jury is able to consider and give effect to the mitigation evidence in imposing sentence,the special issue questions are constitutionally adequate.penry ii,at.quoting johnson,at,dissenting a sentencer must be allowed to give full consideration and full effect to mitigating circumstances.thus,in considering a penry ii claim,the court must ask whether the evidence is beyond the effective reach of the jury.
we are aware of the precedent in this circuit that evidence that a petitioner was suffering from schizophrenia at the time of the crime may be considered under the first interrogatory or alternatively,that mitigation evidence of schizophrenia may be considered under the future dangerousness special issue,if the schizophrenia can be controlled or goes into remission.however,we find those cases to be distinguishable.in lucas johnson,cir,the petitioner essentially tried to put forth an insanity defense during sentencing after initially asserting his innocence at trial.at one expert further explained that if lucas had committed the orange socks murder,then at the time of the act h e would have been psychotic,meaning out of touch with reality,out of control over his impulses,over his drives insane.the lucas court held that a sentencer could give effect to that testimony under the first interrogatory since it went to whether he acted deliberately when he committed the murder.although bigby history of mental illness was relevant to whether he acted deliberately,it also spoke to his moral culpability.importantly,bigby evidence indicated that his schizophrenia was chronic and severe,caused him to suffer delusions with respect to the actions and motivations of the people around him,could not be adequately treated,and significantly impacted his interpersonal relationship abilities.inquiry into whether bigby acted deliberately fails to fully account for the potential impact such a debilitating condition may have upon the jury perception of bigby moral responsibility for his crimes.thus,as in penry i,the first interrogatory did not adequately allow the jury to consider the effect of this evidence upon bigby personal culpability id.at.
furthermore,although this circuit has previously held that mitigation evidence of mental illness could be considered within the context of the second special issue,future dangerousness,if the illness can be controlled or go into remission,see,lucas,see also hernandez johnson,cir,bigby mitigation evidence indicated that his condition can not be adequately controlled or treated.bigby averred that his mental condition prevented him from being able to conform his behavior.even after being in the controlled environment of jail for some time,bigby irrationally tried to take the trial court judge hostage in the presence of armed bailiffs.his behavior also required him having to be restrained during trial.the defense psychiatrist testified that the outburst was not unexpected because medication was not sufficient to control his behavior and thinking.in short,bigby evidence that his mental disorders made it difficult for him to avoid criminal behavior has the same sword quality as penry evidence that he was unable to conform his conduct to the law.
the special issues and supplemental instruction given at the conclusion of bigby sentencing hearing are almost identical to those discussed in penry ii and smith in the present case,bigby jury was given the following supplemental instruction 
if you find that there are an mitigating circumstances,you must decide how much weight they deserve and give them that effect you believe to be appropriate when you answer the special issues.if you decide,in consideration of the evidence,if any,that a life sentence,rather than a death sentence,is a more appropriate response to the personal moral culpability of the defendant,or if you have a reasonable doubt thereof,you are instructed then to answer any special issues,to which such mitigating circumstances apply,and under consideration no.
like the supplemental instructions in both penry ii and smith,this instruction ties the jury consideration of bigby mitigating evidence to the special issues.specifically,it instructs the jury that if they find the mitigating evidence sufficient to warrant a life sentence rather than the death penalty,they must answer any special issues to which such mitigating circumstances apply in the negative.thus,the instruction effectively shackled and confined the jury within the scope of the special issues.as we have found,these issues failed to allow the jury to give effect to bigby mitigating evidence.further,even if the jury understood the instruction as directing them to nullify their answers to the special issues,they still would have faced the ethical dilemma of violating their oath to render a true verdict by providing false answers to the special issues in order to give effect to bigby mitigating evidence and comply with the supplemental instruction.finally,the instruction given bigby jury lacks the brevity and clarity of the instruction provided in the texas criminal procedure code.
because we discern no meaningful distinction between the charges given in penry ii and smith,and those given in the instant case,we find that bigby has demonstrated that the contested jury instructions stripped the jury of a vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response to the appropriateness of the death penalty.in short,the same constitutional infirmities criticized by the supreme court in penry ii and smith are present in bigby.accordingly,since the decision of the texas court of criminal appeals is contrary to clearly established federal law,we reverse the district court denial of bigby application for coa with regard to his jury instruction claim,vacate his sentence,and remand this case to the district court for entry of an order granting bigby habeas relief on his penry claim and setting aside his sentence.
denial of the right to impeach witnesses 
bigby contends that the trial court improperly denied him the right to impeach grace kehler,the chief witness against him,by showing that her pending civil suit provided a motive to testify falsely and by pointing out that kehler had made contradictory allegations in the civil suit.a review of the record,however,reveals a different account of the trial proceedings.in particular,judge leonard did allow bigby to question kehler about any potential pecuniary interests arising from her unresolved wrongful death suit against bigby physician and treating hospitals for failing to attend adequately his mental illness.the judge merely informed bigby counsel that he would not allow the civil petitions into evidence unless kehler denied the suit.
bigby correctly notes that the sixth amendment guarantee of a criminal defendant right to confront witnesses against him includes the right to.see davis alaska,d.but this right is subject to the wide latitude of trial judges to impose reasonable limits.see id.stating that the right to is s ubject always to the broad discretion of a trial judge to preclude repetitive and unduly harassing interrogation delaware van arsdall,d.as such,the confrontation clause does not guarantee defendants to whatever extent they desire.van arsdall,at.bigby fails to demonstrate that his efforts to impeach kehler were unconstitutionally circumscribed or that the state rejection of his impeachment complaints constitute an unreasonable application of
