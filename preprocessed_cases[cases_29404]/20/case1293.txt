noe beltran challenges the district court denial of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.challenges the district court grant of petitioner habeas petition on the grounds that the prosecution knowingly failed to correct false testimony.we grant habeas relief,but rest the affirmation on beltran ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the prosecution skirted a line from which it should steer clear in the future.however,because we grant the petition on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds,we do not have to affirm the false testimony claim.the latter is potentially complicated here by a dispute over whether or not the prosecution believed that the concerned testimony was false and the defense counsel repeated objections to the prosecution attempts to admit the photo spread central to the claims and to mention beltran.
facts and proceedings 
on the afternoon of march,a murder and robbery occurred at the disco de oro tortilla factory in brownsville,tx.owners and operators enrique and carmen arechiga,their son valentin,and employees guadalupe benavides and maria ybarra were in the tortillaria at the time of the incident.upon entering,the robber pointed a derringer pistol owned by beltran ruben plata at valentin,who was standing near the cash register.valentin immediately gave the intruder an unspecified amount of money.carmen approached the register.while she was handing over more money,the robber fired the derringer,killing her.fleeing the scene,the robber jumped into the passenger side of a red sports car,also owned by plata,that had pulled into the adjacent alley right before the robbery.
neighbor guadalupe rodriguez testified that after hearing a noise from the tortillaria she looked out of her window and saw the intruder leave the tortillaria and run towards the sports car.after the murder,valentin and benavides ran into the alley and saw the red sports car.valentin had also seen the sports car pull into the alley right before the intruder entered the tortillaria.valentin drove around with the police right after the they found the car outside of plata apartment.police officers determined that plata owned the car.
on the day of the incident,the police made a composite drawing of the assailant with a tattoo of the initials lx or lt on his upper left arm and forearm.the police also compiled a photo spread including a picture of plata,which they showed to valentin,benavides,and ybarra that same day.this photo spread,state exhibit,was never admitted at trial.valentin chose plata in the photo spread but qualified his choice by stating that he could not make a definite identification without seeing a better picture of plata.when he was later shown a spread without a photo of plata,valentin requested to see plata photo again,stating that it was the only one that resembled the robber.benavides thought plata looked like the robber but was not certain he stated that the robber had longer hair than plata did in the photo and that he would like to see a more recent photo of plata.ybarra response to the photo spread was similar to that of benavides.
attorney reynaldo cantu prepared an affidavit requesting a warrant to arrest plata and his brother luis plata and to search the car.evidence supporting probable cause was that four hours before the murder plata committed an aggravated assault with a derringer at a motel,the murder weapon was a derringer,three witnesses tentatively identified plata as the murderer,plata car left the scene of the crime,and the plata brothers were seen together in the car fifteen minutes after the murder.officer victor rodriguez swore to the affidavit on march.
several days later a photo spread was compiled with beltran photo.enrique,valentin,benavides,and guadalupe rodriguez all identified beltran in the photo spread.beltran was arrested on march.enrique,valentin,and benavides identified beltran in lineups on the day of his arrest.enrique,valentin,and benavides also made identifications of beltran as the robber.they all testified to previously identifying appellant in a photo spread and picking him out of a lineup conducted on march.valentin testified outside of the presence of the jury that the assailant was not in the march photo spread.before the jury valentin testified that beltran was the assailant and that he had previously identified beltran in the only photo spread that he saw and in a lineup.enrique admitted that he could not make a positive identification when he initially viewed beltran in the lineup.guadalupe rodriguez tentatively identified beltran in court explaining that she had only seen the assailant from the side.
at trial,officer rodriguez testified for the prosecution that the photo spread with plata picture,state exhibit,was compiled on the day of the to try to identify the assailant.when asked were you able to get an identification on the person in that robbery,rodriguez replied,no,sir.the government then asked did you know the name of the suspect placed in that spread for them to identify lead defense counsel objected to this question on relevancy grounds even though he knew that witnesses had tentatively identified plata in that spread.the prosecution then tried to introduce into evidence state exhibit,but lead defense counsel again objected on relevancy grounds.the prosecution reply to the objection was a defensive issue is always,could it have been the other guy the state will show the investigative procedure that the police used to identify the person that committed the murder and to exclude people that could not be identified as having committed the murder.defense counsel response was your honor,we could be here forever excluding people that did do it.
admitting the tentative identifications of plata was further discussed outside of the presence of the jury.defense counsel vehemently objected several times to the relevancy of questioning officer rodriguez about the tentative identifications.the prosecution stated that the discussion was necessary to determine whether plata or beltran killed the woman.defense counsel asserted that the court should not care what kind of characteristics are shown by photographs of ruben plata.
the state theory at trial was that beltran committed the murder and plata drove the getaway car.the state case depended solely on eyewitness identifications there was no physical evidence to connect beltran to the crime.
