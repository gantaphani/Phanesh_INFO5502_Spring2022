penalty phase 
the jury found roche and niksich each guilty of two counts of murder and of two counts of murder in the perpetration of a robbery.a sentencing hearing was then held for both defendants,during which the state sought the death penalty against both roche and niksich.the indiana code provided that the state could seek the death penalty against roche if it proved at least one of the following aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt t he defendant committed the murder s by intentionally killing the victim s while committing or attempting to commit robbery or t he defendant has been convicted of another murder.b g b.further,the indiana death penalty statute also provided that roche could present evidence pertaining to any potential mitigating circumstances.see id.at c.the statute provided that the jury could recommend the death penalty,see id.at e,only after it had found that the state had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one of the aggravating circumstances existed and any mitigating circumstances that existed were outweighed by the aggravating circumstance s.see id.at k.the court instructed the jury accordingly.the judge would then make the final determination about the appropriate sentence after considering the jury recommendation and the standards elucidated in k.see id.at e.
with regard to roche sentencing hearing,the state entered the report psr into evidence,which indicated the following roche had attained a education and had pled guilty to burglary in and was incarcerated for about six years as a result.roche had one child,crystall lynn mcdaniel,who was five and a half months old,and roche helped support his daughter financially.roche parents divorced when he was very young and he lived with his paternal grandparents from age three to age seven,while his father was incarcerated.after his father was released from prison,roche lived with roche,and his stepmother,who moved around a lot.as a result,roche frequently changed schools.further,roche did not sleep much as a child because his father would take him places to rip off for money.roche spent a considerable amount of his childhood in foster homes and with other relatives because his father was in and out of prison.further,roche had received psychiatric treatment when he was twelve years old.finally,the psr stated that roche had said that he had never been addicted to any illegal drugs and that he used marijuana and alcohol daily and snorted cocaine occasionally.
roche mother testified that when roche,went to prison and roche was about three years old,she accepted an offer from roche paternal grandparents to allow roche to live with them.in exchange,the grandparents agreed to pay for her divorce from roche.she testified that although she has had very little contact with roche in the last twenty years,she promised that in the future,she would be much more involved in his life.roche sister testified that roche had told her that he was very sorry for what had happened with graves and brown.
after eight hours of deliberation,the jury indicated to the court that it had reached a recommendation with respect to one of the defendants,but that it had not with respect to the other.each juror stated to the court that further deliberations would not result in the jury being able to reach a recommendation with respect to the second defendant.the jury then told the court that it recommended that the death penalty not be imposed on niksich,but that it was unable to reach a recommendation with respect to roche.the court,with counsel approval,then discharged the jury.thereafter,the court sentenced niksich to years imprisonment and sentenced roche to death.in sentencing roche to death,the court found that a lthough there were three defendants involved in these killings,the evidence showed that roche was by far the most culpable and is deserving of the death penalty.
procedural history 
after the indiana supreme court affirmed roche conviction and sentence on direct appeal,roche filed a petition for relief in the lake superior court.at the hearing held on october,roche presented testimony regarding his shackling during the trial and at the sentencing hearing.walter murray,one of the bailiffs during roche trial,testified that at some point after the trial had started,he placed leg cuffs on roche,but not on niksich.murray testified that he did not recall placing a drape over roche legs to prevent the jury from seeing the leg cuffs.he further testified that with the judge permission we left the leg irons on during the trial because we thought roche was an escape risk.paula niksich,edward niksich mother,testified that she could see roche shackles during trial and that she did not see a drape that covered the shackles.finally,a trial witness,patricia andrasco,testified that she could see roche shackles from the witness box when she testified.
ultimately,the trial court denied roche petition for relief.roche counsel appealed the denial of the petition to the indiana supreme court,which affirmed.see roche state.subsequently,roche filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,and the district court found that roche shackling claim warranted habeas relief.see roche anderson,d.however,it held that r ather than require that roche be retried,when it is clear from his subsequent conduct that roche is in fact an escape risk and would most likely be retried in shackles,albeit with an explanation on the record,this court will order roche sentenced to life without parole.id.citation omitted.
on appeal,the state of indiana argues that the district court improperly gra
