after agreeing to sell marijuana to two customers,john szabo appeared at the site appointed for the exchange with a knife,a gun,and a henchman,but no marijuana.he stole the that the customers had brought and murdered both of them to avert any risk that they would identify him.szabo has been sentenced to death for these planned killings.the first capital sentence was reversed by the supreme court of illinois because of errors in the hearing,see people szabo,szabo i,but the second was affirmed.see people szabo,szabo ii.two efforts to obtain collateral relief in the state courts were unavailing.see people szabo,szabo iii people szabo,szabo iv.but in this proceeding under the district court issued a writ of habeas corpus after concluding that szabo lawyer at his second sentencing had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to call prison guards as witnesses to inform the jurors of szabo good conduct in prison between when he was convicted and when the resentencing occurred.see szabo snyder,wl,dist.lexis,relying on hall washington,cir,and kubat thieret,cir.the state only argument on appeal is that the claim was forfeited in the course of szabo initial collateral the supreme court of illinois held in szabo iv.by negative implication the state concedes that if the claim has been preserved,then szabo is entitled to a third sentencing hearing.we shall do likewise and ask only whether the claim remains open to decision.
in szabo iii szabo raised,but did not develop,an claim.his petition for collateral relief,filed pro se,challenged the adequacy of counsel work in the second sentencing hearing.the state judge appointed a lawyer to represent him,but that lawyer neither added to the claims made in the pro se petition nor produced affidavits to back them up.because the record did not reveal what testimony the guards would have given,had they been called at the resentencing,the judge concluded that szabo had not established any constitutional violation.on appeal in szabo iii his new lawyer did not contest this conclusion instead he contended that,as a matter of state law,szabo should be entitled to another hearing with better counsel who would supplement his pro se pleadings and secure the essential affidavits from the guards.the supreme court of illinois rejected that position.szabo then filed a second state collateral attack,which was dismissed as barred by the adverse outcome of the first.
under illinois law a prisoner is entitled to only one collateral attack unless that proceeding is so defective because of judicial shortcomings that justice requires a second opportunity.see,people flores.deficiencies attributable to errors and neglects of the petitioner lawyer do not justify a second opportunity.id.at,at.in szabo iv the supreme court of illinois held that szabo failure to develop an claim in szabo iii was the fault of his lawyer the state judicial system had offered an opportunity,which counsel had not used.consequently,szabo iv held,the state forfeiture rules blocked szabo effort to make a better claim in a new proceeding.
relying on the holding of szabo iv,the state argued that szabo claim was forfeited during the collateral attack that culminated in szabo iii.all the district judge said in response is 
petitioner principal ground for relief is properly before this court.the fact that some of the claims were not raised in all four appeals to the illinois supreme court does not mean that the claims are procedurally defaulted.
yet the state had not argued that a prisoner must make an claim in every appeal.neither the attorney general representing illinois nor the state highest court faulted szabo for omitting this contention in szabo ii it required development by evidence not then in the record.nor would anyone have faulted szabo if he had developed the claim in szabo iii and then sought to present a different theory in a successive collateral attack.the state the holding of szabo that the claim was forfeited because it was not developed in szabo iii,when it should have been.the district judge did not come to grips with that contention.a state is entitled to treat as forfeited a proposition that was not presented in the right court,in the right way,and at the right state rules define those courts,ways,and times.see wainwright sykes,d.failure to comply with the state procedural rules furnishes an independent and adequate state ground of decision that blocks federal collateral review.see harris reed,d.
no one could doubt that this forfeiture decision is independent of federal law,as that term is used in jurisprudence.see stewart smith,d ake oklahoma,d.szabo does question whether the ruling is adequate to block federal review.to be adequate,a state procedural rule must be proclaimed in advance and regularly followed.see,lee kemna,d johnson mississippi,d liegakos cooke,rehearing denied,cir.ever since the law on the books in illinois has specified that a prisoner is entitled to only one proceeding.ilcs.the decision in szabo iv enforcing this norm can not be condemned as retroactive and thus inadequate.nor is it inadequate as irregular,freakish,or invoked in an unprincipled way in order to discriminate against the federal theory of relief.
on appeal in szabo iii,szabo contended that.c required his lawyer to do more than he had done to develop the contention.the supreme court of illinois rejected that proposition as a matter of state law but had second thoughts,and in people johnson,held that counsel must do more to satisfy rule c than szabo counsel had done.szabo iv held that johnson does not give szabo a second chance.if we had to decide whether johnson shows that the approach that szabo iii took to the interpretation of rule c were regularly followed we would need to decide whether johnson was a change in the law,or whether instead szabo iii was an aberration in the application of settled law.that question divided the supreme court of illinois four to three in szabo iv,with the majority taking the view that johnson had altered the law in a way that did not apply retroactively to szabo.
but it is not necessary to enter this arena,because the forfeiture does not stem from a contestable interpretation of rule c by the state supreme court.after all,that court concluded that counsel had complied functionally with rule c and that formal noncompliance the lack of a certificate was harmless.nor does forfeiture lie in appellate counsel failure to pursue a claim on appeal in szabo by then it was too late,and the only sensible avenue was the road taken,a request for a new hearing at the trial level,where the forfeiture had occurred.the root problem was counsel failure on the initial collateral review to develop the claim by adducing evidence that failure to call the guards to the stand during the second sentencing hearing impaired szabo chance of obtaining lenity.that depended on what the guards would have said if as the record was silent,szabo claim was sunk.failure to develop the record with essential evidence invariably means forfeiture.rule c played a leading role on appeal in szabo iii because szabo used his lawyer asserted noncompliance with his duties under that rule as an excuse that would permit him to start anew.in other words,szabo contended that the state had not furnished counsel of the quality that the state had promised through rule c to supply.he asked the supreme court of illinois in szabo iii to use state law to give him a new hearing with a better lawyer who would procure the vital evidence then missing from the record.the state decided that he was not entitled to that the legal services he received had met the state standards of quality.
let us suppose that this is wrong as the three dissenting justices concluded in szabo iv and that szabo did not enjoy the high standard of legal services that illinois seeks to provide on review.still,all that would mean is that szabo did not receive the effective assistance of it is settled as a matter of federal law that poor lawyering does not relieve a prisoner of what is otherwise a forfeiture under state law.see,coleman thompson,d pennsylvania finley,d.see also i the ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during federal or state collateral proceedings shall not be a ground for relief in a proceeding arising under section.that is to say,ineffective assistance of counsel does not supply cause for the formula under which federal courts sometimes entertain claims that were not properly presented to the state courts.szabo therefore can not show a sufficient cause for any forfeiture.because the last state court to consider the issue unambiguously invoked a forfeiture doctrine,the lack of evidence at the trial level in szabo iii supplies an independent and adequate state ground of decision.szabo claim was not preserved in state court and can not furnish the basis for a writ of habeas corpus.
szabo offers an additional argument in support of his judgment that during the second sentencing the judge violated the confrontation clause by admitting transcripts of five witnesses testimony from the first sentencing,even though these witnesses were not shown to be unavailable at the time of the second sentencing.in szabo ii the supreme court of illinois held that failure to make a motion for a new hearing forfeited this contention,see,at,and the district judge agreed.szabo contends that the state forfeiture decision was inadequate as a matter of federal law because szabo ii applied to him a doctrine that did not become firmly established in illinois until after the second sentencing.the state defends the supreme court forfeiture decision in szabo ii and adds that in its view the question is not properly before us in the first place,because szabo did not seek or obtain a certificate of appealability authorizing him to present this issue for appellate decision.
since both state and federal prisoners have needed certificates of appealability to obtain appellate review of adverse decisions in collateral attacks.but the statute deals only with appeals by prisoners it does not mention arguments by prisoners as appellees offered in support of relief they have obtained.section c begins unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability,an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from emphasis added.szabo has not taken an appeal,nor did he need to do so.an appellee may defend his judgment on any ground properly preserved in the district court.compare massachusetts mutual life insurance ludwig,d,with el paso natural gas neztsosie,d.szabo does not ask for additional relief,so he was entitled to proceed exactly as he has done.two woodford,cir,and williams cain,cir assume that a certificate of appealability is needed for a prisoner,and this is a plausible understanding of c though neither court discussed the question.but no court has demanded that a prisoner obtain a certificate of appealability in order to present an extra issue in a case already before the court on the state appeal,and we are content to apply as it is written.it serves a gatekeeping function,see ramunno united states,cir,and once a case is properly before the court of state and federal governments need not obtain certificates of appealability,see fed.app.b there are no remaining gates to be guarded.
szabo ii,which held that szabo failed to preserve his confrontation clause contention,is incontestable as a matter of state law the supreme court of illinois has resolved any dispute about what state law required szabo to do.whether this decision is adequate is,however,a question of federal law.relying on liegakos,szabo contends that the decision is inadequate because the requirement of a motion for a new sentencing hearing was not announced until after it was too late for his counsel to make such a motion.the parties have engaged in an extended debate about what illinois required along these lines during the.we think it unnecessary to resolve this arcane procedural point,because szabo legal position is defective on the merits.he contends that under the confrontation clause the transcripts of the five witnesses testimony at the first sentencing could be used only if they were unavailable at the time of the second sentencing that the record does not demonstrate unavailability.yet the supreme court has held that the confrontation clause does not apply to capital sentencing.it applies through the finding of guilt,but not to sentencing,even when that sentence is the death penalty.see williams new york.
since gregg georgia,d,and lockett ohio,d,the law of capital sentencing has changed considerably.nonetheless,the supreme court of the united states has never questioned the precise holding of williams new york,and we are not entitled to do so in this collateral attack.szabo sentence became final in,and developments could apply on collateral review only under rare circumstances.see teague lane,d tyler cain,d.see also d to obtain collateral relief a state prisoner must show that his claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states emphasis added williams taylor,d.
attempting to sidestep teague,szabo relies on specht patterson,d,which holds that the confrontation clause applies during those portions of a sentencing proceeding that can lead to an increase in the maximum lawful punishment.specht is a precursor of apprendi new jersey,d,and ring arizona,d,which hold that facts increasing the statutory maximum punishment must be proved,to the jury satisfaction,beyond a reasonable doubt,using the procedures normally employed at a per specht includes the opportunity to confront and one accusers in the flesh.unfortunately for szabo,however,in order to apply apprendi to capital sentencing,ring first had to overrule walton arizona,d.given teague,it is walton and not ring that governs szabo claims on collateral attack.see curtis united states,cir apprendi does not apply retroactively on collateral attack.specht itself just wo do the job.it distinguished williams new york on the ground that colorado capital sentencing procedure the one at issue in specht can boost the maximum lawful punishment.illinois has such a proceeding this is not the one at which the transcripts were used against szabo.
illinois handles capital cases in three phases.first is the guilt phase where the jury decides whether a crime occurred,next is the phase where the jury decides whether at least one aggravating circumstance applies,and finally comes the balancing phase,where the jury weighs aggravating and mitigating circumstances to select a sentence.specht dealt with a proceeding of the second kind.szabo waived the opportunity to have such a proceeding and stipulated that he was eligible for the death sentence.the aggravating circumstance was all it took,and there was no point denying it given the outcome of the guilt phase.only during the third,balancing phase of the illinois procedure was the transcribed testimony used,and that phase is outside the ambit of specht because the stipulation that pretermitted the second phase already had lifted the maximum punishment to a sentence of death.
we need not attempt to predict how the supreme court jurisprudence will develop apprendi and ring may portend more changes and may eventually be applied to the balancing phase of capital sentencing,as szabo contends that they should.but they were not so applied indeed,did not exist in,and specht,which did predate szabo sentencing,does not support his position.as late as,in walton,the supreme court rendered a decision strongly supporting the state perspective.williams new york shows that in illinois was entitled to proceed as it did.
the judgment is reversed,and the case is remanded for entry of an order denying szabo petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
the state of illinois proposes to put szabo to death despite the fact that,in its own state courts,he did not receive the quality of legal representation required by state law.nor was his claim of ineffective assistance of resentencing counsel addressed with precision or care by the illinois courts.despite this stark reality,we are required to limit our inquiry to the complex and difficult question of whether the federal courts can afford him any relief.our authority is limited we may inquire only as to whether a federal right,properly raised and preserved in earlier state proceedings,was so unreasonably adjudicated in the state courts as to justify our intervention.
the state takes the view that we can not reach the merits of szabo ineffective assistance of resentencing counsel claim.in its view,szabo has procedurally defaulted this claim.my colleagues agree they believe that szabo procedurally defaulted his sixth amendment claim when he failed to submit affidavits in support of this claim in his first petition.in their view,this forfeiture is analytically separate from the supreme court of illinois contestable interpretation of rule c in szabo iii that szabo counsel had complied functionally with rule c even though that counsel did not attach the necessary affidavits to conform the petition to requirements.see op.at.in my view,szabo failure to submit the required affidavits in the first review and the state court treatment of that failure on appeal from that determination can not so easily be unbundled for purposes of determining whether there has been a procedural default that bars federal review of szabo federal claim that resentencing counsel failed to render constitutionally effective assistance of counsel.in the following paragraphs,i shall set forth more fully the reasons for my taking this view.
our focus will be sharpened by beginning with some basic and undisputed principles.we begin with the fundamental rule that we shall not address a question of federal law raised in a habeas petition if the decision of the state court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.lee kemna,d quoting coleman thompson,d.this rule applies with equal force whether the rule is substantive or procedural in nature.id.at.under this principle,if a state court did not reach a federal issue because it applied,evenhandedly,a state procedural rule,the matter is closed to the federal habeas court absent a showing of cause and prejudice.willis aiken,cir citing wainwright sykes,d.however,the supreme court consistently has made clear that whether an asserted procedural ground is independent and adequate,and therefore a bar to federal relief,is a federal question.see henry mississippi,d johnson mississippi,d.
as my colleagues note,there is no question that the decision of the supreme court of illinois in szabo his counsel had complied with the requirements of rule c was independent of szabo constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of resentencing counsel.see op.at.the state determination of procedural default,however,must also be adequate.our case law consistently has required that,in order to be adequate,the procedural rule must be applied in a consistent and principled way.prihoda mccaughtry,cir.a state rule is consistent and principled when it is firmly established and regularly followed.franklin gilmore,cir rosa peters,cir see also johnson,at.james kentucky,d hamm saffle,cir duncan cain,cir.state courts may not avoid deciding federal issues by invoking procedural rules that they do not apply evenhandedly to all similar claims.garcia lewis,cir quoting hathorn lovorn,d see also romano gibson,cir,cert.denied,d willis,at.we therefore must determine whether illinois application of a state waiver doctrine is adequate to support its judgment and preclude federal habeas review.
in szabo first state petition,he alleged that both his original trial counsel and his resentencing counsel were constitutionally ineffective.with respect to resentencing counsel,one of szabo allegations was that his counsel failed to introduce mitigating evidence in the form of testimony of prison employees.szabo counsel in the first state proceeding did not substantiate those claims with affidavits or other support.consequently,the state trial court dismissed those claims as unsubstantiated.this decision was reviewed by the supreme court of illinois in szabo iii.in that appeal,szabo argued that his counsel in the state proceeding had not provided him with the representation required by state law because he had not provided the court with the necessary affidavits to support his claim that his resentencing counsel had been constitutionally ineffective consequently,szabo submitted,his federal right to competent counsel at the resentencing hearing had not been presented adequately to the trial court at the state hearing.because a determination that resentencing counsel was constitutionally inadequate would constitute cause for the failure to develop the case at resentencing,szabo argued that he was entitled to another hearing at which counsel would establish,with the requisite support,the constitutional ineffectiveness of resentencing counsel.
although there is no federal right to counsel in state proceedings,see pennsylvania finley,d,illinois has chosen to require that counsel representing defendants in such actions meet certain standards.today,and at all times pertinent to this case,those standards are embodied in rule c.however,even prior to the adoption of rule,the supreme court of illinois had set forth the responsibilities of counsel under the illinois hearing act in terms that are relevant to our present inquiry 
to the end that the complaints of a prisoner with respect to the validity of his conviction might be adequately presented,the statute contemplated that the attorney appointed to represent an indigent petitioner would consult with him either by mail or in person,ascertain his alleged grievances,examine the record of the proceedings at the trial and then amend the petition that had been filed pro se,so that it would adequately present the prisoner constitutional contentions.the statute can not perform its function unless the attorney appointed to represent an indigent petitioner ascertains the basis of his complaints,shapes those complaints into appropriate legal form and presents them to the court.
people slaughter.applying this standard in people garrison,the supreme court of illinois reversed a circuit court order dismissing a petition in which t he record d id not affirmatively show that appointed counsel had conferred with the defendant prior to filing the petition.id.at.
rule was adopted in and requires in pertinent part 
the record on appeal on a collateral attack shall contain a showing,which may be made by the certificate of petitioner attorney,that the attorney has consulted with petitioner either by mail or in person to ascertain his contentions of deprivation of constitutional right,has examined the record of proceedings at the trial,and has made any amendments to the petition filed pro se that are necessary for an adequate presentation of petitioner contentions.
c.applying the recently adopted rule,the supreme court of illinois in people brown,remanded a case to the circuit court because counsel failed to comply with the examination portion of the rule.in brown,counsel had received a letter from the defendant stating that he believed that he had other grounds that i could rely on but they in the court records concerning my first hearing id.at.counsel took this assertion to mean that the petitioner other complaints already had been presented by way of an initial proceeding and,consequently,the petitioner had no right to proceed on the current petition.on appeal,the supreme court of illinois stated 
without considering the necessity of a consultation with the petitioner concerning the contents of the letter received by the attorney on the morning of the hearing,it is clear there is nothing in the record to show that appointed counsel examined the record of the petitioner trial proceedings.the state does not dispute this but first replies that there is nothing to indicate that counsel did not examine the trial record.there is no merit to this reply,for rule c explicitly requires a showing that counsel has examined the trial record.
id.at.the illinois appellate courts also routinely have reversed trial court dismissals of petitions if counsel had failed to meet the requirements of rule c to consult,to review or to present the claims.see,people treadway,remanding for further proceedings in part because counsel did not amend the petition to present the claim adequately people alexander,d,stating that a bsent an affirmative showing on the record,we can not presume that counsel fulfilled his obligation to review the trial record,holding that i t is error to dismiss a petition on the pleadings where,as here,there has been no showing of adequate representation by counsel,even where the petition itself failed to present a substantial constitutional claim,and remanding for further proceedings people allen,d,remanding petition when counsel had failed to amend petition to include an affidavit from the defendant explaining how defendant would have testified had he not followed counsel advice to remain silent.
in other cases,the supreme court of illinois,applying the above standard,concluded that counsel had complied with the requirements of rule c.for instance,in people owens,the petitioner alleged that his counsel had not met his obligations under rule c because his counsel failed to introduce any such evidence in support of the ineffective assistance claim.id.at.the court held otherwise 
the record shows that counsel consulted with the petitioner and filed an amended petition which raised numerous allegations of trial error.it would have been impossible for counsel to have raised many of these errors without having examined the record of the proceedings at trial.in addition,petitioner counsel presented adequate evidence in support of the claim at the evidentiary hearing on the petition.for example,he questioned scott belford,the petitioner trial counsel,at length regarding his failure to request a hearing to determine the defendant competency to stand trial and be sentenced.petitioner counsel also questioned belford regarding his failure to call the defendant father to testify in mitigation,his failure to introduce the defendant school records and his failure to introduce evidence of the defendant psychological problems in mitigation at sentencing.in addition,petitioner counsel called the petitioner to testify,so that he might advise the court of mitigation witnesses who were not called and to explain what those witnesses might have said in mitigation.because the record demonstrates that petitioner counsel adequately presented the petitioner claim,we reject the petitioner contention that his counsel did not comply with rule c.
id.at parallel citation omitted.
it was against this background that the supreme court of illinois decided szabo appeal from his first hearing.in denying relief,the supreme court stated that counsel failure to file the requisite affidavit under rule c was of no consequence because the record affirmatively demonstrated that counsel had fulfilled these responsibilities 
this court has held that rule c works in conjunction with the hearing act to ensure that counsel appointed to represent an indigent petitioner ascertains the basis of his complaints,shapes those complaints into appropriate legal form and presents them to the court.rule c,therefore,requires that the record on appeal disclose that appointed counsel took the necessary steps to secure adequate representation of petitioner claims.failure of appointed counsel to file a rule c certificate of compliance is harmless error if the record establishes that counsel met the requirements of the rule.the record indicates that there was considerable communication between counsel and defendant,and that defendant received reasonable assistance of counsel as contemplated by the rule.transcripts include comments by counsel regarding his recent conversations with defendant.counsel called defendant father to testify about hiring landau.additionally,counsel secured investigative services from the court and conducted an exhaustive search for landau.looking beyond certification to the attorney actions,the record clearly supports the trial court finding of effective assistance of appointed counsel.
szabo iii,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in szabo iii,the supreme court of illinois correctly stated the standard it had developed in earlier cases,but it failed to apply that standard properly to the claims raised.as noted above,the supreme court of illinois in szabo iii stated that rule c requires counsel to ascertain the basis of the petitioner complaints,shape those complaints into appropriate legal form and present them to the court.id.emphasis added.although the court properly recited the standard in the thus applicable to all of the petitioner did not apply the standard to each of the allegations in the petition.
szabo had two primary complaints in his first petition david landau,his trial attorney,had been prevented from rendering effective assistance of counsel to defendant due to disciplinary problems which led to landau subsequent disbarment and szabo did not receive effective assistance of resentencing counsel because that counsel had not called prison employees to testify to szabo adjustment to prison life.id.at.the court,however,did not analyze whether counsel had fulfilled his responsibilities under rule c with respect to each of these claims.the court found compliance with the rule based only on counsel actions with respect to the first of these claims 
the record indicates that there was considerable communication between counsel and defendant,and that defendant received reasonable assistance of counsel as contemplated by the rule.transcripts include comments by counsel regarding his recent conversations with defendant.counsel called defendant father to testify about hiring landau.additionally,counsel secured investigative services from the court and conducted an exhaustive search for landau.looking beyond certification to the attorney actions,the record clearly supports the trial court finding of effective assistance of appointed counsel.
id.at.notably,nothing is said about counsel failure to present,in the fashion contemplated by rule c,the contention that resentencing counsel had performed in a constitutionally inadequate manner by failing to present available evidence with respect to szabo behavior while incarcerated.because the court in szabo iii did not consider the requirements of rule c with respect to each of szabo claims,its analysis does not comport with the standards it had set forth in its earlier cases.
the failure to decide szabo iii in conformity with the established body of precedent becomes even more clear upon examination of developments after this deviation.shortly after its decision in szabo iii,the supreme court of illinois returned to the question of counsel obligations under rule c in people johnson.in that case,the petitioner alleged that his counsel did not adequately represent him because he did not amend the pro se petition in the manner necessary to adequately present the petitioner claims.id.at.specifically,counsel failed to interview any of the witnesses named in the petition,marshaled no evidence in support of the petitioner contentions,attached no affidavits or other records to the amended petition,and failed to explain the absence of supporting documentation.id.at.the supreme court of illinois held that counsel had failed to comply with the requirements of the rule it stated 
in the ordinary case,a trial court ruling upon a motion to dismiss a petition which is not supported by affidavits or other documents may reasonably presume that counsel made a concerted effort to obtain affidavits in support of the claims,but was unable to do so.here,however,this presumption is flatly contradicted by the record.counsel filed an affidavit as a supplemental record in this appeal,which unequivocally establishes that counsel made no effort to investigate the claims raised in the defendant petition or to obtain affidavits from any of the witnesses specifically identified in the defendant pro se petition.to adequately establish the manner in which post conviction counsel deviated from his duties,it is necessary to discuss in some detail counsel actions as to each claim raised in the petition.
counsel affidavit,which was filed in this court,likewise states that he made no atte
