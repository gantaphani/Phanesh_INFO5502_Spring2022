fourteen years ago,an individual entered a milwaukee convenience store,robbed the store manager and cashier at gunpoint,and then fled in a getaway car.after a first trial ended in a hung jury,a second jury convicted warren goodman of armed robbery and being a felon in possession of a firearm,and he was sentenced to years imprisonment.having exhausted his state court remedies,goodman petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,challenging the effectiveness of his counsel during the second trial.the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin denied relief.unlike the district court,we find,under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.aedpa,that the state court decision was contrary to the ineffective assistance of counsel standard set forth in strickland washington,d.further,we conclude,under aedpa,that the state court decision was an unreasonable application of strickland because the cumulative effect of counsel errors constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.therefore,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for the entry of an order granting the writ.
background 
on july,an individual robbed kohl food store,a convenience store in milwaukee,holding the store cashier,ilene retzlaff,and manager,daniel kollath,at gunpoint.after the two complied with the gunman demands,the assailant fled in a getaway car,driven by an accomplice.blocks later,the men switched to a second getaway car that was driven by a third accomplice.later that day,police stopped mark smith and larry ross,who were riding in a car matching the description of the second getaway car.police retrieved two handguns and from the car smith eventually confessed that he acted as a lookout in the robbery,and fingered ross as an accomplice.smith also brokered a deal with prosecutors in which,in exchange for more lenient punishment,he implicated goodman.in a lineup,the store manager kollath initially identified another person as the robber,but in a subsequent lineup he chose goodman.the store cashier,retzlaff,did not pick goodman from the lineup,instead choosing another individual as the person who most resembled the robber.
goodman first and second trials 
the case against goodman went to trial twice.in each instance,the facts of the robbery were essentially undisputed only the identification of goodman as the perpetrator was at issue.in the first trial,smith and store manager kollath both testified that goodman robbed the store.the store cashier testified that she could not identify goodman as the robber and that she chose another person from the police lineup.goodman also testified on his own behalf.the court declared a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict.
smith received six years imprisonment for his role in the robbery,in exchange for his testimony in the first trial.ross,who was serving a sentence for being the driver of the second getaway car,contacted the prosecution after the first trial and agreed to testify against goodman at the retrial and to identify the driver of the first getaway car,in exchange for a recommendation to reduce his sentence.ross later named percy sallis,who confessed that he was the first getaway car driver.
at the second trial,goodman was represented by a different lawyer.kollath,as well as confessed accomplices smith,ross,and sallis,all testified that goodman committed the robbery.unlike the first trial,the store cashier,retzlaff,did not testify because she was on vacation and goodman lawyer failed to subpoena her.goodman counsel erroneously believed that a subpoena was unnecessary because the government would call retzlaff as a witness.because goodman counsel failed to demonstrate that retzlaff was unavailable to testify in person,the trial court excluded portions of her prior testimony from the second trial.so in the second trial,four witnesses,including the three accomplices,identified goodman as the robber,and retzlaff was not present to testify.
other problems arose for goodman counsel during the course of the second trial.on direct examination,goodman counsel asked goodman a question that ultimately led the court to allow on two of goodman previous armed robbery convictions as the parties had earlier stipulated to goodman status as a convicted felon,in the normal course of proceedings the prosecution would have been precluded from raising the nature of the prior felonies.
in addition,prosecution witnesses mark smith and larry ross testified regarding threats they received concerning their participation in the goodman trial.while the witnesses acknowledged that the threats were not made by goodman,nor was he was present when they were made,the witnesses claimed that the threats were intended to prevent them from testifying against goodman.goodman counsel objected,asserting that the witnesses testimony impermissibly linked goodman to the threats in the minds of the jurors.the trial court admitted the testimony on limited grounds,stating,outside the presence of the jury,that such testimony would reflect the witnesses credibility by demonstrating that they had something to lose as well as something to gain by testifying.goodman counsel later failed to request a jury instruction explaining to the jury the limited manner in which they could use the testimony.
in addition,goodman counsel did not object after the prosecution made misleading statements on direct examination indicating that the state had not given ross any reason to testify,when in fact ross had agreed to do so in the hopes of receiving a reduced sentence.during closing argument the prosecutor also made false statements improperly bolstering sallis testimony by stating that sallis could not have been charged or convicted without his voluntary confession while omitting the fact that ross had named sallis as an accomplice before sallis confessed.goodman counsel did not object or request a mistrial.
the jury ultimately found goodman guilty,and he was sentenced to years for the robbery and for being a felon in possession of a firearm during its commission.for his testimony and at the government recommendation,ross initial sentence was later reduced to twelve years.sallis received probation,conditioned on six months of work release,for his part in the robbery.
proceedings 
after his conviction,goodman sought relief in state court.goodman argued that,in violation of the sixth amendment,his second trial counsel was ineffective for opening the door to on goodman two prior convictions for armed robbery,failing to procure copies of government witnesses prior inconsistent testimony,failing to subpoena the store cashier to testify,and being generally unfamiliar with the case.the trial court denied the motion.the wisconsin court of appeals affirmed stating as follows 
w e,like the trial court,conclude that the record conclusively establishes that goodman was not prejudiced within the meaning of strickland in order to show prejudice,the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.the strickland test is not an test.in decisions following strickland,the supreme court has reaffirmed that the touchstone of the prejudice component is whether counsel deficient performance renders the result of the trial unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair.
the court concluded that,even if his counsel performance was deficient,goodman sixth amendment claim failed because none of goodman counsel alleged deficient conduct prejudiced him such that the result of the trial was unreliable.
goodman then presented his sixth amendment claim in a state habeas petition pursuant to.stat.and argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a limiting instruction regarding the testimony of threats,failing to object regarding the denial of his right to confront witnesses against him,and failing to object to prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments.the trial court denied relief,and the appellate court affirmed.the wisconsin supreme court denied habeas review.
following these adverse rulings in state court,goodman timely filed his federal habeas petition pursuant to in the united states district court for the eastern district of wisconsin.goodman maintained that,during direct appeal,the state court erred when it required him to prove the alleged errors of his counsel rendered his second trial unreliable or fundamentally unfair.the district court denied habeas relief,holding that the state court decision was not an unreasonable application of,or contrary to,clearly established federal law.see.goodman timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
this appeal presents two questions did the state court apply the wrong legal standard to goodman ineffective assistance of counsel claim and,under the correct legal framework,did the court unreasonably reject goodman sixth amendment claim reviewing the district court denial of habeas relief de novo,van patten deppisch,cir,we affirmatively answer both questions.
under the relevant provision of aedpa,goodman is entitled to habeas relief if the relevant decision was either contrary to clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.williams taylor,d quoting d see also sweeney carter,cir.a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law when the state court applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by the supreme court or,on facts materially indistinguishable from the facts of an applicable supreme court precedent,reaches a different result.badelle correll,cir internal citations omitted.we do not use hindsight to assess whether a law is clearly established instead our inquiry looks to the law of the supreme court at the time of the last state court decision on the merits,which,in this case,is the wisconsin court of appeals decision disposing of goodman direct appeal.see charlton davis,cir the relevant decision for purposes of our assessment is the decision of the last state court to rule on the merits of the petitioner claim.
in strickland,the supreme court announced the framework for assessing sixth amendment ineffective assistance of counsel claims,and the strickland framework was clearly established by the time of goodman direct appeal.see williams,at.it is past question that the rule set forth in strickland qualifies as clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.a petitioner asserting an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under strickland must show that his counsel performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.counsel performance is deficient when the representation f alls below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.strickland,at.to establish prejudice,the petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.goodman argues that the state court decision,requiring him to demonstrate that his second trial was fundamentally unfair,was contrary to the prejudice analysis set forth in strickland,which requires him only to show there is a reasonable probability of a different result.the district court found that the state court decision comported with strickland and,therefore,that goodman was not entitled to relief.we disagree.
previously,there was some confusion among courts attempting to reconcile strickland prejudice analysis,which looks at the reasonable probability of a different result,with the supreme court subsequent statement in lockhart fretwell,d,that an analysis focusing solely on mere outcome determination,without attention to whether the result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable,is defective.in washington smith,a case strikingly similar to the one now before us,we addressed this seeming contradiction in the court precedent 
there is some superficial tension between strickland statement of the prejudice standard,which looks to outcome determination,and lockhart,which looks beyond outcome determination to the fundamental fairness of the proceeding,but this tension evaporates when one understands that the heightened prejudice standard in lockhart concerns the unusual circumstance where the defendant attempts to demonstrate prejudice based on considerations that,as a matter of law,ought not inform the inquiry.lockhart,at,concurring.the supreme court recently removed all in its recent williams strickland governs the prejudice inquiry in most habeas cases and that the decision in lockhart does not justify a departure from a application of strickland when the ineffectiveness of counsel does deprive the defendant of a substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him.williams.at emphasis in original.the wisconsin court of appeals apparently did not fully grasp the proper interaction between strickland and lockhart in determining that washington did not show prejudice,and in so doing,its decision was both contrary to and involved an unreasonable application of the proper prejudice analysis prescribed by the supreme court.
washington smith,cir.in short,lockhart did not modify or supplant strickland prejudice test in a case such as this one id.at.lockhart heightened prejudice analysis only applies in cases where the defendant challenges his conviction based upon unusual circumstances that,as a matter of law,do not typically inform the court inquiry.for example,such unusual circumstances could occur when a state court relies on overruled law,see lockhart,at,or the defendant lawyer refuses to let him commit perjury,see nix whiteside,d.absent such unusual circumstances,strickland prejudice analysis is the proper framework for assessing a sixth amendment claim.
one of the most obvious ways a state court may render a decision contrary to the supreme court precedents is when it sets forth the wrong legal framework.van patten,at citing williams,at.in washington,the petitioner argued that his counsel was ineffective for,among other reasons,failing to subpoena a crucial defense witness.the wisconsin court of appeals applied lockhart heightened prejudice standard and ruled that the petitioner sixth amendment claim failed because he failed to show that the alleged deficiencies rendered the result of the trial unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair.state washington,wl,at,quoting lockhart,at.we concluded that the state court decision applied the wrong legal principle and affirmed habeas relief.washington,at.
to be sure,in washington,the state appellate court mentioned strickland only in passing and exclusively applied lockhart in its prejudice analysis.id.at.this case is somewhat more complicated because the state court cited strickland in its opinion,set forth the strickland test,and even concluded that goodman was not prejudiced within the meaning of strickland.in denying relief,the district court reasoned that these references suggest the appellate court correctly applied the strickland standard.we disagree.there is a difference between what the state court said and what it actually did.although,in a boilerplate fashion,the court cited the strickland rule,it repeatedly reasoned that goodman failed to show that his second trial was fundamentally unfair or unreliable.in conflating lockhart heightened prejudice standard with strickland prejudice analysis,the state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law.d.
even if the wisconsin court of appeals decision were not contrary to federal law,it was an unreasonable application of strickland.the unreasonable application prong of aedpa means the state court decision lies well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.hardaway young,cir see also jackson frank,cir we have held that under this criterion,habeas relief should not be granted if the state court decision can be said to be one of several outcomes.in the habeas context,an unreasonable application is more than simply an
