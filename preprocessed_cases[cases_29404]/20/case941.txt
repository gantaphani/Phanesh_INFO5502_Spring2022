according to the state court records,cummings was arrested on april,in sampson county,north carolina,for driving a stolen vehicle matching the description of a vehicle involved in several in that county.following the arrest,the sampson county authorities contacted nearby police departments to check for outstanding warrants on cummings.as a result,detective tom hunter of the brunswick county sheriff department and detective smith of the red springs police department in robeson county went to the sampson county jail to question cummings regarding the babson and hales murders.
cummings was interviewed at least six times in late april before being arrested for the babson murder,and he was given miranda warnings on each occasion the miranda claim arises from the hunter interview,which was cummings initial interview with detective hunter regarding the babson crimes.according to detective hunter testimony at a suppression hearing conducted on november,he questioned cummings in the sampson county jail on april,concerning the babson robbery and murder.at the start of the hunter interview,hunter reviewed a miranda rights form with cummings.the form provided that i f you want a lawyer before or during questioning but can not afford to hire one,one will be appointed to represent you at no cost before any questioning.detective hunter disagreed with the language of the form,crossed out the words at no cost,and told cummings,i do know why they put in this at no cost.if you are found innocent,it is no cost but if you are found guilty there is a chance the state will require you to reimburse them for the attorney fees.see id.at.according to the state court decision,hunter testified that after cummings waived his miranda rights,he stated the following

the evidence presented in the guilt phase of cummings trial in brunswick county,which lasted from late november,to december,implicated cummings in the babson crimes.witness donald ray long testified that,on the day of the babson robbery and murder,cummings stopped at long farm supply store,about a mile east of babson store,asked for directions from long,and then drove off in the direction of babson store.another witness,martha fowler,testified that cummings twice entered her six miles from babson on the evening of the babson crimes.officer thomas trochum,an expert in firearms identification,testified that babson death resulted from two fatal gunshot wounds,one in the eye and the other in the lower back,from caliber bullets that could not have been fired by babson own caliber revolver.most significantly,cummings statements were introduced,including his statement during the polygraph examination of april,admitting that he had robbed babson store and engaged in a struggle that resulted in babson being shot.on december,the jury found cummings guilty of all three offenses relating to the babson murder.
during the trial sentencing phase,which was conducted before the same jury and also ended on december,the prosecution introduced evidence over objection concerning the unadjudicated murder of lena hales.hales,an woman,had been killed in nearby robeson county,north carolina,two or three days before the babson murder.hales daughter,barbara kinlaw,testified that she found her mother at home unconscious and badly beaten on the morning of april,and that hales had died from her injuries later that day.cummings admitted that he had robbed hales at her home during the early morning hours of april,but denied hurting her in any way.as spelled out in the state court decision

cummings,at.
detective smith testified that,when he interviewed cummings on april,cummings gave a statement regarding his activities from april to april.in summary,cummings stated that sometime around midnight on april,he went door to door in red springs,making inquiries of those who answered.he said that if someone had opened a door and a pocketbook had been visible and nearby,he planned to grab it and run.after this effort proved unsuccessful,cummings met with two friends and spent an hour or so looking for drugs.unable to find drugs,they parted ways around and cummings told the others that he was going to find some money.cummings walked toward a nearby store that he contemplated breaking into but,fearing an alarm,decided against doing so.cummings then noticed a house behind the store without any nearby vehicles or lights.cummings kicked out a window and entered the house,walking over a bed and moving into a hallway.he noticed a lady standing in another room peering out a door and,as she turned,cummings told her to give him her money.as she pleaded for her safety,cummings grabbed her arm and led her to a bedroom were she retrieved a pocketbook and gave him all her money.cummings stuffed the money in his pants,told the lady to lie down in bed,threatened to come back and hurt her if she got up or yelled,and then left.
detective smith testified that cummings statements on the hales crimes were consistent with his observations of hales home when he answered a call there early on april.when smith arrived at the home,hales had already been transported to a hospital after being discovered by her daughter.smith noted morning papers on the front porch dated april and.cummings denied hurting hales,asserting that he had only robbed the woman and left her on the bed unharmed.at the time of the babson trial,cummings had been indicted in robeson county for the hales murder and related offenses,but the charges were unadjudicated.
in the sentencing phase of cummings trial,the court instructed the jury regarding the course of conduct aggravator as follows 
if you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that in addition to killing babson,cummings,on or about the alleged date,was engaged in a course of conduct which involved the commission of another crime of violence against another person and that these other crimes were included in the same course of conduct in which the killing of babson was also a part,you would find this aggravating circumstance 
by its verdict,the jury recommended that cummings receive the death penalty for the babson murder,finding it part of a course of conduct that included crimes of violence against another person lena hales,and that the babson murder had been committed for pecuniary gain.the court imposed sentence on december,including the death penalty for the babson murder,forty years for robbery with a dangerous weapon,and ten years for assault with a deadly weapon.
on july,the state court decision affirmed cummings convictions and sentences relating to the babson murder.see cummings,at.the supreme court of the united states thereafter denied certiorari.see cummings north carolina,d.on december,cummings filed a motion for appropriate relief the mar in the superior court of brunswick county the mar court,which he later amended on may,the mar court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the claims asserted in the mar,and it denied those claims by order of june,the mar decision the supreme court of north carolina thereafter denied certiorari on the mar decision.see state cummings.
on november,while his certiorari petition was pending in the supreme court of north carolina,cummings filed the petition that gives rise to these proceedings,seeking habeas corpus relief in the eastern district of north carolina.on january,the district court dismissed three of the petition claims,and the district court decision granted summary judgment to the state on the remaining eighteen claims.the district court,on may,granted cummings a coa on the evidence claim.we thereafter granted cummings a coa on the miranda claim.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo a district court award of summary judgment,applying aedpa deferential standard of review to the state court adjudication of a petitioner claims on their merits.robinson polk,cir pursuant to aedpa,we may award habeas corpus relief on a claim that was adjudicated on its merits in state court only if the adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.as the supreme court has explained,a state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if the court arrives at a conclusion opposite that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a state court decision is an unreasonable application of federal law when it correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner case.id.at.a state court decision may also be an unreasonable application of federal law if it applies supreme court precedent in a different factual context from the one in which the precedent was decided and one to which extension of the legal principle of the precedent is not reasonable or fails to apply the principle of a precedent in a context where such failure is unreasonable.robinson,at internal quotation marks omitted.
two issues are presented for consideration in this appeal.first,in connection with the evidence claim,the district court granted a coa on cummings contention that the admission of the hales evidence as an aggravating factor during the trial sentencing phase violated his constitutional rights.second,on the miranda claim,we granted cummings a coa on his claim that his fifth and sixth amendment rights were violated by the admission at trial of statements that resulted from an erroneous miranda warning at the hunter interview.we address these
