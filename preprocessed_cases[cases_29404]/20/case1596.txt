thomas keenan appeals the district court judgment that dismissed as untimely his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the judgment and remand the case for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether keenan may avail himself of the doctrine of equitable tolling.
background 
keenan is an ohio prisoner who has been sentenced to death for the murder of anthony klann.the factual background surrounding the crime is extensively detailed in state keenan,ohio,but is not directly relevant to the issue before us.
procedurally,keenan was indicted for aggravated burglary along with the kidnaping and aggravated murder of klann on october.in,keenan was convicted by a jury and sentenced to death by the trial court.the ohio court of appeals affirmed keenan conviction and death sentence in.this conviction was reversed,however,and the case remanded for a new trial by the ohio supreme court on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct.state keenan,ohio.
the second trial took place in.keenan was again convicted by the jury and sentenced to death,and the final judgment of the trial court was again affirmed by the ohio court of appeals.on november,keenan submitted the transcript from this second trial to the ohio supreme court,thus initiating his appeal to that court.this date is key to the issue before us,because it marks the point at which his statute of limitations for state postconviction relief began to run under ohio ann.by the time that this statute of limitations expired,on may,keenan had yet to file a petition for state postconviction relief.
keenan second conviction was affirmed on february,by the ohio supreme court.state keenan,ohio.the united states supreme court denied certiorari on october,another key date in this case.keenan ohio,d.this denial initiated the statute of limitations for petitioning for federal habeas relief under d.
the controversy in the present case was precipitated by a glenn order issued by the ohio supreme court on november.that order provided as follows 
it is further ordered by the court that,pursuant to state glenn,ohio,a stay is granted for a period of six months,beginning october,and ending april,to allow appellant an opportunity to file a petition for relief.
state keenan,ohio,ohio unpublished.significantly,keenan statute of limitations granted by ohio ann.had already expired.
keenan filed a petition for state postconviction relief in the cuyahoga county court of common pleas on march.this petition was well within the time frame set out by the ohio supreme court in the glenn order.all of the parties agree,however,that this petition was filed almost two years after the expiration on may,of the statute of limitations specified in ohio ann.
the ohio trial court denied the petition on its merits in.on appeal,the ohio court of appeals affirmed the trial court denial,but based its decision on the ground that keenan petition was untimely under ohio ann,and that keenan had failed to meet any of the statute exceptions for his late filing.state keenan,wl,at ohio,unpublished.the ohio supreme court denied leave for a discretionary appeal in state keenan,ohio,ohio unpublished.
on september,almost two years after the statute of limitations under d had expired,keenan filed a notice of intent to file a petition with the federal district court.the district court ordered the parties to submit a procedural timeline to determine whether keenan state postconviction proceedings had tolled the federal statute of limitations.keenan filed his federal petition in november of.in january of,the warden filed a motion to dismiss on the basis of the statute of limitations.she argued that since the court of appeals had ruled that keenan state postconviction relief petition was under ohio law,the federal petition was also because the petition for state postconviction relief could not have tolled the federal statute of limitations under d.
the district court agreed with the warden position and dismissed keenan petition as.it also found that keenan had not demonstrated a basis for equitable tolling,nor had he demonstrated that he could avail himself of any exception to the limitations period.the court,however,granted a certificate of appealability on the timeliness issue.keenan also filed a motion to alter or amend the record,arguing that the district court should have certified three questions relating to the timeliness of his petition to the ohio supreme court.the district court denied the motion,but granted a certificate of appealability as to the issues raised within the motion.keenan appeal under these certifications is now before us.

keenan argues at length that his petition for state postconviction relief was indeed timely filed.for the purposes of keenan petition for federal habeas relief,this is the central issue before us.there is a limitations period during which a state prisoner may file for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.d.in keenan case,the statute of limitations began to run on october,the date that the united states supreme court denied certiorari and his conviction became final under the statute.see clay united states,d.under ordinary circumstances,keenan would have had until october,to file for relief in federal district court.he did not file,however,until november.

we are unable,however,to reach a conclusion on the timeliness issue at this time.even if keenan petition for state postconviction relief was improperly filed,he may be able to proceed on the basis of his argument.equitable tolling is permissible under the and effective death penalty act aedpa,although rare.king bell,cir.our focus on aedpa causes us to respectfully disagree with the dissent statement that we are asked to toll the statute of limitations under ohio law,after the ohio court of appeals has determined that the petition was untimely.dissenting op.at to the contrary,the application of equitable tolling is a question of federal law.our present discussion impacts only keenan filing for federal habeas relief,not the timeliness of his petition for state postconviction relief.
in essence,the doctrine of equitable tolling allows federal courts to toll a statute of limitations when a litigant failure to meet a deadline unavoidably arose from circumstances beyond that litigant control.memphis brooks museum of art,cir.this circuit has adopted a straightforward test for analyzing claims.the factors to be considered are lack of actual notice of filing requirement lack of constructive knowledge of filing requirement diligence in pursuing one rights absence of prejudice to the defendant and a plaintiff reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the notice requirement.andrews orr,cir.furthermore,these factors are not necessarily comprehensive or always relevant ultimately every court must consider an equitable tolling claim on a basis.king,at.
in the present case,the ohio supreme court issued its glenn order on november,a year and a half after keenan time for filing for state postconviction relief had expired under ohio ann.keenan,however,still had over months from that point in which to file for habeas relief in federal district court.but,for reasons impossible to determine from the record before us,he chose to file for postconviction relief not in federal was still a venue properly available to in state court.had he instead filed a petition for habeas relief in federal court,the state would have been unable to argue,as it does now,that his petition is barred by the statute of limitations.
the key question for the purposes of equitable tolling,therefore,is why keenan filed for state postconviction relief,as opposed to federal habeas relief,on march.if keenan indeed relied on the literal language of the ohio supreme court glenn order in structuring his legal strategy,then his argument for equitable tolling might be very strong.for example,the petitioner in king bell,cir,was prevented from filing a timely federal habeas petition because of governmental delay in providing him with the trial transcript.in all other respects,however,the petitioner had completely complied with the timetable.this court applied the doctrine of equitable tolling and concluded that the petitioner had no reason to anticipate any procedural difficulties he had complied with the schedule and with the court original order to include all his arguments in one petition.id.at.
indeed,based on the evidence before us,keenan might have reasonably viewed the ohio supreme court order as granting him extra time to properly file a petition for state postconviction relief.he might have assumed that any time spent pursuing this avenue would toll his federal statute of limitations.thus,given the glenn order,he might have believed that filing for state postconviction relief would not prevent him from later filing for federal habeas relief.the record before us,however,contains no mention of keenan motivation in filing for state postconviction relief instead of federal habeas relief.we can not determine with any certainty whether he relied on the glenn order when deciding to file for state postconviction relief.without more information,we can not ascertain if keenan may avail himself of equitable tolling.
whether this case presents one of those rare occasions in which equitable tolling under aedpa is proper is an issue appropriately handled by the district court in the course of an evidentiary hearing.in so remanding,we note that the district court must consider the lack of actual notice of filing requirement lack of constructive knowledge of filing requirement diligence in pursuing one rights absence of prejudice to the defendant and a plaintiff reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the notice requirement.andrews orr,cir.keenan might claim that he did indeed rely on the glenn order in postponing his claim for federal habeas relief,but the district court must then decide whether such a reliance,in light of all the andrews factors,was reasonable.the answer to this question,we believe,will determine whether there is merit to keenan argument that equitable tolling should be applied to the case before us.
iii.conclusion 
for all of the reasons set forth above,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing in accordance with this opinion.
thomas keenan,a petitioner condemned to death in ohio,brings his first habeas case in federal court.he presents a number of plausible claims,including an actual innocence claim.by stretching and stitching together procedural default and statutory limitations arguments,the state seeks to forfeit all of keenan constitutional claims so that he will now be executed without federal review of any kind.
the state treats as a state procedural default the condemned prisoner state habeas petition filed on march.as a result,counsel for the state asks the court to refuse to toll the running of the,federal limitation period under d.there are four reasons that it is wrong to procedurally default as improperly filed the state petition and decline to toll the running of the federal statute of limitations.
first,immediately after the supreme court denied certiorari,the state supreme court in its october order expressly granted a period of six months beginning october,and ending april,to allow appellant an opportunity to file a petition for relief.the petition was then filed five months later,a month before the time was up.it is difficult to understand how the ohio supreme court could have been any plainer in setting out the time to allow a condemned prisoner to file for relief after the supreme court denied certiorari.you have six months to file.that is what the ohio supreme court said.the reasonable expectation of a lawyer reading the order would be that it allows six month time for filing.the state refuses to apply this plain language and would refuse to allow the federal tolling statute to operate because it says that the time allowed for filing the state petition ran out long before the supreme court denied certiorari and long before the state supreme court entered its order to allow the filing of the state petition.so the two years the petitioner waited in the ohio courts for his petition to be decided can not be used or counted to toll under the federal statute.the state attorney general argues that in order to toll the statute the petitioner should have filed months before the state death penalty judgment became final in the ohio supreme court and months before it became final after the supreme court denied certiorari.the condemned prisoner will be executed without review of his federal constitutional claims because he complied with the express language of the state supreme court allowing him six months to file.
upon remand,by this court opinion,one essential question for the district court is whether keenan was relying on the supreme court order when he opted to file his state petition prior to his federal habeas petition.i find it apparent that the ohio supreme court order plainly implied that keenan had six months to pursue state relief rather than six months to pursue federal habeas relief.first,the court order used the term petition for relief,which is the very title of the state collateral attack as put forth in ohio ann.the court was clearly referring to a state petition rather than relief generally or a federal habeas petition.second,when the glenn order was issued in october,keenan had just over months left to file his federal habeas petition.certainly the ohio supreme court was not suggesting that he had only six months to file his federal habeas petition.the time frame clearly referred to state relief.thus,it is easy to see why keenan,relying on the supreme court order,filed a state petition in state court within six months,rather than a federal habeas petition.as keenan almost certainly relied on the ohio supreme court order,this court should equitably toll the limitations period as keenan had no actual notice that this filing would be improper and any ignorance regarding any forfeiting effect was reasonable in light of the supreme court order.the majority of this court does not find sufficient evidence in the record to demonstrate that keenan actually relied upon the natural implication of the ohio supreme court order.the lower court on remand,therefore,should equitably toll the limitations period if the record demonstrates that keenan relied on the supreme court order in proceeding to state court first.
second,despite the plain english of the ohio supreme court order,the state would procedurally default the tolling claim,and hence all other federal claims,by saying simply that the ohio court of appeals opinion dismissing the state petition on jurisdiction grounds controls our decision on tolling even though that court did not mention or purport to interpret the federal tolling statute or even know that its action would deny federal review.the state reads the ohio court refusal to hear the state petition as forfeiting all federal claims because it used the jurisdiction talisman rather than dismissing on other grounds.the ohio court of appeals ruled sua sponte,without argument or briefing,that keenan state claims were late after two years of litigation in state court.that ruling should not cont
