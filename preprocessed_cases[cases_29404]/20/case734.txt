daniel warren warren is currently in the state correctional institution at huntingdon,pennsylvania,serving a prison sentence of to years imposed after he entered a negotiated guilty plea to one count of burglary on october.warren now claims that the commonwealth imposition of that sentence has violated his federal due process rights,and he seeks federal habeas corpus relief under section on that basis.because we conclude that the requirements of section have not been met,we affirm the district court denial of habeas relief.
factual and procedural background 
under the terms of warren plea agreement,other pending charges were dropped and the burglary was treated as a strike two offense by the commonwealth.that latter aspect of the agreement meant that the pennsylvania mandatory sentencing statute.section,was applied during warren sentencing.at that time section a provided 
any person who is convicted in any court of this commonwealth of a crime of violence shall,if at the time of the commission of the current offense the person had previously been convicted of a crime of violence and has not rebutted the presumption of high risk dangerous offender be sentenced to a minimum sentence of ten years of total confinement,notwithstanding any other provision of this title or other statute to the contrary.
that presumption of high risk dangerous offender applied in warren case because the terms of section b were met he had a prior conviction for a crime of violence that had taken place fewer than seven years before the charged strike two offense.to rebut the presumption,section c required warren to present evidence to the court at a hearing and required the sentencing judge to consider factors before deciding whether the evidence presented was sufficient.after finding that no evidence presented had overcome the operable presumption against warren,the sentencing judge imposed the sentence mandated by section on december.
shortly thereafter warren sought to have the court reconsider the sentence imposed.but that effort was rebuffed on february,because warren attorney had initiated a direct appeal to the superior court of pennsylvania.eleven days later the direct appeal was discontinued by warren attorney.then warren later motions seeking to revive his direct appeal by treating his submissions nunc pro tunc were denied,effectively ending any direct review of warren sentence.
that chain of events formed the basis for warren first petition for collateral relief under pennsylvania post conviction relief act.warren claimed ineffectiveness of trial counsel because his direct appeal had been discontinued without his consent.after counsel was appointed,an evidentiary hearing was conducted by the court to assess his claim on june.shortly after that hearing warren filed motions claiming ineffectiveness of his counsel.on august,the court issued a ruling that dismissed both of warren claims,and warren appealed that decision to the superior court of pennsylvania.
after the appeal had been filed,warren submitted an application to the superior court seeking a determination as to whether his waiver of counsel as to that appeal was knowing,intelligent and voluntary.in response the superior court remanded the appeal to the court for the purpose of conducting a colloquy.on february,the court determined that the waiver had been knowing,intelligent and voluntary,so that warren continued to represent himself on his appeal.
in the midst of the waiver proceedings,warren filed a second petition on january.this time he challenged the constitutionality of his sentence in light of the pennsylvania supreme court invalidation of section in commonwealth butler.but because that second petition was filed while his original appeal was still pending,it was dismissed on january.
on december,the superior court disposed of all issues related to warren challenges.first the court affirmed the finding that warren waiver of counsel on the appeal had been knowing,intelligent and voluntary.it also affirmed the rejection of the ineffectiveness claims made in warren first petition.finally,the court directly addressed the constitutional claim raised by warren in his second petition and explicitly declined to apply butler emphasis in original 
it is axiomatic that a new rule of law,even if given full retroactive effect,will not be applied to a collateral proceeding attacking the conviction.commonwealth tilley.instead,for a new rule of law to be applied to a proceeding,the issue had to be preserved at all stages,including on direct appeal.see also commonwealth todaro,a new rule of law is not applied in a collateral attack on a conviction in the present case,appellant did not raise the constitutionality of the statute during his plea proceedings nor did he raise it during direct appeal.hence,it can not be applied in this collateral proceeding.
warren filed a petition for federal habeas corpus relief under section on february,raising three objections to the state court proceedings.two of those objections concerned the state court refusal to restore his direct right of appeal,and the third challenged the use of section in his sentencing.all three objections were rejected,and the writ of habeas corpus was therefore denied,when the district court adopted the report and recommendations of the magistrate judge on march.
warren then filed a timely appeal in this court.we granted warren application for a certificate of appealability as to two issues whether the failure to apply butler retroactively violated warren due process rights,and whether the application of section burden shifting provision violated warren due process rights independently of the ruling on the first issue.because the district court determination was based solely on the information contained in the state court record,our review of those issues is plenary marshall hendricks,cir.
federal habeas standards 
to qualify for relief under section,warren must demonstrate that he is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states section a.as already stated,he contends that the state has violated his federal due process rights in either or both of two respects,we address his contentions in turn.
retroactivity as a due process issue 
as an initial basis for his claim that his due process rights have been violated,warren attacks the pennsylvania superior court decision not to apply butler retroactively.although that argument raises the issue of retroactivity in the context of habeas review,it is not one of the sort governed by the supreme court standard articulated in teague lane,d,because we are not asked to decide the applicability of a new federal rule of jurisprudence to an already concluded state proceeding.instead the issue here is whether the due process clause is implicated when a state court declines to give retroactive effect to one of its own decisions.
we previously addressed a closely related issue in fiore white,cir.after the pennsylvania supreme court had decided commonwealth scarpone,interpreting a state statute,fiore sought through state proceedings to have that ruling applied retroactively to his case.when the state court declined that request,he filed a petition for federal habeas relief.
in reviewing his petition,we first noted that fiore is entitled to relief only if federal law requires retroactive application of scarpone fiore,at.that limitation on the scope of our review stems from the supreme court reemphasis in estelle mcguire,d that it is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine determinations on questions,and it applies with equal force here.
as for the question that we could properly address on habeas the united states constitution required the state to apply its decision on a question of state law said this in fiore,at some citations omitted 
the district court held,and fiore maintains on appeal,that the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment require retroactive application of scarpone.this conclusion,however,is at odds with the supreme court longstanding position that the federal constitution has no voice upon the subject of retroactiv
