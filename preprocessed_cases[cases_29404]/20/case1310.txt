in this death penalty habeas appeal from texas,jose garcia briseno seeks review of the district court judgment denying his claim that his direct appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance.the district court granted briseno a certificate of appealability coa on that issue.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
in late,ben murray,the sheriff of dimmit county,was investigating a burglary case.the sheriff met with briseno to enlist his help in solving the burglaries.several weeks later,on sunday,january,the sheriff was found dead in his home,with numerous stab wounds and a bullet wound to the head.at trial,testimony revealed that over five hundred dollars in cash had been taken from the sheriff.additionally,two of his pistols were missing.
when briseno was arrested,he had bandages on both hands.he told police that he had received the cuts in a fight on the previous friday.while being held,he attempted to escape with several other inmates,including ricardo basaldua.after their capture,basaldua told authorities statements briseno made about the sheriff murder.basaldua testified that on the night of the sheriff murder,briseno and another defendant,alberto gonzales,appeared at the sheriff home offering to sell some rings.briseno and gonzales did not have any rings for sale,but used the ring story to gain entry to the sheriff home.a struggle began,and they stabbed the sheriff.when briseno and gonzales could not take the sheriff down,briseno grabbed the sheriff gun off a table and shot the sheriff.afterwards,briseno and gonzales stole some money from the sheriff home and hid it.basaldua also testified that during the escape briseno showed him the spot where briseno had buried the gun used to kill the sheriff.briseno dug up the gun but soon disposed of it in the same general area before the police caught the escapees.upon being recaptured,basaldua led the officers to the location where briseno had hidden the gun,and the gun was recovered.
at trial,the state introduced evidence demonstrating that blood taken from the sheriff carpet compared positively with that of briseno additional evidence submitted at trial included bloody clothing that was found behind a sofa in a shed in which briseno had been staying.that clothing contained enzyme markers consistent with briseno and the sheriff.furthermore,a bullet of the same caliber and brand as that used in the stolen pistol utilized to kill the sheriff was discovered at the shed.moreover,a bloodhound tracked a lighter found near the sheriff residence to the shed where briseno had been staying.
a jury convicted briseno of sheriff murray murder and sentenced him to death.on appeal,counsel george scharmen represented briseno.briseno filed his brief on appeal on june.the texas court of criminal appeals affirmed the conviction and death sentence in an unpublished opinion on june.the united states supreme court denied briseno petition for writ of certiorari on february.
on july,briseno initiated state habeas corpus proceedings,with scharmen again as his attorney the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on some of briseno claims raised in the state petition.the trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law,which the court of criminal appeals adopted.the court of criminal appeals denied briseno application on november.
thereafter,on november,briseno timely filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court,raising three claims for relief those claims were that briseno trial counsel was ineffective during the penalty phase of trial due to inadequate preparation and lack of investigation of mitigating circumstances briseno due process rights were violated because he was unable to obtain assistance and information from his former defense attorney and briseno appellate attorney was ineffective for failing to challenge on appeal the trial court denial of a defense motion for an expert serologist.the district court granted summary judgment and denied relief with respect to the first two claims and scheduled oral argument and supplemental briefing on the third claim of ineffective assistance of direct appeal counsel.later,the district court granted the director motion for summary judgment and denied relief with respect to the last claim.
briseno timely filed a notice of appeal.subsequently,the district court granted a coa with respect to briseno third claim.
ii.discussion 
before arguing the issue to which the district court granted a coa,briseno raises two preliminary issues concerning the standard of prejudice to be utilized in an ineffective assistance of direct appellate counsel claim,and the legality and parameters of d,the statutory section prescribing the standard of review to be accorded mixed questions of law and fact.we review these matters prior to addressing the merits of the issue granted a coa.
in denying briseno third claim,the district court assumed for purposes of its order that briseno appellate counsel failure to raise the denial of the blood expert on direct appeal fell below the objective standard of reasonable conduct expected of appellate counsel.moreover,the district court assumed that the trial court denial of a blood expert constituted error under ake oklahoma,d,and that the texas court of criminal appeals would have reversed the trial court had that issue been raised on direct appeal.nevertheless,the district court concluded that briseno third claim did not establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim because it did not rise to the level of constitutional error contemplated by goodwin johnson,cir.
briseno asserts that the standard of prejudice to be utilized in an ineffective assistance of direct appellate counsel claim as stated in goodwin conflicts with the supreme court recent decision in smith robbins,d.in goodwin,we clarified the prejudice requirement of the test to show ineffective assistance of counsel,which the supreme court announced in strickland washington,d.under strickland,to prove that counsel afforded ineffective assistance,a petitioner must show that his attorney performance was deficient,and that such deficiency prejudiced the defense.id.at.goodwin held that the presence or absence of strickland prejudice as a result of unconstitutionally deficient performance of counsel at either the trial or appellate level hinges upon the fairness of the trial and the reliability of the judgment of conviction resulting therefrom.goodwin,at.that is,we rejected the outcome determinative aspect of petitioner argument that strickland prejudice is established if there is a reasonable probability that the allegedly deficient performance would have caused a reversal on direct appeal.instead,the focus had to be on the fairness of the proceeding and the reliability of its result.id.at.to the extent that the appellate process is merely a vehicle for correcting errors at trial,the fairness and reliability of an appeal are necessarily functions of the fairness and reliability of the trial.id.
recently,in smith robbins,d,the supreme court appears to have rejected goodwin holding.indeed,the director concedes this point.smith generally involved whether some of the court statements in anders california,d,reciting an acceptable procedure for treating frivolous appeals by criminal defendants,were obligatory upon the states and whether california procedure,as stated in people wende,cal d,violated the fourteenth amendment.although the court concluded that the anders procedure was not obligatory and that california wende procedure was not constitutionally infirm,see smith.at,it noted that the petitioner appeal may not have been frivolous and that he may have been entitled to more than a wende brief.in remanding the case,the court reiterated strickland as the appropriate standard.id.at.and it stated that to demonstrate prejudice,the petitioner had to show a reasonable probability that,but for his counsel unreasonable failure in this case,to file a merits brief,he would have prevailed on his appeal.id.
briseno second preliminary issue relates to the legality and parameters of d the statutory section prescribing the standard
