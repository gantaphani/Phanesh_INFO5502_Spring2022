in,massachusetts state prisoner richard aspen was convicted of raping and sexually assaulting his stepdaughter.during the selection of the petit jury,aspen claimed that the prosecutor exercised her peremptory challenges to exclude potential male jurors in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment,as interpreted in batson kentucky,d holding that the racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges violates equal protection,and alabama,d extending batson to the use of peremptory challenges on the basis of gender.the trial judge denied aspen challenge,concluding that he had not established a prima facie case of discrimination.
aspen appealed to the massachusetts appeals court.the court considered aspen equal protection claim under article of the declaration of rights of the massachusetts constitution,which it understood to mandate the same analysis as the fourteenth amendment.commonwealth aspen.the court stated that to establish a prima facie case,aspen had to show that there was a pattern of excluding members of the venire on account of gender,and it was likely that individuals were being excluded solely on the basis of gender.id.the court also explained that,once presented with this evidence,the trial judge had to determine whether to draw the reasonable inference that peremptory challenges have been exercised so as to exclude individuals on account of gender.id.after stating the standard,the court concluded that aspen had not established a prima facie case because the trial judge could properly conclude that gender was not shown to be the likely reason for the prosecutor initial challenges.id.at.
aspen request for further appellate review by the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc was denied.having exhausted state court remedies,aspen filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court,arguing that the appeals court had applied an incorrect legal standard in considering his batson claim.he asserted that the state court had erred by requiring him,in order to make out a prima facie case,to establish that it was likely that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges on account of gender.the district court,applying the deferential standards of review under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,rejected aspen petition but did grant him a certificate of appealability,see b a.
we review the denial of aspen habeas petition de novo.see ellsworth warden,cir en banc.where,as here,the state court considered aspen claim on the merits,our review is governed by aedpa.see lynch ficco,cir.under aedpa,we may not disturb the state court conclusion unless the adjudication of aspen claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
a state court adjudication is contrary to supreme court precedent if,when made,it results from the application of a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by the supreme court or is inconsistent with a supreme court decision in a case involving materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a state court decision is an unreasonable application of the governing law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.see horton allen,cir.
the clearly established law governing the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges was set forth in batson.the court described a test for adjudicating claims that peremptory challenges have been exercised in a discriminatory manner.the moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating a prima facie case of discrimination.batson,at.if this burden is met,the party must then offer a reason for striking the potential juror.id.at.finally,the trial court must determine if the moving party has met its ultimate burden of persuasion that the peremptory challenge was exercised for a discriminatory reason.id.at.
batson also described the moving party burden at the prima facie stage.to establish a prima facie case,the moving party must raise an inference that the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury because of their membership in a protected class.id.at.the judge may consider all relevant circumstances in making this determination.id.
most significantly for present purposes,batson established that the moving party burden in meeting the prima facie requirement is not substantial.the batson opinion relied on the court earlier title vii jurisprudence to define the operation of the prima facie burden of proof rules.at.among the title vii cases cited in batson was texas department of community affairs burdine,d,in which the court held that the plaintiff burden in establishing a prima facie case of discrimination was not onerous.our precedents reflect the understanding that the burden is not substantial.see united states jesus,cir united states bergodere,cir even more importantly,the supreme court has recently reiterated that the batson prima facie standard is not onerous.see johnson california,d 
in johnson,the supreme court considered whether it was consistent with batson to require the moving party to show,at the prima facie stage,that it was more likely than not that a peremptory challenge had been exercised on a prohibited ground.id.at.the court held that such a standard was at odds with the prima facie inquiry mandated by batson.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court relied exclusively on batson as precedent.it explained that the batson first step was not intended to be so onerous that a defendant would have to persuade the judge that the challenge was more likely than not the product of purposeful discrimination.instead,a defendant satisfies the requirements of batson first step by producing evidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has occurred.id.at.
in holding that aspen had not carried his burden because he had not shown that it was likely that the prosecutor had exercised peremptory challenges on the basis of gender,the appeals court judged aspen prima facie burden by a more rigid standard than that established by batson.batson clearly established that aspen was only required to make a likelihood showing at the final stage of the framework.at.see also purkett elem,d per curiam it is not until the third step of batson that the persuasiveness of the justification becomes step in which the trial court determines whether the opponent of the strike has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.emphasis in original.
the commonwealth argues that the appeals court applied the appropriate standard because the opinion stated that when c onfronted with a claim that a peremptory challenge is being used to exclude members of a discrete group,the judge must determine whether to draw the reasonable inference that peremptory challenges have been exercised on account of their group affiliation.aspen,at.the commonwealth correctly states that an inference of discrimination is the batson prima facie case standard.but it is apparent that the appeals court equated an inference of discrimination with a showing that gender was the likely reason that the prosecutor exercised her peremptory challenges as explained above,batson establishes that the inference of discrimination standard is not so demanding see wade terhune,cir concluding that state appellate court misapplied batson where it understood the inference standard to require the moving party to show a strong likelihood that peremptory challenges were being exercised on an improper basis.
that the appeals court applied a standard that was contrary to clearly established federal law does not automatically entitle the petitioner to relief,however.a writ of habeas corpus will issue only upon a showing that the petitioner is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.this means that a petitioner must show that his underlying detention is unlawful and not just that the state
