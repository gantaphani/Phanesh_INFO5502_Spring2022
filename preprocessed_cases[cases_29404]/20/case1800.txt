after a jury trial,the freddie byers,was convicted of two counts of murder,one count of attempted murder and one count of robbery.the supreme court of indiana affirmed on direct appeal,byers indiana,and,after the indiana court of appeals denied his petition for relief,wl,the indiana supreme court denied transfer.the district court denied byers habeas petition,in which byers argued that his trial counsel performed deficiently.byers superintendent,cv as,wl.we granted byers a certificate of appealability on the question whether he had been denied effective assistance of counsel.we affirm the district court denial because,even if byers successfully exhausted his claim,it lacks merit.
background 
byers was convicted based on the following events.on january,james edison,a guest at bennie spears and almeka dodds house in south bend,opened the door to flint petitioner byers and gill.banter among the men quickly turned serious.dodds,in the next room,heard spears warning flint not to point his gun at spears and then heard it discharge.she entered to see flint,who had visited their home a whole bunch of times,holding a gun and spears shot and wounded on the ground.flint grabbed dodds by the hair and demanded she tell him where the money was,while gill locked dodds children in the bathroom.flint instructed gill to cut edison neck with a kitchen knife and to take dodds to the basement and shoot her in the head.luckily for dodds,gill was unskilled at his first task,and edison attempted an escape out the window.both flint and gill pursued edison and shot him.back in the home,they fired bullets into the basement where dodds hid,but did not hit her.she ran to a neighbor house once she thought her house was clear.the police arrived to find dodds children locked in the bathroom,unharmed.edison and spears died of their wounds.
dodds told the police the shooter she called flint or fred had crooked teeth and a scar on his face.dodds also suggested that the police already had a picture of flint from an incident at flint girlfriend house on the evening of a prize fight.they did have such a photo,and dodds identified flint in an array.
at trial,dodds was the prosecution main witness.no physical evidence or usable fingerprints linked byers to the offense.to demonstrate the errors in dodds initial description of flint,byers walked in front of the jurors to show them that his teeth were straight and his face scarless.during a test run of this walk before the jury entered,the trial judge asked 
what byers anklet thing is that visible byers,come over here please.
it okay.that not so bad.okay.
at an evidentiary hearing in proceedings,byers contended that this anklet thing was a shackle or restraint.at trial,the court made no findings about byers need for shackles or restraints in the courtroom.indeed,there was no discussion of byers wearing restraints in court apart from the comments of the trial judge.
byers trial was interrupted by several spectators outbursts.in a sidebar prior to his opening statement,the prosecutor noted comments from the by the victims families,although the exact words or the identities of the speakers do not appear in the trial the court read the preliminary instructions.the prosecutor suggested that the court admonish the spectators to be respectful byers trial counsel agreed and the court did so after excusing the jury.at his hearing,byers testified that,at this point in the trial,dodds mother and sister said you guilty mother fucker,i hope you fry.we should be having a trial anyway,you know you guilty,you know you did it.things of that nature.byers testified that the jury heard dodds relatives but that he was paying attention to his lawyer at the time and not looking at the jury.later,during dodds testimony,authorities removed dodds brother from the courtroom,possibly for outstanding warrants.dodds mother,jeannie dunlap,reacted by apparently shouting and making a scene and,after excusing the jury,the trial court addressed her and eventually jailed her overnight for contempt of court.byers testified that he knew the jurors heard this incident because their heads turned.after these interruptions and at various points during the trial,after excusing the jury,the judge admonished the spectators to maintain proper courtroom decorum out of respect for the jury difficult job.at his hearing,byers described a third incident,although there is no record of it,when two girls taunted you are going to get found guilty,you gon na get found guilty.byers testified that he was sure that the jury heard them.defense counsel never objected,nor requested jury questioning nor moved for a mistrial based on the disruptions.
byers had not testified at his trial.his lawyer argued that,on the day in question,byers was with his girlfriend,where they were watching movies at byers father house in chicago.byers father and girlfriend corroborated this story.the jury convicted byers on all counts,and he was sentenced to the maximum years imprisonment.as noted,the conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.see byers.
byers collaterally attacked his conviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel and other grounds.at all levels of state review,he asserted an claim based on the failure of trial counsel to address the outbursts at trial the outbursts ground.the courts denied relief on this ground because he failed to show that some of the outbursts occurred or that any juror or prospective juror heard the spectators statements,and,therefore,he failed to prove deficient performance wl,at.in federal habeas proceedings,the district court held that byers claim failed because the outbursts did not call into question byers guilt and because there was no evidence that the jury was prejudicially affected.wl,at.
unlike his outbursts ground,byers was less consistent in his attempt to exhaust his claim based on trial counsel failures to object to byers purported restraints at trial and to demand that the trial judge make findings before allowing byers to appear before the jury in restraints the restraints ground.at an evidentiary hearing before the state trial court,byers submitted a list,including the simple word restraints,of issues his counsel had inadequately addressed.byers also testified that he was in restraints during trial,that his trial counsel did address his request to remove the restraints and that the judge made no findings that restraints were necessary.byers claimed that the trial judge and jury knew he was restrained because he had to walk in front of them when he showed them his teeth.byers,however,did not testify explicitly that the jury saw the restraints.the trial court ordered byers counsel to file a supplemental amended petition to address byers list.in complying,counsel argued that no further evidentiary hearing was warranted and argued that byers restraints issue had no merit 
in this case defendant was required to wear ankle restraints throughout the trial and on at least one occasion,appeared before the jury in those restraints.trial counsel could,and probably should have requested a mistrial based upon the ankle restraint observation by the jury.which is deficient performance on the part of counsel.however,it would be difficult to show any resulting harm at the time it occurred and certainly near impossible at this point in time.such a showing would necessitate contemporaneous voir dire of the jury for existence of any prejudice to the defendant fair trial rights prior to establishing grounds for a mistrial request.such an inquiry can not be made at the present later date the general rule precludes presenting a defendant to the jury in handcuffs or shackles,but a court may need to do so in certain exceptional circumstances when restraint is necessary to prevent the escape of the prisoner,to protect those in the courtroom,or to maintain order.
byers,not satisfied,moved the court to strike the supplemental amended petition and asked for time to find a new counsel.byers failed to find substitute counsel and requested that his counsel continue representation,which had the effect of abandoning his motion his petition was denied.byers indiana,joseph
