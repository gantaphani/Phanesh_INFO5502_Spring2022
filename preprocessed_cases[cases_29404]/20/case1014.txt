in,desmond keith carter was convicted by a state court jury in rockingham county,north carolina,of the separate crimes of capital murder and robbery with a dangerous weapon.the jury recommended that carter be sentenced to death on the murder offense,and the judge imposed the death penalty,plus a consecutive term of forty years imprisonment for the robbery.after an unavailing direct appeal process,carter unsuccessfully sought relief in north carolina.carter then petitioned for federal habeas corpus relief in the middle district of north carolina.he now appeals the district court denial of his habeas corpus petition,contending that the advice of his two attorneys constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.as we explain below,carter sixth amendment claim of ineffective assistance is without merit.we accordingly decline to issue a certificate of appealability,and we dismiss his appeal.
carter was indicted on april,by a rockingham county grand jury,for the stabbing death of his neighbor,helen purdy.he was again indicted,on february,for the robbery of purdy with a dangerous weapon.these crimes occurred during the same episode on march.by carter admissions,he went to purdy home in the early morning hours of that day,carrying a butcher knife and seeking to borrow money to purchase cocaine.although purdy initially agreed to lend carter money,she then changed her mind and refused to do so.carter maintained that when purdy saw the butcher knife,she became excited,attempted to push him,and then fell into the knife.purdy died soon thereafter from thirteen stab wounds.
carter was tried and convicted in the superior court of rockingham county for the murder of purdy,based on two theories premeditation and deliberation,and felony murder.he was also convicted on the related charge of robbery with a dangerous weapon.after the statutorily mandated sentencing proceeding,the jury unanimously recommended that carter be sentenced to the death penalty,which the judge imposed carter was also sentenced to a consecutive prison term for the robbery.
carter initially appealed to the supreme court of north carolina,which,on december,affirmed his convictions and sentences state carter.on may,the supreme court of the united states denied carter request for certiorari.carter north carolina,d.having exhausted his avenues of direct appeal,carter thereafter,on april,filed his motion for appropriate relief the mar,seeking relief in the superior court of rockingham county the pcr court,and asserting five separate claims of error 
in its handling of carter mar,the pcr court initially ruled on four of his five mar claims without conducting an evidentiary hearing.state carter,order denying claims ii,iii,iv and v of defendant motion for appropriate relief on the pleadings,crs,crs,mar order i after conducting an evidentiary hearing on the mar remaining counsel advice to carter that he should testify in his own defense during the guilt phase of his trial was constitutionally ineffective claim i the court also denied relief thereon.state carter,order denying claim i of motion for appropriate relief,crs,crs.july,mar order ii.carter then sought review in the supreme court of north carolina from the pcr court denial of his.that court,however,denied his request for certiorari on may,state carter,and carter did not seek certiorari in the supreme court of the united states 
his proceedings in state court having proven futile,carter then sought federal habeas corpus relief in the middle district of north carolina.in response,the state moved for summary judgment,and on april,a magistrate judge recommended that summary judgment be granted.carter french,recommendation of united states magistrate judge,april.on july,the district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge,granting summary judgment to the state and declining to issue carter a certificate of appealability carter french,order,july.on august,carter filed a timely notice of appeal,and he now seeks issuance of a certificate of appealability and an award of habeas corpus relief.he asserts a single issue that his trial attorneys advice that he should testify in his own defense during the guilt phase of his trial was constitutionally ineffective.
in its opinion of december,rejecting carter direct appeal of his convictions and sentences,the supreme court of north carolina summarized the facts underlying his prosecution and the evidence presented during carter jury trial in rockingham county.we are unable to improve on the factual summary in that opinion,and it is set forth,in haec verba,as follows 
the victim,helen purdy,was a resident of eden,north carolina.she lived alone beside the home of defendant,his grandmother,and his uncle.because of her fragile health,friends and family members took turns looking after and checking in on her.on march gchuther morris,purdy,tried calling purdy all day and became concerned when she did not get an answer.around linda purdy,shirley gray,and ralph carter went to purdy house.they found her dead on her living room floor,lying in a pool of blood.aside from the front door being unlocked,everything in the house generally appeared in order there was no sign of a struggle.in purdy bedroom the bed covers were turned back to one side,as if someone had been lying on the bed,and purdy purse was lying open on the bed.
robert thompson,the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy,found thirteen cut and stab wounds as well as numerous minor cuts and abrasions to purdy hands,neck,and face.the significant findings included two incised or cut wounds in the victim right chest,both with depths of inches,one penetrating the pericardium sac and the other the liver two incised or cut wounds in the left chest with depths of inches and inches,again penetrating the pericardium sac and liver two incised or cut wounds in the left armpit with depths of inches and inches wounds to the back of the left arm,two of which went completely through the arm a small abrasion of the lower lip a superficial long cut in the area of the left ear and a inch cut below the angle of the jaw on the left side scratches and cuts on both wrists a inch cut on the left first finger,described as a defensive wound and a large incised wound in the left side of the neck measuring inches down to the bone.thompson opined that death was caused by the wounds to the chest,none of which would have been instantly fatal.it would have taken several minutes for death to occur.
nadine carter,defendant,carter grandmother,testified that on the morning of march,defendant had called her into his room and told her he needed to go to the hospital.he said he had been accosted by four young white males at the car wash when he was coming home the night before and had been stabbed in the leg.defendant had a towel wrapped around his leg.when carter looked at defendant,she knew something was not right,but she believed his story and did not question him further.she then drove defendant to morehead hospital.
mary hertle,an emergency room employee of morehead hospital,was on duty on march.defendant came to the emergency room around reporting a puncture wound two or three inches deep to the left inner thigh.defendant said four white men had assaulted him at the car wash the previous night.although defendant smelled of alcohol and said he did not come earlier because he was too drunk,hertle observed that defendant did not appear intoxicated or in pain,his speech was not slurred,and he gave what appeared to be appropriate answers to questions.
mark joyce,an eden police officer,also saw defendant at morehead hospital that morning.defendant told him essentially the same story about his leg wound.in joyce opinion,although defendant had been drinking and there was a strong odor of alcohol about him,defendant was not impaired.
greg moore,an eden police department detective,was assigned to investigate the murder.he had seen defendant on crutches on march at the magistrate office and knew defendant was reporting a knife wound to his leg.
detective moore also knew defendant lived beside the victim.at approximately on march,detective moore and sbi agent james bowman interviewed defendant at the rockingham county jail.at that time,defendant was incarcerated on another charge for which he had been arrested on march.in substance,defendant initially gave these officers the following version of the events leading to his leg wound.defendant said three white men had jumped him on monday,march,about or.he had been riding around and drinking with his friends,quentin broadnax and jamel price.after broadnax dropped him off,defendant walked around before stopping at the corner of henry and early streets.defendant said he threw up at this time.defendant then sat on the steps at the ymca for a few hours.he said he may have dozed off.
according to defendant,he had been drinking beer and liquor for most of the day and evening.after leaving the ymca steps,defendant walked up monroe street towards home and was in the car wash parking lot when he saw some people getting into a truck.he could tell they were white males.the truck was directly across the street from purdy house.he said he tried to cut through the lot to avoid them,but they pulled toward him and began shouting obscenities.when defendant hollered back,the men stopped the truck and began chasing him.defendant tried to run,but they caught him,and he was too drunk to defend himself.as one man came up on his left side,defendant tried to kick him but got stabbed in the left leg in the process.
in the course of this interview,detective moore was advised that defendant had a doctor appointment at prior to leaving for the appointment,defendant signed a consent to have a blood sample drawn.following the doctor appointment,moore and bowman again interviewed defendant.prior to commencing the second interview,defendant was told a butcher knife had been found in the lot near his residence.thereafter,defendant confessed to the officers and gave a new statement.detective moore testified that defendant told the officers he went to the home of helen purdy in the early morning hours of march.he had been drinking and using cocaine and wanted to borrow money from purdy.purdy let defendant into her home and initially told him he could borrow five dollars.she then changed her mind and said he could not have any money.purdy then went towards the telephone,whereupon defendant asked her not to call his grandmother.defendant stated that at that point purdy noticed defendant had a knife,and she became excited.she tried to push defendant,and in the process the knife went in her.defendant pulled the knife out and stuck it in his own leg.defendant said he did not know what happened after he cut himself and did not know how many times he stabbed purdy.prior to going home defendant took fifteen dollars that purdy had placed near the telephone and used it to buy cocaine.he then threw the knife into a field next to his house.agent bowman testified that blood drawn from defendant the day after the murder was not tested for alcohol or drug content.
the state introduced a knife found across the street from the murder scene.lieutenant walter johnson testified that the knife was found on the grass in plain view and that no effort had been made to hide it.blood of purdy type was found on the knife.carter identified the knife as one from her kitchen.
denise smith,a girlfriend of defendant at the time of the murder,testified that in the summer of,she asked defendant if he used cocaine or any other drug.defendant said no but told her that if a person is arrested,he should say he was under the influence of drugs and he would get a lighter sentence.after defendant was arrested for purdy murder,smith visited defendant in jail.while in the presence of another detainee,defendant commented he had been to a mental health appointment.when the other detainee mimicked the twilight zone tune,defendant stated,man,i not crazy.
defendant also presented evidence.jamel price,defendant friend,testified that he and defendant spent the day together on march.defendant began drinking at approximately that day.price and defendant visited various establishments in reidsville and price watched defendant consume more than one hundred ounces of beer,some wine,and some liquor.price did not see defendant take drugs,but he was not with him all the time.
another companion,quentin broadnax,gave a similar account.on broadnax said that they went to defendant house before going to reidsville and that he believed defendant got five dollars from carter.
defendant testified in his own behalf.he said he spent the day on march drinking beer,wine,and bootleg whiskey.he also consumed a dollar bag of powder cocaine,a twenty dollar rock of crack cocaine,and two pills which he identified as zannex.during the early morning hours of march,he had wanted to buy cocaine.although he had fifty or sixty dollars on him,he wanted to borrow more so he could get as much cocaine as possible.purdy light was on,so he went to her door to ask for money.the remainder of defendant testimony corresponded with the confession he had given to detective moore and agent bowman.
defendant presented other evidence tending to show that he was mentally impaired at the time of the murder and that he had had a tumultuous childhood.john warren,a clinical psychologist who examined defendant after his arrest,testified that defendant had a low average iq and suffered from a borderline personality disorder as well as a problem.he opined that defendant mental capacity was diminished at the time of the offense,making it very unlikely that he could make and carry out a plan to kill.
during the sentencing phase,the state introduced evidence concerning the facts and circumstances of defendant prior conviction for robbery.darwin neely,the victim of that robbery,testified that in march defendant and three other men abducted him,forced him into a car at gunpoint,stole his money and personal items,and temporarily held him hostage.all four men had guns.the state introduced a certified copy of a judgment from nassau county court,state of new york,which had been entered upon defendant plea of guilty to robbery.defendant served four years in prison for that offense.
defendant evidence tended to show that he was well behaved,kind,and loving.warren testified that defendant was under the influence of emotional disturbance at the time of the crime and that his ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct was impaired.warren found that defendant would benefit from a structured environment,had done well in prison before,and did not have disciplinary problems.lucy moriello,a counselor with the new york department of corrections for eleven years,characterized defendant time in prison in new york as good conduct,with appropriate behavior and no disciplinary problems.
on rebuttal,the state presented evidence of defendant insolence while being held pretrial at the rockingham county jail.
prior to the presentation of any evidence,counsel for defendant conceded that defendant had stabbed and killed purdy,but contended that it was murder,not first.the jury found defendant guilty of murder on the theories of premeditation and deliberation and felony murder.it also found him guilty of robbery with a dangerous weapon.at the capital sentencing proceeding,the jury found as aggravating circumstances that the crime was committed for pecuniary gain and that defendant had been previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence.the jury rejected all proposed statutory mitigating circumstances and found three of the eleven nonstatutory mitigating circumstances submitted.it unanimously recommended a sentence of death,which the trial court accordingly imposed.
state carter.
in addition to the foregoing factual background,certain relevant factual and procedural underpinnings of carter claim of ineffective assistance of counsel are spelled out and discussed in our legal analysis of his constitutional contention.see infra part.
in our consideration of carter claim that he was denied his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel,we must employ the deferential standard of review embodied in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,codified at aedpa.pursuant thereto,a federal court may not award habeas corpus relief with respect to a claim previously adjudicated on its merits in a state court proceeding unless the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or unless the state court adjudication was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.
as the supreme court recently explained,a state court adjudication is contrary to clearly established federal law only if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the supreme court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the supreme court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.williams taylor,d.a state court decision unreasonably applies clearly established federal law if it unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.significantly,findings of fact by a state court are entitled to a presumption of correctness that a petitioner,such as carter,must rebut by clear and convincing evidence.see e.
carter contention that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel is one that is governed by clearly established federal by the supreme court decision in strickland washington,d.in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim under strickland,a petitioner must satisfy a test.first of all,the petitioner must demonstrate that counsel performance was deficient,meaning counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.id.at.second,he must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense,that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.id.
in considering a sixth amendment ineffectiveness claim,a reviewing court does not grade the lawyer trial performance it examines only whether his conduct was reasonable under prevailing professional norms,and in light of the circumstances.id.at.because it may be tempting to find an unsuccessful trial strategy to be unreasonable,a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that is,the defendant must overcome the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.id.at.and as our judge murnaghan rightly recognized several years ago,the advice provided by a criminal defense lawyer on whether his client should testify is a paradigm of the type of tactical decision that can not be challenged as evidence of ineffective assistance.hutchins garrison,cir,cert.denied,d see also jones murray,cir reiterating principle that advice to testify is paradigmatic of strategic decision lane,cir concluding that counsel advice not to testify,based in part on erroneous belief that defendant could be impeached by prior conviction,was not deficient performance united states,d,absent evidence of coercion,legal advice concerning the defendant right to testify does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.
with these controlling legal principles in mind,we turn to the sole issue raised by carter in this habeas corpus proceeding,his claim that he was denied his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel in his state court trial in north carolina.
carter makes two separate contentions in support of his claim that his lawyers advice was constitutionally defective.first,he maintains that his lawyers failed to apprise him of the disadvantages of testifying in his own defense.second,carter maintains that his lawyers offered erroneous advice that forced him to testify in contravention of his right against.in addressing these separate aspects of his sixth amendment claim,we will first review the relevant underpinnings of that claim.we will then assess whether the performance of carter lawyers was constitutionally deficient.
as we discussed earlier,the pcr court conducted a full evidentiary hearing on carter mar claim i,that erroneous advice provided by his trial attorneys constituted ineffective assistance of counsel during this evidentiary hearing,evidence was adduced regarding carter trial representation,including the testimony of his two defense lawyers,thomas medlin,and douglas hux.medlin and hux each possessed experience in the defense of capital murder cases in north carolina.hux had practiced law for approximately years,and medlin had been in practice for nearly ten years.after considering the evidence,the pcr court found,inter alia,that both attorneys had met and consulted with carter on numerous occasions,and that they had researched and investigated the possibility of a diminished capacity defense.they each advised carter that his best possible defense and,as carter conceded in his mar,his only defense was diminished mental capacity.mar order ii at.this diminished capacity defense was premised in part on carter consumption of alcohol,cocaine and other impairing substances prior to going to the home of the victim.id.medlin had also consulted with the death penalty resource center and learned attorneys with that agency agreed with this strategy.id.to assist them in developing carter diminished capacity defense,the lawyers had hired a licensed psychologist,john warren,to evaluate carter mental status.
the pcr court found that medlin had determined that a diminished capacity defense would apply to both the murder charge and the robbery charge since both are specific intent offenses.id.at.according to the pcr court,medlin knew that,as a practical matter,he could present the diminished capacity defense through warren testimony,without putting carter on the witness stand.id.at.nonetheless,after careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of such a course of action,medlin advised carter that he should testify in his own defense during the trial guilt phase.
in making the decision to render this advice,medlin had weighed the already unsuccessful efforts the lawyers had made to suppress carter various conflicting statements,and he had also assessed the fact that carter admissions to the authorities would be utilized by the state in its.in addition,both lawyers realized that carter contradictory admissions and claims concerning his actions in connection with the death of purdy created serious credibility problems.they also realized that these problems had to be favorably resolved in order for carter diminished capacity defense to succeed.medlin had concluded that the defense utilization of warren to testify to the substances carter had consumed would,standing alone,carry less weight with the jury than carter own testimony.indeed,medlin believed that carter could and needed to explain the contradictions in his statements to the jury in order to repair his credibility and to put him in a position to lay a credible foundation for the amount of impairing substances he consumed the night of the murder.id.significantly,the pcr court,in its consideration of the lawyers advice that carter should testify,found that 
this was a strategic decision medlin and hux made and they consulted with carter on the issue and gave him their best advice on the issue.in the course of representing carter,medlin and hux determined he was likeable and easy to talk to and they felt he would come across that way to the jury if he did well on the stand.this would also be a way to humanize carter in the eyes of the jury.
in the first of the two aspects of carter ineffective assistance contention,he maintains that his lawyers failed to consult with him on both the advantages and disadvantages of his testifying in his own defense.this contention is without legal merit,however,for a very simple reason the pcr court explicitly found otherwise in its mar order ii.the pcr court,after conducting its thorough evidentiary hearing on mar claim i,found that the relevant advantages and disadvantages of testifying were in fact discussed with carter,as was th
