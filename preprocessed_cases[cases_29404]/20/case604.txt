factual history 
on february,james washington,willie johnson,romont waddy,and james taylor set out to rob a dollar express store at which taylor worked.they met around midnight and drove to the store at around am.washington drove the four men in a vehicle owned by one of his family members.washington and taylor remained in the vehicle while waddy and johnson entered the store.upon encountering two store employees in the loading dock,johnson shot and killed both.johnson divided money removed from a safe and the men left the premises.
shortly thereafter,taylor surrendered to police,gave a statement,and agreed to testify against the other men in exchange for a reduced sentence.taylor identified washington as the driver.waddy also gave a statement to the police on march,and identified washington as the driver.he added that washington,after hearing the shots,entered the store and helped remove cash from the safe.
johnson,waddy,and washington were tried jointly before a jury in the court of common pleas of philadelphia county in october and november.taylor testified on october,identified all of the coconspirators,and discussed in detail their roles in the crime.he clearly and repeatedly identified washington as the driver of the car.on,washington counsel pointed out significant inconsistencies in taylor story,in addition to his history of substance abuse and admitted heavy impairment from drugs at the time of the incident in question.four days later,on october,detective john cummings testified.after the trial judge gave a limiting instruction,cummings read a redacted version of waddy confession over washington objection.the jury never saw the original or redacted copy of the confession.cummings reading deleted johnson and washington names or nicknames each time they were used they were replaced with phrases such as the guy who went into the store and the driver.
washington argued to the jury that he could not have been guilty because he had an alibi for the time of the robbery.the evidence of this alibi was conflicting.the jury found washington guilty,and the trial judge sentenced washington to two consecutive life terms of incarceration for the murders and a concurrent term of ten to twenty years incarceration for conspiracy.
procedural history 
the superior court of pennsylvania affirmed washington conviction,and the supreme court of pennsylvania denied washington appeal.in january,washington challenged his convictions under the pennsylvania post conviction relief act pcra,alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and a number of violations of his constitutional rights.the pcra court denied his petition and the superior court affirmed,writing that there was no violation of washington confrontation clause rights under the blanket rule set out in commonwealth travers.the pennsylvania supreme court denied his appeal.
on june,washington filed a federal habeas corpus petition in the eastern district of pennsylvania.a magistrate judge initially reviewed washington petition and recommended denying the petition on the merits.before the district court,washington raised eleven objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendations.the district court sustained one of these objections regarding washington rights under the confrontation clause,and granted a conditional writ of habeas corpus.the commonwealth appealed from that decision.
this court heard the appeal on may,and issued a precedential opinion on august.in that opinion,we highlighted bruton holding that a criminal defendant is deprived of his right to confrontation when a nontestifying codefendant confession names him,regardless of whether the judge has given the jury a limiting instruction.although juries are generally presumed able to follow instructions about the applicability of the evidence,the court in bruton determined that a nontestifying codefendants sic confession that names the defendant poses too great a risk that the jury will use the evidence to determine the guilt or of someone other than the confessor.washington sec y.dep t of,cir cert.granted,judgment vacated sub nom.wetzel washington.citing bruton united states.we pointed out that the redacted statement of the nontestifying codefendant in richardson marsh,had eliminated any mention of the defendant name or her existence and did not violate the confrontation clause because jurors are more likely to be able to follow a limiting instruction when the confession was not incriminating on its face.washington,at quoting richardson,at.after discussing the redaction of waddy confession,we concluded that no reasonable reading of bruton,richardson,and gray can tolerate a redaction that the trial judge knew at the time of introduction would be transparent to the jurors.taylor testimony clearly and explicitly identified washington as the driver.replacing washington name with the driver was,as counsel stated,tantamount to using washington name.washington,at.we held that the district court properly granted washington habeas relief because a the pennsylvania superior court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law when it concluded that the trial court had properly admitted into evidence redacted nontestifying coconspirator testimony and b that error substantially and injuriously affected washington case.id.at.we then affirmed the district court order and instructed the commonwealth to either release or retry washington within days.the commonwealth was subsequently granted a writ of certiorari by the supreme court of the united states,which vacated this court judgment and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of white woodall.we requested supplemental briefing and reargument from the parties in light of the supreme court decision.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and this court has jurisdiction over the district court order granting the conditional writ of habeas corpus pursuant to and a.we conduct a plenary review of the district court legal conclusion that the state court decision was an unreasonable application of federal law as established by the holdings of the supreme court of the united states.lambert blackwell,cir.
washington seeks relief on the ground that his sixth amendment rights were violated by the state court admission of a codefendant improperly redacted confession and argues that we are not precluded from granting relief under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,because the state court admission of this confession was an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent.d.the commonwealth argues that,in light of white,we must now consider whether the state court analysis of washington confrontation clause claim was a reasonable application of that precedent.washington argues that he is entitled to relief,even.as directed by the supreme court,we now reconsider washington claim for federal habeas relief in light of white.
in this case we must determine whether the pennsylvania superior court unreasonably applied federal law as established by the holdings of the supreme court of the united states.this standard is difficult to meet.metrish lancaster,internal quotation marks omitted.in this context,clearly established law signifies the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions.howes fields,internal quotation marks omitted.and an unreasonable application of those holdings must be objectively unreasonable,not merely wrong even clear error will not suffice.white.at internal quotation marks omitted.instead,the state prisoner must show that the state court ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington richter.however,a pplying a general standard to a specific case can demand a substantial element of judgment.as a result,evaluating whether a rule application was unreasonable requires considering the rule specificity.the more general the rule,the more leeway courts have in reaching outcomes in determinations.yarborough alvarado.
the pertinent federal law at issue is the sixth amendment right of a criminal defendant to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.the contours of this right as relevant to washington petition were established in three supreme court cases bruton united states,richardson marsh,and gray maryland.
in bruton,a postal inspector testified at trial that one codefendant,evans,confessed to committing an armed robbery and had named his codefendant bruton as his accomplice.the trial judge instructed the jury that although evans confession was competent evidence against evans it was inadmissible hearsay against petitioner and therefore had to be disregarded in determining petitioner guilt or innocence.bruton,at.the bruton court held that a criminal defendant is deprived of his constitutional right to confrontation when a codefendant confession naming him as a participant in the crime is introduced at their joint trial,regardless of whether the judge has given the jury a limiting instruction to consider the confession only with regards to the confessor.at.in short,the court recognized a narrow exception to the presumption that a jury will follow the instructions of the trial court,richardson,at,noting that under these circumstances the risk that a jury will not or can not,follow the instructions is so great and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant,that the practical and human limitations of the jury system can not be ignored.bruton,at.
next,in richardson,one codefendant confession to an assault and murder that was given to police was admitted at the codefendants joint trial.the confession was redacted to omit all reference to clarissa marsh,one of the other codefendants being tried at that time.richardson,at.further,the jury was given a limiting instruction to not use the confession in any way against the other codefendants,including marsh.id.at.marsh objected to the confession admission under bruton as a violation of her right to confrontation.the richardson court held that the confrontation clause is not violated by the admission of a nontestifying codefendant confession with a proper limiting instruction when,as here,the confession is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant name,but any reference to his or her existence.id.at.when a confession has been completely sanitized in this fashion,the richardson court explained,a judge instruction may well be successful and there does not exist the overwhelming probability that a jury will be unable to disregard the incriminating statement.id.at.
most recently came gray.there,a codefendant confession to beating a person to death was admitted after it was redacted by substituting a blank space or the word deleted for the defendants names.gray,at.when the confession was read in court,the detective who read it into evidence said the words deleted or deletion whenever either of the codefendants names appeared.id.one of the codefendants challenged the admission of the confession into evidence,despite the judge giving a limiting instruction.
the gray court took the opportunity to delineate the boundaries of the exception to the constitutional right to confrontation.it wrote that in gray,unlike richardson redacted confession,this confession refers directly to the existence of the nonconfessing defendant.id.at.it held that,
redaction that replaces a defendant name with an obvious indication of deletion still falls within bruton protective rule redactions that simply replace a name with an obvious blank space or other similarly obvious indications of alteration,however,leave statements that,considered as a class,so closely resemble bruton unredacted statements that,in our view,the law must require the same result.
id.this is because the obvious deletion may well call the jurors attention specially to the removed name and is directly accusatory.id.at.justice scalia in dissent noted that t oday the court extends bruton to confessions that have been redacted to delete the defendant name.id.at.
taken together,the current state of the law is that there is a confrontation clause violation when a codefendant confession is introduced that names another codefendant,bruton,at,or that refers directly to the existence of the codefendant in a manner that is directly accusatory,gray,u.at.that is because such statements present a substantial risk that the jury,despite instructions to the contrary,will look to the incriminating extrajudicial statements in determining the defendant guilt.bruton,at.but there is no violation if the confession is properly redacted to omit any reference at all to the codefendant,making it more likely that the jury will be able to follow the court instruction to disregard this evidence in rendering its verdict.richardson,at.it is against this background that we assess whether the pennsylvania superior court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.
in many cases,the decisions of lower courts on bruton issues are close calls that can not be said to unreasonably apply clearly established federal law.they are subject to fairminded disagreement.this is not one of those cases.in our view,the confession that detective cummings read during his testimony was insufficiently redacted and the pennsylvania superior court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law when it affirmed its admission into evidence.the superior court applied a blanket rule,derived from commonwealth travers,that any redaction that would require a juror to consider an additional piece of information outside the confession in order to identify the coconspirator being referred to automatically falls inside the realm of richardson.see app.at.this is not a reasonable view of the law and would permit the admission of many facially incriminating confessions,in direct contradiction of the rules clearly established in the trilogy.for instance,gray expressly instructs that the redaction can not use descriptive terms,at,can not replace the defendant name with any kind of symbol,id.at,and can not replace the defendant name with an obvious indication of deletion,id.at.the redacted confession in this case utilizes each of those proscribed methods.it replaces washington name with the phrase the driver in some instances.see.driver in this context is a noun used to describe the role that washington played in the robbery it is used to identify and describe a particular actor,much like a name or title.furthermore,it is a kind of obvious indication of deletion or alteration to replace a name that is mysteriously absent.the reference to jimmy in the confession arouses suspicion or confusion when the other participants are called the guy who went into the store with jimmy and the driver,though waddy stated that he knew jimmy for like a good couple of years while he knew the driver for a long time,like ten years.this is such an obvious indication of alteration that it function s the same way grammatically.it is directly accusatory,gray,at,and leave s a statement that so closely resemble s bruton unredacted statements,id.at,that allowing its admission is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.this obvious deletion may well call the jurors attention specially to the removed name,id.at,the antipode of the intended result of the redaction.
furthermore,gray instructs that these rules apply to instances where more than one name is redacted,id.at,and the rules a
