habeas corpus petitioner keith mountjoy argues that his convictions for sexual assault and burglary must be set aside because the new hampshire judge who presided over his trial did not advise him about his defense counsel possible conflict of interest and make an appropriate inquiry on the record,thereby violating his sixth amendment right to counsel.federal review of habeas petitions is governed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d supp.ii.under the standards of aedpa,the district court denied mountjoy petition,finding that the underlying decision of the new hampshire supreme court was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states.we affirm.
the facts in this case are not disputed.in,keith mountjoy was charged with aggravated felonious sexual assault and burglary.the victim was bound and raped by a man who came into her apartment in the early hours of january.one of the government witnesses was dennis pratte,a police officer for the town of newmarket who responded when the victim son called the police.officer pratte testified about interviewing the victim and collecting physical evidence.he gave testimony favorable to mountjoy,reporting that the victim said she could not identify her attacker on the morning after she was raped.
mountjoy first and second trials ended in hung juries.defense counsel stephen jeffco represented mountjoy at both trials,and officer pratte testified for the government at both.in january jeffco agreed to defend officer pratte against charges of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter.shortly before mountjoy third trial began on april,jeffco told the trial judge that he was representing pratte,who was then awaiting trial.jeffco said he did not think the simultaneous representation of mountjoy and pratte posed a conflict of interest for him.the prosecutor agreed.jeffco also informed the court that he had told mountjoy he was serving as pratte lawyer,and that mountjoy wanted jeffco to continue representing him.jeffco disclosure to the court took place in an unrecorded conference.mountjoy was not present,and the judge did not speak to him about jeffco possible conflict of interest.mountjoy did not object to jeffco representation at trial.
while the record does not include transcripts of the first two trials,mountjoy does not dispute that pratte gave essentially the same testimony at the third trial that he had given at the first two,and that jeffco him in much the same way.pratte testimony was again helpful to the defense in his closing argument to the jury,jeffco generally criticized pratte police department for its investigation of the crime,particularly because of its failure to follow up on a lead about a possible second suspect.
on april,the jury convicted mountjoy of both charges.the court imposed a to year sentence.on may,mountjoy filed a pro se motion for judgment of acquittal on the ground that his counsel had a conflict of interest.the trial court appointed a public defender to represent mountjoy during proceedings.in february,the public defender filed a motion to set aside the verdict based on the court failure to inquire into jeffco conflict of interest and ineffective assistance of counsel.the trial court held a hearing on the matter on august.mountjoy testified that jeffco did not tell him about the simultaneous representation of officer pratte.in a deposition,jeffco said that he told mountjoy he was representing pratte during a brief conversation on the steps of the courthouse just before the beginning of the third trial.jeffco said he did not specifically remember mountjoy response,but that mountjoy had consented to the concurrent representation.when asked about his of pratte,jeffco said he did not try to impeach pratte because pratte testimony was exculpatory.
the trial court denied mountjoy motion for a new trial.the court found that mountjoy knew about the concurrent representation,that jeffco had defended the case in the same way at the third trial as he had at the first and second ones,and that the defense would have called pratte as a witness because of his exculpatory testimony had the government not done so.the court acknowledged that it should have discussed jeffco representation of pratte with mountjoy before trial,but held that its failure to do so did not warrant reversal.the court also denied mountjoy claim that jeffco did not provide mountjoy effective assistance of counsel because of the possible conflict.
mountjoy appealed to the new hampshire supreme court.in a published opinion,the court denied relief.see state mountjoy.mountjoy filed a petition for habeas relief in state court on july,the lower state court held a hearing on september,and denied relief on september.the new hampshire supreme court declined to hear mountjoy collateral appeal.mountjoy filed a habeas petition in federal court on january,seeking collateral review of three claims the trial judge failure to discuss with him before trial his right to representation,ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,and delay in processing his state court appeal.after the district court denied the petition on all three grounds,it granted mountjoy request for a certificate of appealability as to whether the trial court proceedings violated mountjoy constitutional right to counsel.
aedpa amended the federal law governing review of habeas petitions.in relevant part,the statute provides that 
d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.
d.aedpa places a new constraint on the power of a federal habeas court to grant a state prisoner application for a writ of habeas corpus.williams taylor,d.under the statute,we focus the lens of our inquiry on the state court decision and ask whether the court application of the analytic framework dictated by the relevant supreme court precedents was objectively unreasonable or contrary to that law.see williams matesanz,cir.
aedpa contrary to and unreasonable application clauses yield two separate categories of analysis.taylor,at.dubois,cir.a state court decision is contrary to federal law as determined by the supreme court,and so may be set aside on federal habeas review,if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in our cases or confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of this court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent.taylor,at.
alternately,a state court decision may be set aside as an unreasonable application of federal law as determined by the supreme court if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from this court cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner case,or if the state court either unreasonably extends a legal principle from our precedent to a new context where it should not apply or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to a new context where it should apply.id.at.in defining an unreasonable application of federal law,the court said that the most important point is that an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.id.at.emphasis in original.thus under aedpa,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.
in mountjoy case,the relevant state court decision for review under aedpa is the new hampshire supreme court decision on direct appeal in state mountjoy.as the new hampshire court recognized,the governing supreme court precedents for mountjoy claim that the trial court failure to advise him about jeffco possible conflict of interest violated his sixth amendment rights are holloway arkansas,d cuyler sullivan,d and wood georgia,d.to the extent that inferior federal courts have decided factually similar cases,reference to those decisions is appropriate in assessing the reasonableness vel non under aedpa of the state court treatment of the contested issue,at.
the new hampshire supreme court neither applied a rule that contradicted the supreme court holdings in these cases nor reached a different result based on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.thus aedpa contrary to clause does not apply here.see taylor,at.a decision applying the correct legal rule from our cases to the facts of a prisoner case would not fit comfortably within d contrary to clause matesanz,at a state court decision that applies the correct legal rule but reaches an independent outcome on different facts can not be deemed to run at cross purposes to supreme court precedent.we thus turn to aedpa second inquiry whether the new hampshire court unreasonably applied holloway,sullivan,and wood to the facts of mountjoy case.this reduces to a question of whether the state court derivation of a rule from the court generally relevant jurisprudence appears objectively reasonable,at.
relevant supreme court precedents 
the sixth amendment guarantees a defendant right to counsel in all criminal prosecutions.const.amend.vi.defendants have a correlative right to representation that is free from conflicts of interest.wood,at.even if defense counsel has a conflict,however,the court may sometimes allow the attorney to continue with the representation if the defendant makes a voluntary,knowing,and intelligent waiver.see wheat united states,d district courts have substantial latitude in declining to grant waivers holloway,at.a defendant may waive his right to representation that is unhindered by a conflict of interests.the purpose of a trial court inquiry into a possible conflict is to evaluate the conflict and ensure it is either eliminated or waived.united states rogers,cir.the inquiry thus includes an discussion of the representation with the defendant.c t he court shall promptly inquire with respect to such joint representation and shall personally advise each defendant of the right to the effective assistance of counsel,including separate representation.when courts do not obtain a waiver to counsel and even sometimes when they do,defendants may challenge the representation on appeal by bringing an ineffective assistance claim.see wheat,at.
the extent of the trial court responsibility to make an inquiry into the defendant understanding of a possible conflict is the subject of the supreme court decisions in holloway,sullivan,and wood.in holloway,one defense lawyer represented three.in motions and at trial,the lawyer repeatedly objected to the joint representation,telling the judge that his conflicting loyalties to his clients hindered his ability to advocate for them.the judge refused to appoint separate counsel and did not adequately inquire into the risk posed by the conflict.holloway,at.on appeal,the supreme court held that the sixth amendment requires automatic reversal of a conviction whenever a trial court improperly requires joint representation over timely objection.id.at.holloway premised its holding on the shared responsibility of the trial court and defense counsel to prevent conflicts from infringing on the defendant sixth amendment rights.id.at.
in sullivan,the court considered two questions left open in holloway whether a state trial judge must inquire about multiple representation even though no party objects at trial,and whether the mere possibility of a conflict means that a defendant sixth amendment rights were violated.sullivan,at.emphasizing defense counsel ethical obligation to advise a trial court when a conflict arises,the court said that when defense counsel does not alert the court to a conflict by objecting,nothing in our precedents suggests that the sixth amendment requires state courts themselves to initiate inquiries into the propriety of multiple representation in every case.id.at.at the same time,the court left open some possibility,albeit a narrow one,that holloway may apply without an objection by the defendant.
absent special circumstances,therefore,trial courts may assume either that multiple representation entails no conflict or that the lawyer and his clients knowingly accept such risk of conflict as may exist unless the trial court knows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists,the court need not initiate an inquiry.
id.at.footnotes omitted.
addressing the relationship between a possible conflict and a sixth amendment violation,sullivan next held that when a defendant does not object to a possible conflict and the trial judge is not otherwise alerted to such a conflict,the defendant must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.id.at.this showing of harm need not,however,rise to the level of prejudice.instead,prejudice is presumed when counsel is burdened by an actual conflict of interest.strickland washington,d.this presumption means that a defendant need not show that he would not have been convicted but for choices his lawyer made because of conflicting loyalties.sullivan,at.instead,the necessary showing might involve failure to a witness whose testimony favored one defendant in a joint representation over the other.id.at.
in wood georgia,in an unusual factual context,the court again addressed the question of a trial court responsibility to inquire about a possible conflict.in wood,three employees of an adult theater and bookstore were convicted of distributing obscene materials and sentenced to probation on the condition that they make installment payments toward and fines.the defendants defaulted on their payments,saying that they had expected their employer to pay the fines for them.the supreme court granted certiorari to determine whether imprisoning a probationer because he can not pay a fine violates the equal protection clause.wood,at.after hearing the case,however,the court decided it on a different due process ground.the court noted that the employer lawyer had represented the defendants throughout the proceedings against them,and that this lawyer did not challenge the amount of the fines imposed at sentencing.id.at.the trial court was aware of these circumstances and the prosecutor raised the question of whether they gave rise to a conflict of interest.id.at.
based on the record,the court concluded that a possible conflict of interest was sufficiently apparent to impose upon the court a duty to inquire further.id.at.in response to the dissent argument that the majority had gone beyond sullivan,the court said 
nothing in that case rules out the raising of a problem that is apparent in the record.moreover,sullivan mandates a reversal when the trial court has failed to make an inquiry even though it knows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists.
id.at.quoting sullivan,at.
wood thus emphasized that trial judges have a duty to inquire not only when defendants object to a possible conflict,but also when trial judges are or should be independently aware of a possible conflict.yet the wood court did not impose the remedy of a new trial based on the trial judge failure to make the required inquiry,despite the language from its own footnote about sullivan mandating reversal under such circumstances.moreover,without discussing the implications for holloway s rule of automatic reversal,the court remanded the case for a hearing to determine whether the conflict of interest that this record strongly suggests actually existed.id.at.
not surprisingly,the circuit courts have ruled differently in the wake of wood about the type of remedy that is triggered when the trial court has a duty to inquire about a possible conflict and fails to do so.some courts have reversed for a new trial whenever the possibility of a conflict was sufficiently apparent to impose a duty to inquire.see riggs united states,cir united states cook,c
