jimmy appeals the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed under.he alleges that the bureau of prisons bop has wrongly interpreted b,thereby depriving him of the possibility to earn a maximum of days of good conduct time for each of the ten years he has been sentenced to serve.finding the gct statute to be ambiguous under chevron,natural res.def.council,d,and the bop interpretation reasonable,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
is currently serving year nine of a sentence,imposed after he pleaded guilty to one count of violating a possession with intent to distribute two kilograms of cocaine,and one count of violating c possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime.for each year of his incarceration,has earned the maximum amount of good conduct time gct available under the gct statute,b,as interpreted by the bop.the bop estimates that if continues this good conduct,he will earn a total of days gct to be credited towards his sentence.this calculation is based on days of earned gct per year for each complete year actually has served,plus a prorated amount of gct for the last portion of the year he actually serves.alleges,however,that he is entitled to days of gct under b.this difference arises from the fact that the bop calculates gct based on the time the prisoner actually serves,and urges that b requires that gct be calculated based on the time the prisoner is sentenced to serve.the bop method of calculation is set forth in program statement,which is part of its sentencing computation manual.through a series of examples,the program statement applies a formula which essentially multiplies the number of days served by which is for a prisoner who has earned the maximum amount of gct possible.this formula has the effect of awarding a maximum of days gct for each full year actually served,and a prorated amount of gct for each portion of a year actually served,based on a rate of days of gct per days in a year 
the bop has also promulgated a rule,using the notice and comment procedure of the administrative procedure act,which reflects its interpretation of term of imprisonment as time served for purposes of calculating gct.see.that rule states that p ursuant to b,an inmate earns days credit toward service of sentence good conduct time credit for each year served.
thus,since both the program statement and are premised on the bop interpretation of term of imprisonment in b to mean time served,we must decide whether it is permissible for the bop to interpret term of imprisonment to mean time served rather than sentence imposed.
ii.discussion 
when we are asked to review an agency construction of a statute that it administers,we review that agency interpretation de novo,subject to established principles of deference,and begin with the language of the statute.see goldings winn,cir.the statute at issue here,b,provides that 
a prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than year,other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of a prisoner life,may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner sentence,beyond the time served,of up to days at the end of each year of the prisoner term of imprisonment,beginning at the end of the first year of the term,subject to determination by the bop that,during that year,the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations c redit for the last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.
thus,at the end of each year,a prisoner conduct is evaluated,and if the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations,the bop may award the prisoner credit of up to days at the end of each year of the prisoner term of imprisonment.see b.
judicial review of b 
to evaluate the bop interpretation of term of imprisonment as used in the gct statute to mean time served,we look to the familiar test enunciated in chevron,natural res.def.council,d.first,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,we must ascertain whether congress had an intention on the precise question at issue.id.at.if the answer to this inquiry is yes,then that intention is the law and must be given effect.see id.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
language of the statute 
in step one of our chevron analysis,we must ascertain whether congress has spoken on the precise question at issue,at.we begin with the actual language of the statute,and ask whether the phrase term of imprisonment has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in this case.see duckworth pratt whitney,cir quoting robinson shell oil,d.because congress has chosen not to define the phrase term of imprisonment in the statute itself,we can look to the dictionary for clarification of the plain meaning of the words selected by congress.see united states lachman,cir dictionaries of the english language are a fundamental tool in ascertaining the plain meaning of terms used in statutes and regulations.webster third new international dictionary defines term as a limited or definite extent of time the time for which something lasts.it defines imprisonment as constraint of a person either by force or by such other coercion as restrains him within limits against his will.the dictionary does little to resolve the ambiguity posed here.
statute as a whole 
having determined that the plain language of the statute,standing alone,is ambiguous,we next ask whether this ambiguity can be resolved by looking to the specific context in which the language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson,at.contrary to contention,and the conclusion of the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin in white scibana,d,rev,white scibana,cir,the phrase term of imprisonment is used inconsistently throughout.for example,in a,term of imprisonment plainly refers to the sentence imposed.that section states that each prisoner shall be released by the bop on the date of the expiration of the prisoner term of imprisonment,less any time credited toward the service of the prisoner sentence.a.plainly,if the bop is instructed to deduct time credited from the term of imprisonment,then the term of imprisonment can only mean the sentence imposed.see a.
we compare the use of the phrase term of imprisonment in a with the use of that same phrase in d.in d,the phrase term of imprisonment is plainly used to mean time served.that section states upon the release of a prisoner on the expiration of the prisoner term of imprisonment,the bop shall furnish the prisoner with suitable clothing,an amount of money not to exceed,and transportation.d.plainly,congress intended the prisoner be furnished with these items upon release after completion of his time served.see d see also loeffler bureau of prisons,wl,at,i t would make no sense to provide these amenities at a time when the prisoner original imposed sentence had date that would obviously occur after the prisoner had been released based on the good time credits.
legislative history 
after finding that the statute as a whole does not resolve the ambiguity,we next check the legislative history of the statute to confirm our conclusion.see summit inv.dev.leroux,cir t he congressional intendment conveyed by unclear statutory language may be discernible from its legislative history.
an earlier gct statute,repealed,was in effect in various forms from until,at which time congress codified the current gct statute as part of the comprehensive crime control act ccca.see,stat codified as amended in scattered sections of,and.the legislative history of the repealed gct statute reveals a clear congressional intent to calculate gct based on the sentence imposed rather than the time served.see,reprinted in,discussing amendment to intended in part to reverse a court decision interpreting the statute as requiring gct to be calculated based on time served ra
