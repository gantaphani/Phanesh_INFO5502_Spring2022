harold clarke,director of the virginia department of corrections,appeals the federal habeas corpus order vacating rashaad tiwania jones convictions and sentence.see jones clarke,d.for the following reasons,we vacate that portion of the order granting habeas relief and remand for dismissal of the petition 
jones waived his jury trial right,and a virginia state judge convicted him on charges of grand larceny and breaking and entering.both charges arose from the theft of a television from the home of jereme joseph.during trial,the commonwealth presented two witnesses,joseph and police investigator karen shuler.jones did not testify or present evidence.the incriminating evidence against jones was and is essentially unchallenged.
joseph testified that in january,while he was temporarily relocated from his williamsburg,virginia,house because it had flooded,someone broke a window in the back of the house and stole a television and other items from the bedroom.approximately one month earlier,jones had visited joseph house with a mutual friend.during that visit,jones entered through the front door and remained in the family room.
after the theft occurred and jones had been arrested,jones called joseph on the telephone.in response,joseph visited jones at jail and told him that his house had been broken into and the police knew he committed the crimes because they had his fingerprints.joseph asked jones why he did it,and jones responded that he made a mistake or whatever and that what happened.see also jones just said it happened basically like that.
investigator shuler testified that she investigated the at joseph house.she determined that the thief entered the house through the broken window,and she lifted several fingerprints from the window area.during her testimony,the commonwealth introduced into evidence a fingerprint analysis certificate that indicated one of the fingerprints belonged to jones.investigator shuler did not analyze the fingerprint or prepare the certificate,but jones trial counsel did not object to the admission of the certificate or her testimony.
in her closing argument,jones trial counsel argued that the case was highly circumstantial and that the fingerprint was the only item that connected jones to the crime.the trial judge acknowledged that the fingerprint evidence,without more,was insufficient to convict jones.however,the judge explained that jones statement to joseph that he made a mistake is an admission of guilt that he admits that he was there,that he was involved in it.continuing,the judge stated that he suspected that other people may have also been involved in the crimes,but jones was certainly there and a participant.the judge then noted that when you take the fingerprint and combine it with the recent visit and you combine it with the statement,the evidence is sufficient to find jones guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of breaking and entering and grand larceny.jones counsel responded by arguing that jones mistake comment could mean a number of things,but the judge rejected her interpretation,stating my interpretation is the fact was he acknowledged that it was a mistake,that he participated in this.that a finding of fact.
the trial judge sentenced jones to two consecutive year imprisonment terms but suspended years,resulting in a year sentence.the virginia appellate courts denied jones direct appeal,and the state supreme court denied his state habeas petition.
pursuant to,jones then filed this federal habeas petition.pertinent to this appeal,the district court granted habeas relief on one claim.specifically,the court concluded that the supreme court of virginia unreasonably applied strickland washington,d,in rejecting jones ineffective assistance of counsel claim.generally speaking,the court determined that trial counsel failure to object to the admission of the fingerprint evidence constituted deficient performance that prejudiced jones.see generally melendez diaz massachusetts,d explaining sixth amendment confrontation right regarding laboratory analyst accordingly,the court vacated jones convictions and sentence.we review the order granting habeas relief de novo.richardson branker,cir.
the essence of an claim is that counsel unprofessional errors so upset the adversarial balance between defense and prosecution that the trial was rendered unfair and the verdict rendered suspect.kimmelman morrison,d.in strickland,at,the court identified two necessary components of an ineffective assistance claim first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.this requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment.second,the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.this requires showing that counsel errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial,a trial whose result is reliable.
the supreme court of virginia adjudicated jones ineffective assistance claim on the merits.the court noted that jones argued the fingerprint evidence was inadmissible without the testimony of the fingerprint analyst,an objection by his counsel to the admission of the fingerprint evidence would have been sustained,and the remaining evidence against him would be insufficient to support the conviction.however,the court rejected this claim,finding that jones failed to demonstrate that counsel performance was deficient or that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel alleged errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.
because the state supreme court adjudicated jones claim on the merits,a federal court may not grant habeas relief unless the adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.this is a difficult to meet and highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings,which demands that decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.cullen pinholster,d internal punctuation and citations omitted.
for purposes of this appeal,the pivotal question is whether the state court application of the strickland standard was unreasonable.harrington richter,d.under d,an unreasonable application of federal law differs from an incorrect application of federal law,and a state court must be granted a deference and latitude that are not in operation when the case involves review under the strickland standard itself.harrington,at.
as noted,strickland requires a defendant claiming ineffective assistance to establish two components deficient performance and prejudice.however,the strickland court explained that there is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one,and i f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of sufficient prejudice,that course should be followed.at.consistent with this suggested approach,we will proceed directly to the prejudice component.
to establish prejudice under strickland,a defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.at.in the specific context of this case,jones must establish there is a reasonable probability that,absent the alleged error,the trial judge would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.id.at.under strickland,i t is not enough for jones to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding,id.at,and the question is not whether a court can be certain counsel performance had no effect on the outcome or whether it is possible a reasonable doubt might have been established if counsel acted differently,harrington,at.in short,strickland asks whether it is reasonably likely the result would have been different,and the likelihood of a different result must be substantial,not just conceivable.id.at.
because jones was convicted by the trial judge in a bench trial,we are privy to the factfinder view of the evidence supporting his guilt.based on the trial judge comments,as well as our review of the evidence presented during trial,there are five main facts bearing on jones guilt joseph house window was broken the television was stolen from the house jones visited the house a few weeks before the theft occurred jones fingerprint was lifted from the broken window area and jones stated,in response to joseph question about why he committed the crime,that he made a mistake or whatever and that what happened.the first two facts establish the corpus delicti of the charged crimes,and the other facts incriminate jones.
pointing to the trial judge comments that the fingerprint evidence when combined with other evidence was sufficient to establish guilt,jones argues that the fingerprint evidence was essential to the guilty verdict,and without that evidence,there is a reasonable probability that he would have been acquitted.the district court viewed the record in similar fashion.see jones,d at.however,when the trial judge comments about the fingerprint evidence are examined in context,it is clear that the judge was responding to jones trial counsel argument that the fingerprint was the only evidence connecting jones to the crimes.see.the trial judge merely listed the incriminating facts to rebut jones argument.
having made that point,we readily acknowledge that the fingerprint evidence is strong evidence tending to establish jones guilt,and we do not doubt that the trial judge relied on that evidence to reach his verdict.however,the mere fact of the trial judge reliance on that evidence does not establish strickland prejudice.rather,the determinative question for strickland purposes is whether there is a reasonable probability that the trial judge would have had reasonable doubt respecting jones guilt if the fingerprint evidence had been excluded.
we believe the answer to that question is no.the trial judge specifically found as a factual matter that jones jailhouse statement was an admission of guilt.this factual finding is presumed to be correct.e.even if the fingerprint evidence is removed from the equation,the admission of guilt,in conjunction with the evidence establishing the corpus delicti and the evidence that jones had recently visited joseph house,is sufficient to establish jones guilt of the charged crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.although it is conceivable that the trial judge may have acquitted jones without the fingerprint evidence,we do not believe that there is a substantial likelihood that the judge would have done so.more importantly,under these circumstances,and in light of our deferential standard of review,we can not find that the state supreme court unreasonably concluded that jones failed to establish strickland prejudice therefore,the district court erred in granting the habeas petition.
as a condition for obtaining habeas corpus from a federal court,a state prisoner must show that the state court ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.harrington,at.we hold that jones has fallen well short of meeting this standard.therefore,we vacate the portion of the habeas order granting relief,and we remand for the district court to dismiss the habeas petition.
vacated and remanded 
in the summer of,a television went missing from a temporarily unoccupied home where workers were repairing flood damage.police investigated and lifted a number of fingerprints from a rear window and sliding glass door.one print from the window matched rashaad jones,an acquaintance of the home occupant who had visited socially once before.the single print led to jones arrest and became the fulcrum of the government case against him.
despite fertile ground for investigation by defense counsel,jones attorney apparently did very little.the record is bereft of details regarding her pretrial investigation,apart from conclusory statements that such an investigation took place.at trial,counsel called no witnesses.she introduced no evidence.her of the two government witnesses was largely perfunctory.her closing statement,read at a measured pace,lasted a little over a minute.and when presented with an opportunity to challenge the introduction of the central evidence in case the fingerprint lifted from the rear window she did not object on confrontation clause grounds,an objection that almost certainly would have been sustained.
it bears repeating that a functioning adversarial system requires actual adversaries,not placeholders.see united states cronic,d t he adversarial process protected by the sixth amendment requires that the accused have counsel acting the role of an advocate.internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,jones counsel not only refused to put up a fight.she went so far as to unnecessarily surrender the very sixth amendment right that helps animate the adversarial system the right to confront one accusers.of course,defense counsel need not always object to the introduction of hearsay contained in a forensics certificate.there may be cases when not objecting is supported by sound trial strategy,such as when counsel does not want to draw additional attention to the evidence or provide the opportunity for another government witness to testify.this is not that case.
nonetheless,the majority concludes that any deficient performance was not prejudicial because jones admitted to the crime,and there was thus no reasonable probability of a different result if the fingerprint evidence was excluded.such a conclusion,however,is at odds with the court express rationale for a finding of guilt.as the trial judge reasoned i think when you take the fingerprint and combine it with the recent visit and you combine it with the statement i think that sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt emphasis added.in that light,there is a reasonable probability that if the fingerprint evidence was excluded,jones would have been acquitted.
i thus respectfully dissent.
a more fulsome description of the facts and proceedings in this case is helpful in evaluating the performance of jones counsel.as the majority notes,the government case against jones consisted of two witnesses.the first,jereme joseph,rented the home and owned the television set.he testified that he was living elsewhere while workers repaired the flood damage,and that his landlord received information from the workers that a window had been broken and that there may have been missing items.when joseph reentered the house,he noticed that the workers had placed all of his belongings in one bedroom.a television set was missing.valuable construction equipment,however,was undisturbed.
joseph further testified that jones was an acquaintance who had paid a social visit to the home a month before it flooded.after the police arrested jones for the theft on the basis of the fingerprint evidence,joseph stated that he received a phone call from jones or whatever and visited him in jail to have a conversation.the pair engaged in a short and enigmatic discussion lasting a few seconds.asked what jones told him,joseph testified 
basically he made a mistake or whatever and that what happened.i mean it really was no explanation,it was dumb.
apparently unsatisfied,the trial judge later asked joseph to elaborate on what jones said,leading to this brief exchange 
joseph i mean he really did he just said it happened basically like that.like there was really what happened,happened,you know what i saying.
the court did he say i sorry 
joseph maybe he did.
the court maybe he did 
joseph right,i do recall.
the court well,he said it just happened 
joseph right.
the court and that all he said 
joseph right.
the second witness was james city county police investigator karen shuler,who investigated the at joseph house.shuler investigation determined that somebody had entered the home through a broken rear window to the living room.she also testified there was damage to the front door and sliding glass backdoor.the investigator lifted prints from the rear window and sliding glass door,but did not submit the prints from the door for analysis.
during shuler testimony,the government introduced,and the court admitted,a forensic certificate of analysis the certificate stating that a single fingerprint found on the rear window matched jones.the other four prints did not return matches.the government did not call the analyst who prepared the report.jones counsel did not object to its admission on confrontation clause grounds.regarding the fingerprints in general,shuler testified 
shuler i could not say which one print was really good.i mean it looked by my visual it looked good but i ca testify 
prosecutor you not an expert to qualify those prints,correct 
shuler right.
jones counsel called no witnesses and offered no evidence.she argued briefly in closing that the government evidence was highly circumstantial,observing that the television was never found in jones possession.counsel also curiously characterized the fingerprint on the window as damming sic,but maintained that such evidence alone was simply not enough to find jones guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
the trial judge disagreed.he found that the fingerprint certificate was enough to convict when combined with the evidence that jones had been in the house previously,and the testimony about jones admission to joseph while in jail.the court convicted jones of breaking and entering,and grand larceny.at the close of the guilt phase,the judge told jones that if the victim were to get his television back i suspect that would be a long way to ameliorating the situation before sentencing.the television was apparently not returned,and the judge sentenced jones to years imprisonment,with years suspended.
the court of appeals of virginia denied jones direct appeal.the supreme court of virginia did the same.jones then filed a state habeas petition in the supreme court of virginia,arguing in part that his counsel was ineffective because she failed to conduct an adequate pretrial investigation into the fingerprint evidence,failed to call the forensics analyst to testify,and failed to object to the admission of the certificate on confrontation clause grounds.the virginia high court disagreed and concluded that jones claim did not satisfy either the performance or prejudice prong of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel established by strickland washington,d.
in so holding,the supreme court of virginia relied in part on an affidavit from jones trial counsel in which she explained the circumstances surrounding her decision not to question the fingerprint evidence.the relevant portion of the affidavit provided in full 
adequate investigation was conducted and the undersigned had no reason to question the admissibility of the fingerprint evidence.based on the police reports and discovery materials,counsel had reason to believe that the defendant fingerprints would likely have been found on the scene due to his presence there on a different occasion.the undersigned is aware that counsel can require the prosecution to present at trial the testimony of the scientific expert who conducted the analysis,but the undersigned made the decision to not challenge the admission of the certificate of analysis since no basis existed for doing so and nothing appeared to be gained by challenging to sic admission of the certificate of analysis.
jones then filed his federal habeas petition pursuant to,arguing again that his counsel was ineffective because 
counsel failed to conduct adequate investigation as regards the admissibility of the fingerprint evidence 
counsel failed to call as witness at trial the expert who conducted the fingerprint analysis and 
counsel failed to object to the admission at trial of the certificate of analysis on the grounds that their admissions violated petitioner rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment 
the district court granted relief,ordering that jones sentence and convictions be vacated.jones clarke,d.the court first observed that under the united states supreme court decision in melendez diaz massachusetts,d,jones could have successfully challenged the admissibility of the certificate as violating the confrontation clause because there was no testimony of the expert analyst.further,the court found it was unreasonable for jones trial counsel to base her decision not to challenge the evidence upon her belief that the fingerprint may have been from jones prior visit.the location of the print on the outside of a rear windowpane contradicted such an explanation,the court noted.defense counsel decision not to object could not be called strategic,the court further observed,insofar as there was no apparent cost to objecting and only a significant benefit to be gained.jones,d at.in that light,the court concluded that the state supreme court unreasonably applied strickland when it held that counsel performance was not objectively deficient.
as to the question whether the admission of the certificate prejudiced jones,the district court determined that the fingerprint evidence was central to the state trial judge decision to convict.thus,had trial counsel been able to exclude or undermine the fingerprint analysis,it is likely to have had a significant impact on the likelihood of petitioner conviction.id.at.the district court also rejected the government argument that jones could not prove prejudice because he had failed to demonstrate that the analyst was unavailable to testify,or would have been shown unreliable on the stand,had his counsel challenged the certificate admission.the court observed that the government had failed to present any evidence that the analyst would have been available or prepared to testify,and had even failed to say if it would have called the analyst had jones counsel objected.id.in such circumstances,the court concluded that jones did not bear the burden of actually proving the unreliability of the certificate,or establishing the whereabouts of the analyst.imposing s uch a high burden,the court reasoned,contravenes strickland and effectively convert s the prosecution duty under the confrontation clause into the defendant privilege under state law.id.quoting melendez diaz,at.
the sixth amendment guarantees the right to effective counsel as a condition of a fair trial.strickland,at.to establish a claim of constitutional ineffectiveness,a defendant must demonstrate that counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.id.at.under the first prong,the adequacy of counsel performance is measured by the circumstances of the litigation and prevailing professional norms.id.at.under the second prong,prejudice requires that there be a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.as we have held,i n cases where a conviction has been the result of a trial,the defendant must demonstrate that but for counsel errors,there is a reasonable probability that he would not have been convicted.united states luck,cir.
as the majority recognizes,the merits of jones habeas petition pivot on the question of whether the state court denial of relief involved an unreasonable application of those standards.
under strickland first prong,the question here is whether the supreme court of virginia unreasonably applied the standard for deficient performance in concluding that jones counsel performed adequately even though she failed to challenge the admission of the fingerprint evidence.
as the district court recognized,a forensics certificate of analysis is a testimonial statement that implicates the confrontation clause.melendez diaz,at.such certificates are functionally identical to live,testimony,doing precisely what a witness does on direct examination.id.internal quotation marks omitted.as such,a defendant is entitled to confront the analyst who prepared the certifica
