on july,following a trial in the cook county circuit court of illinois,a jury found jonathan bartlett guilty of murder,attempted murder,and aggravated discharge of a firearm.after exhausting his appeals in the illinois state court system,bartlett filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the northern district of illinois.the district court denied bartlett petition,but granted a certificate of appealability.
for the following reasons,we now affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
for the crimes of murder,attempted murder,and aggravated discharge of a firearm,the state of illinois,cook county circuit court,sentenced jonathan bartlett to a term of forty years imprisonment.bartlett appealed,claiming,inter alia,that the prosecutor closing argument improperly quantified the burden of proof and violated his rights to due process and a fair trial.the appellate court of illinois,first judicial circuit,reversed bartlett conviction for aggravated discharge of a firearm,but affirmed his remaining convictions and total sentence the supreme court of illinois denied bartlett petition for appeal.
after exhausting state remedies,bartlett filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to d.the district court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus,but issued a certificate of appealability with regard to petitioner claim that the prosecutor argument regarding the burden of proof improperly quantified the burden of proof and violated petitioner rights to due process and a fair trial.
bartlett appeal concerns statements made by the prosecution during the rebuttal portion of its closing argument.these comments were quoted by the illinois appellate court and are contained in the record before this court 
shlifka assistant state attorney sheppard defendant counsel has spent a lot of time telling you about how johnathan sic bartlett is cloaked with the presumption of innocence,and he referred to the weighty burden and the heavy burden and all these nice little stories and 
sheppard objection,your honor.
the court overruled.
shlifka brick walls.brick walls.well,let me explain something to you,folks.the burden we have is beyond a reasonable doubt.not beyond any doubt,not beyond a shadow of a doubt,not beyond all doubt,but beyond a reasonable doubt.and it not like a brick wall.
sheppard objection,your honor.
the court overruled.
shlifka it not like a brick wall at all where you have to remove every single brick.think of it more like a puzzle.think the eiffel tower.you putting those pieces in.you want to get thirty percent done.well,it kind of looks likes a tower to me.let say you get all the pieces in except ten,twenty,thirty.you looking at it.my gosh,that the eiffel tower.do you have a doubt,a reasonable doubt and there still pieces missing.beyond a reasonable doubt is the standard.that cloak that bartlett walked into this courtroom with through our evidence has been thrown in the garbage.
emphasis added.
the prosecution was not alone,however,in their attempts to describe reasonable doubt.presumably,the prosecution brick wall commentary was a response to the defendant closing argument,in which,the defense defined the presumption of innocence as a brick mortar wall,which the state must remove every brick of.
in its opinion,the illinois appellate court admonished trial counsel and judges that they should avoid attempting to explain the standard of proof in criminal cases.people bartlett,slip op.at,wl.dist,citing people keene.in this case,however,the court found 
a close reading of the state comments does not indicate that the state improperly attempted to compare the beyond a reasonable doubt standard to a completed puzzle.although the state initially mentioned,it did not directly equate that percentage with its burden of proof.the state,in fact,subsequently equated its burden of proof to a nearly completed puzzle that was only missing a few pieces when directly referring to the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.while we agree that the state analogy,by making the reference to,appears at first glance to be confusing and improper,a reading of the state entire argument in context here does not support defendant argument that he was prejudiced by the state comments,thereby depriving him of a fair trial.
the district court evaluated bartlett habeas petition under the standards set forth in the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.d an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of the in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.emphasis added.
given the constraints of aedpa,the district court found that it may not consider the matter de novo under the law as it now stands,the court is constrained to conclude that the illinois appellate court did not unreasonably apply federal law.the district court went on to state that if it were free to make an independent decision it would conclude that the prosecutor comments were sufficiently prejudicial to warrant vacating bartlett conviction,but that t he illinois appellate court assessment of the impact of the prosecutor comments on the trial as a whole involved an issue as to which reasonable minds could differ.
bartlett now appeals the decision of the district court,arguing that the illinois appellate court conclusion that bartlett received a fair trial,despite the prosecutor improper statement,is contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent.bartlett specifically cites the cases of in re winship,d cage louisiana,d sullivan louisiana,d and darden wainwright,d.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court denial of a habeas petition de novo and the district court findings of fact for clear error.barrow uchtman,cir.
under the and effective death penalty act aedpa,d,a federal court will not grant a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner with respect to any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d.see also williams taylor,d.
when reviewing a decision,this court may only issue a writ of habeas corpus if the state court application of governing federal law is shown to be not only erroneous,but objectively unreasonable.yarborough gentry,d citations omitted.although federal courts,even on habeas,have an independent obligation to say what the law is,williams taylor,d quoting wright west,d,concurring,habeas relief should not be granted if the state court decision can be said to be one of several outcomes.jackson frank,cir citing boss pierce,cir.
the requirement that a habeas court find that the state court decision unreasonably applied clearly established federal law is a difficult standard to meet unreasonable means something like lying well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.id.quoting hardaway young,cir.
the illinois appellate court limited its analysis of the prosecutor comments to whether they constituted prosecutorial misconduct under the standards established in darden wainwright,d darden established a framework to evaluate whether the prosecutors comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.at.quoting donnelly dechristoforo,d.the darden test has two prongs.first,the court evaluates whether the prosecution statements were improper.second,if the comments were improper,the court asks whether the defendant was prejudiced by them.ruvalcaba chandler,cir.
bartlett argues that,g iven the importance the supreme court has placed on reasonable doubt,in re winship,d,the more stringent structural defect analysis regarding the quantification of reason
