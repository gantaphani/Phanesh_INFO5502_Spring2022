charles franklin mcafee,texas prisoner,was convicted in state court of aggravated robbery and sentenced to years of imprisonment.this court granted a certificate of appealability to allow mcafee appeal from the district court denial of habeas relief on the following two issues whether mcafee trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective during mcafee hearing on his motion for new trial,and whether the state district court denied mcafee a fair hearing by failing to grant his motion to dismiss trial counsel until after the hearing on the motion for new trial.we affirm.
mcafee was convicted of robbing a cashier,raye ann clark,with a knife,at the grocery,a convenience store in santa fe,texas,on saturday,june,at.at trial,the state presented the testimony of one eyewitness,clark,the victim.clark testified that mcafee entered the store and began looking at oil while she waited on another customer.after the customer exited the store,mcafee brought the oil up to the counter.as clark examined the oil to locate its price,mcafee pulled out a knife and asked her if she had ever been robbed.mcafee then jumped up onto the counter,asked clark to open the cash drawer,and ordered her to go to the cooler.as mcafee left the store,clark saw a ford bronco exit the driveway.she then called the police.
several members of the santa fe police department arrived at the convenience store.clark gave the officers a description of the robber and the vehicle.she testified that,when giving the police a description of the robber,she was indecisive because she was traumatized and in shock,stating i thought he had dark hair or he had a mustache or had a goatee.i was real sure.captain keith meenen,one of the responding officers,testified at trial that clark described the robber as a white male,approximately six feet tall,blond to brown hair,with a mustache.clark also described the vehicle as a ford bronco but could not recall the colors.sergeant,also a responding officer,attested that he took prints off the counter and the door but they were not readable.
almost six months later mcafee became a suspect when a patrol officer pulled him over in a ford bronco for a traffic violation.the officer noted the similarities between the description of the robber and the vehicle to mcafee and his car.a short time later,clark identified mcafee out of a photographic lineup.she also identified him in the courtroom at trial.the state also submitted a videotape from the convenience store security camera into evidence.
mcafee counsel presented two witnesses at trial,mcafee and his friend blaine carmichael.carmichael asserted that he was mcafee neighbor in houston,texas.he recalled how,on the night of june,he celebrated his birthday with his friends.among those friends was mcafee.carmichael attested that mcafee joined the party at around midnight at duster saloon,and drank with him until the bar closed at around on june.they then all drove to carmichael home to continue the festivities,with mcafee following them in his car.however,upon arriving at carmichael home at around,mcafee retired for the evening and went into his house,which was a trailer behind carmichael home.carmichael testified that he and his friends stayed out in front of his house drinking till,although one of his friends,chad jones,left at carmichael indicated that he did not see mcafee leave the property and indeed,saw him around or,when mcafee pounded on carmichael door requesting a pot of coffee carmichael also attested that mcafee had a mole on his face and that he sported a goatee and not a moustache,and that it took approximately one hour to drive from his home in houston to the santa fe area.
mcafee testified that after the party moved to carmichael property,he drove to the trailer behind carmichael home and did not leave until he asked carmichael for a pot of coffee the following morning.mcafee denied traveling to santa fe in the early morning of june,and robbing the grocery.
after deliberating,the jury found mcafee guilty as charged.the court sentenced mcafee to years of imprisonment.mcafee immediately informed the state district court that he wanted to file a motion for new trial.mcafee counsel,michael donahue,noted that he would file the motion but would not represent mcafee on appeal.
on june,over a month before his hearing on the motion for new trial,mcafee filed a motion to dismiss his counsel,donahue.mcafee asserted that donahue has failed and continues to fail to represent the defendant in an effective,concerned,independent manner.mcafee specifically listed conflict of interest as one of his complaints regarding donahue representation,and he stated that donahue had misled him.he requested that his counsel be dismissed,and he sought the appointment of new counsel.the motion also included mcafee declaration of his intent to file a formal grievance with the state bar of texas.mcafee also filed a pro se notice of appeal,leaving blank the name and address of the defense attorney on appeal.
on the same day that mcafee filed his motion to dismiss counsel,donahue filed a motion for new trial on the grounds that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction,and for reasons which were listed on exhibit exhibit a consisted of a handwritten list of mcafee complaints about his trial,including a claim that donahue had provided ineffective assistance of counsel.exhibit a did not address the reasons underlying mcafee allegations regarding donahue ineffectiveness,as the document stated that listing them would cause conflict of interest.the document instead referred to the motion to dismiss counsel.
the state court declined to rule on mcafee motion to dismiss donahue,prior to the hearing on mcafee motion for new trial,and donahue supposedly represented mcafee at the hearing on august.at the hearing,mcafee contended that donahue had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel at trial for,among other things,failing to call witnesses.mcafee stated that he had affidavits from people you told not to show up in court,and alleged that donahue had showed potential witnesses video from the convenience store security camera and asked repeatedly,is that charles,thereby discouraging them from coming to court to testify on mcafee behalf 
the transcript of the hearing reads like a primer on what not to do as an attorney.donahue attacked mcafee ineffectiveness claim throughout the hearing by vigorously defending his representation.he also accused his client of lying many times throughout the hearing,as far as me saying i did know what to do,that nonsense.that nonsense.that a complete lie a total lie he referred to mcafee testimony at the hearing as a bold faced lie and interrupted mcafee with barbs like,that is not correct.that not true.he impugned the merits of the case,this case had a real troubling strategy problem,and repeatedly referred to the motion for new trial as mcafee motion,or your motion.the court even sustained two of mcafee objections to the testimony of his own counsel,donahue,once on the ground that it was hearsay,and once on the ground that it was privileged.donahue interrupted mcafee numerous times,refusing to let mcafee testify on the motion.indeed,donahue conduct compelled the state court to admonish him multiple times,stressing that his testimony was inappropriate because he was still acting as mcafee counsel,wait a minute,donahue.if you say anything in conflict with your client defense you are still his attorney.anything you say does help his case there is an privilege and you can not breach that privilege,even if he has said he had ineffectual counsel.
halfway through the hearing,mcafee conducted his own of a state witness,with donahue doing the,attempting to undermine mcafee motion and arguments.finally,the court,exasperated by donahue behavior,issued an ultimatum towards the end of the hearing,one more time,if you interrupt another witness while they are arguing,while they are testifying or making an argument,i am going to ask you to leave the courtroom and when they are done you can come back in and read the transcript,because you are just being rude to everybody.just stop.
after the hearing,the state district court granted the motion to remove counsel as attorney of record and denied the motion for new trial.mcafee subsequently filed a grievance with the state bar of grievance committee reprimanded donahue,noting that by attempting to defend the ineffective assistance of counsel allegations at the hearing on the motion for new trial,donahue thwarted his client attempt to obtain a new trial.
on direct appeal,mcafee sought relief on grounds that the state district court erred in granting the state request to amend the indictment on the day of trial and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial because,inter alia,counsel failed to call potential alibi witnesses.see mcafee,wl,at.in affirming the state district court judgment,the intermediate state appellate court found that mcafee counsel waived his complaint regarding amendment of the indictment and the lack of notice,and that,at the hearing,mcafee failed to introduce any evidence that these witnesses were available and that his defense would have benefitted from their testimony.id.at.
mcafee then filed a state habeas application seeking relief on a number of grounds,including ineffective assistance of counsel at the hearing due to conflict of interest,and error by the state district court for failing to grant mcafee motion to dismiss counsel until after the hearing.attached to his state habeas application were affidavits from two potential witnesses,tresia alberts ruiz and chad jones.
tresia alberts ruiz attested that after mcafee was arrested,she spoke with donahue on the phone and told him that she had been with mcafee until midnight on the night of june.mcafee had invited her to come with him to carmichael birthday party later that night but she had declined the offer because she had work the next day.she stated that she was with mcafee,at his place in houston,on saturday,june,i arrived there at and stayed until am on sunday morning.ruiz indicated to donahue that she was available to testify on mcafee behalf that she was with him that weekend.according to ruiz,donahue told her that the district attorney would be real hard on her.she stated that she still wanted to testify.donahue stated that he would contact her once a trial date had been set,which he expected to be six to twelve months away.ruiz indicated that she was not notified of the trial and that she was upset when she learned of the conviction.
chad jones attested that he met mcafee counsel,donahue,on june,the day before jones was supposed to testify at mcafee trial.jones stated that he was celebrating carmichael birthday at duster saloon the night of june,and in the early hours of june.he indicated that mcafee arrived at duster around on june,and stayed until duster closed.jones stated that he knew mcafee had a trailer behind carmichael house,and that he saw mcafee drive toward that direction.jones further explained that donahue showed him the video tape of the robbery and told jones that he thought the robber looked like mcafee,saying that it sure looks like charles to me.jones attested that he did not think the robber in the video tape looked at all like mcafee and felt like donahue was trying to discourage him from testifying at trial.on the day of the trial,jones arrived in court but was not called to testify.jones expressed frustration at donahue because he had been subpoenaed and taken off work to testify on mcafee behalf 
the state district court entered findings of fact on petitioner claims,including the following on his ineffective assistance of counsel claims applicant trial and appellate attorneys delivered reasonably effective assistance of counsel.applicant has failed to show if counsel had acted as he now asserts they should have,such as addressing the indictment issue or having jones and ruiz testify for applicant,the outcome of this case would have likely been different.on january,the texas court of criminal appeals denied the application on the district court findings without a written order or a hearing.ex parte mcafee.jan.
mcafee filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus under,challenging his underlying conviction for aggravated robbery.the district court,in a thorough and opinion,denied mcafee federal habeas relief.this court then granted mcafee a certificate of appealability on two issues whether mcafee trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective during mcafee hearing on his motion for a new trial,and whether the state district court denied mcafee a fair hearing by failing to grant his motion to dismiss trial counsel until after the hearing on the motion for new trial.finding no basis to grant relief on these facts under the and effective death penalty act aedpa,we affirm.
this court has not yet determined whether the right to counsel attaches on a motion for new trial.see mayo cockrell,cir.therefore,before we can discuss either issue on appeal,this court must first determine whether mcafee had a sixth amendment right in texas to the assistance of counsel on the motion for new trial during the,period.
the supreme court has long recognized that the right to counsel is among the most fundamental rights of our criminal justice system,of all the rights that an accused person has,the right to be represented by counsel is by far the most pervasive,for it affects his ability to assert any other right he may have.penson ohio,d.it is that a defendant right to counsel attaches at or after the time adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him,kirby illinois,d,and once the right attaches,it continues to apply at every critical stage of the proceedings,united states cronic,d estelle smith,d psychiatric interviews mempa rhay,d sentencing united states wade,d white maryland,d preliminary hearings douglas california,d appeals.once the direct appeal has been decided,however,the right to counsel no longer applies.see pennsylvania finley,d.
the supreme court has articulated that a critical stage in the proceeding is one where the accused required aid in coping with legal problems or assistance in meeting his adversary,and the substantial rights of the accused may be affected.see united states ash,d rhay,at.
every federal circuit court to address the question of whether the,time period for making a motion for new trial is a critical stage has concluded that it is.see,kitchen united states,cir holding that there is a right to counsel for a rule motion for a new trial williams turpin,cir holding that,because under georgia law,an claim,if not made in a motion for new trial,is waived on direct appeal,the motion for new trial is a critical stage robinson norris,cir holding that defendant had a right to counsel on a motion for new trial in order to raise his claim menefield borg,cir holding that there is a right to counsel,in california,on a,motion for new trial.in addition,two other circuits have held that the hiatus between the termination of trial and the beginning of an appeal is a critical stage.nelson peyton,cir baker kaiser,cir quoting nelson,at 
each of these looked to the effect of a motion for new trial in the particular state at issue.they applied clearly established right to the assistance of counsel at critical the facts of each case.see hamilton alabama,d.in hamilton,the supreme court held that arraignment under alabama law is a critical stage in a criminal proceeding.id.therefore,the court in hamilton made clear that determination of what was a critical stage rested upon the facts of each case.see id.at.it acknowledged that arraignments in other jurisdictions may not be critical id.
thus,the proper inquiry here is whether a motion for new trial during the,time period in texas state court is a critical stage as a matter of federal constitutional law.hamilton,at alabama see also turpin,at georgia robinson,at arkansas menefield,at california.
the texas court of criminal appeals cca has held that it is as a matter of federal constitutional law,that the time for filing a motion for new trial is a critical stage of the proceedings,and that a defendant has a constitutional right to counsel during that period.cooks state,see also trevino state,holding that defendant has a right to the assistance of counsel at a hearing on the motion for new trial.the cca in cooks noted that a motion for new trial is a necessary step to adduce facts not otherwise in the record,in order to be able to present these points of error based on those facts in the appeal.see at citing.this rings particularly true in the context of an claim.see.see also thompson state,any allegation of ineffectiveness must be firmly founded in the record,and the record must affirmatively demonstrate the alleged ineffectiveness.citation omitted deleon state,dist,no pet.a proper record is best developed in a habeas corpus proceeding or in a motion for new trial hearing.thus,if a defendant fails to make a motion for new trial on an claim,there will be no record available on direct appeal for the appellate court to review.and although a defendant is not precluded from pursuing an claim on habeas,not only will the defendant have spent time in prison awaiting the opportunity to press the claim,he or she will have to do without the assistance of counsel in pursuing it.
in addition to the cca,every texas court of appeals to consider the issue has also concluded that,in texas,a motion for new trial,during the,period,is a critical stage.see,prudhomme state,no pet.massingill state,no pet.hanson state,dist,pet.ref burnett state,dist,pet.ref.for example,the court of appeals in prudhomme thoroughly explained how,under texas law,the motion for new trial,during the,period,affected the substantial rights of the accused 
we find it to be indisputable that counsel can be useful in coping with legal problems in preparing,filing,presenting,and obtaining a hearing on a proper motion for new trial,because the process of preserving error with a motion for new trial is governed by a myriad of rules and can be a rather arduous task.we also find it to be beyond dispute that a motion for new trial can be an extremely important tool for presenting an appeal.a motion for new trial is generally not a prerequisite to an appeal,but it can be indispensable for a meaningful appeal of issues which are reliant on facts outside the record.
prudhomme,at citations omitted.
as noted above,every federal circuit to consider this issue,as well as the texas court of criminal appeals,has relied on settled supreme court precedent in determining that the motion for new trial,during the,period,is a critical stage.we join these circuits,and the texas court of criminal appeals,in holding that there is a sixth amendment right to the assistance of counsel at the motion for new trial,during the,period,in texas,because it is a critical stage.
we now turn to the issue of whether mcafee was denied the effective assistance of counsel at the stage,and whether the state court denied him a fair hearing because it failed to grant his motion to dismiss counsel prior to the hearing on the motion for new trial.
under aedpa,this court may grant habeas relief only if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states,or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the state court record.d.clearly established federal law comprises the holdings,as opposed to the dicta,of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant decision.williams,at.a decision is an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if a state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions,but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of a prisoner case.id.at.thus,under aedpa standard of review,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must also be unreasonable.id.at.
we analyze mcafee claim under strickland washington,d.see thompson,at texas courts adhere,as we must,to the united states supreme court strickland test to determine whether counsel representation was inadequate so as to violate a defendant sixth amendment right to counsel.under strickland,the defendant must first show that counsel performance was his assistance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.ogan cockrell,cir.judicial scrutiny of counsel performance must be highly deferential,indulging in a strong presumption that trial counsel rendered adequate assistance and that the challenged conduct was the product of a reasoned trial strategy.west johnson,cir quoting wilkerson collins,cir.to overcome this presumption,a petitioner must identify the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment.wilkerson,at.mere error by counsel,even if professionally unreasonable,does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.strickland,at.
second,the defendant must show prejudice,that is,a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.id.confidence in the outcome of the trial is undermined when counsel deficient performance renders the result of the trial unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair.pratt cain,cir quoting lockhart fretwell,d.unreliability or unfairness does not result if the ineffectiveness of counsel does not deprive the defendant of any substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him.id.quoting lockhart,at.the failure to prove either deficient performance or actual prejudice is fatal to an claim.green johnson,cir.
because mcafee claim was previously considered and rejected on state habeas corpus review,the state court decision on the claim will be overturned only if it is contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.
here,mcafee asserted that he was entitled to a new trial because his counsel had rendered ineffective assistance at trial.mcafee listed a number of reasons why his counsel,donahue,was ineffective,including the failure to call witnesses.instead of acting as his counsel,or at least allowing mcafee to testify at the hearing on the motion for new trial,donahue acted adversely to his client.the potential conflict of interest cited in mcafee motion to dismiss donahue became an actual one,as donahue interrupted mcafee numerous times during his testimony,accused mcafee of lying and referred to their trial strategy as troubled.at the outset,donahue was hostile toward mcafee,stating,i have been around and i know how this works and i am the target.while donahue defended his decision not to call certain witnesses,mcafee objected to his own counsel testimony,noting that it was hearsay,an objection the state district court sustained.even after being admonished several times by the trial court,wait a minute,donahue.if you say anything in conflict with your client defense you are still his attorney.anything you say does help his case,donahue still referred to mcafee assertions about his ineffective assistance as nonsense.that a complete lie.as the hearing progressed,donahue continued to interrupt mcafee testimony,consistently arguing with his own client,that not correct.that not true.when it finally came time for him to speak,donahue accused mcafee of lying,i am still his attorney.when he tells you he gave me a closing statement to read,it a bold faced lie.
at one point,donahue began revealing privileged information,to which mcafee objected,and the court sustained.about halfway through the hearing,mcafee the state witness,and donahue took it upon himself to do the,impugning the merits of his own client motion.given donahue several statements referring to the motion for new trial as mcafee motion,or your motion,it is not surprising that donahue felt no need to assist his client.but donahue did more than fail to assist he interrupted,accused,undermined the merits of the motion,and ac
