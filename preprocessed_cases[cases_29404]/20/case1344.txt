this ohio death penalty case turns on the validity of certain jury instructions that impose a mandatory death penalty that must be addressed first by the jury before consideration is given to life imprisonment.the ohio acquittal first death penalty instructions in this case are the same ohio instructions that were given in the recent case of smith spisak.in spisak,the supreme court held that in light of aedpa the instructions did not violate the holding of mills maryland.the essential constitutional question before us now is whether we should follow justice stevens concurring opinion in the spisak case,which concludes that,although the instructions do not violate mills,the instructions do violate the principles of beck alabama.justice stevens,in his concurrence in spisak,agreed that,mills does not clearly establish under aedpa that the instructions at issue were unconstitutional.but,in my view,our decision in beck alabama,does.stevens,concurring.no other justice reached this beck issue or stated an agreement or disagreement with justice stevens view.justice stevens in his spisak concurrence lays out his view that the principles of the beck case constitute clearly established law under aedpa and should invalidate the same jury instructions in spisak that were repeated in the instant case.in light of justice stevens concurrence,we asked the parties for supplemental briefing analyzing this case in light of beck.
in essence,the jury instructions in the case before us require the jury to first determine whether the aggravating elements necessary for a mandatory death penalty are present and to impose the death penalty if the aggravating elements predominate if you make such a finding then you must recommend to the court that a sentence of death be imposed on the defendant,harry mitts,emphasis added.only if the jury first acquits the defendant of the death penalty may the jury consider life imprisonment or any offense.
after rejecting the state preliminary argument that mitts has waived and procedurally defaulted his constitutional argument against the mandatory,acquittal first death penalty instructions,we consider and accept justice stevens opinion that these death penalty instructions violate the principles announced in beck alabama,supra.we then consider two other issues raised by mitts respecting the ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial and guilt phases of the case and find them to be without merit.
mitts,an ohio prisoner under penalty of death,appeals the district court judgment denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed under.on the evening of august,mitts drank bourbon until he became intoxicated and then shot and killed bryant,an african american man,while speaking racial epithets.during the police that followed,mitts shot and killed sergeant glivar and wounded lieutenant kaiser and officer mackey before being apprehended.
at trial,mitts did not contest the evidence proving that he had killed bryant and gliver,but he instead attempted to establish that he was too intoxicated to form the required intent to kill.after a penalty hearing,the jury recommended the death penalty on both aggravated murder counts and terms of imprisonment for the attempted murders.the trial court sentenced mitts to death for the aggravated murders and to terms of imprisonment for the attempted murders.
the ohio court of appeals affirmed mitts convictions and sentences in december.state mitts,wl ohio.the ohio supreme court affirmed the convictions and sentences in march,and it denied rehearing in june.the court ruled that the trial court should have instructed the jury to merge duplicative death penalty specifications,but it held that the error did not influence the jury and was cured by on appeal.mitts,at.
mitts filed a petition for relief in september and an amended petition in march.the trial court denied the petition in august,and the ohio court of appeals affirmed that decision in september.state mitts,wl ohio.the ohio supreme court denied further review.in april,mitts filed an application to reopen his direct appeal,alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel pursuant to rule b and state murnahan,ohio.the ohio court of appeals denied the motion in may.state mitts,wl ohio.may.the ohio supreme court affirmed that decision.state mitts,ohio.
mitts filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court in october,raising twelve claims.after a period of discovery,the district court dismissed the petition on all asserted claims of error in a comprehensive opinion.mitts bagley,wl.mitts timely appealed.
mitts federal habeas petition was filed subsequent to the passage of aedpa in,and thus its provisions govern this court review.under aedpa,a federal court may not grant habeas relief unless the state court adjudication of the claim either 
resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or 
resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.
d.under the unreasonable application prong of this section,the prong most relevant to the instant case,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the decision applied a supreme court case incorrectly.price vincent.rather,i n order for a federal court to find a state court application unreasonable,the state court decision must have been more than incorrect or erroneous it must have been objectively unreasonable.wiggins smith.as this court has stated,a federal habeas court must ask whether the state court application of clearly established federal law was objectively reasonable.if the federal court finds that,viewed objectively,the state court has correctly identified the governing legal principle from the supreme court decisions but unreasonably applied that principle to the facts of the prisoner case,it may grant the writ.millender adams,cir.
in analyzing whether a state court decision is contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent,a federal court may only look to the holdings of the supreme court decisions as of the time of the relevant state court decision.lockyer andrade,williams,at.the court may look to lower court of appeals decisions to the extent they illuminate the analysis of supreme court holdings to determine whether a legal principle had been clearly established by the supreme court.hill hofbauer,cir.finally,the habeas petitioner has the burden of rebutting,by clear and convincing evidence,the presumption that the state court factual findings were correct.see e mcadoo elo,cir.
we certified appealability of mitts following claims unconstitutional instructions ineffective assistance of counsel in the guilt phase of trial and ineffective assistance of counsel in the penalty phase of trial.
the state asserts waiver and procedural default as the basis for its argument that we should not reach the merits of mitts constitutional claim that the jury instructions in his case are improper.the state argument is that mitts has never challenged his jury instructions under beck,and no previous court in this case has ever referred to beck.supplemental brief of at.this statement is mistaken.here the state highest court considered on direct appeal a federal constitutional claim attacking precisely the same jury instruction and disposed of the appeal by citing one of its earlier cases that decided the same claim by reference to the same supreme court case,beck alabama.thus,we have the ohio supreme court in this case referring to an earlier ohio supreme court case deciding the constitutionality of the same acquittal first mandatory death penalty instructions and doing so based on its interpretation of beck alabama,the case that is the basis of mitts theory here.
in rejecting mitts argument that the specific jury instructions at issue here if you make such a finding then you must recommend to the court that a sentence of death be imposed the ohio supreme court simply referred to an earlier ohio supreme court case that had discussed beck alabama when finding acquittal first instructions improper.state mitts,at,simply referred the reader to the state case of state thomas,in which the court declined to invalidate the mandatory instruction based on harmless error 
this instruction does not expressly require unanimous acquittal on the charged crime the arguments of the parties as to the prejudicial effect,if any,of such instruction are somewhat less than clear.in our opinion,this instruction has negligible coercive potential because it speaks to the jury inability to find,whether unanimously or not,a certain element of the greater offense.
this conclusion follows its discussion of the beck case 
the united states supreme court has expressly declined to hold whether or not a defendant is entitled to a lesser included offense instruction on life imprisonment as a matter of constitutional due process.keeble united states,d beck alabama,d,but has noted that the nearly universal acceptance of the rule in both state and federal courts establishes the value to the defendant of this procedural safeguard.id.
thus,in mitts case the ohio supreme court relies on the earlier thomas case which rejects beck alabama as a basis for invalidating the jury instruction at issue.perhaps the reference to the beck case in the mitts opinion could have been more explicit and the discussion more detailed.but the state is mistaken in its view that no previous court has referred to or rejected beck as a basis for invalidating this type of mandatory death penalty instruction.
mitts has not waived his beck claim.in both his direct appeal and in his petition to reopen his direct appeal,mitts argued that the jury instructions in his case were unconstitutional under the fifth,sixth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments.mitts raised this jury instruction issue in the state court.the court referred to state case which relies primarily on federal law including beck.federal review does not turn on the quality,comprehensiveness or correctness of the state court discussion of the federal issue.the supreme court has repeatedly found that when a state decision relies upon federal cases or other state cases that rely on federal law,the issue has not been waived and review by a federal court is appropriate.see,ohio robinette,t he only cases the opinion discusses or even cites are federal cases,except for the one state case which itself applies the federal constitution illinois rodriguez,the opinion does not rely on or even mention any specific provision of the illinois constitution,nor even the illinois constitution generally.even the illinois cases cited by the opinion rely on no constitutional provisions other than the fourth and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.michigan chesternut,state court decision relied on two state cases that each relied upon federal law.see also harris reed,unless the state court clearly expressed its reliance on an adequate and independent ground,the court may address the federal issue.
the state also argues that the ohio supreme court only reached the federal question under plain error review and that we should decline review for this reason.without cause and prejudice we do not address issues in which the state court has properly and fully invoked procedural default through application of a contemporaneous objection rule.biros bagley,cir hinkle randle,cir.however,in the case where the state court goes on thereafter to address the federal constitutional question under plain error review,we may address that question.see roy coxon,cir see also wainwright greenfield,collecting cases ake oklahoma,the additional holding of the state court depends on the court ruling and consequently does not present an independent state ground for the decision rendered michigan long,state ground not independent when it fairly appears that the state court rested its decision primarily on federal law raley ohio,there can be no question as to the proper presentation of a federal claim when the highest state court passes on it.manhattan life ins.of new york cohen,duty to review when it appears that such a question was actually considered and decided habeas relief for state prisoners,geo.ann.proc,collecting cases.we now address the merits of the beck jury instruction claim.
the ohio jury instructions in this case impose two rules on the jury.the first is a mandatory death penalty instruction that was recently upheld by the supreme court in a decision in kansas.marsh,overruling kansas supreme court invalidation of kansas mandatory death sentence,combined with an rule that tells the jury that,before they can consider mercy and some form of life imprisonment,they must determine whether the factors are present requiring imposition of the mandatory death penalty.under this rule,the jurors may not extend mercy to the defendant until after they have weighed aggravators and mitigators and have acquitted the defendant of the elements that automatically impose the death penalty.the issue on the merits is the constitutionality of the combined effect of two rules that together require the jury as a first step,before considering mercy,to make a decision to acquit the defendant of the mandatory death sentence.does this first step process requiring a decision on the mandatory death penalty interfere with the jury ability to give independent weight to factors that could lead one or more jurors to prefer life imprisonment does the combined effect of the two rules run the risk of causing one or more jurors to neglect or omit the serious consideration of mercy and life imprisonment as a choice justice stevens in spisak explains the answer to these questions the ohio set of jury instructions,both by their literal language and their purpose,only allows for consideration of a sentence of life after consideration of the mandatory death penalty is completed by a verdict of acquittal.
since his direct appeal in,mitts has argued that the jury instructions in his case were unconstitutional under the fifth,sixth,eighth,and fourteenth amendments.the trial court in the mitts case gave the jury a mandatory death penalty,instruction 
when all members of the jury find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances in each separate count with which harry mitts,has been found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors,if any,then you must return such finding to the court.
i instruct you as a matter of law that if you make such a finding,then you must recommend to the court that the sentence of death be imposed on the defendant harry mitts.
on the other hand,after considering all of the relevant evidence raised at trial,the evidence and testimony received at this hearing and the arguments of counsel,you find that the state of ohio failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances with which the defendant,harry mitts,was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors,you will then proceed to determine which of two possible life imprisonment sentences to recommend to the court.
tr,jury instructions,app.emphasis added.in an opinion by justice stevens,the supreme court held unconstitutional a mandatory death penalty rule that required the jury to return a death penalty verdict upon a finding that aggravators outweighed mitigators combined with a rule that the jury could not first consider the third option of a life sentence based on a offense.at.in spisak,based on the same instruction before us in the instant case,justice stevens concluded that the instructions requiring the jury to first consider a mandatory death penalty without considering a third option of life imprisonment created the same basic constitutional error as in the beck case 
the jury instructions used during spisak penalty phase interposed before the jury the same false choice that our holding in beck prohibits.by requiring spisak jury to decide first whether the state had met its burden with respect to the death sentence,and to reach that decision unanimously,the instructions deprived the jury of a meaningful opportunity to consider the third option that was before it,namely,a life sentence.indeed,these instructions are every bit as pernicious as those at issue in beck because they would have resulted in a new trial and that,in any event,they could not give effect to their determination that a life sentence was appropriate unless and until they had first convinced each of their peers on the jury to reject the death sentence.
spisak.at.having explained this problem of requiring the jury to focus first and decide first on the mandatory death penalty sentence,justice stevens concludes,spisak and the court of appeals both correctly assailed the jury instructions at issue in this case,but in my view beck provides the proper basis in clearly established federal law to conclude the instructions were unconstitutional.id.at emphasis added 
the jury instructions at issue in spisak are the same as those given by the mitts court.the ohio supreme court held in mitts that under ohio law the jury could consider possible life sentences only if all twelve members of the jury found that the state had not proved that the aggravating circumstances predominated.at.the mitts court cited ohio revised code d for its interpretation that the jury must look first to the mandatory death penalty requirement because beck compels that proper instructions must make clear that the jury does not have to complete its death deliberation before considering a life sentence,mitts due process rights were violated.under beck,a jury instruction violates due process if it requires a mandatory death penalty sentence that can only be avoided by an acquittal before the jury has an opportunity to consider life imprisonment.at.accordingly,the holding of the supreme court of ohio was contrary to clearly established federal law as determined by the supreme court of the united states in beck alabama and we hereby remand the case to the district court with instructions to issue a writ of habeas corpus vacating mitts death sentence unless the state conducts a new penalty phase proceeding within days of remand.
on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel at the guilt phase of the trial,mitts argues that his counsel completely failed to investigate the case and presented a single caused by alcohol counsel knew was unsupported by the facts and the law.he contends that counsel suppressed facts,ignored what mitts and their expert told them,and presented a witness whom they knew would eviscerate their theory.as a result,mitts argues that his counsel failed to subject the state case to meaningful adversarial testing and created a presumptively unfair trial 
we review a district court decision regarding a habeas petitioner claim of ineffective assistance of counsel de novo.avery prelesnik,cir.the standard for whether counsel ineffectiveness fell below the minimum requirements of the sixth amendment contains two components the deficient performance of counsel as compared to an objective standard of reasonable performance,and that there is a reasonable probability that the lawyer errors prejudiced the outcome of the proceedings.strickland,at.t he performance inquiry must be whether counsel assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.id.at.reviewing courts must try to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight,to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.id.at.to satisfy the prejudice prong of the strickland test,the petitioner must show that a reasonable probability exists that,but for his counsel unprofessional errors,the results of the proceeding would have been different.id.at johnson bell,cir.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.strickland,at.to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,mitts must satisfy both the deficient performance and prejudice prongs of strickland.see harries bell,cir.
we agree with the district court that counsel performance during the guilt phase of trial was constitutionally deficient.the performance of mitts lead defense counsel,thomas shaughnessy,was deficient because he pursued a blackout defense despite knowing that mitts could in fact recall most of the events of august and,and because he did not have any evidence to support the theory that a person who suffered an alcoholic blackout would have been unable to form the specific intent to kill.
in an affidavit filed in support of his state court petition,mitts said his lawyer told him that he should say he had a blackout when the shootings occurred.at his deposition for the federal habeas proceedings,mitts described what he remembered about the shootings,indicating that although there were gaps in his memory he was able to recall both his internal struggles about his actions and most of the actions themselves.mitts testified that he told shaughnessy everything that he said in his deposition and that shaughnessy told him to say that he did not remember.mitts apparently followed the advice in his unsworn statement in the mitigation phase of trial,he stated that he never meant for any of this to happen and said he only remembered bits and pieces of what happened.
susan evanson,a mitigation specialist who worked on mitts case,swore in an affidavit that mitts revealed to me that he was not in a blackout state at the time of his offenses,but was told by his attorney that under any circumstances not to tell anyone that he remembered anything regarding the charges.evanson had compiled a social history of mitts by interviewing him and his family members and submitted a report to james eisenberg,a psychologist appointed by the court to assist mitts in the mitigation phase.mitts first told evanson that he did not remember the events of august,but he later told her that he did not have a blackout and that shaughnessy told him not to tell anybody the truth.evanson told eisenberg what mitts had told her.according to evanson,shaughnessy did not meet with her or eisenberg until the day that eisenberg testified at the mitigation phase of trial.
in his affidavit,eisenberg stated that mitts told him that his attorneys insisted he maintain during his interview and trials that he was in a blackout during his crimes.eisenberg said that he did not believe that mitts suffered a blackout and that shaughnessy refused to accept his opinion about mitts mental state during the crimes.eisenberg also stated that shaughnessy was only interested in the blackout theory and did not want to address other psychological issues.in his deposition,eisenberg testified that he refused to go along with shaughnessy blackout theory because mitts never told him that he blacked out.eisenberg said that mitts was able to give a fairly detailed account of the events that led to his arrest,and he told shaughnessy he did not think mitts had a blackout.the psychiatrist also testified that mitts told him it was his attorney idea to say he had a blackout.
accordingly,if mitts,evanson,and eisenberg are to be believed,shaughnessy pursued the blackout defense even though he knew that mitts could remember many of the events of august,and instructed mitts to lie about his memory.shaughnessy is deceased,and nothing in the record from his disputes mitts account or those of evanson and eisenberg.
the record also establishes that shaughnessy knew,or should have known,that psychiatrist and defense expert sonya mckee would not support the theory that someone who was intoxicated to the point of being unable to recall his actions later would have been unable to form specific intent.shaughnessy tried to ask that question of mckee in the competency hearing on september,but the trial court sustained the prosecution objection.shaughnessy told mckee that he would definitely ask her the question again in front of the jury.later in the hearing,mckee explained that although an intoxicated person may not remember his actions later,at the time he is conscious and engaged in activities.mckee also testified that mitts explanation that he remembered doing something without understanding why or what he was doing was not consistent with an alcohol blackout.during trial on november,shaughnessy prefaced his question on this subject by saying,l et me ask you the question,doctor,that i have asked you before or we have got to before.he then asked whether a person who is unable to lay down memories would have the ability to form the specific intent to cause a particular thing to happen.mckee answered,yes.the record thus demonstrates that shaughnessy should have recognized that mckee would not support his lack of specific intent theory,that shaughnessy did not question mckee about his theory between the competency hearing and the trial,and that shaughnessy called mckee as a witness with no reason to believe she would support his theory.shaughnessy was forced to concede his defense in closing argument.
in sum,shaughnessy sole theory at trial was that mitts lacked the requisite intent to commit murder as a result of voluntary intoxication,yet the defense only expert witness directly contradicted that theory and shaughnessy should have been aware that mitts did remember much of the events.the defense expert,mckee,testified that mitts acted purposefully and not only destroying mitts sole defense but also proving a key element of the prosecution case.such performance alone would enable us to find counsel deficient for failing to fully investigate before presenting witness testimony.see combs coyle,cir.sadly,counsel deficiency ran even deeper.even a preliminary conversation with mckee would have revealed that she would not have supported a defense of voluntary alcohol intoxication for any defendant in any trial under any circumstances.it was her clinical opinion than only pass out before alcohol intoxication rendered them unable to form intent.moreover,the record shows that trial counsel had a hunch that mckee would contradict his intoxication defense and still placed her on the stand.defense counsel commented during side bar the lady mckee,as i guessed that she would,was going to say that the defense is bull shit,which is about what she saying.shaughnessy failure to do the minimal investigation required to determine his own expert opinion about a matter central to his theory of the defense was objectively unreasonable and constituted deficient performance under strickland and combs.
notwithstanding trial counsel deficiencies,we agree with the district court that mitts does not establish prejudice under strickland.shaughnessy did concede that mitts shot the victims and abandoned the alcohol blackout defense after mckee testimony,leaving mitts without a viable defense theory at trial.shaughnessy did not,however,bring out damaging information about mitts,make him seem dangerous,or express contempt for him.he the state witnesses and brought out evidence in the guilt phase that laid the groundwork for the mitigation phase of trial.
moreover,while mckee contradicted mitts voluntary intoxication defense,mitts can not show that another expert would have testified that mitts was too intoxicated to form the specific intent to kill.eisenberg testified during the mitigation phase that mitts was highly intoxicated on the night of the offense but did not testify that mitts lacked the intent to shoot the victims.testifying that the majority of the individuals whom he has evaluated as having alcohol impairment were able to have knowledge and purpose at the time of the offense.as mitts habeas counsel has noted,neither intoxication nor blackout was a defense available to mitts.neither the facts nor the law supported such a defense and the evidence of mitts guilt was overwhelming.
even at this stage in the proceedings,mitts offers no evidence of a trial strategy that may have produced a different result.as mitts implies,the only alternative approach that his counsel could have reasonably attempted was a full concession defense.the supreme court recognized the merits of such a strategy in florida nixon,defense attorney concession of guilt in a capital light of overwhelming evidence against his not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.by admitting guilt from the beginning,the attorney will impress the jury with his candor and his unwillingness to engage in a useless charade.id.at quoting cronic,at.
it follows from nixon that overwhelming evidence of guilt may signal to an attorney that a concession defense could prove an effective tactic,but we can not extend the dicta of nixon to find that counsel failure to implement a concession defense constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.obviously,mitts can not show that a full concession defense could have changed the result of the proceedings at the guilt phase the jury would,of course,have found him guilty.mitts also can not demonstrate that a concession defense at the guilt phase would have resulted in a lighter penalty at sentencing because such a tactic relies upon unprovable factors,such as the credibility of the lawyer and the morality and sympathy of the jury.
lacking any viable alternative trial theory,mitts can not demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel errors,the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt about his guilt.hicks collins,cir citing strickland,at.hence,mitts fails to satisfy the prejudice standard of strickland and his first claim must fail.
mitts also claims that his trial counsel failed to investigate his case and failed to present evidence of viable mitigating factors.he charges that his counsel relied upon the unsupportable theory of blackout that was discredited during the guilt phase of trial.
we also agree with the district court assessment of counsel performance during the penalty phase of trial.counsel chief deficiency during the guilt phase carried over into the mitigation phase when counsel continued to focus on alcohol intoxication.despite having already received a guilty verdict that nullified the intoxication defense and the fact that eisenberg did not believe that mitts blacked out and that mckee had rejected the idea that a blackout meant that mitts was so intoxicated that he could not form specific intent,counsel told the jury that alcohol intoxication was the only thing that may mitigate.shaughnessy also appeared to attack his own witnesses by comparing psychiatrists to those who believed in witches and by describing mitts as a monster who should never be released from prison.it could be argued that shaughnessy thought that the jurors would be skeptical of psychological explanations for mitts actions and that he wanted to assure the jury that,because of mitts age,he would die before becoming eligible for parole.these possible strategic reasons for parts of shaughnessy approach do not comprise a mitigation strategy.the district court correctly found that defense counsel did not conduct a reasonable investigation of alternative theories of mitigation and thus fell below the contemporaneous standards established by the supreme court and the american bar association.see wiggins smith,strickland,at aba guidelines for the appointment and performance of counsel in death penalty cases c,aba standards for criminal justice,commentary,ed.
in order to assess whether prejudice resulted from counsel failures at the penalty phase of trial,we reweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of available mitigating evidence.wiggins,at.in order to establish prejudice,the new evidence that habeas petitioner presents must differ in a substantial strength and subject the evidence actually presented at sentencing.brooks bagley,internal citations omitted.on appeal,mitts argues that he suffered prejudice at sentencing because trial counsel failed to present evidence of mitts avoidant personality disorder,iq of,and violent fantasy life.eisenberg was unable,however,to link any event or events in mitts past to his actions on august and,nor did he find or suggest that mitts had an organic brain injury or a mental illness that might have contributed to his actions.his testimony that mitts had no significant prior record and showed ability to adjust to prison life would have been cumulative to the evidence that was introduced in mitts mitigation hearing.the lay witnesses who testified on mi
