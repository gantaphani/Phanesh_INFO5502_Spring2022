opinion of the court 
barry gibbs appeals from the district court april,judgment denying his application for release.the primary issue presented in this appeal is whether the district court complied with this court earlier mandate to grant gibbs petition for a writ of habeas corpus and require the state to either release gibbs or retry him within a specified time period.gibbs frank,cir gibbs i.the district court set this time period at days,but gibbs retrial did not take place within that time frame.the district court excused this delay because it concluded that the delay was due in large part to gibbs own actions.the secondary issue presented in this appeal is whether the district court properly interpreted its own order establishing the time period of days to include an extension under state procedural rules for the filing of several motions.we agree that the district court complied with our prior mandate and properly exercised its discretion in excusing the brief delay in the pennsylvania state court system.we will therefore affirm.
three times a jury has convicted gibbs of the same criminal homicide the pennsylvania supreme court vacated gibbs first conviction after concluding that certain statements he made to the police were induced in violation of his fifth amendment rights.at gibbs first trial,a government psychiatrist who had conducted a examination of gibbs testified about statements made by gibbs to the psychiatrist the psychiatrist testimony was presented to rebut gibbs diminished capacity defense.at gibbs second trial,the government psychiatrist again testified about gibbs statements.but at the second trial gibbs did not raise a diminished capacity defense.accordingly,on habeas corpus,this court set aside gibbs second conviction,ruling that gibbs statements to the psychiatrist in a examination were compelled,and hence the presentation of the psychiatrist testimony as part of the government affirmative,in a gibbs fifth amendment rights.in remanding the case,this court directed the district court to enter an order conditionally granting habeas relief unless gibbs was retried within a specified time period.gibbs i,at 
the district court received the certified order in lieu of the formal mandate from this court on november.that court issued an order on november,directing the commonwealth to either release gibbs or retry him within days in accordance with the third circuit court directive.the district court noted that days would run on march.earlier in november,gibbs had written to his former state counsel from the first trial,ronald bugaj,informing him that the third circuit had granted him a new trial,that the state was petitioning for a rehearing and then certiorari,and that although he had a lawyer for his appeal,a new lawyer would have to be appointed for his retrial.gibbs indicated that bugaj should notify him if bugaj was interested in representing him.on november,before the district court issued its order,bugaj responded to the letter,expressing an interest in the case.in late november,gibbs wrote attorney bugaj and suggested that bugaj contact mark berman,who represented him before the third circuit in gibbs i,on how to proceed.
in late december,berman wrote to judge joseph kameen of the court of common pleas of pike county,stating that counsel should be appointed for gibbs immediately,and that bugaj was willing to take the appointment.judge kameen was unaware of the district court order to retry gibbs because it had been electronically served only on the parties.this contact by bugaj was,therefore,the first indication to the state court that gibbs would need new counsel to be appointed for a retrial.in january,judge kameen wrote to the chief public defender,directing that a public defender undertake the representation of gibbs at his trial,which was set for march.assistant public defender robert bernathy was designated.shortly thereafter,gibbs wrote to bugaj advising of the appointment of bernathy and stating that he wrote to the public defender objecting to the appointment.in,the commonwealth filed a motion objecting to the appointment of public defender bernathy because his father had been part of the original team of pennsylvania state police troopers investigating the homicide more than two decades earlier.
on february,gibbs filed a pro se motion for appointment of counsel in the pike county court of common pleas,outlining the history of the case and claiming that he had a conflict with the public defender because the public defender had supposedly ineffectively represented him at earlier trials.four days later,the public defender filed a motion to withdraw as gibbs counsel.
on march,judge kameen granted the motion to withdraw,and appointed bugaj and an associate to represent gibbs.on march,the day the trial was scheduled to begin,bugaj moved to continue the trial until may,so that he could file pretrial motions.during the hearing on that motion the prosecutor stated that the commonwealth is ready to proceed today,but conceded that it had no objection to the continuance.the defense was given until april,to file its pretrial motions.on april,the defense filed an omnibus motion,asserting several issues.the defense also made an oral motion for judge harold thomson to recuse himself because he had presided over the first two trials.after the defense filed a written recusal motion,judge thomson recused himself on april.judge kameen ruled on the omnibus motion in an opinion on may.he noted that the continuances previously granted had been at the request of the defense,and that motions had also been filed.because many of the issues raised by the defense had previously been determined by the trial court,judge kameen comprehensively addressed only four issues a motion to suppress specific evidence two motions to dismiss charges and a motion for release on nominal bail because gibbs was not going to be tried within the days which was march,set by the district court.
in early may,the district court docketed a letter by bugaj associate that stated that gibbs wished to file an application for release based upon the commonwealth violation of the previous order that gibbs be tried within days.the attorney requested that counsel be appointed to represent gibbs in these federal court proceedings.on may,the district court appointed berman to represent gibbs in any further proceedings.one day later,berman prepared an application for release that asserted that the commonwealth had disregarded the order of the district court and deliberately acted in a manner that made it impossible for such a trial to take place.for reasons not clear from the record before us,the application was not docketed until march.by order dated april,the district court denied gibbs application for release.this appeal followed 
the district court had continuing jurisdiction under and over gibbs application for release from confinement.see vaughn,cir phifer warden,cir declaring that district court had continuing jurisdiction to address alleged noncompliance with conditional writ of habeas corpus.because gibbs notice of appeal is from a final order denying his application to make the conditional writ absolute and to release him,we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.the commonwealth contends that we lack jurisdiction because a certificate of appealability coa has not been granted.our analysis in demonstrates,however,that we have jurisdiction.
in,at,we revisited the issue of whether an ex post facto violation had occurred on remand as a result of the pennsylvania board of probation and parole conduct with regard to renewed parole application.we noted that we had found a violation in the first appeal and remanded the matter for the board to rectify the violation.see vaughn,cir.we observed that our mandate in the first appeal,as set forth in several paragraphs of the opinion,could not be clearer,at.yet the board conduct once the matter was remanded was again deficient.
after relating the factual history of the case,we considered whether we had jurisdiction.we noted that,even though no coa had been granted by the district court,notice of appeal constituted a request for a coa under federal rule of appellate procedure b.we further stated that,o f utmost importance,this court has continuing jurisdiction over this appeal to determine whether the board has complied with the district court remand order and our remand mandate.id.at.as support we cited phifer,at.in phifer,the seventh circuit declared that w hen a habeas petitioner alleges noncompliance with a conditional order granting habeas relief,jurisdiction exists for the purpose of determining whether the state acted in accordance with the court mandate.id.the court explained that the district court jurisdiction to address phifer claim was encompassed in the same power that would have enabled the court to release phifer.id.
the procedural posture of this case brings it within the doctrine,giving us jurisdiction over this appeal.at issue here is whether the district court properly executed,and whether the state court properly followed,this court conditional writ of habeas corpus.we exercise plenary review over whether the district court correctly interpreted the instructions of our prior opinion.see cooper distrib,amana refrigeration,cir united states,cir citation omitted.we review a district court interpretation of its own order for abuse of discretion.in re cendant.prides,cir we review the district court modification of its own order establishing a deadline for abuse of discretion.
gibbs argues that he should be permanently released because the commonwealth failed to comply with the court order to afford him a trial within days the first question we address is whether the district court properly interpreted the instructions of gibbs i to grant gibbs petition for a writ of habeas corpus and require the state to either release gibbs or retry him within a specified time period.gibbs i,at.the district court november,order directed the commonwealth to either release gibbs or retry him within days in accordance with the third circuit court directive.the district court selected this time frame in part because pennsylvania state criminal procedure uses days.pennsylvania rule of criminal procedure d states that w hen a trial court has granted a new trial and no appeal has been perfected,the new trial shall commence within days after the date of the order granting a new trial,if the defendant is incarcerated on that case.we note at the outset that the gibbs i instruction did not require the time period decreed by the district court.our mandate was only that retrial take place within a specified time period.implicit in specified,however,is a reasonableness requirement.see,richmond lewis,d directing district court to enter a conditional order granting habeas unless the state corrected the constitutional error within a reasonable period of time boles stevenson,d remanding to the district court to allow the state a reasonable time to afford stevenson a hearing or a new trial,failing which stevenson is entitled to his release rogers richmond,d the case is remanded to the court of appeals to be held in order to give the state opportunity to retry petitioner,in light of this opinion,within a reasonable time.dowd ex rel.cook.directing the court to enter the appropriate order to allow the state a reasonable time in which to afford respondent the full appellate review he would have received but for the suppression of his papers,failing which he shall be discharged.the district court selection of days was eminently reasonable.see pazden maurer,cir reversing a district court denial of federal habeas relief and remanding with instructions to grant the writ if the defendant is not retried in days slutzker johnson,cir days holloway horn,cir days.
the second issue we address is whether the district court abused its discretion by interpreting its own time period of days to include a reasonable period of excusable delay.this issue breaks down into two,one primarily legal and the other primarily factual.
the legal is whether the district court had any discretion to excuse the commonwealth from strictly complying with the district court initial time period.we hold that,so long as its actions are reasonable under the circumstances,a district court has the authority to alter the time period it originally sets for retrial to commence pursuant to a grant of conditional habeas relief.in schlup delo,d,the supreme court acknowledged that it has adhered to the principle that habeas corpus is,at its core,an equitable remedy.as an equitable remedy,a federal court has wide latitude in setting the time period for conditional relief.see hilton braunskill,d stating that a court has broad discretion in conditioning a judgment granting habeas relief.
consistent with the supreme court observations in hilton and schlup,the seventh circuit recognized in phifer,at,that c onditional orders are essentially accommodations accorded to the state.they represent a district court holding that a constitutional infirmity justifies the petitioner release.the conditional nature of the order provides the state with a window of time within which it might cure the constitutional error.failure to cure that error,however,justifies the district court release of the petitioner.the seventh circuit in phifer further noted that a conditional order framework contemplates that a district court will eventually make an assessment concerning compliance with its mandate.id.at see also smith lucas,cir in the conditional writ cases,the federal court has determined that it has the authority to order immediate release of the prisoner as a result of the federal law violation the court chooses,however,to delay the writ to allow the state to correct the problem as best it can.
in light of the broad discretion a district court possesses in fashioning a conditional order,the seventh circuit in gilmore bertrand stated that it logically follows that this discretion includes the ability to grant the state additional time beyond the period prescribed in a conditional writ to cure a constitutional deficiency,cir per curiam see also chambers armontrout,cir noting that the district court did not err by granting additional time to retry the prisoner,particularly since there was some evidence that the delay in retrial had been attributable at least in part to the defense moore zant,cir concluding that the court could give the state additional time to correct a constitutional violation even after delay of more than months frazier roberts,cir instructing the district court that it should order retrial within days or within a reasonable extension of such period.
we agree with the seventh circuit holding in gilmore,as it is in accord with the supreme court jurisprudence regarding the broad discretion given to district courts in fashioning habeas relief.gibbs attempts to distinguish gilmore because,in that case,the state made a motion to the federal district court for an extension,whereas in this case,the state never made a motion in district court for additional time to retry gibbs.this distinction in this context has no legal significance.to begin,it is not even clear that,in gilmore,the state had made its motion prior to the passing of the deadline.at after the state failed to meet the deadline,the district court granted its motion for a extension of the stay.second,and more importantly,it is of no moment whether the commonwealth seeks an extension directly from the district court during the initial deadline or,as happened here,provides a post hoc justification for the trial delay.such a maneuver may be strategically unwise from the commonwealth perspective because of the broad discretion afforded to a district court in conditioning and granting habeas relief.see grasso norton,cir.nonetheless,we fail to see why a justification offered by the state for the delay in a prisoner retrial should be categorically rejected as a legal matter.the broad discretion inherent in a district court habeas powers include the ability to evaluate whether the commonwealth has provided a legitimate reason for its delay in retrying a defendant subject to a conditional habeas writ.
the factual,then,is whether the district court abused its discretion in making the factual
