in,a new york jury convicted kevin langston of felony assault and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree new york felony assault statute criminalizes actions taken i n the course of and in furtherance of the commission of a felony that cause serious physical injury to a.penal law.at trial,the prosecution demonstrated that one of langston accomplices shot and seriously injured nypd detective arthur marquez during what appears to have been an attempted robbery.langston was not charged with committing the assault in furtherance of the felony of attempted robbery.instead,the jury was instructed that to convict langston of felony assault,it had to find that langston committed the assault in the course of and in furtherance of the felony of criminal possession of a weapon,a finding the jury implicitly made by finding langston guilty of felony assault.
langston,after unsuccessfully challenging the sufficiency of the evidence against him on direct appeal,see people langston,dep t,leave to appeal denied,sought habeas relief in the eastern district of new york edward korman.judge korman granted langston petition after determining that the evidence at trial was constitutionally insufficient to prove the in furtherance of element beyond a reasonable doubt.langston smith,wl,at.joseph smith,the superintendent of shawangunk correctional facility the state,appealed.
on may,a confidential informant introduced john robert,an undercover officer in the nypd firearms investigation unit,to local gun dealer edward moultrie.following that meeting,moultrie agreed to facilitate robert purchase of four handguns.a few days later,robert and marquez together,the officers met moultrie and his man langston at junior restaurant in brooklyn,new york to carry out the deal.
when the officers arrived at junior,langston insisted that the sale take place at a housing project a few miles away and directed them to sutter avenue,the building in which he grew up.once there,moultrie,robert,and marquez waited outside while langston entered the building,purportedly to initiate contact with the sellers.langston testified that he looked for,but was unable to find,his friend,who had previously agreed to sell robert and marquez the weapons and to compensate langston for his efforts.langston did,however,make contact with gamel cherry,an acquaintance who lived in the building langston testified that cherry agreed to provide the weapons necessary to complete the sale.
after making arrangements with cherry,langston returned outside,informed robert and marquez that the sellers needed the money,and offered to act as courier for the transaction.robert rejected this proposal,but agreed to do the deal inside the building.robert,marquez,and moultrie then followed langston into sutter avenue where langston greeted a few people,including ralph wyman,who were milling about the lobby.after robert again refused to prepay,langston convinced the officers to make their purchase in the sixth floor hallway.on their way up,the elevator stopped on the fifth floor,where skyler brownlee was waiting.when the elevator door opened,brownlee acknowledged langston,but did not get on the elevator.
on the sixth floor,langston and robert continued to argue about the mechanics of the deal.at one point,cherry entered the hallway from the stairwell and joined in langston unsuccessful efforts to secure prepayment.cherry demanded that the officers produce identification.after marquez complied,cherry,apparently satisfied,told robert and marquez that they were going to get what they came for and left the hallway.
while awaiting cherry return,langston tried to convince robert to reimburse him for cab fare from manhattan to brooklyn.suddenly,cherry,brownlee,and wyman burst into the hallway with guns drawn and opened fire on the officers a bullet from the initial volley of shots struck marquez hand,causing permanent damage.robert and marquez returned fire before retreating into the stairwell to escape their assailants.langston,who had been standing next to robert at the time of the shooting,also fled the scene.police officers found him inside a nearby train station bleeding from gunshot wounds to his arm and buttocks.
officers responding to the scene discovered moultrie lying partially paralyzed on the hallway floor with wounds to his back and face.crime scene investigators recovered a handgun,discharged shells all of which came from the officers weapons,and ballistics evidence from a caliber pistol,including one discharged shell,one live cartridge,and numerous bullet fragments.
a grand jury indicted langston on thirteen counts ranging from attempted murder to attempted criminal sale of a firearm.people langston.kings.at trial,langston testified in his own defense.he insisted that he barely knew cherry and had never met wyman or brownlee.while langston admitted to attempting to arrange a gun sale,he vehemently denied any involvement in plotting a robbery or any knowledge that cherry,wyman,or brownlee possessed weapons other than those offered for sale.
five counts went to the jury felony assault,criminal possession of a caliber handgun,criminal possession of a caliber handgun,criminal possession of a handgun,and criminal possession of a handgun.the jury acquitted langston of the possession charges related to the handgun,but convicted him of felony assault and possession of the caliber weapon.as instructed by the trial judge,reaching this verdict required the jury to find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the assault on marquez was committed in furtherance of the felony weapon possession.
the trial court sentenced langston to years imprisonment on the felony assault count and to a concurrent sentence on the possession count.brownlee,wyman,and moultrie all pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.brownlee and wyman were sentenced to ten years imprisonment,while moultrie received a sentence.cherry was tried with langston,convicted of felony assault,and sentenced to years.
on direct appeal,langston primarily argued that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove that he acted in concert with cherry,wyman,and brownlee.langston also insisted that,while he intended to sell weapons,he did not anticipate that the transaction would degenerate into a shootout and,therefore,he should not be held liable for marquez injuries.langston also argued that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault was committed in furtherance of the weapon possession.the appellate division of the new york supreme court rejected langston claims and affirmed his conviction.people langston,at,leave to appeal denied,at.
after exhausting his remedies,langston filed a timely petition in the district court for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.the district court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to prove the in furtherance of element of felony assault beyond a reasonable doubt and granted langston petition.langston smith,wl,at.however,the district court denied the petition with respect to langston conviction for weapon possession and rejected langston claim that the prosecution failed to prove that he acted in concert with cherry,brownlee,and wyman.id.at.langston does not appeal this portion of the district court ruling,perhaps because he has now been incarcerated for more than eight years,three years longer than his sentence on the possession charge 
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of langston habeas petition de novo.jones keane,cir.our review focuses on the state appellate court decision upholding langston conviction.since that court rejected langston insufficiency claim on the merits,we must determine whether its ruling was erroneous,and,if so,whether the error resulted from an unreasonable application of the sufficiency of the evidence standard laid out by the supreme court in jackson virginia.see d 
ii.the merits 
due process requirements 
langston argues that his conviction violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,which forbids conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which the defendant is charged.jackson,at,quoting in re winship.this requirement provides concrete substance for the presumption of bedrock axiomatic and elementary principle whose enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.winship,at,quoting coffin united states.
despite the importance of this constitutional principle,judges must be highly deferential to the jury verdict of conviction courts view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,jackson,at,and will uphold the jury verdict unless the evidence that the defendant committed the crime alleged is nonexistent or so meager that no reasonable jury could convict,united states macpherson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.that said,a conviction based on speculation and surmise alone can not stand,united states,cir,and courts can not credit inferences within the realm of possibility when those inferences are unreasonable,united states quattrone,cir.
this standard must be applied with explicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.jackson,at henry ricks,cir.w here a fact to be proved is also an element of the offense it is not enough that the inferences in the government favor are permissible t he inferences must be sufficiently supported to permit a rational juror to find that the element is established beyond a reasonable doubt.united states martinez,cir.
b.the elements of new york penal law 
new york felony assault statute characterizes as assault actions causing serious physical injury that occur in the course of and in furtherance of the commission of a felony.penal law.in so doing,it replaces the intent to injure requirement traditionally associated with the crime of assault with the intent to commit the underlying felony here,criminal possession of a caliber handgun.see people snow,dep t,aff,d.in this respect,felony assault is closely akin to the and statutory crime of felony murder,which punishes killings as murder,even in the absence of intent to kill,when death is caused in furtherance of a felony 
the trial judge instructed the jury that in order to convict langston of felony assault it had to find four elements beyond a reasonable doubt langston either committed or aided and abetted the crime of criminal possession of a weapon,marquez suffered a serious physical injury,langston or another participant caused marquez injury while in the course of and in furtherance of the commission of criminal possession of a weapon,and marquez was not a participant in the crime.tr.langston argues that the evidence at trial failed to establish that marquez injury was caused in furtherance of the weapon possession.
although the precise boundaries of the in furtherance of requirement remain uncharted,the new york courts have provided sufficient guidance for us to resolve langston petition.under new york law,meaning and effect should be given to all of a statute language,if possible,and words are not to be rejected as superfluous when it is practicable to give to each a distinct and separate meaning.stat.law.therefore,in the course of and in furtherance of must be construed as two distinct proof elements,each of which has independent meaning.people.afzal,slip u,at.june.in other words,the assault must have a nexus with the underlying felony beyond the fact that they occurred at the same time.id.
as the new york court of appeals has repeatedly said,to be guilty of felony assault,the defendant must injure the victim in the attempted execution of the unlawful end.people joyner,internal quotation marks omitted see also people cahill,graffeo,concurring in part and dissenting in part explaining that in the legislature adopted the in the attempted execution of language as part of the in furtherance of requirement,quoting people wood,people ryan.t he act which results in injury must be in furtherance of the unlawful purpose.cahill,at graffeo,concurring in part and dissenting in part internal quotation marks omitted see also people taylor.queens.
people swansbrough provides an example.in that case,a jury convicted tonya swansbrough of,among other things,felony assault and unlawful imprisonment for her role in an attack on an unarmed woman,dep t.a male had facilitated the assault by restraining the victim during the beating and the jury concluded that the assault was committed in furtherance of that unlawful imprisonment.id.the state appellate court reversed swansbrough felony assault conviction,holding that the evidence was insufficient to support the conclusion that the assault was committed to further the unlawful imprisonment r ather,any unlawful imprisonment was committed in furtherance of the assault.id.at.in effect,the court found that the assault was not committed in the attempted execution of the unlawful imprisonment,even though the assault likely aided the unlawful imprisonment and the two crimes occurred at the same time 
as swansbrough implies,the efficacy of the action taken in furtherance of the underlying felony is irrelevant the law is only concerned with whether the action was committed with such a design.for example,in people slaughter the new york court of appeals upheld a felony murder conviction after an car crashed into another vehicle,killing its occupant,despite the fact that the reckless driving that caused the victim death did not,as it turned out,facilitate the defendant crime,but actually thwarted his escape and led to his apprehension.
sufficiency of the evidence 
the prosecutor tried this case as a botched robbery.he began his opening statement by arguing that langston and the men he was working with never had any intentions of selling any guns.instead,they planned a robbery.and when that did work they shot marquez and then tried to shoot robert.tr.the prosecutor then reenforced this argument during summation,asserting that langston plan was to lure two people into brooklyn have them outnumbered,have them outarmed and then take what they have got.tr.
there is no question that the evidence presented at trial supported the prosecution robbery theory.had the jury convicted langston after being asked to decide whether the assault on marquez had been committed in furtherance of an attempted robbery,affirmance of that verdict would present no difficulty.however,langston was not charged with attempted robbery,and the trial judge instructed the jury that to convict langston of felony assault it had to find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that he or another participant caused serious physical injury to arthur marquez while in the course of and in furtherance of criminal possession of a weapon.tr.under new york law,that instruction reference only to the criminal possession charge eliminated all other possible theories of conviction.see people bell,n,people suggs,dep t people wilson,dep t.
in contrast to the prosecution repeated focus on the alleged attempted robbery,the requirement in the jury charge that the assault be committed in furtherance of weapon possession was wholly ignored.the prosecution sole mention of the necessary relationship between marquez injuries and the underlying possession charge occurred in a single sentence during summation 
the part that i want you to cue in on and the part that i want to talk to you about is that artie marquez suffered these injuries while kevin langston,along with the other young men in this case,jointly,together possessed guns that were loaded and that worked.
tr.emphasis added.even here,the prosecutor spoke only of the required temporal relationship between the assault and the weapon possession he altogether ignored the in furtherance of requirement.
in keeping with this confused approach,the prosecutor presented no evidence tending to show that the officers were assaulted to further,swansbrough,at,the possession of the very guns used in the theory on which the state principally defends the conviction in this court.to the contrary,based on the evidence that he did present,the prosecutor concluded that there was a very specific reason why these guns were pulled and used and that was to wrest money from robert and marquez.tr.as the p
