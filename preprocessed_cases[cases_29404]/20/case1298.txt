discussion 
this court may not issue a writ of habeas corpus for a defendant convicted under a state judgment unless the adjudication of the claim by the state court resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.d a state court decision will be contrary to clearly established federal law when it reaches a legal conclusion in direct opposition to a prior decision of the united states supreme court or when it reaches a different conclusion than the united states supreme court on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.kutzner johnson,cir.moreover,a state court decision will be based on an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law when it is objectively unreasonable.id.
