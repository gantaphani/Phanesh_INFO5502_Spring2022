in substance,alfred hernandez seeks a certificate of appealability a coa granting him permission to appeal the district court denial of his motion for relief from judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b.the judgment in question applied the rule of salinas dretke and dismissed hernandez habeas petition as barred by limitations.hernandez argues that if the district court had applied the rule announced in jimenez quarterman it would have determined that his petition was timely filed.on this point,hernandez is right.where he is wrong is on his claim that the supreme court announcement of a new method of calculating the limitations period under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa is the kind of extraordinary circumstance that warrants relief under rule b.this latter claim is foreclosed by the binding precedent of this court and the supreme court.as a result,we deny hernandez motion for a coa.
a texas jury convicted hernandez of aggravated robbery in,and the trial court sentenced him to a term of years imprisonment.the thirteenth court of appeals in corpus christi affirmed his conviction on january.hernandez did not file a petition for discretionary review with the texas court of criminal appeals the cca,so his conviction became final on march,according to hernandez,his attorney never informed him that the court of appeals had denied his appeal or that he had a right to file a petition for discretionary review with the cca.instead,hernandez states,he did not learn his conviction had been affirmed until about two years later when he sent an inquiry to the cca.
hernandez filed a state application for a writ of habeas corpus on june,more than three years after his conviction became final.his state habeas application alleged claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial,ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal,and prosecutorial misconduct.in december,the cca granted the application in part,authorizing hernandez to file an petition for discretionary review and ordering hernandez returned to the point at which he can file a meaningful petition.hernandez filed a petition for discretionary review in january,and the cca denied it on march.
a little more than two months later,on may,hernandez filed his federal habeas petition.the western district of texas docketed the petition under cause number.hernandez federal habeas petition raised the same three claims his state habeas application raised.on may,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order in which it concluded that hernandez petition was barred by aedpa statute of limitations the same day,the district court entered a final judgment.the judgment contained several errors but it is clear from the record that hernandez,the district court,and this court all understood that his petition had been dismissed on limitations grounds in december,this court denied hernandez motion for a coa.fast forward years.on march,hernandez filed a document that the district court treated as a second habeas petition.for reasons we explain below,we ultimately conclude this filing should have been construed as a motion for relief from judgment under rule b.however,the district court construed this filing to be a new,habeas petition and docketed it under a separate cause number.on march,the district court dismissed the new petition because it was a second or successive petition filed without authorization from this court and because it was barred by limitations.the district court also denied a coa.
on april,hernandez timely filed a notice of appeal under cause number that stated that petitioner wishes to appeal this court decision of march.however,the district court did not enter any orders in cause number on march.the order of march,was entered under cause number.hernandez never filed a notice of appeal that listed cause number.
aedpa allows a petitioner to appeal a district court final order in a proceeding only if either this court or the district court issues a coa when the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner underlying constitutional claim,as here,a certificate of appealability should issue only when the prisoner shows both that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.
before turning to the merits of hernandez motion for a coa,we pause to assure ourselves of our jurisdiction habeas proceedings are civil actions and the timely filing of a notice of appeal is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a civil appeal hernandez seeks to appeal an order entered on march,in cause number,but he filed his notice of appeal in cause number.we must determine whether hernandez error in listing the wrong cause number on his notice of appeal divests us of jurisdiction to consider his motion for a coa.
we conclude that it does not.the federal rules of appellate procedure have for their primary purpose the securing of speedy and inexpensive justice in a uniform and well ordered manner they were not adopted to set traps and pitfalls by way of technicalities for unwary litigants.in accordance with that purpose,a policy of liberal construction of notices of appeal prevails in situations where the intent to appeal a mislabeled ruling is apparent and there is no prejudice to the adverse party.the party who makes a simple mistake in designating the judgment appealed from does not forfeit his right of appeal where the intent to pursue it is clear.we have previously held that the mistake of a party whose attorney inadvertently listed the wrong case number on a notice of appeal was excusable neglect where the attorney recognized the mistake and moved to amend the notice today we adopt the view previously expressed by the seventh ninth eleventh and federal circuits that even when an appellant has not moved to correct his mistake in listing an incorrect docket number,the notice of appeal is still effective so long as the the intent to appeal from a specific ruling can fairly be inferred by probing the notice and the other party was not misled or prejudiced.
here,hernandez notice of appeal clearly states his intention to appeal the district court order of march.the arguments in hernandez memorandum of law in support of his motion for a coa also make it apparent that he is challenging the march,order.that he listed the wrong cause number on the notice does not make his intention any less apparent in addition,there is no prejudice to the state,which is not required to file a response to hernandez motion for a coa therefore,we conclude that the notice of appeal that hernandez filed on april,satisfies the requirements of and federal rule of appellate procedure a,giving us jurisdiction to decide the merits of his motion for a coa 
we conclude that hernandez filing of march,should be construed as a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b for relief from the judgment entered in cause number.it is true that hernandez,using the standard form for a petition for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in state custody,styled his march,filing as a habeas petition.but pro se habeas petitions are not held to the same stringent and rigorous standards as are pleadings filed by lawyers.the filings of a federal habeas petitioner who is proceeding pro se are entitled to the benefit of liberal construction it is the substance of the relief sought by a pro se pleading,not the label that the petitioner has attached to it,that determines the true nature and operative effect of a habeas filing 
if hernandez march,filing is construed as a second or successive habeas petition,then it must be dismissed as a threshold matter,hernandez failed to move this court for an order authorizing the district court to consider the petition further,the two claims documented in the march,assistance of trial counsel and denial of due process due to prosecutorial identical to the two claims presented in hernandez habeas petition,which means the march,filing would be a second or successive habeas petition and aedpa mandates that a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.
we should adjudicate hernandez latest filing on its merits if possible and rule b provides a mechanism through which we can do so.a habeas petitioner can not use rule b to present new claims for relief from a state court judgment of conviction or to attack the federal court previous resolution of a claim on the merits.however,where a habeas petitioner merely asserts that a previous ruling which precluded a merits determination was in example,a denial for such reasons as bar,rule b empowers a federal court to hear the petitioner challenge specifically,when the petitioner motion alleges that the federal courts misapplied the federal statute of limitations set out in d,then allowing the motion to proceed as denominated creates no inconsistency with the habeas statute or rules.
liberally construed,hernandez march,filing is just such a motion.both the memorandum of law he attached to that filing and the brief he filed in support of his motion for a coa contend that the supreme court decision in jimenez entitles him to have his habeas petition considered on the merits.as discussed in greater detail below,jimenez announced a new rule for determining when aedpa statute of limitations begins to run in cases in which the cca has allowed the petitioner to file an appeal.the substance of hernandez march,filing thus alleges that the federal courts misapplied the federal statute of limitations set out in d.therefore,we construe that filing,which was docketed under cause number,as a motion under federal rule of civil procedure b for relief from the judgment entered may,in cause number.correspondingly,we treat the district court order of march,as a denial of such a motion.
a habeas petitioner in hernandez situation must obtain a coa before he can appeal the denial of a rule b motion so both the procedural posture of this appeal and our standard of review remain unchanged.t he decision to grant or deny relief under rule b lies within the sound discretion of the district court and will be reversed only for an abuse of that discretion.on hernandez motion for a coa,then,we must determine whether a jurist of reason could conclude that the district court denial of hernandez motion was an abuse of discretion 
hernandez can not demonstrate that he is entitled to relief under rule b.subsections enumerate specific grounds on which a district court may relieve a party from a final judgment,none of which is applicable here rule b authorizes a district court to relieve a party from a final judgment for any other reason that justifies relief.while rule b is commonly referred to as a grand reservoir of equitable power to do justice,the rule is only invoked in extraordinary circumstances.the circumstance on which hernandez supreme court announcement of a new method of calculating the limitations period under d a is not the kind of extraordinary circumstance that warrants relief under rule b.
hernandez argument for relief from the judgment arises out of a distinctive feature of texas habeas jurisprudence.the cca occasionally determines that a state habeas applicant direct appeal should be revived and that the applicant should be allowed to file an petition for discretionary review in the cca.when the cca grants the right to file an petition for discretionary review,it restores the petitioner to the position he was in when he first possessed the right to petition for discretionary review.aedpa statute of limitations does not begin to run until the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.in salinas,we held that the cca decision to allow an direct appeal did not reset aedpa limitations clock the supreme court overruled salinas in jimenez,holding that where a state court grants a criminal defendant the right to file an direct appeal during state collateral review,but before the defendant has first sought federal habeas relief,his judgment is not yet final for purposes of d a.
the gravamen of hernandez rule b motion is a request to have the rule announced in jimenez retroactively applied to revive the federal habeas petition he filed in.hernandez is correct that under the rule announced in jimenez his federal habeas petition was timely he actually filed his federal habeas petition before his direct appeal became final but salinas was still good law when the district court adjudicated hernandez habeas petition in,and the district court was correct to conclude that,under salinas,hernandez petition was barred by limitations nearly years excluding the time during which his state habeas application was pending elapsed between the conclusion of hernandez first direct appeal and the filing of his federal habeas petition.
precedent dictates that hernandez may not use rule b to claim the benefit of the supreme court decision in jimenez.we have previously held that a change in decisional law after entry of judgment does not constitute exceptional circumstances and is not alone grounds for relief from a final judgment under rule b this rule applies with equal force in habeas proceedings under aedpa in fact,the supreme court has considered and rejected the argument that a change in the judicial interpretation of aedpa statute of limitations justifies relief under rule b,reasoning 
the district court interpretation of the aedpa statute of limitations was by all appearances correct under the interpretation of d.it is hardly extraordinary that subsequently,after petitioner case was no longer pending,this court arrived at a different interpretation n ot every interpretation of the federal statutes setting forth the requirements for habeas provides cause for reopening cases long since final.
direct review of hernandez federal habeas petition concluded in december when this court denied his first motion for a coa.hernandez can not use rule b to circumvent the principle that when the supreme court announces a new rule of law and applies it to the parties before it,the new rule is given retroactive effect only in cases that are still open on direct review 
the district court decision to enter judgment dismissing hernandez habeas petition as barred by limitations was correct under the law as it existed in.that the law has subsequently changed does not entitle hernandez to relief from the judgment under rule b.no jurist of reason would debate the correctness of the district court determination that hernandez habeas petition remains barred by limitations.accordingly,his motion for a coa is denied.
