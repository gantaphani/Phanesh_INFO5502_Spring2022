david grillette,a louisiana state prisoner,appeals the district court dismissal of his petition as.grillette was granted a certificate of appealability coa as to whether he is entitled to statutory tolling of the limitations period pursuant to d during the interval between the trial court april,denial of his state habeas application and the filing of his supervisory writ application to the state appellate court on june.for the following reasons,we hold that,under the circumstances presented,grillette state relief proceedings remained pending and thereby tolled the limitations period throughout this interval,rendering his application timely.accordingly,we vacate the district court dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
grillette was convicted by a jury in louisiana eleventh judicial district court,desoto parish,of attempted second degree murder,aggravated burglary,and armed robbery,for which he was sentenced to concurrent terms of,and years imprisonment.grillette convictions and sentences became final on october,when they were affirmed on direct appeal by the louisiana second circuit court of appeal.grillette did not seek direct review in the louisiana supreme court.on july,grillette filed an application for state habeas relief,asserting that he was denied his sixth amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.specifically,grillette argued that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by engaging in the use and manufacture of methamphetamine during the time of grillette trial and by failing to object to allegedly improper and unconstitutional jury instructions on april,after conducting an evidentiary hearing,the trial court vacated grillette attempted second degree murder conviction,but denied his habeas application as to his remaining convictions.on june,grillette filed an application for a supervisory writ with the louisiana second circuit court of appeal.the louisiana court of appeal reached the merits of the case,but denied relief on june,grillette then timely filed an application for supervisory writs with the louisiana supreme court on june.on may,the louisiana supreme court denied the writs without assigning reasons.
on april,grillette filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in federal district court,challenging his remaining state court convictions.the magistrate judge sua sponte recommended that grillette petition be dismissed with prejudice as by the limitation period imposed by the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.because grillette conviction became final prior to the aedpa april,effective date,he was entitled to a grace period from that date in the absence of statutory or equitable tolling to file a federal habeas petition.egerton cockrell,cir citing flanagan johnson,cir.the magistrate judge determined that grillette state application tolled the limitations period under d until april,while it was pending in the trial court.from that point,grillette had days within which to timely file a supervisory writ application to the louisiana court of appeal.see louisiana courts of appeal uniform rule.the magistrate judge found,however,that grillette had neither filed a writ application to the appellate court within that period nor obtained an extension of the return date.citing melancon kaylo,cir,the magistrate judge determined that tolling of the limitations period therefore ceased on may,when the days allotted by rule had passed.the magistrate judge further concluded that grillette was not entitled to any further tolling under d.the magistrate judge reasoned that by the time grillette filed his supervisory writ application with the louisiana court of appeal on june,more than one year had elapsed since this application was rendered untimely under rule therefore,the aedpa limitations period had already expired.
grillette filed objections to the magistrate judge recommendation of dismissal,contending that he was entitled to equitable tolling because his case presented rare and extraordinary circumstances and because he had diligently pursued relief.grillette also argued that he was entitled to further statutory tolling.contrary to the magistrate judge conclusion,grillette averred,his writ application to the louisiana court of appeal was filed timely because he gave notice of his intent to take a w rit on the issues related to the two convictions left standing and the court had granted him an extension on the return date,set ting it for june.in support of his contentions,grillette presented a letter dated july,from the trial judge,judge beasley,verifying that following his april written judgment,he was aware that grillette,through counsel,intended to file a writ of supervisory review to the louisiana second circuit court of appeal.judge beasley further wrote that b ecause he was aware that grillette new defense counsel had been diligently trying to locate and gather the documentation necessary for a writ application,he believed it appropriate to extend the return date until june.nonetheless,on august,the district court denied grillette objections,adopted the reasons stated in the magistrate judge recommendation,and entered a judgment dismissing grillette petition.grillette then timely filed notice of appeal and sought a coa from the district court,which the district court denied on september.
this court granted a coa as to whether grillette is entitled to tolling of the limitations period pursuant to d during the interval between the trial court denial of his application and the filing of his writ application to the appellate court,but denied coa on the issue whether the defendant was entitled to equitable tolling.for the following reasons,we vacate the district court dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
discussion 
in a federal habeas corpus case,we review de novo the district court denial of a application on procedural grounds.melancon kaylo,cir citing emerson johnson,cir.the aedpa established a statute of limitations on the filing of federal habeas applications.d.federal habeas applicants,such as grillette,whose convictions became final prior to the aedpa april,enactment,had a grace period until april,to file a federal habeas application.melancon,at citing hall cain,cir.however,pursuant to d,a properly filed state application tolls any aedpa limitations period,including the grace period,throughout the entire time during which the application is pending.smith ward,cir citing fields johnson,cir stating that the d tolling provision is applicable to this grace period for filing following aedpa effective date.
the supreme court clarified in carey saffold,d,that a state habeas application is pending,in the context of d,as long as the ordinary state collateral review process is in continuance,or,in other words,until the application has achieved final resolution through the state procedures.saffold,at.thus,a petitioner is entitled to,and indeed often must invoke,one full round of collateral review in state court before seeking federal habeas relief.id.at.while that full round of state habeas proceedings is properly in progress,aedpa period of limitations is tolled.id.the supreme court emphasized that such a construction of aedpa and its limitations period protects the principles of comity,finality,and federalism,by promoting the exhaustion of state remedies while respecting the interest in the finality of state court judgments.id.quoting duncan walker,d.
it is undisputed that grillette state application,filed july,was pending with the trial court for almost six years,until april,when the trial court granted in part and denied in part the application.accordingly,his state application clearly tolled the federal limitations period,which began on april,the day after the aedpa became effective,until april.a state habeas application remains pending,and thus continues to toll aedpa limitations period,during the interval between a state trial court disposition of the habeas application and the applicant timely filing of a notice of appeal or petition for review in the next court.saffold,at.grillette application therefore remained pending until at least may,when,in the absence of an extension,the deadline under louisiana courts of appeal uniform rule for filing a writ application to the louisiana second circuit would have expired.see saffold,at.accord,melancon,at holding that d tolls the entire period allotted for timely state appellate review.the version of rule in effect at the time of the trial court denial of grillette habeas petition and the filing of his writ application provided that a trial court shall fix a reasonable time not to exceed thirty days from the date of the trial court adverse ruling,during which period the applicant must apply to the appellate court grillette,however,did not file his supervisory writ application until june,by which time nearly thirteen months had elapsed after the trial court denial of relief.though grillette subsequent properly filed writ application ordinarily would entitle him to further statutory tolling from the time of the proper filing,the magistrate judge concluded that no additional tolling under d was available to grillette in this case because his june,writ application was filed more than days after the federal limitations period began to run.
the primary question for our consideration on appeal,therefore,becomes whether the period starting may,when the ordinary window for filing a supervisory writ closed,until june,the date grillette properly filed his supervisory writ application to the louisiana court of appeal,qualifies under aedpa relevant tolling provision as time during which a properly filed application for state review is pending.d emphasis added.if so,aedpa limitations period would be tolled during this interval,making grillette petition timely.if,on the other hand,grillette state application ceased to be pending during the period from may,to june,the limitations period would not be tolled and,consequently,the federal courts would have no jurisdiction to entertain his federal habeas petition.
in determining whether grillette state habeas application for state relief was pending within the meaning of d,we must look to whether it was filed in compliance with louisiana timeliness requirements.see saffold,at.cook morrill,cir.in saffold,the supreme court established that an unambiguous ruling by the state court that a state habeas application is untimely,regardless of whether the state court nonetheless reached the merits,ends our inquiry,because a state application ceases to be pending when the time for appellate review expires.at.in this case,the louisiana court of appeal minute order neither indicated that grillette june,filing of his supervisory writ was untimely,nor did it expressly state that it was timely.rather,the louisiana court of appeal succinctly disposed of the application on the merits,stating simply writ denied.on the showing made,the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction is not warranted.see state penns,so d.state grillette,d cir unpublished.
citing saffold,grillette argues that the louisiana court of appeal consideration of his writ application on the merits evidences that court implicit determination that the application was timely filed pursuant to rule,and that principles of comity and state exhaustion requirements dictate that this court defer to the state appellate court construction of its own timeliness rules.see saffold,at.grillette further asserts that this court decision in dixon cain,cir per curiam,compels the conclusion that his writ application was in fact timely under rule because he gave timely oral notice to the trial court of his intent to file a supervisory writ application and the trial court,by setting a return date beyond rule period,or until june,impliedly extended the return date under extenuating circumstances that were due to no fault of his own.the state counters that saffold forecloses grillette argument that the louisiana court of appeal consideration of his writ application on the merits proves that his application was timely.the state further argues that melancon,relied upon by the magistrate judge,is on all fours with this case,and therefore grillette application ceased to be pending in state court when he failed to file his supervisory writ application within rule time limit and failed to file a motion for and obtain an extension on the return date.after thoroughly reviewing the record and pertinent authorities,we find that resolution of the statutory tolling issue before us lies between this court decisions in melancon and dixon,and that the issue must be resolved in favor of grillette.
in melancon,approximately five months elapsed between the trial court december,relief and melancon may,filing of his supervisory writ application to the louisiana court of appeal.melancon,at.melancon,appearing pro se,did not give notice of his intent to seek a writ until sometime well after rule deadline had expired.see dixon,at discussing the record and briefs presented in melancon.the trial court signed the notice of intent on either may or may,and set the return date for may.see id.in its opinion,the louisiana court of appeal noted that the writ application appeared to be untimely because there was no indication that any extension on the return date had been granted.id.citing state melancon.cir unpublished.nonetheless,because the appellate court ordered an evidentiary hearing in response to melancon writ,it proceeded to dispose of his claim on the merits.melancon,at.a panel of this court held that melancon state habeas application ceased to be pending when the period for seeking a writ had expired,reasoning that at no time during that period had melancon given notice of his intent to seek a writ,asked the court to set a return date,or requested an extension on the return date.id.at.on the facts presented,the four untolled months between january,when the days allotted by rule passed,and the filing of melancon supervisory writ rendered his petition untimely.
in dixon,by contrast,we held that the applicant federal habeas petition was timely because his state habeas application remained pending throughout the interval from the trial court denial of relief to his filing of his petition,even though his application for supervisory writs was filed after the deadline ordinarily imposed by rule.dixon,at.in that case,dixon timely filed his notice of intent to seek a supervisory writ approximately one week after the trial court august,denial of his state habeas application.id.at.in his notice,dixon requested that the trial court set a return date of a reasonable time of not less than sixty days from the filing of this notice for the writ application to be filed with the first circuit court of appeal.id.the trial court set the return date for october.dixon did not file his supervisory writ application until october,more than days after the trial court denial of relief but within the time allotted by the trial court.id.we held that dixon application was timely filed,reasoning that louisiana courts consider the trial court setting of a return date later than thirty days to be an implicit extension of the return date in accordance with rule.id.citing brock duhe,so d.we further observed that,t his is at least so when the filing of the return date is pursuant to the appellant timely request for a return date beyond the thirty day limit,as it was in dixon case id.quoting watts dorignac,so d.cir stating that i f the notice of intent to seek writs a motion and order requesting a return date was filed with the trial court within days of the ruling at issue,this court has interpreted a return date set outside the day period as an implicit extension of the return date by the trial court.accordingly,we concluded that b ecause dixon timely both sought and obtained an extension of the appeal period,his application to the louisiana court of appeal was not only timely filed but was never in an untimely status,and his case is thus distinguished from melancon.id.at.we explained that in melancon 
t here was nothing in the record or briefs to indicate that the prisoner there ever,or ever during the thirty days next following the trial court december,denial of relief,sought any
