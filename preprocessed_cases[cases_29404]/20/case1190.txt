the petitioners are lawful permanent resident aliens who pleaded guilty to marihuana possession offenses and received deferred adjudication in state court.based on their guilty pleas,the government successfully sought their removal from the united states.although at the time of their guilty pleas the board of immigration appeals bia interpreted the relevant immigration statutes as not requiring removal for this type of deferred adjudication or at least as allowing for discretionary relief from removal,the petitioners were found to be removable and ineligible for discretionary relief based on precedent that developed after entry of their pleas.they filed for habeas corpus relief,which was denied by the district court.finding no error,we affirm.
laura estela and nohemi are lawful permanent residents who filed habeas petitions in federal district court regarding findings that they were removable and ineligible for discretionary relief from removal the habeas petitions were consolidated with seven other similar petitions.the district court denied the petitions,and all the petitioners appealed.and cases were selected as the lead cases for briefing and argument.we examine the facts of each of their cases in turn.
pleaded guilty on january,in texas state court of possession of a controlled substance intentional and knowing possession of to pounds of marihuana.it was her first offense,and she received deferred adjudication of guilty and was placed on probation for years.on august,the immigration and naturalization service ins commenced removal proceedings against her on the grounds that she was an alien who has been convicted of a controlled substance offense pursuant to a b i an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony pursuant to a a iii,namely a drug trafficking crime as defined by a b and c.
denied deportability and moved to terminate the proceedings,contending she was not convicted for immigration purposes under the state exception created in matter of manrique,wl,bia,which held that a state drug offense of simple possession should not be considered a conviction for immigration purposes if the alien would have hypothetically been eligible for treatment under the federal first offender act ffoa had he been prosecuted under federal narcotics laws.the immigration judge ij agreed that deferred adjudication was not a conviction and concluded that her crime of drug possession would not be punishable as a felony under federal law,and thereby was not an aggravated felony under matter of,wl,bia.
the ins appealed the termination of the removal proceedings,and the bia reversed,concluding that was deportable on either ground.the bia found that the deferred adjudication did constitute a conviction for immigration purposes under the statutory definition of conviction enacted by congress in,after manrique but before guilty plea the bia pointed to its conclusion in matter of roldan,wl,bia,that the statutory definition superseded manrique.furthermore,the bia concluded that was alternatively removable because her state felony crime constituted an aggravated felony under united states,cir which held that a state felony drug possession crime constitutes an aggravated felony for federal sentencing purposes,and united states,cir which extended the definition to immigration proceedings and explicitly rejected matter of.filed a habeas petition in federal district court,challenging the bia conclusion.the denial of that petition is the subject of the instant appeal.
pleaded guilty on march,in texas state court to felony possession of marihuana between and pounds and was granted deferred adjudication.the ins placed her in removal proceedings and charged her with being deportable as an alien convicted of a controlled substances offense.she conceded that she was deportable as and applied for discretionary relief pursuant to on may,the ij found that she deserved relief as a matter of discretion.
the ins appealed,and the bia reversed,concluding that based on intervening precedent since the time of the prior decision,crime of felony drug possession was an aggravated felony under matter of,wl,bia,which adopted the construction set forth in.because the bia found that had committed an aggravated felony,it decided that the ij had abused his discretion by granting discretionary relief.filed a habeas petition in federal district court challenging the bia conclusion.its denial is the subject of the instant appeal.
we review questions of law as to jurisdiction and merits de novo.see pasquarell,cir.we review the ins constructions of the law it administers deferentially,under the test established by chevron,natural resources defense council,d.see ins,d.
on reviewing an agency construction of a statute it administers,we must perform the inquiry first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.if,however,the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.rather,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
moosa ins,cir citing chevron,at.
the ins argues that the district court erred when it held that it the district court had jurisdiction over petition.the essence of the ins argument is that we,as the court of appeals,had jurisdiction to review her appeal from the bia decision directly,and her habeas petition should therefore have been dismissed because she failed to exhaust her other available remedies before filing that petition 
in resolving this jurisdictional question,the first issue to address is whether we would have had jurisdiction to review claims on direct appeal.as a threshold matter,a the statute governing review of final orders of that review of such orders shall take place in the courts of appeals by means of petitions for direct review.section a c,however,eliminates jurisdiction to review final orders of removal involving aliens who are deportable for conviction of certain crimes,including controlled substances offenses and aggravated felonies 
despite this jurisdictional bar,it is well established that we retain jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction specifically,
w hen confronted with a petition for review from a criminal alien,a court of appeals must make three specific inquiries before dismissing the petition as barred a c whether specific conditions act to bar jurisdiction over the petition to review whether the conditions that bar example as in this case,deportation for an aggravated been constitutionally applied and if the jurisdictional bar applies,whether the remaining quantum of review satisfies the constitution.
garcia,at.the issues raised by appear to fall squarely into what we have previously considered to be part of the jurisdictional inquiry she challenges whether she was convicted for the purposes of removal,and she brings constitutional challenges retroactivity,due process,and equal protection to whether the conditions that bar jurisdiction whether her deferred adjudication was a conviction and whether her offense was an aggravated felony apply 
finally,notes that a couple of her claims could not have been reviewed by us,her challenge to her ineligibility for discretionary relief and her international law argument.she is correct,for these questions do not address the jurisdictional inquiry as we framed it in garcia,id.
the issues that we do have jurisdiction to consider on direct review,however,are threshold issues that must be considered before reaching ineligibility for discretionary relief.as we explained in lee,at,wl,at.lexis,at,the proper procedure in such a situation is first to file a petition for direct review.if we then determine that the statute,a c,does not apply because,for example,we decide that the offense was not an aggravated felony,then the alien is not removable,and our inquiry ends.see id.if,on the other hand,we determine that the alien is removable and the statute applies,we dismiss the case,and the alien,lacking another avenue of review,can proceed in habeas.see id.in sum,we agree with the government contention that we had jurisdiction to entertain the threshold issues in appeal on direct review.
because there was jurisdiction for us to hear appeal on direct review,the government urges us to dismiss her habeas petition for failure to exhaust available judicial remedies the district court correctly noted that at the time when filed her habeas petition in the district court,there was debate among the circuits as to whether the requirement of exhaustion of available judicial remedies still applies in the wake of ins cyr,d several courts have held that the availability of an alternative forum of review does not conclusively determine,in the absence of plain congressional intent,that habeas jurisdiction is no longer available other circuits have ruled the other way,holding that there is no habeas jurisdiction to review an alien removal order where he failed to exhaust available judicial remedies 
although we had not ruled on this precise jurisdictional issue at the time the district court considered habeas petition,we have since adopted the position that the exhaustion requirement still applies.cyr.see lee gonzales,cir.because we have determined that we could have reviewed claims on direct review,and she failed to pursue that avenue of relief before filing her habeas petition in the district court,dismissal of her habeas petition is appropriate.
despite this,not all is lost for,for we decline to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in this case and may consider the merits of the issues raised by her habeas petition,because transfer to this court is appropriate in the interest of justice under which provides 
whether a civil action is filed in a court as defined in section of of this title or an appeal,including a petition for review of administrative action,is noticed for or filed with such court and the court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction,the court shall,if it is in the interest of justice,transfer such action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal shall proceed as if it had been filed in or noticed for the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in or noticed for the court from which it is transferred.
in the immigration context,that statute authorizes us to transfer these cases to this court if we would have been able to exercise jurisdiction on the date that they were filed in the district court the district court lacked jurisdiction over the cases and the transfer is in the interests of justice.ins,cir 
the first requirement is met here,because we would have had jurisdiction to review the bia disposition of claims on direct review,and she filed her habeas petition in the district court within the deadline for filing for direct review next,we have decided that the district court lacked habeas jurisdiction because failed to exhaust her available judicial remedies.finally,it would be in the interest of justice to allow this relief,given that the caselaw regarding this procedure was admittedly murky.cyr,and the purpose of the transfer statute is to aid litigants who were confused about the proper forum for review.baeta,at internal citations omitted.
as a final complication,we must deal with the claims that could not have brought on direct review,namely,her challenge to her ineligibility for discretionary relief and her international law claim.the district court pointed to the existence of these claims to justify retaining jurisdiction over all of claims.
the ninth circuit has taken a different splits the claims into those that could have been brought on direct appeal and those that could not,and treats them differently this approach is preferable,because it comports with the procedure recommended in lee,at,wl,at.lexis,at an alien first present his threshold jurisdictional issues on direct appeal,and then if unsuccessful pursue the remainder of his claims in because it also prevents a litigant from manufacturing habeas jurisdiction by bootstrapping,onto his habeas petition,frivolous issues that could not be reviewed on direct appeal.
thus,pursuant to,we transfer all of claims other than her challenge to her ineligibility for discretionary relief and her international law claim to this court for consideration on the merits.because habeas jurisdiction was proper for the remaining claims,we do not transfer those,and we consider them on the merits as properly appealed to us after being denied by the district court.
challenges the bia decision that her texas deferred adjudication constitutes a conviction for removal purposes.importantly,no definition of conviction existed before.in this context,the bia decided matter of manrique,wl,bia,which held that aliens who received deferred adjudication for drug offenses in state court who would be eligible for discretionary deferred adjudication under the had they been prosecuted under federal drug not be considered to have a conviction for immigration removal purposes.see id.at.that decision was based on a policy consideration that the appropriate focus should be on the alien conduct,not the breadth of the state rehabilitative statute the bia decided that leniency should be extended to aliens to provide them the same treatment they would have received under federal law if they had been subject to federal rather than state prosecution.see id.at.
in,congress drafted a concrete definition of conviction for immigration purposes 
the term conviction means,with respect to an alien,a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or,if adjudication of guilt has been withheld,where 
i a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt,and 
ii the judge has ordered some form of punishment,penalty,or restraint on the alien liberty to be imposed.
a.in matter of roldan,bia,the bia determined that this new definition abrogated manrique,noting that manrique and the decisions it relied on were decided in the absence of any indication from congress as to whether a state rehabilitative action should be given any effect in immigration proceedings.roldan,at.the bia observed that the plain language of a dictated that 
a state action that purports to abrogate what would otherwise be considered a conviction,as the result of a state rehabilitative statute,rather than as a result of a procedure that vacates a conviction on the merits or on grounds relating to a statutory or constitutional violation,has no effect in determining whether an alien has been convicted for immigration purposes.
id.at.the bia assumed that congress was aware of its administrative exception for deportability that was created in manrique but noted that congress had failed to provide any exceptions that would allow the manrique exception to survive.see id.
mainly by citing and crediting the arguments made in the roldan dissents,argues that roldan incorrectly concluded that a overruled manrique.as the district court correctly found,however,that question is foreclosed by moosa ins,cir,which held that c onsidering only the text of a,a texas deferred adjudication,see supra note,is a conviction.exercising chevron deference,we can not say that the bia interpretation of the statute it is charged with administering was an impermissible construction in light of our binding precedent in moosa,in which we found this construction to be dictated by the text of the statute.see id.at.
and claim that the bia erroneously applied our construction of aggravated felony expressed in united states,cir.congress has defined aggravated felony for immigration purposes to mean,inter alia,a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title.a b.section c of title,in turn,defines drug trafficking crime to include any felony punishable under the controlled substances act et c,at.
as of,the bia used a hypothetical federal felony approach in defining aggravated felonies,which included any state offense that would be punishable as a felony under the controlled substances act if it were a federal offense.see id.at matter of,wl,bia.based on this reading,the bia construed state felony drug possession as not coming within the definition of aggravated felony for immigration purposes.see,at.meanwhile,we used a different interpretation in federal sentencing cases,construing the definition of aggravated felony to include offenses that are punishable under the controlled substances act whether as a felony or not and a felony in the law of the convicting jurisdiction.this led to divergent results.see id.at citing united states,cir.
in,we resolved this discrepancy by extending to the immigration context the definition of aggravated felony as established by.we decided that the plain language of the statutes indicate s that congress made a deliberate policy decision to include as an aggravated felony a drug crime that is a felony under state law but only as a misdemeanor under the controlled substances act,and that a lack of a uniform substantive test for determining which drug offenses qualify as aggravated felonies is the consequence of a deliberate policy choice by congress that the bia and the courts can not disregard internal citations omitted.
the bia directly applied in case,and to the extent that her argument attacks that case as wrongly decided,it is foreclosed by our obligation to follow the prior panel opinion.similarly,we can not say that the bia was incorrect to apply matter of,wl,bia adopting the rule to,because we are bound by,which tells us that the plain language of the statute dictates the interpretation of aggravated felony made by the bia in.accordingly,we can not say that the bia,in light of chevron deference,made an unreasonable interpretation of the statute that it is charged to administer.
and claim that their due process rights were violated by the retroactive application of roldan and to them,because they pleaded guilty before those rulings were made.as correctly noted by the district court,the retroactive application of judicial decisions is a longstanding maxim.the general principle that statutes operate prospectively and judicial decisions apply retroactively had been followed by the common law and the supreme court decisions for near a thousand years.hulin fibreboard,cir quoting kuhn fairmont coal.holmes,dissenting.
this reasoning originates from the notion that w hen the courts appl y a rule of federal law to the parties before it,that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events,regardless of whether such events predate or postdate the court announcement of the rule.harper.dep t of taxation,d.the logic is that judges say what the law is,rather than what the law shall be as legislatures do overruling a former judicial decision is not a new declaration of law,but rather a new decision that corrects legal error.see id.at scalia,concurring citing marbury madison,cranch.
first,argues that principles of administrative rather than judicial retroactivity should be applied,citing microcomputer tech.inst.riley,cir as we stated in riley,
when an agency changes its policy prospectively,a reviewing court need only determine the reasonableness of the new interpretation in terms of chevron.but where an agency makes a change with retroactive effect,the reviewing court must also determine whether application of the new policy to a party who relied on the old is so unfair as to be arbitrary and capricious.
id.we concluded that in evaluating the retroactive effect of a change in administrative policy,we balance the ills of retroactivity against the disadvantages of prospectivity.id.
we do not apply the administrative retroactivity test in this case,where the rule that is sought to be applied retroactively is not a change in administrative policy,but rather an administrative decision that interprets a statutory change.in riley,the petitioner claimed reliance on policy stated in a memorandum,issued by the agency,that was contrary to the administrative decision made by the agency in his case.see id.at.
may claim reliance on policy expressed in manrique before her guilty plea,but the fact is that a,defining conviction,also predated her plea,and thus roldan did not constitute a sua sponte change in policy that we review for arbitrariness and capriciousness,but rather a determination that the statute that it was charged with administering abrogated its prior policy.roldan was not establishing a new rule or standard of conduct,but was merely determining the effect of a superseding act of congress.
the petitioners also claim,citing hulin,at,that the judicial retroactivity doctrine is inapplicable to apply roldan and to their cases because they claim that judicial retroactivity can not trump the claimed due process violation,the requirement of fair notice under bmw of north america gore,d.in hulin,we noted several instances in which a new rule does not determine the outcome of the case 
thus,a court may find an alternative way of curing the constitutional violation,or a previously existing,independent legal basis having nothing to do with retroactivity for denying relief,or as in the law of qualified immunity,a general legal rule that trumps the new rule of law,which general rule reflects both reliance interests and other significant policy justifications,or a principle of law,such as that of finality present in the teague context,that limits the principle of retroactivity itself.but,this case where a concern about reliance alone has led the ohio court to create what amounts to an ad hoc exemption from retroactivity involves no such instance.
hulin,at citing reynoldsville casket hyde,d.we then added 
evidently,the supreme court has concluded that the linkletter and chevron oil departures from traditional retroactivity doctrine proved unsatisfactory.the court most recent decisions substantially reject those departures and return to the general rule of adjudicative retroactivity leaving only an indistinct possibility of the application of pure prospectivity in an extremely unusual and unforeseeable case.
id.emphasis added.the petitioners then cite language from cyr,at,which stated that it would be contrary to familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance and settled expectations to disrupt a plea bargain by making drastic,retroactive,changes to its immigration claim that it establishes the extremely unusual circumstances envisioned by hulin that may allow for the indistinct possibility that judicial rulings not be given retroactive effect.
the flaw in petitioners presentation is that it is in essence nothing more than an argument that the rulings should not be applied retroactively because of reliance petitioners detrimentally relied on the bia pronouncements and.the supreme court has repeatedly rejected reliance alone as a reason for overcoming the retroactivity doctrine in this context,where reliance interests alone are insufficient to overcome judicial retroactivity,petitioners fail to cite any cases that dictate a general legal rule that trumps the new rule of law,which general rule reflects both reliance interests and other significant policy justifications as in the law of qualified immunity.hulin,at emphasis added.
although it is true that in cyr,at,the court noted the problems of fair notice in the context of attaching new disabilities to plea agreements,that case dealt with the question whether a statutory change could be applied retroactively by command of congress,and did not deal with whether a judicial decision can be applied in such a way.see cyr,at.this distinction is the plain,correct statement of the law provided cyr with the type of relief he desired at the time of his plea agreement,and were relying on plainly erroneous interpretations of the law in expecting relief at the time they pleaded guilty,as illuminated by the bia in roldan and by this court in the district court
