argelio gonzales,an indiana state prisoner serving a sentence for various offenses,challenges the district court denial of his habeas corpus petition.on appeal,gonzales argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel as a result of his trial counsel conflicts of interest.we affirm.
background 
attorney jay hirschauer represented gonzales at a jury trial that began on april,and ended april.the indiana court of appeals summarized the facts presented at trial as follows 
o n december,indiana state police and logansport police department officers conducted an undercover sting operation in which gonzales sold a police informant a total of grams of crack cocaine during two transactions conducted inside gonzales apartment.police recorded the transactions on both audio and video tape.a subsequent search of the apartment,which gonzales shared with two other individuals,produced grams of crack cocaine,grams of powder cocaine,and grams of marijuana.police also discovered an additional grams of crack cocaine on the ground below a second story bedroom window.the apartment was located feet from crayon campus,a licensed child care home.
the jury found gonzales guilty of possession of cocaine and dealing cocaine within feet of school property,possession of marijuana,and maintaining a common nuisance.the court sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of years on each of the cocaine charges,and months on each of the other two charges.on direct appeal,the indiana court of appeals upheld gonzales convictions and sentences.gonzales did not file a petition for transfer to the indiana supreme court.
in an amended petition filed on november,in cass county circuit court,gonzales raised four arguments his trial counsel simultaneous representation of him,codefendants jorge perez and laura lapcheska,and exculpatory witnesses arnaldo garcia and larry campbell violated his right to counsel and impaired his counsel representation of him his counsel failed to present exculpatory evidence at trial he was deprived of his right to a unanimous jury verdict and his appellate counsel,who also was his trial counsel,was ineffective in failing to raise the verdict issue on direct appeal.
at the evidentiary hearing on gonzales amended petition,hirschauer agreed that he represented lapcheska at the same time as gonzales.hirschauer explained that an initial written plea agreement offered to lapcheska called for her to plead guilty to possession of cocaine in exchange for a prison sentence.it did not mention her testifying against gonzales.according to hirschauer,the prosecutor never made an offer to lapcheska which required her to testify against gonzales.if such an offer was made,hirschauer said that he would not have communicated it to her but,rather,he would have gotten out of the case due to a conflict of interest.lapcheska ultimately refused the first plea agreement.after a month or two,lapcheska accepted a second written plea agreement for years imprisonment.like the first plea agreement,it did not require her to testify.hirschauer said that the prosecution had no need for lapcheska to testify against gonzales because the police had both gonzales and lapcheska on videotape.after reviewing copies of lapcheska first and second plea agreements,hirschauer testified that neither required her to testify against anyone.hirschauer said that the second plea agreement provided that she give a statement,but he did not think that she ever did 
laura lapcheska testified that she and gonzales had dated,engaged in a drug deal operation,and were arrested at the same time.the first plea agreement offered to her included a prison sentence and required her to provide a statement.according to lapcheska,hirschauer explained to her and to her parents that a statement entailed testimony about her involvement with drug dealing and that she would be exempt from any prosecution other than murder.when asked whether hirschauer explanation of the statement included a requirement to testify against gonzales,lapcheska responded,well,to tell what happened,he explained it as i would have to mention,to name,and to me,to mention anybody name would be giving testimony against them so yes.lapcheska said that once hirschauer explained the statement,she decided not to accept the first plea agreement.lapcheska testified further that she later accepted a plea agreement that did not require a statement.
on,after being shown the first written plea agreement,lapcheska acknowledged that it contained no reference to a statement.she added that she did not recall reading the agreement.she did remember that hirschauer discussed the plea agreement with her and her parents.lapcheska agreed that it was possible that she was confused about when the conversation between her,hirschauer,and her parents took place,but said that she remembered that she did not accept the first plea agreement because she refused to testify against gonzales.
arlita morehead,lapcheska mother,testified that while she did not remember who explained the statement,she said that it was explained that lapcheska would have to testify against gonzales.morehead could not remember whether hirschauer was even present during this alleged explanation.
gonzales testified that hirschauer never told him that he also represented lapcheska,perez,campbell,and garcia.gonzales said hirschauer never discussed any conflict of interest with him.
the first and second plea agreements offered to lapcheska were admitted as exhibits at the hearing.the first plea agreement had no provision for lapcheska to testify against anyone or to give a statement.the second plea agreement,entered on march,provided in pertinent part 
a.the defendant agrees to plead guilty to the information charging dealing cocaine within of school property.
b.the state of indiana agrees to dismiss the information charging count,and and any criminal activity prior to disclosed by defendant in a statement given by.
c.the court will impose as a sentence in this case the following 
twenty years imprisonment in indiana department of corrections.
the cass county circuit court found that neither plea agreement required lapcheska to testify against anyone.the court interpreted the second plea agreement to mean that the charges against lapcheska in counts,and would be dismissed,and that the state of indiana agreed not to file charges against lapcheska for any criminal activity that she committed prior to december,and disclosed in a statement based on these findings of fact,the circuit court held that the evidence was insufficient to support a charge of ineffective assistance of trial counsel based on conflicts of interest arising out of hirschauer representation of various defendants.the court did,however,set aside gonzales conviction for dealing cocaine on the basis that he was deprived of his right to a unanimous jury verdict.
before the indiana court of appeals,gonzales argued that hirschauer had a conflict of interest due to his joint representation of him,lapcheska,perez,garcia,and campbell.with respect to lapcheska,gonzales argued that a conflict of interest arose when hirschauer negotiated a plea agreement for lapcheska that called for her to testify against gonzales.citing cuyler sullivan,d,gonzales maintained that because he showed an actual conflict of interest,he did not need to demonstrate prejudice,that is,that there was a reasonable probability that,but for the ineffective assistance,the result of the proceedings would have been different.see strickland washington,d.
the indiana court of appeals set out the standards for ineffective assistance of counsel stated in both strickland,at,and cuyler,at,and then noted that gonzales raised an actual conflict of interest argument only as to hirschauer dual representation of gonzales and lapcheska.the court found no actual conflict of interest because its review of the record demonstrated that the terms of the plea agreements that hirschauer negotiated for lapcheska did not require lapcheska to testify against gonzales,and because lapcheska never gave a statement.the court concluded that gonzales failed to demonstrate an actual conflict of interest consequently,the indiana court of appeals affirmed the circuit court ruling on gonzales petition.
gonzales filed a petition to transfer to the indiana supreme court stating that the question presented on transfer was 
argelio gonzales attorney,jay hirschauer,tried to help the state prosecute gonzales by negotiating a plea agreement for gonzales which called for the to testify against gonzales.the court of appeals erred in finding that this did not create a conflict of interest.
the indiana supreme court denied transfer.
gonzales then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under in which he raised the three issues that had been advanced on his direct appeal and a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.the district court determined that although gonzales attempted to present multiple reasons for counsel ineffectiveness,the only issue exhausted in the indiana courts,and therefore properly considered on habeas corpus review,was the issue presented in the petition to transfer set out above.the district court concluded that,b ecause gonzales has not demonstrated that the state court was unreasonable in its determination of his claim that his attorney was ineffective because of a conflict of interest,this ground presents no basis for habeas corpus relief.after the district court denied gonzales a certificate of appealability,we issued a certificate only on the question of whether gonzales received ineffective assistance of counsel.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,gonzales contends that the district court erred when it rejected his claim that he is being held in violation of the sixth amendment to the united states constitution because he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his trial attorney simultaneously represented him,lapcheska,and campbell.gonzales maintains that the conflicts affected the adequacy of his attorney representation and that,under such circumstances,prejudice is presumed.
our review of a district court denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is de novo.julian bartley,cir.we review the decision of the last state court that substantively adjudicated each claim.watson anglin,cir.we must evaluate gonzales petition under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,specifically d.see knowles mirzayance,d.under that provision,federal habeas relief may not be granted with respect to a claim which was adjudicated on the merits in the state court unless the adjudication

resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.

conflict of interest as a result of representing campbell 
the state of indiana argues that the district court properly determined that gonzales procedurally defaulted his claim based on hirschauer dual representation of him and campbell when he failed to make this argument in his petition to transfer to the indiana supreme court.we agree.
a federal court may not grant an application for a writ of habeas corpus from a prisoner being held in state custody unless the petitioner has exhausted his available state remedies prior to seeking federal habeas relief.see b a.this doctrine serves the interests of comity by giving states the first opportunity to address and correct alleged violations of a petitioner federal rights.lieberman thomas,cir.fair presentment contemplates that the operative facts and the controlling legal principles of the federal claim be submitted to the state court through one complete round of review,either on direct appeal or in proceedings.malone walls,cir.a habeas petitioner who has exhausted his state court remedies without properly asserting his federal claim at each level of state court review has procedurally defaulted that claim.lewis sternes,cir.whether a claim is procedurally defaulted is a question of law this court reviews de novo.malone,at.
gonzales concedes that his conflict of interest claim based on hirschauer dual representation of him and campbell was not included in the question presented on transfer section of his petition for transfer to the indiana supreme court,but maintains that he made that argument in his petition for transfer,thereby alerting the indiana supreme court that he was raising the issue.we disagree.
gonzales included a description of hirschauer dual representation of him and campbell in the background and prior treatment of issues section of his petition for transfer but made no substantive argument that an actual conflict of interest arose out of that dual representation.the passing references to campbell did not sufficiently alert the indiana supreme court that gonzales was arguing that there was an actual conflict of interest as a result of hirschauer dual representation of gonzales and campbell.see stevens mcbride,cir t he failure to alert the state court to a complaint about one aspect of counsel assistance will lead to a procedural default.the question presented on transfer to the indiana supreme court was clearly limited to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel growing out of hirschauer dual representation of gonzales and lapcheska.thus,we agree with the district court determination that this issue is procedurally defaulted 
where,as here,a petitioner has procedurally defaulted a claim,he may obtain federal habeas relief only if he can show either cause and prejudice for the default,some external obstacle prevented petitioner from presenting his claim to the state courts or that a failure to grant him relief would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice,a claim that the constitutional deprivation probably has resulted in a conviction of one who is actually innocent.bintz bertrand,cir.gonzales does not make either of these arguments.for these reasons,the claim of an actual conflict of interest arising from hirschauer dual representation of gonzales and campbell is procedurally defaulted.
conflict of interest as a result of representing lapcheska 
one of the basic duties that counsel owes to a criminal defendant is a duty of loyalty,including a duty to avoid conflicts of interest.strickland,at.m ultiple representation does not violate the sixth amendment unless it gives rise to a conflict of interest.cuyler,at.a lawyer representing codefendants whose interests conflict can not provide adequate legal assistance.id.at.
to establish ineffective assistance of counsel under strickland,a petitioner must establish that his attorney representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for the ineffective assistance,the result of the proceedings would have been different.strickland,at.in contrast,under cuyler,to establish a violation of the sixth amendment,a defendant who raised no objection at trial must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.id.at.while a defendant who shows that a conflict of interest adversely affected his counsel performance need not show prejudice to prevail,until a defendant shows that his counsel actively represented conflicting interests,he has not established the constitutional predicate for his claim of ineffective assistance.id.at.an adverse effect is established by showing that but for the attorney actual conflict of interest,there is a reasonable likelihood that counsel performance somehow would have been different.stoia united states,cir quotation marks omitted.
gonzales argues that the district court erred in finding that the indiana court of appeals was reasonable in determining that under cuyler no actual conflict of interest arose out of hirschauer dual representation of gonzales and lapcheska.gonzales first a
