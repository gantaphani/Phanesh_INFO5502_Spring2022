opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before the court on an appeal from an order entered on october,by the district court approving and adopting a magistrate judge report and recommendation and denying as untimely frank mcaleese petition for a writ of habeas corpus that he filed on march.in his petition,mcaleese,a state prisoner currently confined at the state correctional institution at albion,pennsylvania challenges the september,decision of the pennsylvania board of probation and parole pbpp denying him parole and requiring that he participate in a sex offender treatment program.we are not concerned,however,with the merits of the pbpp decision as we granted a certificate of appealability solely on the question of whether the district court erred in dismissing mcaleese habeas corpus petition as untimely.the gravamen of mcaleese argument is that the pbpp failure to turn over documents opposing his release that the philadelphia district attorney and a supervising judge of the philadelphia county court of common pleas submitted to it tolled the limitations period under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa to such an extent that his petition was timely.as a matter of convenience,we refer to the documents as if the district attorney submitted all of them.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the order of the district court.
ii.facts and procedural history 
in,after a philadelphia county jury found mcaleese guilty of murder for killing his and for possession of an instrument of a crime the state trial court sentenced him to consecutive custodial terms of ten to twenty years and two and one half to five years,respectively,on the convictions.following his sentencing mcaleese unsuccessfully pursued direct appeals and relief.
in,after twelve and one half years of incarceration,mcaleese became eligible for parole.mcaleese contends that on march,the institution staff recommended that the pbpp grant him parole and release him to a halfway house,predicating its recommendation on his exemplary prison record and his completion of various prison programs.on march,however,the institution staff advised mcaleese that the district attorney who had prosecuted the case had submitted correspondence opposing his release to a halfway house.mcaleese alleges that,based on that correspondence,which he was unable to obtain either at that time and,as will be seen,for some years thereafter,the institution rescinded the favorable parole recommendation.
nevertheless,the pbpp conducted a hearing on mcaleese case on july.on september,the pbpp advised mcaleese that it was denying him parole and that it would not reconsider a parole application from him until july.according to the pbpp,it denied mcaleese parole for the following reasons poor prison adjustment,habitual offender,assaultive instant offense,highly assaultive behavior potential,victim injury,weapon involved in the commission of the offense,need for counseling,and unfavorable recommendation from the pennsylvania department of corrections doc.the pbpp also advised mcaleese that it was requiring him to participate in a sex offender program.
thereafter,mcaleese began challenging his parole denial and the requirement that he participate in a sex offender program.as early as september,a little more than one week after the parole denial,he notified the doc that he believed that there was no factual basis whatsoever for the parole denial which he believed was a retaliatory act for his failure to cooperate with the district attorney in the murder prosecution of a fellow inmate,wilfredo santiago,who was charged with murdering a philadelphia police officer app.at.at that time he reiterated his request for disclosure of the correspondence the district attorney sent to the pbpp.moreover,he began sending letters to the pbpp objecting to having to participate in the sex offender program.
inasmuch as he was unsuccessful in his efforts to avoid the direction to participate in the sex offender program and to obtain the correspondence opposing his parole,mcaleese obtained counsel who for the next several years sent requests to the pbpp,the doc,and the district attorney seeking release of the district attorney letters.all three agencies,however,rejected these requests.the doc told his counsel that the records are not public records within the meaning of pennsylvania act,and,in any event,it could not locate the requested records.id.at.the pbpp indicated that the information mcaleese sought was privileged,app.at,a response similar to that of the district attorney who cited confidentiality protections in refusing to disclose the letters,id.at.
on march,about two and one half years after the pbpp denied him parole,mcaleese filed a pro se habeas corpus petition pursuant to in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania.the petition challenged the pbpp denial of his parole application and its requirement that he participate in the sex offender program,contending that the determination and direction were arbitrary,capricious,and in violation of his equal protection and due process rights.mcaleese alleged that the pbpp purported reasons for the decisions were pretextual and its real reasons were that it was retaliating against him at the insistence of the district attorney for his refusal to testify helpfully for the prosecution in the original santiago murder trial,and was trying to coerce him to change his testimony for santiago pending retrial respondents answered,asserting the procedural contentions that the petition was and mcaleese failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and the substantive contention that the petition was without merit.
the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation,recommending that the court dismiss the petition for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.on may,the district court approved and adopted the report and recommendation and thus dismissed the petition on the ground that mcaleese had not exhausted his state remedies before seeking relief in the district court.on mcaleese appeal,however,we vacated that dismissal after we decided coady vaughn,cir because mcaleese claims were not subject to state judicial review in pennsylvania and thus he had no remedies to exhaust.see mcaleese brennan,cir unpublished.we did not express an opinion on the timeliness issue,stating 
w hether mcaleese petition is is a matter best addressed in the first instance by the district court,which has yet to reach this question.assuming arguendo that aedpa one year statute of limitations applies to mcaleese petition,mcaleese has provided reasons for equitable tolling which are not meritless and which turn on factual determinations which should be made by the district court.
we express no opinion concerning whether the statute of limitations applies in this case,or,if it does,whether it bars mcaleese petition.
id.at.accordingly,we remanded the case to the district court,which transferred it to the eastern district of pennsylvania.while the judicial proceedings were pending,the pbpp on august,and october,again denied mcaleese parole,explaining that he showed no remorse for his commission of the crime and presented a continued danger to the community.mcaleese has not challenged these denials in separate habeas corpus proceedings.
on may,the district court in the eastern district ordered mcaleese to complete that court forms for filing a habeas corpus petition pursuant to section,and mcaleese did so on june,restating the claims that he had made in the western district.respondents answered that the pbpp actions were not retaliatory,and that the pbpp was not attempting to coerce him to testify in the santiago case.they further contended that the court should dismiss mcaleese petition because it was and because he failed to exhaust his remedies with respect to some of the claims.
significantly,in respondents answer to the petition,they disclosed the correspondence from the district attorney that they previously withheld.thus,they produced four separate letters opposing mcaleese release 
a letter dated february,from the district attorney to the superintendent of the doc institution opposing any programming for mcaleese.
a letter dated february,from legrome davis,then the supervising judge of the philadelphia county court of common pleas,to the pbpp at the recommendation of the district attorney opposing parole.
a letter dated april,from the district attorney to the pbpp indicating that the district attorney office is most strenuously opposed for any parole consideration for this brutal murder.
a letter dated august,from the district attorney to the pbpp indicating that the district attorney office can not overstate its satisfaction with the board action.the letter goes on to provide additional allegations that it wanted to be included in mcaleese file,including that he had filed a civil action against the district attorney office and an assistant district attorney and that he had authored an anonymous letter purporting to be from a philadelphia police officer.
upon review of the materials submitted,the magistrate judge recommended that the court dismiss the petition as untimely.the magistrate judge concluded that because direct review of mcaleese conviction ended before the aedpa effective date,he had one year from its effective date,until april,to file his petition.however,mcaleese did not file his petition until march.the magistrate judge further concluded that subsection d of section d extending the time for the filing of a petition for habeas corpus for one year after a petitioner knows or should know of the factual predicate for his claims,did not extend the filing deadline beyond april,because mcaleese was cognizant of the factual predicate of his claims on the day that the pbpp denied him parole,september.additionally,the magistrate judge found that mcaleese had failed to present any evidence to justify equitable tolling of the statute of limitations,and that there was no basis for the court to toll the statute of limitations by reason of the subsequent denials of parole as they did not amount to continuing violations of mcaleese rights.on october,the district court entered an order approving and adopting the magistrate judge report and recommendation,and,accordingly,dismissing the petition as being untimely.
on january,the district court entered an order permitting mcaleese to file an appeal nunc pro tunc which mcaleese did within the permitted period on february.as we indicated at the outset of this opinion,we granted a certificate of appealability on august,with regard to the question whether the district court erred in dismissing mcaleese habeas corpus petition as untimely,and we now resolve that issue 
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under.upon our issuance of a certificate of appealability,we obtained jurisdiction over this appeal under and.our review of the order denying the habeas corpus petition in this case as is plenary.see douglas horn,cir.
iv.discussion 
mcaleese makes three arguments on this appeal.first,he argues that the factual predicate of his claims under section d d is the disclosure of the content of the district attorney correspondence,not the denial of the parole,and thus the limitations period did not begin to run until its disclosure in in the answer to his june,restated petition filed in the eastern district on its forms.if he is correct on this point,his petition surely could not have been late as he filed it before the disclosure.second,he argues that even if the denial of the parole is the factual predicate triggering the running of the statute of limitations,the time of the last of three parole denials in is the appropriate date at which to look for the purposes of application of the aedpa limitations period because the pbpp continued to receive additional correspondence from the district attorney up until that time.thus,he views this case as involving a continuing violation of his rights.third,mcaleese argues that we should equitably toll the limitations period because for seven years the district attorney,the pbpp and the doc did not divulge the documents that he sought.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the decision of the district court to dismiss the petition as untimely.
factual predicate 
under the aedpa there is a limitations period in which a person in custody pursuant to a judgment may file an application for a writ of habeas corpus.d.the period begins to run from the latest of a the date on which the judgment pursuant to which he is in custody becomes final b the date on which an unconstitutional impediment to filing the application is removed c the date on which the supreme court recognizes a new constitutional right asserted in the application so long as the right is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review and d the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.id.additionally,if direct review of a criminal conviction,or in this case a decision with respect to parole,ended before the aedpa effective date of april,a prisoner has a grace period after the effective date to file a habeas corpus petition,until april.burns morton,cir.
in this case,mcaleese is challenging the parole denial and thus section d and the grace period,which expired on april,were applicable to his petition mcaleese,however,filed his petition on march,and thus his petition appears to be untimely.mcaleese attempts to save his petition by arguing that he did not discover the factual predicate of his claims until when respondents disclosed the correspondence from the district attorney to the pbpp.accordingly,in his view,his petition was timely because of the application of section d d.the magistrate judge rejected the argument,stating,i n this case,the limitations period would arguably run from the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence,which would be the date that petitioner was denied probation on september.app.at.the district court approved and adopted that holding.
mcaleese argues that the magistrate judge and district court erred because the denial of parole in was not the factual predicate of his claims,but rather,t he factual predicate which he was required to diligently act to discover was,in fact,the content of the district attorney correspondence and the pbpp reliance thereon,not merely the existence of such correspondence,and t he legal event of the parole denial and the fact that he was aware that something had been submitted that was withheld from him,simply triggered his diligent effort to obtain that material.appellant br.at.we disagree with him for the following reasons.
in order to determine the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented for purposes of section d d,we first must identify mcaleese claims.he asserts four grounds that he believes constitute an unconstitutional execution of his sentence,app.at,but,boiled to their essence,his claims are.first,he believes that the pbpp unjustifiably denied him parole because his testimony was unfavorable to the prosecution in the santiago murder case and the district attorney was trying to deter him from testifying in the same way at santiago retrial.second,he believes that the requirement that he participate in a sex offender program even though he had not committed a sex offense was unjustified and was intended to foreclose his opportunity for parole because completion of the program would be impossible 
having defined the contours of mcaleese claims,we set forth their factual predicate as d d uses that term.though the aedpa does not define factual predicate,we have held that s ection d d provides a petitioner with a later accrual date than section d a only if vital facts could not have been known.schlueter varner,cir,cert.denied,d internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.therefore,under schlueter,the factual predicate of a petitioner claims constitutes the vital facts underlying those claims.
in this case,there is no doubt that the vital facts underlying mcaleese claims are the denial of his parole application in an alleged attempt to coerce him to cooperate in the santiago case and the decision to require him to participate in the sex offender program,not the subsequent disclosure of the content of the letters the district attorney sent to the pbpp.in fact,mcaleese himself proved that the content of the correspondence was not a vital fact underlying his claims as he filed his habeas corpus petition without possession of those documents.obviously,he could have filed his petition earlier had he chosen to do so.furthermore,even before the pbpp initially denied him parole he was aware of the correspondence opposing his parole application and surely knew that he had not been convicted of or,indeed,so far as we are aware,even charged with a sex offense.
clearly,mcaleese has confused the facts that make up his claims with evidence that might support his claims.see johnson mcbride,cir a desire to see more information in the hope that something will turn up differs from the factual predicate of a claim or claims for purposes of d d.the record reveals that mcaleese had all of the vital facts at the time of the parole denial in.indeed,the record includes his requests for relief to the doc and the pbpp soon after his parole denial.the requests contain all of the critical information and claims which appeared in his habeas corpus petition filed several years later he was denied parole and ordered to comply with a sex offender treatment program there was no factual basis for the denial of parole the pbpp denied him parole in retaliation for his failure to cooperate with the district attorney in the santiago proceedings and the correspondence from the district attorney to the pbpp was being withheld from him illegally.moreover,we reiterate that he knew even before the pbpp denied his parole application that the district attorney had submitted correspondence opposing his application.unfortunately for mcaleese,he chose to pursue his grievances for several years with the doc and the pbpp rather than to file a timely habeas corpus petition in the district court.
we point out that in the eastern district of pennsylvania,the applicable procedural directions for a habeas corpus petition require that a petitioner s tate concisely every ground on which you claim that you are being held unlawfully,and s ummarize briefly the facts supporting each ground.app.at.accordingly,mcaleese did not have to present all of the evidence to support his claims.the petition is only the first step in a habeas corpus proceeding,following which,if appropriate,there can be discovery leading to the uncovering of evidence.under mcaleese theory,a court would delay the triggering of the running of the limitations period until all evidence in support of a petition is secured,a result which surely would run contrary to the intent of congress through its enactment of the aedpa to promote the finality of convictions.see duncan walker,d united states bendolph,cir,cert.denied,d.
we are not the only court of appeals to have considered a situation like the one here.in flanagan johnson,cir,the petitioner was convicted in of aggravated possession of more than grams of cocaine.his conviction became final in when its direct review was over.id.in,he filed a section petition asserting that his conviction was obtained without due process of law because he was called to testify on his own behalf without being informed of his right not to testify.id.the petitioner argued that his petition was timely under section d d because he did not discover the factual predicate of his claim until october when his habeas corpus counsel located his trial counsel in a rehabilitation facility in rural texas.id.at.at that time,the petitioner trial counsel executed an affidavit stating that he did not remember whether he and the petitioner discussed his right not to testify.id.the petitioner contended that the lawyer affidavit form ed part of the factual predicate of his suit because,by not conclusively negating the proposition,the affidavit implicitly supports his claim that he was not informed of his right not to testify.id.at.
the court of appeals of the fifth circuit rejected the petitioner timeliness argument,explaining that 
the petitioner is confusing his knowledge of the factual predicate of his claim with the time permitted for gathering evidence in support of that claim.trial counsel affidavit neither changes the character of the petitioner pleaded due process claim nor provides any new ground for his federal habeas petition.section d d does not convey a statutory right to an extended delay,in this case more than seven years,while a habeas petitioner gathers every possible scrap of evidence that might support his claim.
id.at.the court pointed out that the petitioner did not even file the purportedly crucial affidavit with his original habeas petition.id.rather,he submitted only his own affidavit with the original habeas corpus petition and he did not submit his trial counsel affidavit until he later filed a supplementary pleading.id.
inasmuch as the material facts here are indistinguishable from those in flanagan,not surprisingly we reach a conclusion parallel with the conclusion that the court reached in that case.as was true of the trial attorney affidavit in flanagan with respect to the petitioner claims there,the correspondence from the district attorney was not the factual predicate of mcaleese claims as the correspondence did not change the character of the claims,nor did it provide new grounds for the petition.rather,the correspondence merely was evidence that mcaleese believed supported his claims.moreover,like the petitioner in flanagan,mcaleese filed his habeas corpus petition without obtaining the purportedly crucial materials.in sum,mcaleese quest to uncover evidence to support his claims simply did not entitle him to a potentially indefinite delay in filing his habeas corpus petition.
we address one more case relating to this point.mcaleese relies on johnson united states,cir,for the proposition that legal events,such as parole denial,are not facts as used in the habeas corpus limitations provisions because a factual proposition is typically something capable in principle of falsification or possibly even verification by some empirical inquiry,while a legal proposition is identified by consulting some authoritative legal source.appellant br.at.quoting johnson,at.mcaleese,however,neglects to mention that on further appeal the supreme court unanimously disagreed with johnson on this point,holding that a vacatur of a state sentence underlying the federal sentence,and not the facts on which the challenge to the validity of the state convictions was based,constituted the facts that triggered the period under section.see johnson united states,d 
this is what happened in johnson.after the petitioner pleaded guilty in the district court to distribution of cocaine,the court sentenced him as a career offender on the basis of two prior state convictions for cocaine distribution.id.at.at.four years later,a state court vacated one of the predicate convictions because the petitioner had not knowingly waived his right to counsel in that case.id.at.at.three months after the state court vacated the conviction,the petitioner filed a section habeas petition seeking an order vacating the enhanced federal sentence.id.at.at.he claimed that his motion was timely under section because the order vacating the state judgment constituted the fact supporting his claim,thus triggering a renewed limitations period.id.a divided court of appeals over a dissent rejected his argument,holding that the order vacating the prior conviction was not a fact,but,instead,was a legally operative order that was a mandate of law or a consequence of applying law,and therefore was distinct from a matter of fact as congress used the term in.id.at.at summarizing holding of court of appeals.
the supreme court,however,disagreed with the court of appeals on this point,holding that notice of the order vacating the predicate conviction is the event that starts the one year running as the order of vacatur was a necessary predicate for the section claim.id.at.at.therefore,the court unani
