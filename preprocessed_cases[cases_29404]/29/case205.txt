civil rights 
the panel reversed,in part,the district court summary judgment in favor of las vegas metropolitan police department officers,and remanded in an action brought by a street performer who alleged that she was unlawfully arrested for conducting business with another performer without a license on the las vegas strip,in violation of her first amendment rights.
plaintiff and her friend,both dressed in sexy cop costumes,posed with pedestrians on the strip and accepted tips in exchange for photos.defendant police officers,working a strip enforcement assignment,arrested plaintiff and her friend for doing business without a license after the officers were asked to pay a tip or delete a photo.the charges against plaintiff were ultimately dropped.
the panel held that,on the summary judgment record viewed most favorably to plaintiff,the panel would assume that it was plaintiff friend who asked that the officers pay a tip or delete the photo.the panel concluded that the full first amendment protections accorded to plaintiff own activities did not lapse because of what her friend said or did without plaintiff direct participation.the panel determined that there was no evidence at all,for example,of a prior agreement between the women to require a payment for posing in photos,nor of a demonstrated pattern of demanding payments during performances together.the panel held that plaintiff associated with her friend only for expressive activity protected under berger city of seattle,cir.en banc,and that the district court erred by deciding that the officers had probable cause to arrest plaintiff despite the first amendment protections afforded to her expressive association.
as to the denial of partial summary judgment to plaintiff,the panel remanded for a determination after trial of the disputed factual issues and for consideration in light of the panel opinion as to whether,on the facts thus determined,plaintiff was validly arrested for her own statements and actions.
berzon,circuit judge 
las vegas metropolitan police department metro officers arrested michele santopietro,a street performer,for conducting business without a license on the las vegas strip.we consider the constitutionality of her arrest.
background 
santopietro arrest 
the various people involved in the incident that led to santopietro arrest provided versions of the events that vary somewhat but,as will appear,are mostly consistent as they relate to the constitutional issues santopietro raises in this litigation.we recount here both the areas of agreement and those of discord.
michele santopietro is an actress who occasionally engages in street performance.on several occasions,santopietro and her friend,lea patrick,traveled to las vegas from california and performed together as sexy cops on the las vegas strip the strip.
on may,santopietro flew to las vegas to meet patrick.the next day,the two women set about presenting their sexy cop routine.less than an hour into their performance they were approached by three metro officers clayborn howell,kristine crawford,and francisco together,officers who were patrolling the strip in plain clothes.
howell spoke first,asking santopietro and patrick,how much does a picture cost according to santopietro,she replied,it does cost anything.we just ask for a tip,to which patrick added,we pose for tips.is that okay howell responded,okay,posed for a picture with santopietro and patrick,and,after crawford snapped a shot,told the two sexy cops,he was going to go get the money for the tip.
but he did not.instead,howell slowly moved a few steps away from santopietro and patrick,offering no payment.although patrick reminded howell,do forget the tip,none was offered.patrick reiterated you said you would tip,whereupon howell made clear that no gratuity was in store.at that point,either patrick or santopietro asked crawford to delete the photo from her camera if howell was unhappy with it or,according to the officers,if he was not going to tip.the parties dispute the characterization of the statement,as well as of others assertedly made by patrick.specifically,they disagree as to whether the statements were made as polite requests or as demands albeit,the officers concede,ones.
crawford then approached santopietro and queried,and what are you going to do to my camera if i do give you a tip santopietro reply was,i not going to do anything to your camera.i not going to touch you.what exactly are you trying to get me to say meanwhile,howell told patrick she could not demand a tip,and patrick responded,you absolutely right,i ca demand a tip.i just said that you said you would tip.patrick also told howell he had entered into a verbal agreement or verbal contract to tip her.
either seconds before or immediately after patrick mentioned the verbal agreement,howell lifted his shirt to reveal his metro badge to patrick and santopietro.one or more of the officers then proceeded to handcuff the sexy cops.according to patrick and santopietro,just patrick was handcuffed at first santopietro was handcuffed only after she said,you ca arrest patrick she has done anything wrong.crawford agreed with this sequence,testifying in her deposition that officer,the third metro officer at the scene,took umbrage at santopietro remark and handcuffed her after she made it.
according to santopietro,she twice protested,as she was being placed in handcuffs,that she had not said anything to the officers to justify her arrest.crawford did not recall santopietro making such a statement,but she agreed that said something to the effect of,i tell you right now it does matter.you here doing business together,dressed alike,so you do have to say anything.
whatever precisely was said and whoever said it,the officers arrested santopietro and patrick for doing business without a license in violation of clark county code.that section provides it is unlawful for any person,in the unincorporated areas of the county to operate or conduct business as a temporary store,professional promoter or peddler,solicitor or canvasser without first having procured a license for the same the charges against santopietro eventually were dropped.
ii.memorandum of understanding 
santopietro and patrick were by no means the first street performers arrested by metro officers.most notably,as a result of repeated arrests and citations made for street performance activities,two street performers sued metro and other government entities and officials in to prevent similar future arrests and citations,alleging that such enforcement of clark county code and related ordinances violates the first amendment.
to settle that suit,the parties,including metro,agreed to an interim stipulated memorandum of understanding mou in.the mou specified that the sidewalks and pedestrian bridges along the strip constitute a traditional public forum defined street performer as a member of the general public who engages in any performing art or the playing of any musical instrument,singing or vocalizing,with or without musical accompaniment,and whose performance is not an official part of a sponsored event and recognized that this court held in berger city of seattle,cir.en banc,that street performing is expressive speech or expressive conduct protected under the first amendment.the mou went on to provide that s treet performing,including the acceptance of unsolicited tips and the solicitation of tips,is not a per se violation of any of the codes or statutes being challenged in the action,which included chapter of the clark county code.the mou also recited that t he entirety of chapter of the clark county code,the business licensing codes,as written,is inapplicable to the act of street performing.at the same time,the mou cautioned that s treet performers who are legitimately in violation of a county code,state statute,or other law of general applicability are not immune from prosecution simply because they are street performers.
all three of the defendant officers in this case had received guidance or training concerning the mou before santopietro was arrested.the officers reported that their principal takeaway from the training was that street performing without a license is not a crime,so long as no demands for compensation are made.
iii.procedural history 
santopietro sued howell,crawford,and,asserting eleven federal and state causes of action.invoking,she alleged violations of her first amendment free speech rights fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and fourteenth amendment substantive and procedural due process and equal protection rights.santopietro also asserted several causes of action based on state constitutional rights.she sought declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as damages for injuries suffered during detention and attorney fees.after discovery,the officers filed a motion for summary judgment.santopietro filed a for partial summary judgment on her claim that the arrest violated her first amendment rights.
the district court granted the officers summary judgment motion and denied santopietro.concluding that the officers had probable cause to arrest santopietro for doing business without a license,the district court maintained that,for that reason,santopietro arrest was in all respects constitutional.in the district court view,the o fficers did not arrest santopietro because she was a street performer who was soliciting tips in a manner,but because the officers reasonably had determined that patrick,and by association,santopietro,were no longer acting as street performers,but were conducting business without a license as prohibited by clark cty.mun.code.emphasis added.
without addressing any first amendment concerns,the district court held that the offense of doing business without a license was completed as soon as santopietro and her partner offered to perform a service in exchange for compensation the officers did not need to wait to arrest until a tip was demanded several times.rather,the district court opined,it is reasonable for an officer to believe that tipping has become involuntary and thus coerced when a street performer reminds someone to tip,demands a tip,and asserts that a verbal contract exists that necessitates payment of a tip.as the district court recognized,however,none of those actions were completed by santopietro only patrick engaged in that kind of conduct.
santopietro timely appealed both the grant of summary judgment to the officers and the denial of her motion for partial summary judgment 
discussion 
santopietro asserts that at the time of her arrest she was engaged only in fully first street performance,which includes the solicitation of tips.see berger,at.she further maintains that the officers had no legal basis for arresting her on the basis of patrick statements simply because they were performing together.moreover,patrick statements,she argues,could not themselves support probable cause under the applicable municipal ordinance because they did not constitute an offer to perform a service,and were constitutionally protected as part of her street performance.for all those reasons,santopietro contends,the officers violated her constitutional rights by arresting her.
taking a similar approach to that of the district court,the officers argue that they had probable cause to arrest santopietro for violating section of the clark county code,primarily because of her association with patrick.it was reasonable to conclude,the officers maintain,that the two women were engaged in the business of peddling without a license to do so.
constitutional violation 
we consider first the district court grant of summary judgment to the officers and conclude it was in error,because it misconceived the scope of the applicable first amendment protections.
the pivotal role of probable cause analysis in fourth amendment jurisprudence is,of course.as pertinent here,a warrantless arrest by a law enforcement officer is reasonable where there is probable cause to believe that a criminal offense has been or is being committed.devenpeck alford.if an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed even a very minor criminal offense in his presence,he may arrest the offender.atwater city of lago vista.but police may not exercise the awesome power at their disposal to punish individuals for conduct that is not merely lawful,but protected by the first amendment.velazquez city of long beach,cir.quoting duran city of douglas,cir.where no specific criminal statute validly applies to the facts at hand,an arrest is not supported by probable cause.
our principal question,then,is whether it is constitutionally permissible under the first amendment to require that a person hold a business license to conduct the activities in which santopietro was engaged at the time of her arrest.if not,then it was not objectively reasonable for the officers to believe santopietro was violating section,as the ordinance did not validly apply to her actions.see mackinney nielsen,cir.we turn now to that question.we review the district court grant of summary judgment to the officers de novo and construe the facts in the light most favorable to santopietro.see fogel collins,cir.in conducting this inquiry,it is helpful to break the relevant facts into digestible parts.the facts available to the metro officers at the time of the arrest fall into three categories santopietro street performance activities her association with patrick and patrick acts and,finally,any other actions santopietro took in the to the arrest.
street performance 
performances on public sidewalks and in public parks both traditional public fora are protected under the first amendment as expressive activity.see berger,at.although street performances are subject to reasonable time,place,and manner restrictions,id.at,we have never upheld a law that subjects individuals or small groups who wish to engage in expressive activity in public fora to advance notice and permitting requirements,see id.at.t he significant governmental interest justifying the unusual step of requiring citizens to inform the government in advance of expressive activity has always been understood to arise only when large groups of people travel together on streets and sidewalks.santa monica food not bombs city of santa monica,cir.see also long beach area peace network city of long beach,cir.
the sidewalks along the las vegas strip dedicated to public use are public fora.see venetian casino resort,local joint exec.bd.of las vegas,cir.as applied here,clark county code would have required santopietro to obtain an individual license or be employed by a licensed business before engaging in her activities on the sidewalks of the las vegas strip.but any such requirement would run squarely afoul of berger central holding,that a permitting scheme that requires single individuals to inform the government of their intent to engage in expressive activity in a public forum,a requirement that neither we nor the supreme court has ever countenanced,is not permissible.at.the clark county ordinance is thus indubitably invalid as applied to santopietro performance as a sexy cop.because of their training regarding the mou,the officers understood that.
additionally,the solicitation of tips is entitled to the same constitutional protections as traditional speech.aclu of city of las vegas,cir.municipalities accordingly may not ban either passive solicitation of tips for street performance,putting a hat out or saying thank you,or active solicitation,encouraging a tip orally or by tipping a hat.see berger,at.if only active solicitation is banned,an officer seeking to enforce that ban must necessarily examine the content of the message that is conveyed.id.quoting forsyth cty.nationalist movement.as a regulation of speech in a public forum,such a ban is subject to strict scrutiny,a standard not met by a distinction between active and passive solicitation of voluntary tips.id.at.metro mou appears to incorporate that holding,by recognizing that solicitation of tips is not a per se violation of the county code business licensing provisions.
if santopietro activities remained within the scope of protected street performance and protected solicitation of tips,then the officers could not properly arrest her.so the central dispute is whether santopietro actions went beyond protected expression and moved into the realm of business activity subject to chapter regulations.more specifically,the officers recognize that both santopietro costumed performance and her reply to howell inquiry about the cost of a photo it does cost anything.we just ask for a tip.were within the first amendment protections and so were not regulable commercial activity,as both berger and the mou established.but,the officers contend,those actions provide a basis to associate santopietro with patrick and patrick statements,which they maintain did go beyond the realm of fully protected speech and were regulable under chapter of the clark county code.we turn,therefore,to whether santopietro could be arrested,consistently with the first amendment,not for anything she said or did but because of her association with patrick.
expressive association 
because we are examining the grant of summary judgment to the officers and so construe the facts in the light most favorable to santopietro,we assume here that patrick,not santopietro,asked for the photo to be deleted.we shall also assume for present purposes,without deciding,that patrick alleged verbal agreement statement,and perhaps her request that crawford delete the photograph,established probable cause to believe that patrick was demanding a fee for service,not a voluntary tip.and we shall finally assume for present purposes,also without deciding,that such a demand,although not coercive in the ordinary sense of that word,would take the exchange outside the ambit of fully protected first amendment expression,such that the exchange itself could be regulated under clark county code as commercial speech.such speech,which does no more than propose a commercial transaction,would be subject to the more forgiving first amendment analysis laid out in central hudson gas electric public service commission of.see hunt city of los angeles,cir.quoting united states united foods.
under those assumptions,if patrick actions may be imputed to santopietro for the purposes of establishing probable cause to arrest,the scope of facts available to justify her arrest widens significantly.we conclude,however,that the full first amendment protections accorded santopietro own activities do not lapse because of what patrick said or did without santopietro direct participation.rather,santopietro and patrick expressive association may not be the sole basis relied upon to attribute patrick actions to santopietro.
association for the purpose of engaging in protected activity is itself protected by the first amendment.i mplicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the first amendment is a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political,social,economic,educational,religious,and cultural ends.roberts jaycees,collecting cases see also naacp alabama ex rel.patterson.this first amendment right extends only to expressive association,that is,to associations engage d in expressive activity that could be impaired by government action.boy scouts of am.dale.
government actions that may unconstitutionally burden this expressive association freedom may take many forms.id.at.for example,the first amendment restricts the ability of the state to impose liability on an individual solely because of his association with another.naacp claiborne hardware.it has long been established that guilt by association alone,without establishing that an individual association poses the threat feared by the government,is an impermissible basis upon which to deny first amendment rights.healy james,alteration in original quoting united states robel.
these considerations necessarily factor into whether the first amendment allows arresting an individual engaged in protected expressive activity in conjunction with another person simply because the second person behavior crossed the line into actions that may be unprotected and unlawful or,at least,are less clearly protected and lawful,because they involve commercial speech.even outside the context of protected first amendment expressive association,a person mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not,without more,give rise to probable cause.ybarra illinois.claiborne hardware and healy make lucidly clear that the more can not consist of inferences of possible criminal involvement based solely on an individual first activities and associations.
in claiborne hardware,for example,a local naacp chapter in claiborne county,mississippi,voted to boycott stores in an effort to put pressure on local elected officials to implement racial justice reforms.at.boycott activities occurred between and.id.at.local naacp leaders encouraged stronger enforcement of the boycott in the wake of a few significant events,including the assassination of martin luther king,in,and a police shooting of a local black man in his home in.id.at.some of the leaders words of encouragement included threatening language.id.at.additionally,a handful of enforcement actions taken by individual participants in the first year of the boycott had involved violent acts,such as throwing a brick through the window of a car owned by a boycott violator.id.at.in an action brought by white business owners against the naacp,its local leaders,and more than boycott participants,the mississippi state courts rejected the defendants arguments that their conduct was protected by first amendment.id.at.
the supreme court held that first amendment protections are not lost merely because some members of the group may have participated in conduct or advocated doctrine that itself is not protected.id.at.rather,the presence of activity protected by the first amendment imposes restraints on the grounds that may give rise to liability and on the persons who may be held accountable.id.at emphasis added.more specifically,f or liability to be imposed by reason of association alone,it is necessary to establish that the group itself possessed unlawful goals and that the individual held a specific intent to further those illegal aims.id.at.
here,the record indicates the officers had no evidence before them when they decided to arrest santopietro that suggested that the sexy cops association had any purpose that could have fallen outside the protection of the first amendment under berger.nor was there evidence of santopietro intent to engage with patrick in anything other than clearly constitutionally protected expressive activity which,again,includes active solicitation of voluntary tips.both sexy cop performers were engaging largely,if not entirely,in activity that was not only legitimate but also constitutionally protected.the only evidence offered by the officers on appeal to demonstrate the two women were working together is that they wore the same costumes,portrayed the same sexy cop characters,and posed for pictures together,evidence of expressive association to engage in street performance.there is no evidence at all,for example,of a prior agreement between the women to require a payment for posing in photos,nor of a demonstrated pattern of demanding payments during performances together.thus,on the summary judgment record viewed most favorably to santopietro,santopietro associated with patrick only for expressive activity protected under berger.
even if patrick to howell initial statements that he would tip or to his later statements that he would not transformed her actions into regulable commercial activity again,we do not decide that question they did not transform the street performance association into an unprotected one,any more than the violent action by some participants in the boycott in claiborne hardware transformed the entire boycott effort into unprotected activity.
indeed,were no first amendment protections at issue,we still very much doubt that a common enterprise between santopietro and patrick could reasonably be inferred for the purposes of establishing criminal liability.individualized suspicion can,under certain circumstances,be based on an inference of a common enterprise,see maryland pringle,but reliance on such an inference
