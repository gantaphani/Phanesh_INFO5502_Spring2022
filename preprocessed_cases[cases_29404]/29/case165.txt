the instant action arises from the passage of substitute house bill hb by the ohio general assembly.ohio laws h.hb concerned,in relevant part,the terms under which horse racing tracks and satellite facilities could receive simulcast races conducted at other facilities.the owners of licensed race track facilities located in cincinnati,toledo,and lebanon,ohio,and the satellite facility associated with the toledo the ohio state racing commission,among others,challenging the constitutionality of certain aspects of hb under the takings clause of the fifth amendment and the equal protection and due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,and dismissed the case.because the statutory scheme does not effectuate a taking for fifth amendment purposes,and does not otherwise run afoul of the fourteenth amendment,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the statutory provisions at issue in this case govern the allocation of proceeds from simulcast horse racing in ohio.prior to the enactment of hb,wagering at ohio tracks on televised,simulcast horse races was significantly restricted tracks could offer simulcast racing only on days that they also offered a live racing program.ohio law also prescribed how wagering revenues were allocated.money wagered at tracks was divided,with a percentage going to the track operator as a commission and the balance distributed as payoffs on winning wagers.after taxes and administrative fees were subtracted from the commission,of the balance was allocated to the operator purse account which must be used to fund purses at the track and of the balance was retained by the operator as income.see ohio ann.west.
this scheme for allocating wagering revenues on days on which a track offered both live and simulcast racing was not changed by the passage of hb.see ohio ann.anderson.hb,however,authorized tracks to offer simulcast racing on days on which they offered no live racing program,and provided a separate scheme for allocating wagering revenues from such days.see generally ohio ann.anderson.the scheme was essentially the same,except that the portion of the commission which had been allocated to the purse fund at the track was diverted instead into a newly created combined simulcast purse fund cspf.ohio ann.e anderson.funds from the cspf are distributed periodically to the purse funds at ohio race tracks in accordance with a formula based on each track historical share of the total amount wagered on live racing days during the five calendar years immediately preceding the distribution.ohio ann.f anderson.the plaintiffs have each paid more money into the cspf than they have received in distributions,while the racetrack defendants have each received more money in distributions from the cspf than they have paid into it.
this case involves the constitutionality not only of the cspf,but also the rule that applies to wagers made at satellite facilities.ohio ann.f anderson.satellites must be affiliated with a particular race track but conduct no live racing activities themselves.consequently,a satellite depends entirely on simulcasts of races conducted at other locations.satellites receive simulcasts from simulcast hosts,ohio race tracks that transmit live racing conducted at ohio tracks or that act as hosts for races taking place in other states 
all money wagered at the simulcast host and all money wagered at satellites is included in a common pool at the simulcast host and,with limited exceptions not relevant here,the payment on winning tickets is the same whether the wager was placed at the simulcast host or at a satellite.ohio ann.e anderson.under the rule,of the money wagered at a satellite location is allocated to the simulcast host,ohio ann.f anderson,which effectively means that that portion is treated as if it were wagered at the simulcast host for the purposes of determining taxes to be paid and commissions to be retained by the host.the remaining is allocated to the satellite for the purpose of determining taxes to be paid and the commission to be retained by the satellite.the allocation is the same whether the simulcast host is transmitting live racing conducted at its track or hosting racing conducted at tracks.
the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the district court,alleging that the cspf and the rule constituted unconstitutional takings of their property under the takings clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution,and violated their rights under the equal protection clause and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.faced with for summary judgment,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,denied the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,and dismissed the plaintiffs complaint.the court concluded that,because the cspf was created by the same legislation that authorized racing,the plaintiffs had no reasonable expectation to receive the revenues diverted to cspf and,thus,had no property interest in those funds that could be taken in violation of the takings clause.the district court further found that the plaintiffs failure to demonstrate a protectable property interest in the revenues diverted to the cspf doomed their claims that the creation of the cspf arbitrarily deprived them of property in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.finally,the district court concluded that hb contained no indiscriminate or arbitrary classification,but was a studied and statutory scheme established to protect and promote live horse racing in ohio the plaintiffs filed the instant appeal.
ii.analysis 
summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c anderson liberty lobby,d.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.adickes kress,d citation omitted.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.pinney dock transp.penn cent,cir.
a.the challenged provisions do not constitute unconstitutional takings of the plaintiffs property under the takings clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.
the takings clause of the fifth amendment,made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,dolan city of tigard,d citing chicago,burlington quincy chicago,provides that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.even assuming that the plaintiffs have a property interest in the funds diverted under the cspf or the rule,however,the operation of those provisions does not constitute an unlawful taking under the fifth amendment.
because the constitution protects rather than creates property interests,the existence of a property interest is determined by reference to existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.phillips.legal,d quoting bd.of regents roth,d.current law does not grant the plaintiffs any property interest to wagering revenues diverted under the cspf aside from their rights to distributions under the statutory formula or the rule.accordingly,the inquiry turns to whether the plaintiffs had such an interest prior to the passage of hb.it is apparent that they did not.
it is clear that,prior to the enactment of hb,the plaintiff race tracks were statutorily entitled to commissions earned from wagering on simulcast racing at their tracks on days when live racing was also conducted at the tracks.the race tracks entitlement to those commissions was not affected by the passage of hb and the establishment of the cspf.the plaintiffs did not,however,have a statutory entitlement to commissions earned on days when they offered only simulcast racing because,under law,no such racing could be conducted.there could therefore have been no property interest in such commissions.it was the passage of hb that created the right to conduct racing in ohio,and,therefore,any property rights to commissions on such racing could not the passage of hb.
nor did the plaintiffs have a property interest in the revenues diverted under the rule prior to the passage of hb.while the plaintiffs generally assert that the mere fact that an activity is pursued under an authorization or license obtained by the government does not mean that licensees have no property interest in the fruits of their labors,and that they have a property interest in funds generated though the conduct of a licensed business simulcasting of horse racing events,they do not identify any specific property interest that is affected by the rule.
it follows that funds diverted by hb to the cspf,and funds allocated under the rule,are not the private property of plaintiffs for fifth amendment takings clause purposes.this conclusion is consistent with phillips and webb fabulous pharmacies,beckwith,d,because the conclusion is not,contrary to plaintiffs assertions,dependent on any theory of value.in phillips,the supreme court concluded that interest earned on funds deposited in pooled accounts under an interest on lawyers trust accounts iolta program was private property.phillips,at.under texas law,attorneys were required to pool client deposits in an iolta account if the funds could not earn net interest if deposited separately.the interest on the pooled account was not apportioned among the clients,but diverted to foundations that financed legal services for individuals.the court found that the interest was,in fact,the private property of the clients,reasoning that the clients owned the principal and,under texas law,interest is presumed to follow the principal that generates it.id.at.the court found that the fact that net interest could not have been earned had the clients funds been deposited separately rather than in an iolta account,was irrelevant to the question of whether the interest,once earned,was private property.id.at.the court had reached a similar result in webb,concluding that interest accruing on an interpleader fund was the private property of the fund beneficiaries.webb,at.florida law required that interpleader funds be deposited in the registry of the county clerk,and the interest earned on such funds was retained by the county as income.the court found that the county retention of the interest,under the specific statutory scheme in place,was a taking in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.in doing so,the court relied heavily on a long established general rule that interest on interpleaded and deposited funds follows the principal and should be allocated to the owners of the principal.id.at.in the instant case,as in webb and phillips,the relevant inquiry is whether state law recognizes the asserted property right.the conclusion we reach here results from the fact that there is no right to the revenues earned from gambling on horse racing.
we could appropriately end our takings clause analysis here,as there is no taking if there is no private property in the first place.we are reluctant to do so,however,because our conclusion is potentially subject to counter arguments outlined in the margin that have some force,though not enough to persuade us.we therefore assume for the sake of argument that revenues diverted to the cspf and revenues diverted under the rule for takings clause private property of plaintiffs.even if so,hb clearly does not effectuate an unconstitutional taking.
the supreme court has consistently declined to create a set formula for identifying a taking forbidden by the fifth amendment and has instead prescribed an ad hoc,factual inquiry into the circumstances of each particular case.see,connolly pension benefit gty,d.in conducting such an inquiry,three factors have particular significance the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant,the extent to which the regulation interfered with reasonable expectations,and the character of the governmental action.id.in the instant case,each of these factors weighs against finding a taking prohibited by the fifth amendment.
the nature of the action.
first,the challenged provisions are not by nature takings.under hb,the government does not physically invade or permanently appropriate any of the plaintiffs assets for its own use.instead,hb represents an attempt by ohio general assembly to protect and preserve ohio horse racing industry.it is true that the statutory scheme created by hb includes provisions that allocate revenues from wagering on horse racing according to prescribed formulas,and that those formulas burden some race track operators and benefit others.it is well settled,however,that legislation that adjusts the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good does not constitute a taking requiring government compensation.connolly,at.citations omitted 
the plaintiffs contend that the cspf and the rule do not benefit the general public,but instead benefit a select group of race track the racetrack defendants.they argue that ohio aims of protecting and preserving its horse racing industry could have been accomplished by liberalizing the restrictions on simulcast racing,and that therefore the cspf and the rule are extras that inure only to the benefit of private parties.even assuming that ohio could have achieved its goals of providing economic relief to the horse racing industry in another fashion,however,it does not follow that the balancing of interests codified in hb was beyond ohio power to modify the economic benefits and burdens from wagering on horse races.accordingly,we conclude that the nature of the action weighs against finding a taking.
interference with investment backed expectations.
second,the challenged provisions of hb do not interfere with legitimate investment backed expectations.the district court observed that the same legislation that authorized racing also included the revenue allocation formulas to which the plaintiffs objected and concluded that the plaintiffs could have no reasonable expectation of a greater return on their investment than that provided under the cspf and rule.
the plaintiffs offer several arguments as to why this disclosure of the terms of participation did not prevent them from reasonably expecting higher returns.first,they argue that the district court conclusion is tantamount to finding that participants in industries have no choice but to accept even the most confiscatory regulations.i t is not objectively reasonable,they contend,to expect that the state will condition participation in the racing industry upon acceptance of a system which transfers earnings from one set of race track owners to another.next,the plaintiffs charge that hb disrupts normal expectations as to how value generated through economic activity is apportioned among those performing the activity,because the distribution of funds from the cspf is based on historical shares of racing revenues at ohio race tracks,and because both the cspf and the rule create disproportionate benefits and burdens among race track operators.finally,the plaintiffs argue that they had a reasonable investment backed expectation that the introduction of racing would enhance revenues and enable them to offer larger purses at their own tracks 
even assuming,however,that the plaintiffs have accurately characterized the provisions of hb,these contentions are beside the point.to say that it is not reasonable to expect that the government enact such regulations,that such regulations are subject to challenge,or that such regulations conflict with normal business expectations does not change the fact that the plaintiffs were well aware of the cspf and the rule prior to making any investments related to racing,and could not,therefore have reasonably expected a greater return.consequently,this factor also weighs against finding a taking.
economic impact.
finally,consideration of the economic impact of the challenged provisions of hb does not support the conclusion that there has been a taking.the district court acknowledged that the cspf and the rule had an adverse economic impact on the plaintiffs,at least to the extent that they were deprived of a portion of simulcast wagering proceeds the plaintiffs emphasize that,under the challenged provision
