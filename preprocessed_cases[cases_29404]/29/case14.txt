this appeal concerns claims by fishman transducers,fishman,primarily for trademark infringement and false advertising under the lanham act,et,against hsn interactive llc hsn,musician stephen paul and his company daystar productions.fishman failed to get the relief it sought in the district court and now appeals.we refer to the lanham act throughout by its title section numbers rather than the sections in the original statute.
fishman is a developer and manufacturer of electronic equipment,specifically a line of acoustic equipment that can be attached to individual musical instruments to provide sound amplification.fishman guitar pickups often include both a transducer and a preamplifier or equalizer,although the term can also refer to only the transducer.the fishman transducer is a small device usually installed inside the guitar where it is not immediately visible.
hsn is a retailer of various consumer goods and sells products on its website its sister company sells products on the television channel home shopping network for purposes of this case the two entities were treated as one.in late,hsn sold through the website and television station about esteban guitars that it identified in the programming and website inaccurately,it now concedes as containing fishman pickups.this trademark violation is the centerpiece of the litigation that led to this appeal.
esteban is the performance name used by musician stephen paul who,with his company daystar productions,has collaborated with hsn since to market and sell esteban guitar packages usually a guitar equipped with a pickup as well as accessories such as a strap,case,amplifier and instructional videos.beginning in october on the hsn channel,paul lauded fishman pickups,emphasized that the guitars included them and boasted that a fishman pickup alone would sell for as much as the full hsn package.beginning in the second quarter of,the hsn website simply listed a fishman pickup as a specification of the guitars.
several months after the television advertising began,fishman contacted hsn and daystar and demanded an end to claims in the broadcasts and on the website that the guitars contained fishman pickups.hsn complied and ceased to make reference to fishman pickups in its sales pitches and on its website.fishman also brought suit in the district court,stating claims against hsn,paul and daystar under the lanham act for trademark violation and false advertising,the massachusetts consumer protection act.ch,and state common law trademark infringement and unfair competition.
after extensive discovery and shortly before trial,the district court dismissed fishman chapter claim,denied its request to present evidence of trademark counterfeiting,and ruled that the parties were not in direct competition the latter relevant to damages under the lanham act.fishman transducers,paul,cv.during the trial,the district court ruled inadmissible key damage evidence proffered by fishman,but left open evidence of disgorgement of profits for a separate hearing before the judge,a.
during the trial,defendants did not seriously deny infringing the fishman trademark and falsely advertising the guitars as containing fishman pickups much of the extensive testimony and argument focused on whether the defendants violations were willful.the evidence showed that the guitars in question had been manufactured for hsn in china by force limited force,which had previously made esteban guitars for hsn using pickups supplied by a company named belcat.
then,in,force substituted another belcat pickup that belcat told force was a fishman or pickup force then advised hsn that the guitars contained fishman pickups and so identified the pickups in the specifications hsn passed on the information to paul.whether or not fishman made the new belcat pickup or supplied technology for it defendants now concede that the hsn advertising and sales in question used the fishman trademark without authorization.
at the close of trial,the jury found trademark infringement and false advertising in violation of the lanham act but the jury also found that neither violation was willful.in a decision,fishman transducers,paul,wl,the judge agreed that willfulness had not been shown,adding that the jury finding would bind him anyway.because the violations were not willful,and separately because of conventional equitable balancing,he chose not to order disgorgement of profits.id.
fishman has now appealed.the applicable standard of review varies with the issue and whether the claim was properly preserved.fishman appeal is directed primarily to its claims under the lanham act.section of the act creates federal causes of action both for misuse of a trademark and false advertising that misrepresents the source of goods section permits trebling of a damage award,a recovery of defendant profits,and an award of attorney fees in exceptional cases.a,a 
fishman first claim is that the district court mishandled the central issue of willfulness,both in its instructions and in responding to two jury questions.interestingly,the term willful appears in section only in relation to two provisions not of immediate importance here one relating to dilution claims section and another with counterfeit marks section d,a,c and similarly in section only in relation to dilution of a famous mark and domain name registration,c b,d d ii.
rather,the governing language provides 
the court shall assess such profits and damages or cause the same to be assessed under its direction.in assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove defendant sales only defendant must prove all elements of cost or deduction claimed.in assessing damages the court may enter judgment,according to the circumstances of the case,for any sum above the amount found as actual damages,not exceeding three times such amount.if the court shall find that the amount of the recovery based on profits is either inadequate or excessive the court may in its discretion enter judgment for such sum as the court shall find to be just,according to the circumstances of the case.
nevertheless,in lanham act cases,courts including this one have used willfulness as a gloss or screen in deciding what remedies to provide for ordinary infringement.while damages in trademark or false advertising cases can be awarded without any special showing of scienter or equitable factors,hot wax,turtle wax,cir,our cases usually require willfulness one primary exception involving direct competition is discussed below to allow either more than single damages or a recovery of the defendant profits 
because the district court excluded testimony on damages,fishman remaining hope was to recover the defendant profits,but this required a showing of willfulness.the jury found that trademark infringement and false advertisement occurred but that the violations were not willful.the judge treated the finding as binding,adding that his own view was the same and that no other equitable ground for awarding profits to fishman had been established.
on this appeal,fishman argues that the jury finding that the violations had not been willful was impaired both by errors in the court instructions to the jury and by inaccurate answers that the court gave to questions the jury asked during deliberations.we address these claims on the have ongoing importance for future trademark conclude finally that such errors as occurred did not affect the outcome.
in federal civil litigation willfulness requires a conscious awareness of wrongdoing by the defendant or at least conduct deemed objectively reckless measured against standards of reasonable behavior the criminal standard is slightly more demanding because it requires a subjective indifference to risk for recklessness sometimes called willful blindness as the minimum condition for a willfulness finding.see united states griffin,cir.
the district judge in this case instructed the jury that 
in order to consider whether it willful,consider whether the defendants knew or should have known about the mark and that it belonged to the plaintiff second,that the defendants knew or should have known that their own conduct was infringing the plaintiff mark and third,and importantly,the defendants intentionally sold products in connection with the infringing mark with the knowledge that it infringed.an act that is done willfully is done voluntarily and intentionally as opposed to by mistake or accident.
emphasis added.
fishman is right that the underscored language fails to make clear that objective recklessness is also a basis for finding willfulness in the civil context.whether fishman adequately preserved the claim of error in its colloquy with the judge is doubtful,scarfo cabletron,cir requiring that an instructional error and the proposed correction be adequately identified but,if preserved which we need not decide,there is no doubt that the underlined portion set the bar too high and might have confused the jury 
the district judge also instructed the jury that the plaintiff bore the burden of proving willfulness by clear and convincing evidence.fishman did preserve this objection and argued that the appropriate burden is preponderance of the evidence.the district judge denied the request relying on tamko roofing,where this circuit noted in passing that the jury in the district court found willfulness by clear and convincing evidence,at but the burden of proof was not a disputed issue and our decision in tamko roofing did not adopt any standard.
the ordinary rule in civil cases is proof by a preponderance of the evidence,herman maclean huddleston,and the text of section does not prescribe a different burden of proof.fraud,a cousin to willfulness,has an historical association with the clear and convincing standard but the modern tendency in the supreme court is to reserve the clear and convincing burden,unless dictated by statute,for matters with constitutional implications like civil commitment 
this was the view taken in herman maclean,holding that the preponderance standard should govern the main provision of the securities exchange act.at.the court also noted that in prior cases,it had found the preponderance standard applicable for imposition of even severe civil sanctions.id.at see also grogan garner,bankruptcy code fraud provision ramsey united mine workers of,antitrust treble damages.the one recent decision looking the other way,microsoft.partnership,rested primarily on statutory interpretation.id.at.
authority in other circuits is divided on whether in lanham act cases to equate fraud or willfulness with a heightened standard of proof but the modern guidance of herman maclean and grogan supports the ordinary preponderance standard where,as here,the statutory language does not call for more.the omission of the term willful in the relevant portion of section contrasts with its explicit use elsewhere in section.so,as a matter of first impression in this circuit,we think preponderance the proper standard.
finally,fishman claims that the district judge erred in responding to two questions from the jury during its deliberations relating to willfulness.one question in substance was whether a failure to act can constitute willfulness to this the judge gave the jury the reporter transcript of the oral instruction on willfulness which contained a confusing to which neither side objected after review.fishman transducers paul,wl at.march.fishman did preserve a claim that the answer to the question should merely have been yes,but the judge could regard this as an oversimplified answer and properly refuse to give it.
the second jury question was,is hsn responsible for their own published document on the worldwide web when they are aware of its incorrect information.in response,the judge sought to explain that hsn was responsible for the content of its own website but,at least as to willfulness,not for something hsn did not control.this was reasonable enough given evidence that fishman concedes that hsn sent warning letters to third party sites later selling the esteban guitars with the erroneous claims to fishman products.
although the jury instructions were understandably mistaken on burden of proof and potentially confusing on recklessness,neither was harmful to fishman because the evidence was insufficient to justify a finding of willfulness even under the correct preponderance standard and a perfect understanding of willfulness.under the standard governing review of jury verdicts,we conclude that no reasonable jury could have found a willful violation in this case.
force,the maker of the guitar,orally represented to hsn that it included a pickup and in a product specification sheet noted that the guitars had a fishman pickup.hsn relayed this information to paul before he went.nothing indicates that defendants were any more than negligent in passing on that representation.in particular,no evidence indicated that the defendants had knowledge of the infringement or were reckless in failing to learn of it.when told of the error hsn promptly stopped claiming that its pickups were fishman products.
paul did say on the air that he had personally selected fishman products for the guitars,which he admitted at trial was not true and he praised the fishman pickups in terms exceeding anything represented by force limited for example,that the pickups in the guitars were top of the line.but none of these statements remotely suggests that paul knew or was reckless in not so suspecting that hsn was mistaken or that force was lying when they said that the pickups in his guitars were fishman pickups.
this brings us to damages and fishman other main basis for appeal.single damages can be awarded without a finding of willfulness.but damages awards turn out to be comparatively rare in trademark cases primarily,it appears,because of the difficulty of proving them.michael freno,trademark valuation preserving brand equity,trademark.various damage theories are available,but proving causation and amount are very difficult unless the two products directly compete an issue to which we return,and most cases that go beyond injunctive relief involve an attempt to recoup the infringer profits.id.at.
the problem of which this case is a good illustration is not theory but proof.the most straightforward theory of damages would be that the infringement had diverted specific sales away from fishman.see aktiebolaget electrolux armatron int l,cir denying damages absent lost sales.but fishman does not sell guitars to consumers rather,it supplies its pickups to other guitar makers who in turn compete with esteban,or directly to consumers through retail channels,who buy them to be installed in their own guitars.
accordingly,on this theory,fishman had to show to take the most obvious possibility that the wrongful use of the fishman name during part of to describe pickups on the esteban guitars diverted sales from outlets often big box stores who purchased competing guitars from guitar makers whom fishman supplied that this sales diversion in turn reduced new orders to such competing guitar makers and that those manufacturers reduced their orders of fishman pickups for some period,largely after the defendants infringement ceased.
the district judge rejected the testimony of fishman expert,thomas britven,finding that britven furnished neither a figure or range for damages suffered by fishman nor supplied the jury with data from which it could make an intelligent estimate of fishman damages,if any,caused by the infringement.fishman founder,larry fishman,also testified but the judge excluded him from testifying about the cause of the damages.fishman says that these exclusionary rulings were error.
although some evidentiary rulings involve issues of fact or law,this one was a classic judgment call reviewed for abuse of discretion.lynch boston,cir.the question is whether the information tendered by the expert and by larry fishman would help the jury to determine a fact in issue.see also daubert merrell dow.these witnesses proffered testimony together was the only substantial damage evidence offered even taken together,we agree that this evidence would not allow a reasonable jury to assess damages.
britven sought to testify supplying the relevant figures that esteban sold lots of guitars in and that by contras
