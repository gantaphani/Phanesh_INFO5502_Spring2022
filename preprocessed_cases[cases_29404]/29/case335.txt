at issue today is the constitutionality of several zoning and public nudity ordinances adopted by the city of daytona beach the city to regulate adult theaters.the owners and operators of lollipop gentlemen club lollipop,an adult theater in daytona beach,sued the city claiming that these ordinances violate the first amendment.the district court upheld the zoning ordinances,finding that the city had provided a constitutionally sufficient number of available sites for adult theaters,and also denied lollipop claim that it was grandfathered in under florida law.however,the district court struck down the nudity ordinances,concluding that they did not further the substantial government interest in reducing negative secondary effects associated with adult theaters.
after thorough review,we affirm the district court determination that the zoning ordinances pass constitutional muster,as well as its ruling that,under florida law,lollipop is not entitled to grandfather status.but as for the nudity ordinances,we conclude that the city has indeed carried its evidentiary burden of establishing their constitutionality because the ordinances further substantial government interests,and,accordingly,we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
zoning ordinances 
in,after years of increasing urban blight and economic decline,the city of daytona beach adopted various zoning ordinances in an effort to reduce the perceived secondary effects of adult businesses by limiting the locations where they could open and operate among other things,the zoning ordinances permitted adult to open only in the city business automotive ba zoning districts,and even there prohibited them from locating within certain distances of churches,schools,parks,playgrounds,or other adult businesses 
in the,the zoning ordinances were challenged on various grounds in function junction,city of daytona beach,aff,cir table.gerald langston,the city director of planning and redevelopment and a key participant in formulating the zoning ordinances,testified in that case as an expert in urban planning and about the legislative process that led to their enactment.langston said that,before enacting the zoning ordinances,the city had conducted a local study of urban blight and decay that identified two blighted areas the old downtown and the beachside.langston explained that the identification of these areas as blighted was based on characteristics such as a significant percentage of deteriorating structures a large number of small lots,which did not allow cars a notable parking problem a high incidence of crime,particularly,on the beachside and a large percentage of antiquated,underground utility systems,such as drainage,water and sewer systems.id.at.langston testified that the blight deterred development ceased in,and in the late,daytona beach was denominated the city of sleaze.id.
langston explained that the city of daytona beach then created a redevelopment design and review board to deal with the blight problem.id.langston worked with the board and testified that it considered studies of blight in boston and detroit by the american society of planning officials in.these studies show strong evidence that the central location of adult uses,like the combat zone in boston,causes the blighted area to grow and creates blight in fringe areas.id.langston also opined,b ased upon his education,experience,knowledge of blight in daytona beach and his participation in drafting the subject ordinance,that live nude and seminude entertainment businesses promote and perpetuate urban decay and that adult businesses have impacted on crime in the area surrounding daytona beach.id.
david smith,an assistant state attorney who had prosecuted drug and prostitution offenses in daytona beach,also testified that most definitely there were more drug and prostitution offenses in topless bars than in other bars.id.at.based in part on this testimony by langston and smith,the district court in function junction upheld the zoning ordinances.id.at.
in,the city enacted several amendments to the zoning ordinances that,among other things,required adult theaters to obtain from a technical review committee before being able to open and operate in the ba districts.in a first amendment challenge brought by several adult theaters,the united states district court for the middle district of florida entered a preliminary injunction preventing the city from enforcing the amendments because,the court found,the plaintiffs were likely to prevail at trial on their claims.jack,city of daytona beach,d,hereinafter jack i.
while the jack litigation was still pending,the city amended its zoning ordinances still again to eliminate the constitutional infirmities identified by the district court relevant here,the city once again allowed adult theaters to open in the ba districts without the city also created a new zoning district category,the heavy industrial zoning district and ultimately applied it to acres in the western part of the city within this new district,adult theaters were permitted to open without the distance requirements that applied in ba districts.although the district consisted mostly of undeveloped land,the city ensured that telephone and power lines were installed in the district interior,the county paved a previously dirt road through it,and the city approved a preliminary plat for a subdivision straddling that road as a result of these changes,the district court concluded that the zoning ordinances were constitutional.jack,city of daytona beach,d,hereinafter jack ii.the court found that new sites were available in the district and that,in concert with one site already found to be available in the ba district,this created a constitutionally sufficient number of sites for the ten adult businesses that were operating or seeking to operate in daytona beach at that time.id.at.
nudity ordinances 
in conjunction with the zoning ordinances adopted in,the city enacted ordinance to prohibit nudity and sexual conduct in establishments that serve alcohol specifically,in any establishment that deals in alcoholic beverages,ordinance prohibits the expos ure to public view of a person genitals,pubic area,vulva,anus,anal cleft or cleavage or buttocks the expos ure to public view of any portion of a woman breasts below the top of the areola a wide variety of sexual activities and any simulation or graphic representation,including pictures or the projection of film,which depicts any of the conduct prohibited by the ordinance.in addition,ordinance provides that no person maintaining,owning,or operating an establishment dealing in alcoholic beverages shall suffer or permit any of the proscribed conduct.
by,the city of daytona beach became concerned that some bars were exploiting a loophole in ordinance by separating alcohol and nudity within a single structure but allowing for ready access between the two areas.the city also became increasingly concerned that lewd and lascivious conduct within adult theaters was increasing and that nudity in streets,parks,and other public places was especially a problem during events such as spring break and black college reunion.
motivated by these perceived concerns,the city enacted ordinance to reduce lewd and lascivious behavior,prostitution,sexual assaults and batteries,other criminal activity,the degradation of women,and activities which break down family structures and values.in fact,ordinance was enacted as a general public nudity ordinance and prohibited any person over ten years of age from recklessly,knowingly,or intentionally appearing in any public place with anything other than a full and opaque covering over the following areas t he male or female genitals,pubic area,or anal cleavage t he nipple and areola of the female breast at least of that outside surface area of the breast located below the top of the areola,which area shall be reasonably compact and contiguous to the areola o of the male or female buttocks centered over the cleavage of the buttocks for the length of the cleavage and,even if covered,the male genitals in a discernibly turgid state.ordinance also provided a list of items of clothing that are not sufficient to comply with its provisions items commonly known as,dental floss,and thongs.
in july,less than a year after the city enacted ordinance,a panel of this court decided lounge of bradenton,manatee county,cir.that decision suggested that an ordinance that does not leave an erotic dancer free to perform wearing pasties and would violate the first amendment because it would significantly affect the dancer capacity to convey an erotic message.id.at quotation marks omitted.about five weeks later,the city enacted ordinance,which amended ordinance to allow erotic dancers to wear and pasties within a fully enclosed structure legally established as an adult theater that is more than feet from an establishment that serves alcohol within feet of an establishment,however,ordinance applies and,as described above,requires clothing somewhat more modest than and pasties 
lollipop lawsuit 
on december,lollipop brought this suit challenging the constitutionality of the zoning ordinances and of ordinances,and.first,lollipop claimed that the zoning ordinances do not offer reasonable alternative venues for adult theaters to communicate their erotic message because an insufficient number of sites are available for adult theaters.alternatively,lollipop claimed that it was grandfathered in as a lawful nonconforming use under florida law.the district judge,who also presided over the jack litigation,granted summary judgment to the city of daytona beach on both claims,noting that the city had made no changes to the zoning ordinances since his decision in jack ii and that lollipop provided no evidence that warranted a departure from the earlier decision.
second,lollipop challenged ordinances,and,urging that they neither further a substantial government interest nor are narrowly tailored.the district court granted final summary judgment to the city on lollipop narrow tailoring claim,but concluded that there was a genuine issue of material fact about whether the three nudity ordinances furthered a substantial government interest.thereafter,at a bench trial,lollipop presented expert testimony in an effort to cast direct doubt on the city rationale for enacting the nudity ordinances.the experts explained at trial that they had conducted two empirical studies using data provided by the city.they concluded based on the data they examined that adult theaters in daytona beach had no statistically significant effect on crime rates,and that the city evidence offered to the contrary was shoddy and meaningless.
the district court agreed and concluded that lollipop evidence cast direct doubt on the city rationale for enacting the nudity ordinances 
plaintiffs have succeeded in their attempt to cast direct doubt on the city rationales for its ordinances.as persuasively demonstrated by plaintiffs expert studies,the city evidence consists either of purely anecdotal evidence or opinions based on highly unreliable data.most notably,the city evidence lacks data which would allow for a comparison of the rate of crime occurring in and around adult entertainment establishments with the rate of crime occurring in and around similarly situated establishments.absent the context that such a comparison might provide,the city data is,as plaintiffs assert,meaningless.
the court also determined that the additional evidence provided by the city in an effort to renew support for the ordinances was similarly flawed.the district court,therefore,held that ordinances,and did not further a substantial government interest and declared that they violated the first amendment.in fact,the district court struck all three nudity ordinances in their entirety,except for subsection e of the daytona beach code enacted by ordinance because that subsection regulates conduct.
these appeals followed lollipop argued that the district court had improvidently entered summary judgment for the city on its challenge to the zoning ordinances,as well as on its claim to grandfather status.the city,in turn,the court determination that the three nudity ordinances were unconstitutional.lollipop also appealed from the grant of final summary judgment to the city on its claim that the nudity ordinances are not narrowly tailored 
ii.zoning ordinances 
the city zoning ordinances do not ban adult theaters altogether but do restrict them to the ba and zoning districts and,in the ba districts,impose distance requirements between adult theaters and churches,schools,parks,playgrounds,and other adult businesses we review the constitutionality of a city ordinance de novo.see lounge of bradenton,manatee county,cir.
it is by now that zoning ordinances limiting the locations where adult businesses may be located are evaluated under the test for time,place,and manner regulations established in city of renton playtime theatres,d,and reaffirmed in city of los angeles alameda books,d.lounge,at see also david vincent,broward county,cir.we have summarized the renton framework this way 
first,the court must determine whether the ordinance constitutes an invalid total ban or merely a time,place,and manner regulation second,if the ordinance is determined to be a time,place,and manner regulation,the court must decide whether the ordinance should be subject to strict or intermediate scrutiny and third,if the ordinance is held to be subject to intermediate scrutiny,the court must determine whether it is designed to serve a substantial government interest and allows for reasonable alternative channels of communication.
lounge,at see also renton,at.because neither party disputes that the first two prongs have been satisfied or that the zoning ordinances serve a substantial government interest,our analysis under renton focuses solely on whether the zoning ordinances provide adult theaters with reasonable alternative channels of communication.we hold that they do.
a new zoning regime must leave adult businesses with a reasonable opportunity to relocate,and the number of sites available for adult businesses under the new zoning regime must be greater than or equal to the number of adult businesses in existence at the time the new zoning regime takes effect.fly fish,city of cocoa beach,cir quoting david vincent,at.although a district court calculation of the number of sites that a zoning ordinance makes available for adult businesses is a factual finding that we review only for clear error,the district court methodology in making that as whether a particular site is available and provides a reasonable avenue for communicating an adult business erotic a legal determination that we review de novo.david vincent,at see also fly fish,at.
we have enumerated several general rules to aid in deciding whether a particular site is available for first amendment purposes 
first,the economic feasibility of relocating to a site is not a first amendment concern.second,the fact that some development is required before a site can accommodate an adult business does not mean that the land is,per se,unavailable for first amendment purposes.the ideal lot is often not to be found.examples of impediments to the relocation of an adult business that may not be of a constitutional magnitude include having to build a new facility instead of moving into an existing building having to clean up waste or landscape a site bearing the costs of generally applicable lighting,parking,or green space requirements making do with less space than one desired or having to purchase a larger lot than one needs.third,the first amendment is not concerned with restraints that are not imposed by the government itself or the physical characteristics of the sites designated for adult use by the zoning ordinance.it is of no import under renton that the real estate market may be tight and sites currently unavailable for sale or lease,or that property owners may be reluctant to sell to an adult venue.
david vincent,at.as the supreme court explained in renton,simply because adult businesses must fend for themselves in the real estate market,on an equal footing with other prospective purchasers and lessees,does not give rise to a first amendment violation.at.
here,the district court relied on its earlier finding in jack ii that in the district and one in the ba available for adult theaters.d at.because the jack ii court found that,at most,ten adult theaters were operating or seeking to operate in the city of daytona beach,id.at,it held that the zoning ordinances provide for a constitutionally sufficient number of sites,id.at.in the instant case,the district court concluded that lollipop had presented no evidence to warrant a departure from its earlier ruling in jack ii.
lollipop vigorously disagrees,contending that the district is no more than unimproved industrial property and that,therefore,the lots in the district can not count as being available under renton.the undisputed historical facts concerning the district are these telephone and power lines extend through the interior of the district along a road water and sewer lines have been installed up to the boundary of the district a preliminary plat has been approved for acres of the district that would create at least sites fronting the road and the entire district is owned by a single private landowner,not by the city.id.at.
under the applicable case law,these undisputed facts yield the conclusion that the sites in the district are available for first amendment purposes.it is irrelevant for our purposes that all of the land in the district is owned by a single private landowner who may be reluctant or unwilling to develop or sell the land.see david vincent,at holding that i t is of no import under renton that the real estate market may be tight and sites currently unavailable for sale or lease,or that property owners may be reluctant to sell to an adult venue,and finding sites available even though there was no evidence that any of the land is for sale.nor is it constitutionally significant that the land is mostly vacant where,as here,the city has provided sufficient infrastructure for a private developer to commence development,including a paved road,telephone and power lines,and water and sewer lines.see id.at examples of impediments to the relocation of an adult business that may not be of a constitutional magnitude include having to build a new facility instead of moving into an existing building.
although we have acknowledged that the physical characteristics of a site or the character of current development could render relocation by an adult business unreasonable,examples of such unavailable sites are land under the ocean,airstrips of international airports,and sports stadiums.id.at.here,the land in the district is hardly comparable to such sites,where relocation is,for all practical purposes,untenable.finally,the city has removed the legal obstacles that might have prevented adult theaters from relocating to the district,and has gone so far as to approve a preliminary plat for a subdivision straddling the main road in the district.id.at t he first amendment is not concerned with restraints that are not imposed by the government itself.in short,we agree with the district court that the sites in the district are available under renton.and because the record shows that no more than ten adult theaters are operating or seeking to operate in daytona beach,the zoning ordinances are constitutional reasonable alternative channels of communication are available.
lollipop also claims that,even if the zoning ordinances are constitutional,lollipop is otherwise grandfathered in under florida law lollipop argument is grounded on the contention that the zoning ordinances were unconstitutional at the time that lollipop began operating as an adult theater.although the city may now have cured the earlier constitutional defects,lollipop argues that no valid law made lollipop unlawful when it opened.thus,according to lollipop,its right to operate at its current location vested at that time,and it may continue to operate there despite any subsequent changes to the zoning ordinances that rendered it a nonconforming use the district court granted summary judgment to the city on this claim too,and we review the district court determination de novo.see reserve,town of longboat key,cir.
not surprisingly,vested rights are not created easily under florida law.coral springs,city of sunrise,cir.the overarching pattern in florida case law is that vested rights can be created only in two circumstances.id.at.the first occurs when a party has reasonably and detrimentally relied on existing law,creating the conditions of equitable estoppel,while the second occurs when the defendant municipality has acted in a clear display of bad faith.id.here,neither circumstance applies.it is undisputed that when lollipop began operating as an adult theater,it violated the zoning ordinances as then written.as a matter of logic,then,lollipop can not have relied on existing law because it began operating plainly in contravention of that law.nor is there any record evidence of bad faith or arbitrary behavior by the city.therefore,on this record,the district court correctly concluded that lollipop has failed to establish a vested right to continue operating as a lawful nonconforming use.
iii.nudity ordinances 
we analyze the three nudity ordinances challenged here under the test for expressive conduct set forth by the supreme court in united states,d,and employed in city of erie pap,d.as we have explained 
according to this test,public nudity ordinances that incidentally impact protected expression should be upheld if they are within the constitutional power of the government to enact further a substantial governmental interest are unrelated to the suppression of free expression and restrict first amendment freedoms no greater than necessary to further the government interest.
lounge,at.here,our analysis focuses on the second and fourth prongs because there is no dispute between the parties as to the first and third prongs.
substantial government interest 
under second prong,a city must establish that the challenged ordinance furthers a substantial government interest.pap,at.plurality opinion it has been by now clearly established that reducing the secondary effects associated with adult businesses is a substantial government interest that must be accorded high respect.city of alameda books,d kennedy,concurring in the judgment quotation marks omitted see also pap,at.plurality opinion c ombating the harmful secondary effects associated with nude dancing is undeniably important.ctr.for fair pub.policy maricopa county,cir it is beyond peradventure at this point in the development of the doctrine that a state interest in curbing the secondary effects associated with adult entertainment establishments is substantial.
as for whether an ordinance furthers this interest,a city bears the initial burden of producing evidence that it relied upon to reach the conclusion that the ordinance furthers the city interest in reducing secondary effects.lounge,at.to that end,a city need not conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other cities,so long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the city addresses.alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment quoting renton,at.see also id.at.plurality opinion a municipality may rely on any evidence that is reasonably believed to be relevant for demonstrating a connection between speech and a substantial,independent government interest.quotation marks omitted pap,at.plurality opinion quoting renton reasonably believed to be relevant language.although a municipality must rely on at least some evidence,such evidence can consist of a municipality own findings,evidence gathered by other localities,or evidence described in a judicial opinion.lounge,at see,pap,at.plurality opinion finding sufficient that the city council relied on this court opinions detailing the harmful secondary effects caused by adult establishments,as well as on its own experiences barnes glen theatre,d souter,concurring in the judgment permitting a municipality to rely on prior judicial opinions renton,at.holding that the city was entitled to rely on the experiences of other cities and on a judicial opinion.
once a city has provided evidence that it reasonably believed to be relevant to its rationale for enacting the ordinance,plaintiffs must be given the opportunity to cast direct doubt on this rationale,either by demonstrating that the city evidence does not support its rationale or by furnishing evidence that disputes the city factual findings.lounge,at quoting alameda books,at.plurality opinion see,pap,at.plurality opinion rejecting claim when plaintiff never challenged the city council findings or cast any specific doubt on the validity of those findings.if plaintiffs succeed in casting doubt on a municipality rationale in either manner,the burden shifts back to the municipality to supplement the record with evidence renewing support for a theory that justifies its ordinance.alameda books,at.plurality opinion citing pap,at.plurality opinion see also lounge,at.
although the burden lies with the municipality,a court should be careful not to substitute its own judgment for that of the municipality,and the municipality legislative judgment should be upheld provided that it can show that its judgment is still supported by credible evidence,upon which it reasonably relies.lounge,at.
here,the city of daytona beach plainly carried its initial burden to show that the three challenged nudity ordinances furthered its interest in reducing the negative secondary effects associated with adult theaters.the city has produced a substantial body of evidence that it reasonably believed to be relevant to combating those problems.ordinance prohibits nudity and sexual conduct in establishments that serve alcohol.as the ordinance itself says,the city rationale was to reduce the negative secondary effects associated with adult theaters 
it is hereby found that the acts prohibited in this ordinance encourage the conduct of prostitution,attempted rape,rape,murder,and assaults on police officers in and around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages,that actual and simulated nudity and sexual conduct and the depiction thereof coupled with alcohol in public places begets undesirable behavior,that sexual,lewd,lascivious,and salacious conduct among patrons and employees within establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages results in violation of law and dangers to the health,safety and welfare of the public 
ordinance.to support this rationale,ordinance cites two supreme court decisions,new york state liquor authority bellanca,d per curiam,and california larue,d,both of which upheld prohibitions on nude dancing in establishments that serve alcohol.see bellanca,at.upholding statute where the legislature had found that c ommon sense indicates that any form of nudity coupled with alcohol in a public place begets undesirable behavior larue,at.the conclusion that certain sexual performances and the dispensation of liquor by the drink ought not to occur at premises that have licenses was not an irrational one.
although the city reliance on these cases may be sufficient to carry the city initial burden,see pap,at.plurality opinion suggesting that a city can carry its initial burden by relying solely on relevant supreme court cases,the legislative history of ordinance shows that the city also relied on its own experiences to support its rationale.that legislative history includes a document describing the difficulties faced by law enforcement in arresting and successfully prosecuting crimes relating to prostitution and pornography and listing arrests for prostitution and other crimes that occurred in or near many daytona beach adult businesses a short memorandum written by the city police chief that provides a partial list of situations,offenses and incidents which have occurred within the areas of topless bar establishments that can be substantiated by police reports and testimony of various police officers police dispatch records of calls for service cad data from areas around adult businesses from november to july,which were attached to the police chief memorandum police reports of prostitution arrests police reports of seven arrests for assault and battery of a police officer in or near an adult theater and the minutes of a public hearing summarizing local business owners firsthand accounts of criminal activity in and around adult businesses.
this legislative history supporting the enactment of ordinance is more than sufficient to carry the city initial burden under second prong.see,alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment concluding that the city carried its initial burden with a single study and common experience pap,at.plurality opinion holding that the city legislative findings were sufficient because city council members,familiar with the city commercial downtown,are the individuals who would likely have had firsthand knowledge of what took place at and around nude dancing establishments see also lounge,at.
as for ordinances and,the city likewise carried its initial burden of proof.ordinance was enacted as a general public nudity ordinance to protect and preserve the health,safety and welfare of the city residents.daytona beach,code a,enacted by ordinance.the ordinance sets forth the following findings the appearance of persons in the nude in public places increases incidents of lewd and lascivious behavior,prostitution,sexual assaults and batteries,attracts other criminal activity to the community,encourages degradation of women,and facilitates other activities which break down family structures and values.ordinance.to support these findings,the city relied on,among other things,newspaper articles describing incidents of public nudity and other criminal activity during spring break and black college reunion narrative reports by undercover detectives describing instances of sexual conduct,nudity,and violations of ordinance by dancers at adult theaters and the supreme court decisions in pap,and barnes,d.as with ordinance,the evidence for ordinance is sufficient for the city to carry its initial burden under second prong.
ordinance amended ordinance to allow erotic dancers to wear and pasties within an adult theater located more than feet from an establishment that serves alcohol,but ordinance somewhat more restrictive clothing remain applicable within feet of such an establishment.daytona beach,code b,enacted by ordinance.in support of ordinance,the city relied on langston and smith testimony from function junction.as we have noted,langston testified that live nude and seminude entertainment businesses promote and perpetuate urban decay and that adult businesses have impacted on crime in the area surrounding daytona beach.id.at.smith,who as an assistant state attorney had prosecuted drug and prostitution offenses in daytona beach,concurred that there were more drug and prostitution offenses in topless bars than in other bars.id.at.
the city also relied on several controlled studies conducted by william george about the relationship between drinking alcohol and sexual conduct.thus,for example,one study found that exposure to erotica led male subjects to drink more alcohol than did exposure to materials another study found that young men who believed they had consumed of whether they had in fact done greater interest in viewing violent erotic images and reported increased sexual arousal than young men who believed they had not consumed alcohol still another study found that study participants perceived a woman they believed had consumed alcohol as being significantly more aggressive,impaired,sexually available,and as significantly more likely to engage in foreplay and intercourse than a woman whom study participants believed had not consumed alcohol finally,ordinance expressly incorporates all of the evidence that the city previously had relied on to support ordinances and.the city evidence for ordinance is sufficient to carry the city initial burden under second prong.
because the city carried its initial burden,the district court properly gave lollipop the opportunity to cast direct doubt on the city rationale,either by demonstrating that the city evidence does not support its rationale or by furnishing evidence that disputes the city factual findings.see pap,at.plurality opinion lounge,at see also alameda books,at.plurality opinion.to this end,as we have noted,two expert witnesses testified that the city evidence consisted of shoddy,meaningless,and unreliable data and that its reasoning was equally shoddy.the experts explained that the city provided no empirical data to support the conclusion that prostitution and other crimes occurred more frequently in and around adult theaters than elsewhere,and that the cad data and police reports lacked reliability because they did not cover all of the areas where adult theaters are located in daytona beach and contained no comparison data from other areas of the city against which the incidents occurring in and around adult theaters could be measured.similarly,lollipop experts said that the narrative reports of undercover law enforcement and the testimony from function junction about urban blight and crime being found around adult theaters lacked comparative data,did not cover a sufficient period of time to rule out momentary fluctuations,and were merely the result of law enforcement.experts report.the experts also observed that george studies were conducted in controlled laboratory settings,and,therefore,the experts opined,the studies conclusions could not be generalized to the real world situation of alcoholic beverage consumption in an adult nightclub that features topless or nude entertainment.id.at.
to buttress their critique of the city evidence,lollipop experts conducted two empirical studies.the first study analyzed cad data provided by the city for the months preceding ordinance enactment to examine the relationship between the presence of adult cabarets in areas and the rates of crime in those areas.id.at.the experts compared cad data from areas that had adult theaters to control areas that did not and found no statistically significant differences in overall rates of crime between study and control areas.id.at.they concluded that their empirical study cast grave doubt on the findings of the city commission that the combination of nude topless dancing and alcohol increase s rape,attempted rape,murder,and assaults on police officers.id.at quoting ordinance.
the second empirical study focused on the city rationale for ordinances and and examined cad data from march to april.this study compared the presence of an adult theater to other demographic variables previously used by criminologists and found to be related to criminal activity,such as a local area population,age structure especially the presence of young adults,composition,housing vacancies,households,and the number of alcohol retail sale establishments.id.at see also id.at.based on their statistical analysis,lollipop experts concluded that these other variables were statistically strongly related to crime events,whereas the presence of an adult theater accounted for an insubstantial amount of crime in the relevant area.id.at emphasis omitted see also id.at.the experts concluded that only of the criminal activity within a radius of adult theaters could be attributed to the theaters,and that adult theaters accounted for zero or percent of the sex crime activity in their near vicinity.id.at.
the district court agreed with lollipop experts that the city evidence for all three nudity ordinances was shoddy and meaningless.it concluded that lollipop had succeeded in casting direct doubt on the city rationale for each ordinance and declared all three nudity ordinances unconstitutional.the district court said that lollipop experts scientific studies cast direct doubt on the city anecdotal evidence primarily because the court read the supreme court decision in alameda books and our opinion in lounge to have raised the bar somewhat on renton reasonably believed to be relevant standard.dist.am.order.
in alameda books,the plurality explained the renton standard this way 
in renton,we specifically refused to set such a high bar for municipalities that want to address merely the secondary effects of protected speech.we held that a municipality may rely on any evidence that is reasonably believed to be relevant for demonstrating a connection between speech and a substantial,independent government interest.
alameda books,at.plurality opinion quoting renton,at.but the plurality then warned this is not to say that a municipality can get away with shoddy data or reasoning.the municipality evidence must fairly support the municipality rationale for its ordinance.id.although justice kennedy opinion,not the plurality,is the holding in alameda books,we quoted the plurality shoddy data and fairly supports language several times in lounge,at.
we do not agree,however,with lollipop claim that either alameda books or lounge raises the evidentiary bar or requires a city to justify its ordinances with empirical evidence or scientific studies.justice kennedy alameda books concurrence,which all parties agree states the holding of that case under the rationale explained in marks united states,d,emphasized that the evidentiary standard announced in renton remained sound 
w e have consistently held that a city must have latitude to experiment,at least at the outset,and that very little evidence is required.the first amendment does not require a city,before enacting such an ordinance,to conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other cities,so long as whatever evidence the city relies upon is reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem that the city addresses.
alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment quoting renton,at.emphasis added 
our opinion in lounge is consistent with justice kennedy concurrence in alameda books and with renton.there,a panel of this court held that t o satisfy renton,any evidence reasonably believed to be relevant including a municipality own findings,evidence gathered by other localities,or evidence described in a judicial form an adequate predicate to the adoption of a secondary effects ordinance,lounge,at,and we remanded that case with specific instructions to uphold the ordinance provided that the county judgment is still supported by credible evidence,upon which it reasonably relies,id.at emphasis added.
here,lollipop argument that the city evidence is flawed because it consists of anecdotal accounts rather than empirical studies essentially asks this court to hold today that the city reliance on anything but empirical studies based on scientific methods is unreasonable.this was not the law before alameda books,and it is not the law now.see alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment reiterating that a city need not conduct new studies or produce evidence independent of that already generated by other cities quoting renton,at.pap,at.plurality opinion criticizing the dissent for ignor ing erie actual experience and instead requir ing an empirical analysis.rather,the city of daytona beach could reasonably rely upon c ommon sense,see bellanca,at,its own experiences,see pap,at.plurality opinion,the experiences of other cities,renton,at,or city officials local knowledge,see alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment the los angeles city council knows the streets of los angeles better than we do.it is entitled to rely on that knowledge citations omitted see also pap,at.plurality opinion.
to be sure,as the alameda books plurality admonished,the city can not get away with shoddy data or reasoning,and its evidence must fairly support its rationale.see at.plurality opinion.but this is simply another way of saying that the city reliance on evidence supporting its rationale must be reasonable.anecdotal evidence is not shoddy per se.at most,lollipop experts studies suggest that the city could have reached a different conclusion during its legislative process about the relationship between adult theaters and negative secondary effects.but demonstrating the possibility of such an alternative does not necessarily mean that the city was barred from reaching other reasonable and different conclusions.see,town of joseph,cir although this evidence shows that the town might have reached a different and equally reasonable conclusion regarding the relationship between adverse secondary effects and sexually oriented businesses,it is not sufficient to vitiate the result reached in the town legislative process.see also alameda books,at.plurality opinion noting that a city does not bear the burden of providing evidence that rules out every theory that is inconsistent with its own.
our review is designed to determine whether the city rationale was a reasonable one,and even if lollipop demonstrates that another conclusion was also reasonable,we can not simply substitute our own judgment for the city.see lounge,at see also barnes,at.souter,concurring in the judgment at least as to the regulation of expressive conduct,w e decline to void a statute essentially on the ground that it is unwise legislation quoting,at.alterations in original renton,at.it is not our function to appraise the wisdom of the city decision to regulate adult theaters second alteration added and quotation marks omitted alameda books,at.kennedy,concurring in the judgment c ourts should not be in the business of empirical assessments of city planners.
the city of daytona beach relied on,among other things,the supreme court decisions in bellanca,larue,barnes,and pap numerous police reports of criminal prostitution and assaults on police and around adult theaters undercover police investigations that revealed numerous violations of city ordinances by adult theaters the city police chief documentation of criminal activity in and around adult theaters cad data showing to police dispatchers from areas near adult theaters extensive testimony taken in function junction.at studies conducted by boston and detroit showing that adult businesses tend to increase urban blight studies of urban blight and decay in daytona beach controlled laboratory studies showing a correlation between alcohol and sexual conduct anecdotal accounts from local business owners about increased crime in and around adult theaters and newspaper articles describing increases in problems related to nudity and alcohol surrounding events such as spring break and black college reunion.because lollipop has failed to cast direct doubt on the aggregation of evidence that the city reasonably relied upon when enacting the challenged ordinances,we hold that the ordinances further a substantial government interest under.
moreover,a close examination of lollipop experts studies calls into question their stated conclusion that they cast grave doubt on the city evidence that adult theaters increase crime,and,equally important,the studies do not even purport to address the city evidence that adult theaters tend more generally to perpetuate urban blight and decay.first,one underlying methodological problem with both studies suggests that they cast little or no doubt on the city evidence that nudity in establishments that serve alcohol encourages prostitution,undesirable behavior,and sexual,lewd,lascivious,and salacious conduct among patrons and employees in violation of law and en dangers the health,safety and welfare of the public.see ordinance.the experts studies are based solely on cad data,which,in lay terms,is essentially emergency call data.relying on such data to study crime rates is problematic,however,because many crimes do not result in calls to,and,therefore,do not have corresponding records in the city cad data this is especially true for crimes,such as and prostitution,that the city sought to reduce by enacting the challenged ordinances.see ordinance seeking to reduce lewd and lascivious behavior,prostitution,sexual assaults and batteries,other criminal activity,and the degradation of women ordinance seeking to reduce prostitution,undesirable behavior,and illegal sexual,lewd,lascivious,and salacious conduct among patrons and employees of adult theaters see also ordinance relying on legislative record for ordinances and.
such crimes are often victimless,in the sense that all of those involved are willing participants,and,therefore,they rarely result in calls to.college students on spring break are unlikely to call after a wild night out on the town despite having participated in exactly the sort of activity that the city nudity ordinances were enacted to reduce.likewise,an encounter between a prostitute and a john rarely leads to a call.by contrast,the city anecdotal evidence may be a more accurate assessment of such crimes because it is not based on a data set that undercounts the incidents of such victimless crimes.world wide video of,city of spokane,cir anecdotal evidence and reported experience can be as telling as statistical data and can serve as a legitimate basis for finding negative secondary effects.citation and alteration omitted 
a second problem with lollipop experts studies is that,even if the underlying cad data fully reflected all of the conduct that daytona beach sought to reduce,the experts appear to draw conclusions that overstate the underlying data.for example,the study that focuses on ordinance concludes that crimes against persons,crimes against property,and sex crimes,including both rape and prostitution,are not more common in areas with adult businesses than they are in similar control areas.experts report.but the experts own underlying data suggests three of the six pairs of study and control areas that the experts examined,the study areas,areas with adult theaters,do show significantly higher rates of crime than the control areas.id.at emphasis added.
the experts attempt to explain away this result by pointing to the other three show no significant difference between study and control areas,and one shows a significantly higher crime rate in the control area than the study area.the experts assert,without much discussion,that t his mixed pattern shows that factors other than the presence of a nude cabaret are affecting rates of crime.id.at.the experts are no doubt correct that factors other than the presence of adult theaters affect crime rates in daytona beach crime is plainly caused by many factors.but that does little to undermine the city conclusion that adult theaters also affect crime rates,especially when the experts own analysis shows a statistically significant correlation between adult theaters and increased crime in half of the areas in the study 
finally,both studies focus only on criminal activity and do not even purport to address the connection between adult theaters and urban blight.ordinance,which amended ordinance,was supported by testimony from function junction that adult theaters promote and perpetuate urban blight,which in daytona beach was characterized by a significant percentage of deteriorating structures a large number of small lots,which did not allow cars a notable parking problem a high incidence of crime,particularly,on the beachside and a large percentage of antiquated,underground utility systems,such as drainage,water and sewer systems.at.lollipop experts studies examine only one of these crime,notably,do not address at all the city evidence that adult theaters tend to perpetuate these other features of urban blight.although lollipop experts argue that the testimony provided in function junction was based on unreliable data and methodologically unsound analysis,we repeat that the city reliance on such evidence need only have been reasonable,and it was.
in short,the cad data relied on by both studies may substantially undercount incidents of many of the types of crime that the city sought to reduce the data that the studies did analyze show some statistically significant correlations between adult theaters and increased criminal activity and the studies completely fail to address evidence of increased urban blight and decay that the city reasonably relied on when enacting ordinance.thus,lollipop has failed to cast direct doubt on all of the evidence that the city reasonably relied on when enacting the challenged ordinances.see lounge,at noting that the government must rely on at least some evidence emphasis in original wise,unified gov t of county,cir noting that a municipality must have some factual basis for its rationale emphasis in original quotation marks omitted see also world wide video,at explaining that a city needs only some evidence to support its ordinances baby dolls topless saloons,city of dallas,cir renton teaches us that the government must produce some evidence of adverse secondary effects emphasis in original citation omitted.accordingly,we hold that ordinances,and further a substantial government interest under 
narrow tailoring 
under the fourth prong of the test,an ordinance that imposes a reasonable time,place,or manner restriction on nudity must be no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the government interest.pap,at.plurality opinion.the supreme court has made clear,however,that does not impose strict scrutiny familiar least restrictive means requirement 
lest any confusion on the point remain,we reaffirm today that a regulation of the time,place,or manner of protected speech must be narrowly tailored to serve the government legitimate,interests but that it need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of doing so.rather,the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long as the regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.

here,the combined effect of ordinances,and is that at least and pasties are required in all adult theaters regardless of location,and that ordinance slightly more modest clothing requirements apply at establishments that either serve alcohol or are located within feet of an establishment that serves alcohol.lollipop argues that requiring more than and pasties at establishments that serve alcohol imposes a greater restriction than is necessary to further the city substantial interest in reducing negative secondary effects 
appellants are claiming,at a minimum,that adults have a right to perform in pasties and where alcohol is served.appellants further argue that the city ordinances are unduly restrictive because they should allow pasties and at more locations.appellants claim should be understood in the broadest terms government simply has no business telling adults what they can and can not wear beyond a simple prohibition against nudity.

we break no new ground in rejecting lollipop argument.it is that a nudity ordinance that imposes a minimum requirement of and pasties is narrowly tailored under.see pap,at.plurality opinion the requirement that dancers wear pasties and is a minimal restriction in furtherance of the asserted government interests,and the restriction leaves ample capacity to convey the dancer erotic message.barnes,at.souter,concurring in the judgment pasties and a moderate the expression to some degree,to be sure,but only to a degree.dropping the final stitch is prohibited,but the limitation is minor when measured against the dancer remaining capacity and opportunity to express the erotic message.id.at.plurality opinion indiana requirement that the dancers wear at least pasties and is modest,and the bare minimum necessary to achieve the state purpose.lounge,at suggesting that the ordinance at issue,which did not leave erotic dancers free to perform wearing and pasties in any location in the county,was not narrowly tailored.
so too,the first amendment does not prevent a city from limiting the venues where dancers may communicate their erotic message.an ordinance that does not prohibit all nude dancing,but only restricts nude dancing in those locations where the unwanted secondary effects arise,is narrowly tailored.wise,at.and an ordinance that defines those locations by reference to the presence of establishments that serve alcohol does not unduly restrict the ability to communicate an erotic message.see grand faloon tavern,wicker,cir n ude entertainment necessarily involves a substantial degree of conduct,and any artistic or communicative elements present in such conduct are not of a kind whose content or effectiveness is dependent upon being conveyed where alcoholic beverages are served.thus,both the requirement that dancers wear and pasties in all adult theaters,and the additional requirement of clothing somewhat more within feet of establishments that serve alcohol,are narrowly tailored under.
iv.conclusion 
accordingly,we hold that all of the city ordinances challenged in this lawsuit are constitutional.we affirm the district court decision upholding the city zoning ordinances we reverse the district court decision striking down ordinances,and and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
