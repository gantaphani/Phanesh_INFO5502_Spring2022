plaintiff norton styne sued defendant connie stevens,a prominent entertainer,for sums allegedly due under an oral contract.before trial,stevens sought summary judgment on grounds that the alleged contract involved styne procurement of professional employment for stevens,that styne thus acted as a talent agency but lacked the necessary license,and that the contract was therefore illegal and void under the talent agencies act.the trial court denied the motion,reasoning that styne activities on stevens behalf were not of a kind governed by the act.later,the court refused stevens request for a jury instruction presenting her defense.
the jury found for styne,but the trial court granted stevens motion for a new trial.the court concluded it had erred in refusing stevens request for a jury instruction on the requirements of the talent agencies act.
styne appealed the new trial order.he urged that the talent agencies act was not involved in the parties dispute because the trial evidence disclosed no activities requiring a license.in any event,he also asserted,stevens defense was barred by her failure to raise it,and submit it to the commissioner,within the act limitations period.stevens responded that the evidence did suggest styne had acted as a talent agency,and that stevens was free to assert the consequent illegality of the contract as a defense to styne court suit without regard to the act statute of limitations or its requirement of first referral to the commissioner.
the court of appeal reversed the new trial order and reinstated the verdict.the appellate court held that stevens defense under the talent agencies act was barred because she had failed to invoke the act,and to refer the matter to the commissioner,within one year after she was served with styne complaint.
on review,we reach the following conclusions contrary to the court of appeal holding,a statute of limitations does not bar a defense involving no claim for affirmative relief.hence,section,subdivision c,the limitations period contained in the talent agencies act,did not affect the times within which stevens could take actions necessary to assert her defense against styne suit for breach of contract.on the other hand,the court of appeal was correct insofar as it determined that under section,subdivision a,stevens claims,if colorable,must first be referred to the commissioner for resolution.stevens claim that section,subdivision a does not apply to defenses lacks merit.
by granting a new trial on grounds that an instruction concerning the talent agencies act requirements should have been given,the superior court necessarily determined,contrary to its prior assumption,that stevens has a colorable defense under the act.the court of appeal agreed that the trial evidence permitted such an inference,and that conclusion appears correct.accordingly,stevens is entitled to maintain her defense,though it must be pursued in the first instance before the commissioner.
as we explain in greater detail below,the appropriate disposition is therefore to reverse the judgment of the court of appeal,thus reinstating the new trial order.however,we will instruct the court of appeal to direct that new trial proceedings in the superior court be stayed pending submission to the commissioner of issues arising under the talent agencies act.
in january,styne sued stevens,asserting various theories arising from stevens claimed breach of contract.styne original and amended complaints alleged as follows styne was stevens longtime personal manager.he had devoted professional efforts that substantially led to stevens deal with home shopping network hsn to feature stevens as a celebrity spokesperson selling her own line of beauty products on cable television.under the deal,stevens company would gain profits by selling products to hsn,which would then resell them to consumers.at the time of these events,styne and stevens had an oral management contract,whereby styne would use his efforts to advance the career efforts of stevens.in return,stevens would pay styne a commission of percent of all gross monies derived by stevens arising out of or in connection with stevens s professional endeavors.between and the date of the complaint,stevens company made many sales of beauty products to hsn,and stevens earned profits from these sales.styne made demand on stevens for his share of these profits,and stevens refused to pay.
stevens did not.her april answer asserted no defense under the talent agencies act.however,in july,after discovery,stevens moved for summary judgment on grounds that the contract styne alleged was void because styne had no talent agency license.stevens theory was that styne various discussions with hsn,including those relating to the sale of stevens own beauty products,were efforts to procure employment or engagements for stevens in her capacity as an artist,subd.a see also,subd.b,and thus were the services of a talent agency for which the act required a license 
in opposition,styne did not dispute he lacked a talent agency license.however,he urged that stevens defense,based on a claimed violation of the talent agencies act,was within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the commissioner,the defense was waived because not raised within the act statute of limitations,and styne had not acted as a talent agency because,among other things,his efforts to help stevens market her company product line were not the procurement of her employment or engagement as an artist.
the trial court denied stevens motion for summary judgment based on the grounds set forth in the opposing party papers.in particular,the court opined that stevens claim that styne had acted as an unlicensed talent agency was without merit,because the income derived from hsn was based upon sales generated from products of stevens company sold to the public and not through the employment or engagement of the artist.labor code section a.connie stevens was not employed by the home shopping club.
trial began in january.at the outset,stevens proposed an instruction that would require the jury to determine whether styne had violated the talent agencies act.the trial court ultimately refused the instruction.
the trial evidence,like that adduced on summary judgment,permitted an inference that,under an agreement with stevens,styne undertook extensive efforts to promote her employment with hsn as a celebrity spokesperson,and through record albums and live concert performances to be produced by hsn.in numerous meetings with hsn personnel,styne touted stevens wholesome image and communications skills.styne provided hsn with detailed budgets and profit projections for the ideas he proposed.he set up a meeting between stevens and top hsn executives to cement a deal,and he took credit for bringing about the final arrangement with hsn.as before,the evidence also indicated that,while stevens ultimately appeared on the network to promote her own company products,she was not paid by hsn for these appearances as such,but instead derived revenue from sales of her company products to hsn.
the jury found for styne and awarded some million in damages.stevens moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict judgment,and alternatively,for a new trial.in the motion for judgment,stevens urged that the alleged contract was void for violation of the talent agencies act.in the new trial motion,stevens argued that the trial court had erred by refusing her proffered instruction allowing the jury to void the contract for violation of the act if it concluded that styne activities were an attempt to procure professional employment for stevens.
the trial court denied the motion for judgment however,the court granted the motion for new trial,agreeing with stevens that it should have instructed the jury re the requirements of the talent agencies act.
styne appealed from the new trial order.the court of appeal,second appellate district,division two,reversed.the appellate court first concluded that any dispute arising under the talent agencies act must first be submitted to the commissioner,and no exception arises when a violation of the act is raised solely as a defense in a court suit.second,the court of appeal reasoned that such a defense had been waived in any event,because stevens had failed to raise it,or submit it to the commissioner,within one year after the statute of limitations set forth in section began to run.for purposes of defensive application,the court of appeal held,the limitations period commenced when stevens received formal notice of styne claim by service of process in his lawsuit.
we granted review.
discussion 
overview of talent agencies act.
as indicated above,the talent agencies act et regulates the activities of a talent agency,a person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring,offering,promising,or attempting to procure employment or engagements for an artist or artists,subd.a,italics added.artists include stage and screen actors radio and musical artists musical organizations theater,movie,and radio directors writers cinematographers composers lyricists arrangers models and other artists and persons rendering professional services in motion picture,theatrical,radio,television and other entertainment enterprises,subd.b.the act is remedial its purpose is to protect artists seeking professional employment from the abuses of talent agencies.waisbren peppercorn productions,th,d waisbren buchwald superior court d.
as also indicated,the act definition of a talent agency is narrowly focused on efforts to secure professional employment or engagements for an artist or artists,subd.a.thus,it does not cover other services for which artists often contract,such as personal and career management,advice,direction,coordination,and oversight with respect to an artist career or personal or financial affairs park deftones th,d park waisbren,supra,th,d,nor does it govern assistance in an artist business transactions other than professional employment.
among other things,the act provides that n o person shall engage in or carry on the occupation of a talent agency without first procuring a license from the labor commissioner.the weight of authority is that even the incidental or occasional provision of such services requires licensure.park,supra,th,d waisbren,supra,th,d but see wachs curry th,d.in furtherance of the act protective aims,an unlicensed person contract with an artist to provide the services of a talent agency is illegal and void.waisbren,supra,at,d buchwald superior court,supra,d.
statute of limitations.
after providing that all cases of controversy arising thereunder shall first be refer red by the parties to the commissioner,subd.a,the talent agencies act further declares that n o action or proceeding shall be brought pursuant to the act with respect to any violation which is alleged to have occurred more than one year prior to commencement of the action or proceeding,subd.c,italics added.the court of appeal ruled that this limitations period applied to stevens defensive use of the act,and that it began to run against her when styne filed and served his complaint against her in january.see park,supra,th,d.as the court of appeal noted,stevens did not raise the act as a defense until she filed her motion for summary judgment in august.in the court of appeal view,stevens defense was thus barred by her failure to invoke it,or to submit it to the commissioner,within the applicable period.
stevens insists the court of appeal holding contravenes the clear rule that statutes of limitations do not apply to defenses.we agree.under authority,a defense may be raised at any time,even if the matter alleged would be barred by a statute of limitations if asserted as the basis for affirmative relief.the rule applies in particular to contract actions.one sued on a contract may urge defenses that render the contract unenforceable,even if the same matters,alleged as grounds for restitution after rescission,would be untimely,estate of cover cal,bank of america vannini d,stiles bodkin d,see french construction laborers pension trust d.french nonjudicial rescission on grounds of fraud and mistake cox schnerr cal,quiet title suit based on fraudulent deed witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions.
statutes of limitations bar actions or proceedings,french,supra,d,thus guarding against stale claims and affording repose against litigation.they act as shields,not swords.id.at.thus,we long ago explained with respect to a fraud defense that neither the limitation of the statute nor the doctrine of laches will operate to bar the defense of the invalidity of the agreement upon the ground of fraud,for so long as the plaintiff is permitted to come into court seeking to enforce the agreement,the defendant may allege and prove fraud as a defense.in short,it is not incumbent upon one who has thus been defrauded to go into court and ask relief,but he may abide his time,and when enforcement is sought against him excuse himself from performance by proof of the fraud.estate of cover,supra,cal.the same reasoning applies to any grounds for asserting the illegality of the contract upon which the plaintiff sues.
as the united states supreme court recently stated in another context,the object of a statute of limitation in keeping stale litigation out of the courts,would be distorted if the statute were applied to bar an otherwise legitimate defense to a timely lawsuit,for limitation statutes are aimed at lawsuits,not at the consideration of particular issues in lawsuits.beach ocwen fed.bank,d.
styne suggests that under park,the defendant in a contract suit must assert a talent agencies act defense,and submit it to the commissioner,within one year after commencement of the action.in park,however,the matter was submitted to the commissioner within one year after the action began,and the court of appeal simply endorsed the commissioner conclusion that it was therefore timely.park,supra,th,d.there is no indication the issue whether statutes of limitations apply at all to defenses was considered.hence,park is not authority for the proposition that the act statute of limitations may bar assertion of the act as a defense.
indeed,the commissioner,whose interpretation of a statute he is charged with enforcing deserves substantial weight see,kelly methodist hospital of california cal th,d,has consistently held that the limitations period of section,subdivision c does not apply to pure defenses arising under the talent agencies act,hyperion animation,toltec artists,tac pure defenses not untimely though invoked more than one year after both challenged contracts and commencement of agent superior court action sevano artistic productions,tac defense not untimely because not raised within one year after plaintiff demand for arbitration rooney levy,tac act statute of limitations does not bar commission petition seeking declaration that contract is void based on act violation that occurred more than one year earlier limitations period does not apply to defenses church brown,june,tac same but see moreno park,tac.
styne asserts that stevens has actually sought affirmative relief by asking,in effect,for a declaration that the contract is void and unenforceable.but the cases belie such an argument one who raises the defense that a contract is illegal and unenforceable necessarily asks for a determination to that effect.if the result the defendant seeks is simply that he or she owes no obligations under an agreement alleged by the plaintiff,the matter must be deemed a defense to which the statute of limitations does not apply.
styne notes that the talent agencies act limits actions and proceedings,subd.c and contains no exception for defensive use,though the legislature must have understood that artists would routinely commence proceedings before the commissioner seeking to avoid their contractual commitments by claiming violations of the act.but the act phrase actions and proceedings which parallels the universal statute of limitations reference to actions see,code civ,et must be construed in the same fashion,as referring to claims for affirmative relief.nothing in the language of section,subdivision c suggests that,in contrast with other statutory limitations periods,it was intended to bar a mere defense to a claim for relief initiated by another.
we therefore conclude that the statute of limitations set forth in section,subdivision c does not bar steven assertion of her contract defense based on styne alleged violation of the talent agencies act 
labor commissioner jurisdiction.
the talent agencies act specifies that i n cases of controversy arising under this chapter,the parties involved shall refer the matters in dispute to the labor commissioner,who shall hear and determine the same,subject to an appeal to the superior court where the same shall be heard de novo,subd.a,italics added.the commissioner has the authority to hear and determine various disputes,including the validity of artists contracts and the liability of the parties thereunder.buchwald superior court,supra,d.the reference of disputes involving the a ct to the commissioner is mandatory.id.at.disputes must be heard by the commissioner,and all remedies before the commissioner must be exhausted before the parties can proceed to the superior court.ibid.reo broadcasting consultants martin th,d reo broadcasting,italics in original see also garson div.of labor law enforcement cal d,collier wallis,astor cal d,humes margil ventures,d.humes buchwald superior court,supra,at.
when the talent agencies act is invoked in the course of a contract dispute,the commissioner has exclusive jurisdiction to determine his jurisdiction over the matter,including whether the contract involved the services of a talent agency.buchwald katz cal d,see buchwald superior court,supra,d.having so determined,the commissioner may declare the contract void and unenforceable as involving the services of an unlicensed person in violation of the act.see,park,supra,th,d reo broadcasting,supra,th,d humes,supra,d.it follows that a claim to this effect must first be submitted to the commissioner,and that forum must be exhausted,before the matter can be determined by the superior court.
our conclusion that section,by its terms,gives the commissioner exclusive original jurisdiction over controversies arising under the talent agencies act comports with,and applies,the general doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.with limited exceptions,the cases state that where an adequate administrative remedy is provided by statute,resort to that forum is a jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial consideration of the claim,johnson city of loma linda cal th,d,sierra club san joaquin local agency formation com.cal th,d,abelleira district court of appeal cal d,abelleira.
stevens nonetheless argues that referral to the commissioner is not necessary when the artist alleges a violation of the talent agencies act solely as a defense in a court action for breach of contract.she urges that section,subdivision a requires referral only of cases ibid.arising under the act.in stevens view,a case is limited to a claim for affirmative relief that itself relies on the act.she insists that when an artist merely asserts the act as a defense to the agent civil suit for breach of contract,and seeks no affirmative relief for herself,no case arises for referral to the commissioner.
stevens misreads the statute.section,subdivision a specifies that in all cases of controversy arising under the talent agencies act,the parties involved shall refer the matters in dispute to the commissioner.italics added.this broad language plainly requires all such controvers ies and dispute s between parties to be examined in the first instance by the commissioner,not merely those controvers ies and dispute s where the part y invoking the act seeks affirmative relief 
a number of courts,and the commissioner himself,have assumed that even when the talent agency act is first invoked by the defendant in a civil action,and whether or not the defendant seeks affirmative relief,the matter is properly submitted to the commissioner in the first instance.see,park,supra,th,d breach of contract suit,defense of illegality based on act no indication defendant sought affirmative relief reo broadcasting,supra,th,d same defendant originally sought,but ultimately waived,claim for damages humes,supra,d.same defendant sought return of commissions paid ivy howard,tac same no claim for affirmative relief.this assumption conforms to the general principle that the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies applies to defenses,south coast regional com.gordon cal d,landowner who failed to seek coastal zone building permit can not raise vested rights defense in action for violation of coastal zone conservation act people west publishing cal d,corporation sued by state for use taxes due can not raise issues after failing to pursue available administrative remedies aguirre lee th,d landlord sued for rent control violation can not raise exemption defense after failing to seek exemption permit from rent control board coit ranch,supra,d.farmer sued by director of agriculture for cantaloupe advertising assessment can not,for the first time,raise ultra vires defense available in administrative proceedings before the director.
stevens insists waisbren,supra,th,d supports a rule that defenses under the talent agencies act need not be submitted to the commissioner.in waisbren,artists defending a court suit for breach of contract won summary judgment on grounds the agreement was void as involving unlicensed talent agency services.the court of appeal affirmed,rejecting the plaintiff claims that the mere occasional or incidental procurement of employment for artists requires no license,and that the sanction of voiding the contract was too harsh.id.at,d.as stevens points out,there is no indication the matter was first submitted to the commissioner,and the court of appeal did not suggest this barred a judicial determination of the merits.
however,it appears neither party raised the exhaustion issue in waisbren,and the court of appeal did not address it.an opinion is not authority for a point not raised,considered,or resolved therein,people castellanos cal th,fn,d,san diego gas superior court cal th,d.
stevens asserts that requiring an artist to submit a mere defense to the commissioner contravenes the talent agencies act remedial purposes.to avoid this result,she urges,we should hold the court and the commissioner have concurrent original jurisdiction in such cases.but the plain meaning of section,subdivision a,and the relevant case law,negate any inference that courts share original jurisdiction with the commissioner in controversies arising under the act.on the contrary,the commissioner original jurisdiction of such matters is exclusive.
moreover,stevens policy arguments are unpersuasive.no reason appears why the talent agencies act purposes to protect artists from unscrupulous and unqualified talent agencies warrant a conclusion that an artist claims for affirmative relief under the act must first be submitted to the commissioner,but that an artist defenses under the act need not be.in both instances,referral to the commissioner serves the intended purpose of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative reduce the burden on courts while benefiting from the expertise of an agency particularly familiar and experienced in the area.see,rojo kliger cal d,department of fair housing and employment westlake community hosp.superior court cal d,internal hospital board abelleira,supra,cal d,california employment commission.the commissioner expertise in applying the act is particularly significant in cases where,as here,the essence of the parties dispute is whether services performed were by a talent agency for an artist.
stevens implies that requiring submission to the commissioner of defenses under the talent agencies act will somehow inhibit artists from availing themselves of its protective purposes.we disagree.when an issue under the act arises in this fashion,the appropriate course is simply to stay the superior court proceedings and file a petition to determine controversy before the commissioner.see,tit,reo broadcasting,supra,th,d see also park,supra,th,d.accordingly,we agree with styne and the court of appeal that when the defendant in a court suit raises a colorable defense based on a violation of the act,the merits of that issue can not be considered by the court until it has first been submitted to,and examined by,the commissioner 
disposition.
the question remains how these principles should apply to the facts,and in the procedural posture,of this case.as indicated above,controversies colorably arising under the talent agencies act are within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the commissioner,subd.a,even when issues are first raised as an affirmative defense to a court suit.on the other hand,as we have also explained,the act statute of limitations,subd.c does not restrict the time within such a defense may be raised and presented to the commissioner.
moreover,we are persuaded that although the parties to a controversy arising under the act must first exhaust proceedings before the commissioner,one who first asserts the act as a defense against a lawsuit does not waive the defense insofar as he or she failed to pursue and exhaust the administrative remedy before the suit was filed.the act simply requires that controvers ies thereunder be refer red by the parties to the commissioner when they aris e,subd.a it does not require any party to invoke the commissioner jurisdiction before such a controversy has arisen.the filing of a lawsuit may be the defendant first inkling that such a controversy exists.
we therefore conclude that if this case presents any colorable basis for exercise of the commissioner jurisdiction,the matter still may,and must,be submitted for his examination accordingly,we address whether such a colorable basis arises here.
we confront an appeal from a new trial order,granted by the superior court on grounds the jury should have been instructed on the requirements of the talent agencies act.the trial court thus necessarily determined that,contrary to its prior assumption under which the trial was conducted,stevens has at least a colorable defense based on matters governed by the act.
the court implicit conclusion is entitled to great deference on review of its order granting a new trial,jiminez sears,roebuck cal d.indeed,s o long as a reasonable or even fairly debatable justification under the law is shown for the order granting the new trial,it will not be set aside.citations.ibid.
that standard is met here.without dispute,styne seeks a share of revenues derived from an arrangement involving entertainer stevens and hsn,a cable television network,which required stevens to make use of her professional talents,personality,image,and status.on appeal,styne admits he initiated contact with hsn on stevens behalf,promoted her skills and image,and tried to interest the network in using her as a celebrity spokesperson for products sold on the air.styne further acknowledges he set up and attended a key meeting between stevens and hsn that led to the final deal between those parties,and that he maintained contact with hsn executives to protect stevens s interests hsn as the deal developed.finally,styne appears to concede that any promise stevens made to provide him a share of the revenues from this venture was as compensation for his help in securing the deal 
styne argues about the meaning of these facts under the talent agencies act.he has contended throughout that there is no issue of unlicensed talent agency services because,in the final analysis,his efforts did not produce,and his monetary claims do not arise from,the procurement of employment for an artist,subd.a.in this regard,he stresses that stevens was not directly paid for her television appearances,but went on camera to promote her own company products in styne view,therefore,the most he did was to broker a business deal for the sale of cosmetics by stevens company to hsn,and he seeks only his promised share of profits derived from that commercial venture.
but this is precisely the sort of issue that the talent agencies act commits in the first instance to the exclusive jurisdiction and special competence of the commissioner.here,the commissioner was never given the opportunity to resolve stevens colorable claim that the contract alleged by styne is void under the act.he should now be allowed to do so.
accordingly,the court of appeal judgment,overturning the new trial order and reinstating the trial verdict,must be reversed.we will instruct the court of appeal to reinstate the new trial order,and to direct the superior court not to go forward immediately with a retrial,but instead to stay its proceedings pending first submission to the commissioner of the issues arising under the talent agencies act 
conclusion 
the judgment of the court of appeal is reversed.the court of appeal is instructed to reinstate the order for new trial,and to direct the superior court to stay further new trial proceedings in that court pending submission to the commissioner of issues arising under the talent agencies act,as set forth in this opinion.
all further unlabeled statutory references are to the labor code unless otherwise indicated.
according to the motion,styne deposition indicated he discussed several concepts with hsn,including her appearance as a celebrity spokesperson for products marketed by hsn,projects involving the production and marketing of records of stevens s performances and stevens performing in concert,and finally the idea of stevens appearances on the network to promote her own line of products,to be purchased and resold by hsn.
we note that efforts to secure recording contracts for artists shall not of themselves subject a person or corporation to regulation and licensing under the talent agencies act,subd.a.
the commissioner does not have a system of publication in which precedential decisions under the talent agencies act are printed.this does not obviate the rule of deference to administrative construction,though it may weaken an inference that the legislature was aware of a prior administrative interpretation when adopting or amending statutory language.see robinson fair employment housing com.cal th,fn,d.moreover,the rules of court do not bar our citation of such unpublished decisions to demonstrate administrative construction.see cal.rules of court,rule a prohibiting citation of unpublished court of appeal and appellate department decisions.
as an additional basis for arguing that her defense is not barred,stevens cites the maxim that the illegality of a contract need not be pled,can be asserted at any time,and is never waived.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.however,this principle appears concerned not with limitations periods as such,but with the procedural issue whether a defense is waived by failure to assert it in a timely fashion once a lawsuit has commenced.moreover,it is not clear that all issues of illegality in a contract fall within the unwaivable category.ibid.because we conclude on other grounds that section,subdivision c does not bar stevens defense,we do not reach steven additional argument.on the other hand,styne suggests that stevens claim of illegality is among those defenses which must be correctly and timely pled.styne notes that stevens never pled this defense in her answer and raised it only by her motion for summary judgment.but again,section,subdivision c,a statute of limitations,is not concerned with the general procedures or time limits for asserting defenses to a lawsuit.styne did not argue,in his opposition to the new trial order here under review,that stevens had waived her d
