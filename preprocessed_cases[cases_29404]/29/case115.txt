opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on appeal from an order entered on may,partially dismissing this action pursuant to.b for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted see doug grant,greate bay casino,d.the appellants had instituted this action in the superior court of new jersey but the appellees removed it to the district court.consequently,when the district court entered the rule b order it remanded appellants claims that it did not address to the superior court.in view of the procedural posture of this case,we treat the allegations of fact in the complaint as true,and consider them in a light most favorable to the appellants 
the individual appellants are blackjack players who have frequented atlantic city casinos operated by the casino appellees.of the individual appellants,all but six have developed skills for playing blackjack enabling them to reduce or eliminate the normal odds in favor of the casinos and,indeed,to turn the odds in their favor.the corporate appellants are associated with appellant doug grant,a new jersey corporation,whose predecessor corporations operated schools and mock casinos established by the appellant,doug grant,a renowned.doug grant,also provided the training for several cooperative player groups,including many of the appellants here,who pooled their financial resources and agreed to share their blackjack winnings.
a.the play of blackjack,and and other countermeasures 
the gravamen of appellants complaint is that the casinos have taken countermeasures that the appellants regard as illegal to eliminate the advantage that a skilled may have over them in playing blackjack,the one casino game in which a player skill may increase his chance of winning to the point of eliminating the winning odds in favor of the house.see campione adamar of.use intellect and memory to identify the time during the course of play when a player odds of winning are better or worse.thus,the individual appellants allege that the casinos have impaired their ability to win money from the casinos in blackjack.the corporate appellants allege that their schools and mock casinos were forced to close as a result of the casinos countermeasures against,and because of bomb threats,destruction of property,theft of student lists,stalking and other intimidation tactics.
it is necessary for us partially to describe how blackjack games are run in order to put appellants allegations in context.blackjack is played with decks containing cards of four suits hearts,diamonds,clubs and spades with each suit containing cards ace,king,queen,jack.see.before a blackjack game starts,the dealer receives one or more,usually between six to eight,card decks from a casino supervisor and inspects them in the presence of the floorperson.see id.a.after inspecting the cards,the dealer takes them to a blackjack table and spreads them out in a fan,face upward,for visual inspection by the first player or players to arrive at the table.see id.b.after these players are afforded an opportunity to inspect the cards,the dealer turns them face downward on the table,mixes them thoroughly,and shuffles them until they are randomly intermixed.the dealer then places the cards into a stack.see id.c id.a.after the shuffling is completed,the dealer asks the player seated at a particular position at the table,as defined by the regulations of the casino control commission ccc,the casino regulatory agency,id.e,to cut the deck.see id.b.the player cuts the deck by placing a plastic cutting card in the stack at least ten cards from either end.see id.c.
once the player has inserted the cutting card,the dealer takes all the cards in front of the cutting card and places them at the back of the stack.see id.d.the dealer then takes the entire stack of shuffled cards and cuts and aligns it along the side of the dealing shoe which has a mark on its side enabling the dealer to insert the cutting card so that it is in a position at least approximately of the way from the back of the stack.see id.d id.d.the dealer then inserts the stack of cards into the dealing shoe for commencement of play.see id.d.the cards behind the cutting card will not be used during the game.
once play has commenced the dealer deals the cards to the players in a series of hands until the dealer reaches the cutting card.when the dealer reaches the cutting card,the dealer repeats the shuffling process and cutting procedures described above.see id.h.
a blackjack player object is to reach as close as possible to a total card value of without exceeding that value.a player exceeding loses regardless of the dealer subsequently acquired hand.persons in the casino industry and have come to recognize that,in a player endeavor to reach a value as close as possible to,certain cards are more favorable to the player and certain cards are more favorable to the dealer.in particular,appellants assert that the ace,king,queen,jack and ten are favorable to a player,but the,and are favorable to the dealer and thus to the house.the,and are said to be neutral.at any point during the play,the cards in a shoe can contain more cards or more cards.when there are more cards,a player chances of winning are increased but when there are more cards,the dealer chances of winning are increased.whether and when a shoe will turn out to be is purely random.
attempt to count cards to determine whether and when a shoe is.they then vary their bets,betting high when the shoe is and low when the shoe is to increase their chances of having a winning round of play.bets are placed before each individual round of blackjack,usually within established minimum and maximum limits for the table.according to the appellants,successful contains several basic elements including the assignment of a point value to each card,maintaining a running total of those points during play,betting strategies,playing strategies,money management,a sufficient bankroll,and the intangible ability to consistently apply these interrelated strategies under casino conditions.see app.at.
for maximum advantage,need to be able to view,through the rounds of play,as many of the cards in the shoe as possible.the greater number of cards they are able to view,the easier it is for them to determine to whom the remaining cards in the shoe are favorable.for this reason,prefer that the dealer place the cutting card toward the end of the shoe,leaving a small number of cards behind the and increasing the overall number of cards in play.also prefer to have the entire shoe of cards played.if the dealer reshuffles prior to reaching the cutting card,then the opportunity to bet high on a shoe with a remainder of mostly cards is impaired.
the casinos,on the other hand,prefer to decrease the opportunity to bet high on a shoe.therefore,it is in their interest to decrease the chances of determining whether a shoe is by playing with fewer cards in the shoe,placing the cutting card as far from the back of the stack as permitted by the ccc regulations.it is also in the casinos interest to reshuffle prior to reaching the cutting card when the remaining cards in a shoe are.these practices,however,come at a cost to the casino as the more often the dealer goes through the meticulous shuffling process,the shorter the actual time of play and thus the smaller the casino profits.
appellants allege that the casinos maintain teams video and computer surveillance equipment to identify and inform the dealers of their participation in a blackjack game so that the dealers can take countermeasures against them.appellants challenge these practices,claiming they violate the new jersey cheating games section in the casino control act.west,which provides that it shall be unlawful 
knowingly to deal,conduct,carry on,operate or expose for play any game or games played with cards which have in any manner been marked or tampered with,or placed in a condition,or operated in a manner,the result of which tends to deceive the public or tends to alter the normal random selection of characteristics or the normal chance of the game which could determine or alter the result of the game.
the appellants make several specific allegations to support their claims.see doug grant,d at.first,they argue that the identifying process fundamentally is flawed because it tends unfairly to misidentify as.they claim casinos define as any patron who increases a bet during a count,or any patron who knows or is related to someone who has increased a bet during a count.according to appellants,a player the casino identifies as a is branded for life and never is able to play a fair game of blackjack without being subjected to countermeasures.the casinos allegedly share information about suspected through defendant griffin investigations and other similar agencies.these agencies allegedly keep dossiers containing the pictures of suspected which casino employees then use to spot for the purpose of knowing when to implement countermeasures.
second,appellants claim that the casinos utilize what they term the preferential shuffle and which,as codified by the ccc regulations,generally is known as the.a dealer reshuffling prior to reaching the marker.a casino will shuffle in this manner when its team determines that the shoe is at a table where it suspects are playing.appellants allege that the provides an extra advantage to the casino,nearly double its normal chance of winning,and thus providing the casinos with a windfall of millions of dollars.id.at.they also claim that a casino can abusively to the disadvantage of players who are not by even when its employees do not suspect that there is a playing at a table.id.
appellants recount specific instances in which individual appellants allegedly were subjected to by specific casinos throughout the past ten years.on some,but not all,of these occasions,the player reported the to the ccc the new jersey department of gaming enforcement dge official at every casino.according to appellants,the casinos never have responded to such complaints by admitting to counting cards and shuffling during a count.id.
appellants also allege that because they have been identified as,they are limited to one wager at a time,are refused cards,have bets pushed back,and are forced to bet below the original posted limit at the table.id.moreover,they allege that shills associated with the casinos sometimes occupy all seats at tables at which they wish to play.id.the appellants allege that they have been treated in these adverse ways even though players who are not are not so treated.
appellants also claim that the casinos have denied them hospitality comps,such as meals,after identifying them as.id.finally,appellants allege that they have been threatened,assaulted and stalked because of their suspected status.id.they allege that they have been threatened in person while at the casinos by both known and unknown casino employees and that they have been threatened and sent pornographic materials over the internet by unnamed john does allegedly connected to the casinos.id.
b.the casino control act and ccc regulations 
the new jersey casino control act.et.west the act,gives the ccc comprehensive authority to define and regulate the rules and conduct of play for blackjack and other authorized casino games.see campione,at uston resorts int l hotel.it also grants the ccc exclusive jurisdiction over the interpretation and enforcement of regulations governing all matters delegated to it or within the scope of its powers under the provisions of the act.b see also id.that jurisdiction delegates to the ccc the power to promulgate regulations regarding the rules of casino games,including blackjack,id.f,gambling related advertising,id.o,and the enforcement of gaming regulations,including the investigation,adjudication,and punishment of regulatory violations,id.b,f,g id.id.
the regulations governing blackjack are exhaustive and set forth in great detail the rules for the conduct of the game.see et.indeed,the new jersey supreme court has stated that,i t is no exaggeration to state that the commission regulation of blackjack is more extensive than the entire administrative regulation of many industries.uston,at.the ccc is very aware of the controversy.as the parties have recognized,the ccc carefully has considered and addressed in its regulatory capacity the effect can have on the game and the ways in which casinos should be permitted to respond to professional.see,reg.may,reg.june,reg,reg.june,reg,reg,reg,reg,reg.the ccc regulations authorize the casinos to use certain countermeasures to prevent from overcoming the statistical advantage that is necessary to ensure the casinos financial viability.
the ccc adopted many of its regulations authorizing countermeasures in response to the new jersey supreme court ruling in uston,a case considering whether casinos have the authority to exclude from their premises.the court determined that casinos were not authorized to exclude,reasoning that the act gave the ccc exclusive and plenary authority to set the rules and methods of play of casino games and that the ccc had not authorized the exclusion of as a countermeasure the court suggested,however,that if the ccc wanted to approve measures to neutralize the threat,it might be able to exclude,provided that the regulation did not violate constitutional or statutory limits.uston,at.
yet,prior to uston,the ccc had codified a practice which the casinos used as a countermeasure even though the ccc did not promulgate it for that purpose.this regulation provides that a casino licensee,in its discretion may permit a player to wager on more than one box at a blackjack table.the ccc had been allowing the use of this practice against through its approval of casinos internal control pursuant to.the rule specifically grants casinos discretion to allow players usually to bet on more than one box,and presumably,in light of the discretionary language,allows them to preclude from betting on more than one box.
after uston,the ccc held a series of hearings on the issue of and decided to enact regulations authorizing the casinos to use certain measures to neutralize the potential negative effect could have on their financial viability.see campione,at.the new regulations,which the new jersey supreme court urged the ccc to consider in lieu of allowing the casinos to exclude,balanced the statutory goals of casino viability and fair odds to all players.see.e.the ccc intended the regulations to ensure both the fairness and integrity of casino gambling and the right of the casinos to have the rules drawn so as to allow some reasonable profit.uston,at see also reg.june,reg.june.
several of these countermeasures involved the manner by which casinos could shuffle the blackjack cards.the first approved shuffling method is known as the bart carter shuffle,a shuffling procedure in which approximately one deck of cards is shuffled after being dealt,segregated into separate stacks and each stack is inserted into premarked locations within the remaining decks contained in the dealing shoe.see also reg.june,reg.the ccc also approved the,which we have described above,to allow the casinos to shuffle after any round of play.to implement this approval,the ccc amended the existing shuffle regulation by adding language regarding the casinos authority to shuffle after each round of play 
a immediately prior to commencement of play,after any round of play as may be determined by the casino licensee and after each shoe of cards is dealt,the dealer shall shuffle the cards so that they are randomly intermixed.
h a reshuffle of the cards in the shoe shall take place after the cutting card is reached in the shoe except that 
the casino licensee may determine after each round of play that the cards should be reshuffled 
when the bart carter shuffle is utilized a reshuffle shall take place after the cards in the discard rack exceed approximately one deck in number.
see reg.june,reg.
the ccc also has approved the use of a device known as the continuous shuffling shoe.in place of the dealing and shuffling requirements set forth in and,a casino licensee may utilize a dealing shoe or other device designed to reshuffle the cards automatically,provided that the ccc or its authorized designatee has approved such shoe or device and the procedures for dealing and shuffling the cards through the use of this device.see see also reg.june,reg.
the shuffling regulations,particularly the most commonly used,have enabled the casinos to lessen the ability to determine whether cards remaining in the shoe are.as we already have noted,when the cards are reshuffled continuously or prior to the dealer reaching the in the shoe,lose their potential advantage over the casinos because they no longer can increase their bets,secure in the knowledge that their chance of receiving cards has been increased.
the ccc also authorized one countermeasure after the uston increase in the number of decks casinos are allowed to use in blackjack play.see.this change helped the casinos combat by increasing the number of cards would need to track to determine whether a shoe was.plainly,the more cards in the shoe,the more difficult a player task is to keep track of the cards.
after the ccc authorized these initial countermeasures,in it approved another regulation which provides that 
a casino licensee may at any time change the permissible minimum or maximum wager at a table game,without notifying the commission of such change,upon posting a sign at the gaming table advising patrons of the new permissible minimum or maximum wager and announcing the change to patrons who are at the table.
c see also reg.june,reg,reg,reg.this regulation gives the casinos the authority to lower the betting limit whenever it identifies a so that the will not be able to bet high when the shoe becomes.then,in,the ccc made a further addition to its regulations which,as further amended in,provides 
b a casino licensee may offer 
different maximum wagers at one gaming table for each permissible wager in an authorized game and 
different maximum wagers at different gaming tables for each permissible wager in an authorized game.
c a casino licensee shall provide notice of the minimum and maximum wagers in effect at each gaming table,and any changes thereto,in accordance with.
d notwithstanding c above,a casino licensee may,in its discretion,permit a player to wager below the established minimum wager or above the established maximum wager at a gaming table.
e any wager accepted by a dealer which is in excess of the established maximum permitted wager at that gaming table shall be paid or lost in its entirety in accordance with the rules of the game,notwithstanding that the wager exceeded the current table maximum or was lower than the current table maximum.
b to e see reg,reg.this regulation clarified that the casinos could limit specifically the wagers of only those patrons identified as,while permitting to continue betting at higher limits.
the new jersey courts seem not to doubt the legality of the countermeasures.in particular,the trial court in campione recognized that the practice of shuffling at will,the central concern in this case identified by the district court,is authorized by ccc regulation,see,and affects all patrons,even those not counting cards,at a blackjack table.see campione adamar of,law div,rev on other grounds,mod.and aff.further,on appeal in campione,the new jersey superior court,appellate division,found that the ccc authorizes the disparate treatment of.at.the court noted that the ccc has approved the countermeasures allowing for betting limits and permitting casinos to vary the number of boxes in which particular players can wager.id.at.finally,the new jersey supreme court in campione,while not expressly upholding the countermeasures the ccc has allowed,implicitly made it clear the ccc lawfully may permit such countermeasures.at.
ii.jurisdiction 
the complaint in this action alleged violations of the united states constitution,and the federal rico statute,as well as causes of action under the new jersey rico statute,constitution and common law.thus,the district court had jurisdiction under,and.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
iii.standard of review 
our review of a district court order of dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,is plenary and we apply the same test as the district court.see maio aetna,cir.thus,a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b may be granted only if,accepting all allegations in the complaint as true,and viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff,plaintiff is not entitled to relief.id.at.however,while our standard of review requires us to accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint,we need not accept as true unsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences.city of pittsburgh west penn power,cir quoting schuylkill energy,pennsylvania power light,cir.c ourts have an obligation in matters before them to view the complaint as a whole and to base rulings not upon the presence of mere words but,rather,upon the presence of a factual situation which is or is not justiciable.we do draw on the allegations of the complaint,but in a realistic,rather than a slavish,manner.id.at.
iv.discussion 
rico claims 
appellants first count alleges claims for racketeering under federal rico,c,new jersey rico.c west,and the rico provisions of the act.c west.as appellees point out,the predicate acts of alleged racketeering on which appellants base their rico claims consist almost exclusively of the use of countermeasures or alleged violations of other ccc regulations.in order to make out a rico claim,appellants first must show that the casinos committed the predicate criminal acts enumerated by rico.see.appellants claim that the casinos committed the following predicate acts when the count was,using computer and video technology to assist in counting cards and identifying,denying comps to appellants,using shills,limiting plaintiffs to one hand of blackjack at a time,lowering betting limits,and failing to disclose the use and nature of the disputed countermeasures.see br.doug grant,d at.based on the premise that these uses of authorized countermeasures and other alleged regulatory violations are criminal acts,appellants complaint alleges that the casinos operation of blackjack violates criminal statutes regarding unlawful debt collection,transmission of gambling information,operation of illegal gambling business,and interstate commerce for an unlawful activity.
the district court believed that the primary purported predicate act on which appellants relied is the shuffling of cards when the count is favorable to the players the complaint alleges that use of the countermeasure constitutes a predicate act of racketeering because it violates the criminal casino cheating statute.the trial court in campione rejected this precise claim.campione,at labeling of the shuffling at will as cheating is specious.moreover,despite appellants protestations,the regulation itself makes clear that a casino at its discretion may shuffle at the conclusion of any round of play 
a immediately prior to commencement of play,after any round of play as may be determined by the casino licensee and after each shoe of cards is dealt,the dealer shall shuffle the cards so that they are randomly intermixed.
h a reshuffle of the cards in the shoe shall take place after the cutting card is reached in the shoe as provided in except that 
the casino licensee may determine after each round of play that the cards shall be reshuffled.
appellants attempt at length to skew the plain meaning of this regulation and the relevant regulatory history leading to its adoption to convince us that the ccc has authorized only a random,not a reshuffle that occurs only during player favorable counts.see br.at.appellants restrictive interpretation of the regulation,however,runs contrary to its express language.
the regulatory history makes clear that the ccc is fully aware of and allows the practice of when there is a count as a countermeasure against.when the ccc published the proposed regulation to allow the casinos to,it noted that the casinos might shuffle when the count is favorable and that this practice might affect the odds of the game 
the economic impact of this proposed amendment would vary depending on when in fact the cards were shuffled.for example,if the cards were always shuffled after the first round of play regardless of the point count,then the casino advantage against the basic strategy player and average player would probably remain the same with the advantage enjoyed by the card counter being decreased.if the cards,however,were only shuffled in positive point count situations and not in negative point count situations,the casino advantage against all types of players would increase.
appellants appear to take issue with the propriety of the regulation.but even assuming that in this action we should entertain a challenge to the regulation,we perceive nothing illegal in it in any event,even if the regulation is an improper exercise of the ccc authority,a conclusion that we reject,a casino following it before its invalidation hardly could be subject to rico liability for that conduct.in our view,a casino does not commit a predicate rico act when it engages in conduct the ccc expressly permits.
we are disturbed that appellants have couched their arguments in dramatic hyperbole obfuscating the real issues.indeed,we are satisfied that the appellants have mischaracterized the facts.for instance,appellants characterize the use of the as secretly removing cards from a blackjack game in progress.see br.at.but the reshuffle is hardly secret as the dealer does it openly in the view of the players.moreover,a dealer reshuffling does not remove cards from the deck.rather,the reshuffle simply places the cards in a different random order for the next hands.
appellants further allege that the is a rico criminal predicate act because it has a tendency to alter the normal random chance of the game.see br.at.what appellants fail to realize,however,is that the normal random chance of the game is defined pursuant to the statutory rules and ccc regulations.as the ccc has explained 
t he normal chance and random character of any casino game is necessarily defined and determined by the rules governing the conduct of the game.since the commission has the statutory authority to initially establish the rules of the game,e and,and primary jurisdiction to resolve any issues concerning interpretation of the act and the rules promulgated thereunder,it is absurd to allege that practices approved by the commission as being consistent with its rules constitute cheating under section of the act.
reg.while appellants may wish to have the ccc rethink the scope of the regulation,we are satisfied that after being stripped of its conclusory legal dressing,there is no allegation in the complaint regarding reshuffling sufficient to support a rico claim against the casino defendants.
appellants other alleged predicate acts are similarly insufficient to support a rico claim.the alleged violations of criminal statutes regarding unlawful debt collection,transmission of gambling information,interference with commerce by threats or violence,interstate commerce for unlawful activity,and operating an illegal gambling business,all derive from the allegations regarding the use of authorized countermeasures and other alleged but in fact nonexistent violations of the ccc regulations.any debts allegedly unlawfully collected are those lost by players during blackjack games played in accordance with the ccc regulations.any illegal gambling business or unlawful activity in interstate commerce is simply the play of blackjack as authorized by the ccc.similarly,the casinos do not engage in unlawful activity or operating an illegal gambling business by not offering appellants or anyone else comps,which are nothing more than free gifts from the casinos.while appellants claim that the casinos are obliged to offer comps,in our view if they fail to do so they are not committing criminal acts in any way impacting on the integrity of the blackjack game.if appellants want to bring a judicial action to recover the value of comps,surely their forum should be a new jersey state court,at least in some instances the small claims part.plainly,the casinos activities of which appellants complain do not constitute crimes and therefore are not predicate rico acts.
furthermore,appellants,although mentioning the use of shills in their complaint,have not made any allegations that the casinos violate the statutory prohibition of the use of shills,persons who induce potential patrons to enter a casino or induce them to play any game.see.l west.certainly the casinos have not used shills to encourage appellants to play blackjack in their premises.
in their brief,appellants further assert that the ccc stated in an administrative proceeding that it would be deceptive for casinos actively to solicit a player to count cards in its casino without letting the player know that countermeasures will be used against those suspected of counting cards.see br.at.appellants,however,fail to cite the full text of the ccc statement,which concluded 
t he commission does not believe that any of the exhibits submitted by the commenters come even close to supporting an allegation of active solicitation of card counter play by a casino licensee.
reg.thus,appellants reference to the ccc statement adds nothing to their allegation that the casinos use of shills constitutes a rico act.
appellants also assert that it is deceptive for the casinos to fail to provide players with a complete text of the rules governing the play of blackjack.this allegation also fails to support a claim for relief.as we set forth above,the rules and regulations governing blackjack are numerous and thus they do not lend themselves to inclusion in a short manual.further,the sample casino brochure in the appendix explaining blackjack on its face is not deceptive.see app.at.while it does not purport to set forth all of the blackjack rules,it does give the information needed by a player to play the game.
the appellants also allege that it is impermissible for the casinos to require one player wager to be less than that of other players at the same table.see br.at citing.g west.as we mentioned,however,the ccc has adopted a regulation that specifically allows casinos to set different wager limits,even among players at the same table,if a player is suspected of card counting.see b,d.as a result,the casinos can not be said to have violated the act in a manner to support a rico cause of action.while appellants may wish to challenge the propriety of the regulation,they have not stated a rico cause of action against the casinos whose actions are in compliance with the law and the ccc regulations.
appellants next argue that the casinos failure to obtain prior approval for the countermeasures they implement constitutes a predicate act.see br.at.yet appellants also recognize that the ccc has determined that the casinos do not need prior approval to implement the measures.see id.at.while the appellants note that that ruling is being challenged on appeal,it will be time enough for a federal court to consider the rico implications if and when the ccc determines that the casinos practices are illegal and the casinos do not comply prospectively with the ccc determinations.
the only alleged predicate acts that are not based on ccc regulations are the allegations of assaults,threats,and and via the internet.appellants allege that one appellant was knocked off his seat on one occasion,that some appellants were followed around casinos,and that one appellant was grabbed by the arm while being escorted out of a casino.however,these minor altercations can not be regarded as conduct egregious enough to serve as predicate acts sufficient to support what appellants apparently believe is massive litigation,in which,before trebling,they are seeking at least in damages.see doug grant,d at.nor do the appellants claims of receiving anonymous pornographic,offensive and threatening messages over the internet from john doe defendants constitute predicate acts attributable to the appellees,as appellants put forth no basis for concluding or even alleging that anyone associated with the casinos sent the messages.accordingly,we will affirm the order of the district court dismissing the state and federal rico causes of action.
for the reasons we have set forth,w
