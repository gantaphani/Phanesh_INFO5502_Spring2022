the primary question presented is whether an unauthorized work that makes fair use of its source material may itself be protected by copyright.
we hold,for substantially the reasons stated by the united states district court for the southern district of new york thomas griesa,judge,that,if the creator of an unauthorized work stays within the bounds of fair use and adds sufficient originality,she may claim protection under the copyright act,for her original contributions.we also reject defendant challenges to the district court jury charge.the district court january,judgment is therefore affirmed.
background 
plaintiff appellee jaime keeling is the author of point break live pbl,a parody stage adaptation of the hollywood action movie point break,starring keanu reeves and patrick swayze.in the film,reeves plays a rookie fbi agent who goes undercover to infiltrate a gang of surfers led by swayze character.the pbl parody parallels the characters and plot elements from point break and relies almost exclusively on selected dialogue from the screenplay.to this raw material,keeling added jokes,props,exaggerated staging,and humorous theatrical devices to transform the dramatic plot and dialogue of the film into an irreverent,interactive theatrical experience.for example,in keeling pbl parody,point break scene in which reeves character must pick up bricks,blindfolded,in a swimming pool takes place,instead,in a kiddie pool.massive waves in the film are replaced by squirt guns in the pbl parody.a central conceit of the pbl parody is that the keanu reeves character is selected at random from the audience and reads his lines from cue cards,thereby lampooning reeves reputedly stilted performance in the movie.keeling added to the effect that the audience was watching the making of the film by creating a set of characters in the pbl parody,including a director,cinematographer,and production assistants.keeling possesses no copyright or license with regard to the point break motion picture.
defendant appellant eve hars,proceeding pro se on appeal,owns production company new rock theater productions,llc new rock.in,keeling executed a production agreement with hars,pursuant to which new rock would stage a production run of pbl from october through december.during that time period,hars conferred with an entertainment attorney and the holder of the copyright to the hollywood screenplay for point break,and eventually hars came to believe that keeling did not lawfully own any rights to the pbl parody play.accordingly,after its initial run,hars sought to renegotiate the terms of the contract upon its expiration and,in effect,continue to produce pbl without further payment to keeling.keeling refused renegotiation,threatened suit,and registered a copyright in pbl,without first obtaining permission from the copyright holders of the original point break.keeling asserted copyright in pbl became effective on january.hars and new rock continued to stage performances of pbl for four years thereafter without payment to or authorization from keeling.
in december,keeling brought suit against hars,new rock,and new rock investor ethan garber,asserting claims for copyright infringement,breach of contract,and tortious interference with contract.in the district court proceedings,all parties were represented by counsel.after the district court denied defendants motion to dismiss,see keeling new rock theater,llc,civ.tpg,wl,at may,defendants asserted counterclaims seeking,inter alia,a declaration that keeling pbl copyright registration was invalid.upon completion of discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing primarily that pbl,an unauthorized derivative work,was not entitled to copyright protection as a matter of law.the district court denied defendants successive motions for summary judgment,ruling that a parody that makes fair use of another copyrighted work may contain sufficient originality to merit copyright protection itself.see keeling new rock theater,llc,civ.tpg,wl,keeling new rock theater,llc,civ.tpg,wl.the district court also rejected defendants argument that a script heavily reliant on theatrical devices,as was pbl,could not lawfully constitute original creative expression deserving of copyright protection.wl at.finally,the court found that multiple outstanding issues of material fact remained including whether pbl constituted a fair use parody of point break and whether pbl contained sufficient originality to merit copyright protection.id.
in december,the case proceeded to a trial by jury.at the close of the evidence,the parties delivered summations focused largely on whether pbl was a parody at all,and if so,whether that parody constituted fair use.record on appeal roa,keeling new rock theater,llc,civ.tpg gwg,dkt,at.the district court then charged the jury,beginning with the first question the jury would be asked to answer whether pbl was a fair use by way of a parody of the original movie point break.id.at.the district court declined to enumerate each of the four statutory factors pertaining to fair use,opting instead to attempt to put a little more content on the discussion,which the district court believed that the list of factors alone lacked.id.at.the pertinent instructions on fair use were as follows 
now,the person who creates the derivative work has a copyright in that derivative work.now,if the derivative work is simply somehow really a copy of the original then it may be somehow called a derivative work but it infringes on the owner of the original.but if it is what we call fair use then it is not an infringement on the original and it is a new work and it has its own copyright and the author or the creator of the new work owns that copyright as well as owns the new work 
the plaintiff contends that pbl is a fair use of sections of the script of the original movie.the plaintiff contends that this is fair use as a parody and a parody,certainly,can be fair use 
a proper parody is something which generally ridicules to some extent,makes fun of,makes light of the original.suppose the original is the very serious drama of some kind and if someone comes along and makes a parody,it is generally turning it into something different,humorous,ridiculous.and if that is done it is fair use to use even substantial amounts of the script of the original movie.it is fair use to even use the high points or the high point as long as it is not simply conveying again the original movie.if it takes the script of the original movie and creates something which uses that script to ridicule to make fun of,to make light of to produce humor instead of the original seriousness,then that is a legitimate parody.
now,the amount of script taken from the original can not completely go beyond the needs of the parody.in other words,if the parody is for,if we could imagine,a third it is not legitimate to copy the other two thirds and put them out again.but if the amount of script used is reasonably related to the production of the humor,the ridicule,the lightheartedness and so forth that is a legitimate parody and that is fair use.
now,it is sometimes said that the judge in instructing a jury on fair use is supposed to refer to a list of factors.the list of factors is a list of factors without much content or meaning.and what i am trying do with you now is to refer to the necessary factors but i hope put a little more content on the discussion.and really that all i have to say to define fair use by way of parody.
id.at.no party objected to the district court jury instructions.id.at.
the jury returned a verdict in keeling favor in the amount of,finding a that keeling use of material from the film point break was fair use in the way of a parody,b that keeling was the sole owner of the copyright to pbl,and c that defendants infringed keeling copyright.id.at.the district court entered judgment on january.
defendant hars,now proceeding pro se,appealed.she challenges the district court denial of her pretrial motion for summary judgment as well as the subsequent jury verdict in favor of keeling 
discussion 
though not a model of clarity hars appellate briefing primarily raises three issues first,whether pbl,as an unauthorized fair use,is entitled to copyright protection capable of supporting keeling claim of infringement by a third party second,whether keeling contributions to the work consisting of individually elements could be sufficient to support a copyright in pbl and third,whether the district court jury instructions were erroneous.the first two issues relate to the same question whether keeling work was copyrightable.we consider each issue in turn.
challenges to copyright law 
in general,where summary judgment is denied and the movant subsequently loses after a full trial on the merits,the denial of summary judgment may not be appealed.schaefer state ins.fund,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,this rule does not apply where,as here,the district court purported error was purely one of law.id.in such circumstances,we review de novo the legal issues underlying the district court denial of summary judgment.id.
the copyright act principally offers copyright protection for original works of authorship.a.pursuant to the statute terms,authors may control the copying of their original works and also retain the exclusive rights to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.thus,unauthorized derivative works are typically afforded no copyright protection because they unlawfully infringe the exclusive rights of the original author.see also id.p rotection for a work employing preexisting material in which copyright subsists does not extend to any part of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully.
the doctrine of fair use constitutes a critical and longstanding limitation on the exclusive rights of the original copyright owner though only made a part of statutory copyright law in,f rom the infancy of copyright protection,some opportunity for fair use of copyrighted materials has been thought necessary to fulfill copyright very purpose,to promote the progress of science and useful arts.campbell acuff rose music,d alterations omitted quoting,art.i,cl.under section of the copyright act,certain unauthorized fair use of a copyrighted work,for purposes such as criticism,comment,news reporting,teaching,scholarship and research,is not an infringement of copyright and thus is lawful.while parody is not expressly mentioned in the statute,the supreme court has instructed that parody,like other comment or criticism,may claim fair use under.campbell,at.
in this case,hars does not dispute the jury factual determination that keeling use of point break material in her creation of pbl was fair use in the way of a parody.roa,dkt,at.indeed,she repeatedly disclaims any fair use challenge,explaining that she is not concerned about whether keeling script is a fair use of point break because it is completely irrelevant to any and all of hars arguments.def.reply br.see also id.at t he issue of whether keeling script qualifies as fair use was astutely and consciously avoided by hars in her brief.hars is not asking the court to spend even one second of valuable time trying to determine whether keeling script qualifies for fair use.
instead,hars presents two legal arguments for why copyright protection should not extend to keeling work,both of which were first raised in defendants summary judgment briefing and denied by the district court.
copyright protection fair use 
first,hars argues that an unauthorized derivative work like pbl categorically may not receive independent copyright protection,regardless of whether it makes fair use of its source material this argument flows from the admittedly unusual posture in which this case arises.typically,fair use is invoked as a defense against a claim of copyright infringement brought by the rightsholder.here,however,keeling invoked the principle to establish an affirmative claim against defendants for unauthorized use of her pbl parody.hars concedes that keeling could use the fair use doctrine as a shield against a claim of copyright infringement,but argues that she may not use the doctrine as a sword to vest a work with independent copyright protection against infringement.def.br.
this argument is inconsistent with the operative statutory language.the copyright act provides that derivative works are entitled to independent copyright protection,separate from any copyright in the preexisting material.b.though copyright protection expressly may extend to derivative works employing preexisting material in which copyright subsists,the statute cautions that protection does not extend to any part of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully.a emphases supplied.if,however,a work employs preexisting copyrighted material lawfully as in the case of a fair use nothing in the statute prohibits the extension of the independent copyright protection promised by section id.b.a close reading of the statute therefore makes plain that an unauthorized but lawful fair use employing preexisting copyrighted material may itself merit copyright protection.it is not the invocation of fair use that provides the work copyright protection,and perhaps thinking so has created some confusion on the part of the defendant.it is the originality of the derivative work that makes it protectable,and fair use serves only to render lawful the derivative work,such that it may acquire as would other lawful derivative works such protection.
resisting this statutory principle,hars argues that the case law does not permit the extension of independent copyright protection to an unauthorized fair use,and contends that the only court to have dealt with the issue found that congress did not contemplate such a result.def.br.quoting sobhani.media,d.but in fact,congress did expressly contemplate the extension of copyright protection where,as here,a work constituted fair use.the relevant legislative report stated that,
u nder this provision,section a of the copyright act,copyright could be obtained as long as the use of the preexisting work was not unlawful,even though the consent of the copyright owner had not been obtained.for instance,the unauthorized reproduction of a work might be lawful under the doctrine of fair use or an applicable foreign law,and if so the work incorporating it could be copyrighted.
at emphases supplied.this language addresses precisely the issue raised in the instant appeal.although the consent of the copyright owner here,the rightsholder in the hollywood screenplay point break had not been obtained by keeling,her resulting parody pbl was lawful under the doctrine of fair use,and accordingly,it could be copyrighted.
we have previously confirmed that,because d erivative works are explicitly included in the subject matter of copyright as defined by the copyright act,the mere fact that a litigant unauthorized creations are derivative works is in itself,of course,no bar to copyrightability.durham,tomy,cir citing.and this statutory interpretation is consistent with the animating policy behind the fair use doctrine to fulfill copyright core purpose of promoting development in arts and science.see campbell,at.without any possibility of copyright protection against infringement for her original parody,playwrights like keeling might be dissuaded from creating at all.
accordingly,we agree with the district court holding that,when a derivative work unauthorized use of preexisting material is fair use and the work contains sufficient originality,its author may claim copyright protection under for her original creative contributions.see keeling,wl,at.
copyright protection selection,coordination,and arrangement of un protectable elements 
hars second legal argument fares no better.hars contends that if an author original contributions to a derivative work consist solely of individual elements,those contributions can not support a copyright.specifically,she claims that keeling original contributions to the pbl script are insufficient to warrant copyright protection because they consist entirely of stage directions and theatrical devices.see b providing that copyright protection does not extend to any idea,procedure,process,system,method of operation,concept,principle,or discovery,regardless of
