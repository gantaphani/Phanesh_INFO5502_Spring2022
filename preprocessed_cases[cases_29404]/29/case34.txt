this case raises several novel issues,including an important question of the meaning of the statutory damages provision of the copyright act,c,and the question of whether.e is ever available to alter or amend a default judgment entered under.b.
the heirs of a puerto rican popular songwriter sued two recording companies for copyright infringement of some of the songwriter songs.one of those companies defaulted and ended up with a million judgment against it.the judgment was based on statutory damages for sixteen albums that each included at least one of two infringed songs.plaintiffs also sought actual damages and defendant profits for a seventeenth album,but the court at the default judgment hearing found that such damages and profits were not proven.the defaulting defendant,sonolux records sonolux,a company,then moved promptly under rule c to set aside the entry of default and the default judgment.sonolux also moved under rule e,in the alternative,to amend the judgment to reduce the damages award.
sonolux attempt to remove the default and the entry at all of a default judgment was heard and rejected by a second judge.however,that judge granted sonolux rule e motion to amend the amount of the judgment,and the statutory damages award for the copyright infringement was reduced from to on the ground that the larger amount was based on an incorrect reading of the statutory damages provision of the copyright act,c.
after careful review,we affirm the denial of defendant motion to set aside the entry of default and the default judgment and affirm the grant of defendant rule e motion.the entry of a default judgment stands,but we vacate the amount of that judgment and remand the amount determination to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
plaintiffs are the children of guillermo,a noted composer,who inherited the copyright in of his songs.they filed a copyright infringement suit against sonolux in district court in september.sonolux had published recordings of two of the copyrighted songs,desde que te marchaste and no me digan cobarde,on sixteen different albums by different artists.sonolux had also used portions of desde que te marchaste in a seventeenth album called sentimientos.plaintiffs had duly registered their copyright claims to both songs.
sonolux failed to answer the complaint and a default was entered against it on january,under.a.plaintiffs applied to the court for entry of a default judgment under.b and sent sonolux notice of the damages hearing.sonolux still did not appear to defend.plaintiffs elected to seek statutory damages,rather than to try to prove actual damages and defendant profits,for sixteen albums.they also sought actual damages for another album called sentimientos.because sonolux had not appeared,plaintiffs had no opportunity to obtain discovery and thus were disadvantaged in proving actual damages and defendant profits as to each of the songs.
plaintiffs represented to the district court that they were entitled to the measure of statutory damages multiplied by the number of albums containing the infringed songs.they did not provide citations,nor did they alert the judge that the statute had been interpreted differently by courts.
on february,the court found that plaintiffs had failed to prove actual damages or profits as to the album sentimientos,but,simply accepting plaintiffs statement of the correct measure of damages,awarded plaintiffs million in statutory damages for the infringement of the two songs on the other albums.the court concluded that an award of for each of works,or a total of represents a fair measure of damages in this case.this was based on the willful nature of defendant conduct as well as the potential to discourage future infringement.
after the default judgment issued on february,sonolux appeared for the first time on march,and filed a motion under rule c to set aside the default entry and default judgment,or,in the alternative,to amend the default judgment under rule e.in the rule e motion,sonolux argued,inter alia,that the district court had erred in its damages calculation by applying the statutory damages rate to the number of infringing albums sixteen rather than to the number of infringed songs two.the district court,now a different judge,who was the first to address the question of the correct measure of damages,denied sonolux motion to set aside the default and default judgment but found the damages calculation to be a manifest error of law and granted the rule e motion.the court reduced the damages award to using the method of statutory damages calculation advanced by sonolux.this appeal and ensued.plaintiffs appeal the grant of sonolux rule e motion to amend the default judgment and the finding that they did not prove defendant profits on the album sentimientos.sonolux the denial of its motion to set aside the default and default judgment.
sonolux challenges the denial of its motion to set aside both the entry of default and the entry of a default judgment.rule c sets up different standards for setting aside an entry of default under rule a and setting aside a default judgment under rule b.we take up each in turn.
a.the entry of default 
an entry of the default itself may be set aside f or good cause.c,a term that is liberally construed.united states in united states currency,cir.among the factors that a court may consider are whether the default was willful and whether removal of the default would prejudice the plaintiff.id.there is no precise formula for the good cause analysis.kps,designs by fmc,cir.our review of the denial of the motion to set aside the entry of default is for abuse of discretion we review any factual findings underlying the denial for clear error.id.
there was no abuse of discretion here.having been properly served with a summons and a complaint,and later given notice of the damages hearing,defendant intentionally did not appear in the case until more than a year after the filing of the complaint and ten days after the default judgment was entered.defendant was well aware of the ongoing litigation,and the district court was justified in discounting defendant excuse.sonolux claimed that it never intended to default,reasonably understood that the claims of the plaintiffs were being properly dealt with,and was mistaken in apparently failing to note the significance of the plaintiffs filing of a duplicative lawsuit.the court rejected those claims,noting that plaintiffs suit was a major dollar copyright infringement action that could not have been easily ignored,that defendant was given proper notice of the suit,and that it was defendant obligation to learn the specifics of the suit and keep informed of its progress.we believe that the district court did not abuse its discretion in reaching these conclusions.defendant decision not to appear also may have prejudiced plaintiffs case by preventing them from obtaining sufficient evidence on which to prove actual damages and defendant profits.
b.the default judgment 
a default judgment may be set aside in accordance with rule b.c.although sonolux motion did not reference rule b,we understand its argument that the default judgment should be vacated entirely to rely essentially on the theory that its actions in failing to appear constituted excusable neglect.that argument fits within the requirements of rule b,which allows a court to relieve a party from a judgment on account of mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.the reason for a defendant delay is a critical factor in the excusable neglect inquiry.see,at.
our review of the district court denial of defendant rule b motion is also for abuse of discretion,id.at,and we find none here.for the same reasons that defendant can not satisfy the more liberal good cause standard for setting aside the entry of default,defendant can not show that its actions constituted excusable neglect.defendant has offered no adequate justification for its failure to respond in this case its decision not to respond appears to have been willful.as a result,the decision that defendant does not deserve a new opportunity to litigate the entry of a default judgment is sound.
plaintiffs challenge the grant of defendant rule e motion to amend a default judgment by reducing the damages amount.that challenge raises an issue that has not been addressed by either party or previously by this court.
availability of rule e 
it is by no means clear that a rule e motion is even a valid mechanism for altering or amending a default judgment.it is arguable that rule c provides the exclusive means for challenging a default judgment through rule b,which allows relief from a judgment or order.rule c states for good cause shown the court may set aside an entry of default and,if a judgment by default has been entered,may likewise set it aside in accordance with rule b.rule b,in turn,specifies six grounds for relief.rule e provides that a ny motion to amend a judgment shall be filed no later than days after entry of the judgment.rule e does not specifically mention default judgments.
in a different context,that of whether a defaulted party had filed a timely notice of appeal one court of appeals has held that rule c and,by reference,rule b provides the exclusive method for attacking a default judgment.gulf coast fans,midwest,cir.in that same context,two other courts of appeals have held that a rule e motion is indeed a valid mechanism for attacking a default judgment,in addition to the mechanism of rule b.united states v.one dodge pickup,cir anilina fabrique de colorants aakash chems.dyestuffs,cir.this court has noted the issue,but declined to decide it,in a case where the defaulted party motion specifically invoked rule c and did not invoke rule e,cir.
our case presents this issue in a different context.we again decline to resolve it.plaintiffs have not argued to either this court or the district court that sonolux could not have used a rule e motion at all,and neither party has briefed the issue.as a result,we treat any argument that a rule e motion is not a valid mechanism for amending a default judgment as waived.
one might ask why,if there is doubt about the availability of rule e to amend a default judgment,we do not just treat the motion to alter the judgment as a rule b motion and review it as such.after all,rule,which deals with default judgments,expressly says that such judgments are subject to rule b motions.
the answer is that such a solution is foreclosed by circuit precedent in these circumstances.sonolux motion to alter the amount of the damages was premised on the argument that a legal error was made as to the statutory measure of damages.rule e permits an attack on a judgment on the ground that the judgment is based on a manifest error of law.bogosian woloohojian realty,cir wright,miller kane,federal practice and procedure,west.one might,and some courts do,think that rule b reference to mistake as a grounds for relief from judgment includes this type of error of law.but this circuit decided that question the other way in.silk sandoval,cir aldrich,a construction of mistake under rule b that is as extensive as that available under rule e undermines the interest in speedy disposition and finality that rule e reflects that may be why sonolux framed its motion for relief based on error of law as a rule e motion.
we have cited silk favorably since,ahmed rosenblatt,cir,and it has never been overruled.as one commentator has noted,this circuit interpretation seems to fit better the structure of the rules and makes more sense of the relation between rule e and rule b.federal practice procedure.however,silk did not account for the special problem of default judgments.
if silk is correct about the limited scope of rule b and so are the courts that say that rule e may not be used to challenge a default judgment,then a party in default would never be able,by motion in the district court,to bring to that court attention an error of law in the default judgment.of course,the party could appeal the judgment to the court of appeals,but it would be odd and inefficient to preclude the party in default from first seeking relief based on error of law from the district court.judge friendly,taking a different view from judge aldrich,made that point in schildhaus moe,cir t here is indeed good sense in permitting the trial court to correct its own error and,if it refuses,in allowing a timely appeal from the refusal no good purpose is served by requiring the parties to appeal to a higher court,often requiring remand for further trial proceedings,when the trial court is equally able to correct its decision in the light of new authority on application made within the time permitted for appeal.that particular problem would be exacerbated if,as happened here,the defaulted party also failed to appear at the hearing on the amount of the default judgment.in such circumstances,the defaulting party could never get a hearing before the district court on its argument that the amount embodied in the default judgment is based on an error of law.that might make sense as a strong medicine to encourage parties not to default,but it also could lead to uncorrected basic legal errors.given this problem,and given that plaintiffs have waived the issue of the availability of the rule e motion to defendant in these circumstances,we proceed to plaintiffs argument that the motion was granted in error.
plaintiffs do argue that sonolux should not have been allowed to use the rule to make its particular argument about the meaning of work in.they point us to the usual rule that parties can not use rule e motions to raise new arguments that could have been made before judgment issued or to undo their own procedural failures.bogosian,at aybar,cir.rule e motions are aimed at re consideration,not initial consideration,at internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added jorge rivera surillo,falconer glass,cir.in this way,rule e motions allow a court to correct its own errors and avoid unnecessary appellate procedures.
but,assuming arguendo rule e can be used for amendment of default judgments,it is an open question whether the usual rule for rule e they can not be used to raise new where one party is challenging a default judgment and it has not previously appeared the topic is unaddressed in the case law.the rule may not always make sense when applied to a default judgment,and does not make sense here,once rule e is deemed to apply due to plaintiffs waiver.
standards of review 
we review for abuse of discretion the district court decision to grant the rule e motion.williams poulos,cir desenne jamestown boat yard,cir.our abuse of discretion review is superimposed on the standard of review the rule e judge exercises over the original judgment.that question is complicated here by the fact that the underlying judgment was a default judgment,not the normal stuff of rule e review.
rule e itself does not state the grounds on which relief under the rule may be granted,and the district courts have considerable discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny a motion to alter or amend under rule e.edward bohlin banning,cir robinson watts detective agency,cir wright,miller kane,federal practice and procedure,west.that discretion requires a balancing of the need for finality of judgments with the need to render a just decision.edward bohlin,at.under the broad umbrella of the district court discretionary power,the case law has developed a list of circumstances in which relief is available under rule e that attempts to balance the need for finality with the need for justice.one of those circumstances,articulated in cases where the underlying judgment is not a default judgment,is where the moving party clearly establishes a manifest error of law.world,cir.in granting sonolux rule e motion,the second district judge determined that there was a manifest error of law in the first judge interpretation of c.it would be a closer question here if the judgment had entered not by default,but after the parties joined on the issue,whether the error was,indeed manifest.
in the common case,the judgment being reviewed by the rule e judge has been entered after both parties have argued the points at issue.here,by contrast,the judgment being reviewed was a default judgment and the rule e judge was the first to address the legal issues around the question of the statutory measure of damages.sonolux had never appeared in the case.finality plays a slightly different role in the default context.this is reflected by the lenient standard for removing entries of default and the only slightly more restrictive standard for setting aside default judgments.we have found no cases discussing the application of the rule e standard to a default judgment.assuming rule e is available at all,we think it is clear that the default context is something that a district court can consider in exercising its discretion in order to strike the appropriate balance between finality and justice.
interpretation of c 
section c states that a copyright owner can elect to recover statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action,with respect to any one work,for which any one infringer is liable individually.the second district judge read that language as meaning that an infringer statutory damages liability is based on the number of infringed works rather than on the number of infringing works.
in support of that interpretation,the district judge pointed to the applicable report of the committee on the judiciary,at reprinted in,which states a single infringer of a single work is liable for a single amount no matter how many acts of infringement are involved in the action and regardless of whether the acts were separate,isolated,or occurred in a related series.
the court also found support for its interpretation in the case law,citing to walt disney powell,both the text of the copyright act and its legislative history make clear that statutory damages are to be calculated according to the number of works infringed,not the number of infringements,and to a case from this circuit,gamma audio video,cir.noting that there were only two infringed works,desde que te marchaste and no me digan cobarde,the second district judge applied the statutory damages rate set by the first district judge per work to those two works,resulting in a reduction in the damages award from to.
the legal issue of whether under c statutory damages are to be applied to each infringed work or to each infringement on a given work is reviewed de novo a leading commentator,nimmer,sets up the question as follows 
if in a single action,the same copyrighted work is held to have been infringed by several different infringing acts all committed by the same infringer,does this give rise to only one set of statutory damages,with a statutory minimum of currently raised to for all such infringing acts,or is the plaintiff entitled to recover at least a minimum of,and a separate set of statutory damages,for each such infringing act the current act states that only a single minimum,and a single set of statutory damages,will be applicable for all infringements involved in the action,with respect to any one work,for which any one infringer is liable individually 
nimmer nimmer,nimmer on copyright e a.
section c states that a copyright owner may elect an award of statutory damages for all infringements involved in the action,with respect to any one work,for which any one infringer is liable individually another leading treatise in the field,goldstein,states without reservation that under c statutory damages are available for each infringed work song,not each act of infringement album.goldstein,copyright,a ed.supp.a n infringer will be liable for a single statutory award whether it makes one copy of a copyrighted work or one thousand.nimmer comes to a tentative conclusion that this reading of the statute,propounded by goldstein,is correct.nimmer on copyright,e c.
the most natural reading of the plain language of the statute is that the song is the work.there is,though,arguably some ambiguity.the legislative history dissolves any argument of ambiguity 
although an award of minimum statutory damages may be multiplied if separate works and separately liable infringers are involved in the suit,a single award is to be made for all infringements involved in the action.a single infringer of a single work is liable for a single amount between and,no matter how many acts of infringement are involved in the action and regardless of whether the acts were separate,isolated,or occurred in a related series.
where the infringements of one work were committed by a single infringer acting individually,a single award of statutory damages would be made.
at,reprinted in,emphasis added.
the one circuit court to have addressed the issue squarely,the circuit,has adopted the reading advanced by the second district judge.walt disney,at vacating a damages award that mistakenly focus ed on the number of infringements rather than on the number of works infringed.although the precise issue was not presented to the fifth circuit,that court addressed it at length in mason montgomery data,cir,as part of its interpretation of,which references.the fifth circuit explained 
under c,the total number of awards of statutory damages that a plaintiff may recover in any given action depends on the number of works that are infringed and the number of individually liable infringers,regardless of the number of infringements of those works.so if a plaintiff proves that one defendant committed five separate infringements of one copyrighted work,that plaintiff is entitled to only one award of statutory damages and if a plaintiff proves that two different defendants each committed five separate infringements of five different works,the plaintiff is entitled to ten awards,not fifty.
id.at emphasis in original.the eleventh circuit declined to reach the issue in mca television feltner,cir,because it was not raised before the district court,but the court went on to quote at length from the above section of mason and also cited walt disney id.at.in columbia pictures television krypton broadcasting,cir,rev on other grounds,feltner columbia pictures,d,the ninth circuit,citing mason,stated that when statutory damages are assessed against one defendant each work infringed may form the basis of only one award,regardless of the number of separate infringements of that work.id.at affirming a statutory damages award based on works infringed,where neither party challenged this interpretation of c.language from the second circuit opinion in twin peaks,publ ns inter l,cir,is also consistent with the walt disney and mason interpretations,id.at the current statute shifts the unit of damages inquiry from number of infringements to number of works infringed,but in twin peaks there was only one infringing work so the issue was not directly presented.
our own opinion in gamma audio,while not directly on point,implicitly adopts the reading adopted or cited approvingly by those other circuits.in gamma audio,we held that the plaintiff was entitled to four awards of statutory damages because the defendant had infringed four separate works.at.we observed that the present copyright act marked a change in the scheme for awarding statutory damages from the copyright act of,and we cited twin peaks for the proposition that the current act shifts the unit of damages inquiry from number of infringements to number of works.id.at quoting twin peaks,at.we also quoted the house report concerning c and cited walt disney.
nimmer cautions that the prevailing reading may lead to adverse,by plaintiffs to separate their various claims of infringements as to any one work into separate lawsuits so as to obtain more than one statutory damages award for each infringed work.nimmer on copyright,e.nimmer does acknowledge that the doctrine of res judicata may act as a curb on this problem,id.at e b c,but he suggests that the law of res judicata might not bar separate suits based on different infringing transactions and that the risk of such warrants reconsideration of the widely accepted reading of the section,id.at e c.
there are a number of ways in which the problem of could occur under the prevailing reading and a number of possible solutions to that problem,the discussions of which are beyond the scope of this opinion and both interpretations of the statute have an accompanying
