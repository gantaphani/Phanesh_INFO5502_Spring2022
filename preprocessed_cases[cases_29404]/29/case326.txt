since,palladium has been in the business of producing original master sound recordings of popular hits,commonly referred to as karaoke music tracks.the tracks are designed to allow consumers of the music to sing along with their favorite songs.palladium hires musicians and technicians to record music made popular by other artists.the recordings it produces sound similar to the original artist and are produced in the style of that artist.palladium does not,however,incorporate any previously recorded sound components in its production and it does not attempt to change in any way the original musical compositions it uses.the final product is an original sound recording of a previously copyrighted musical composition.for example,palladium sound recording number is entitled baby one more time and is palladium version of the song by the same title made popular by britney spears.
it is undisputed that from palladium produced its sound recordings without licensing from the copyright owners of the underlying musical works it sold its sound recordings to manufacturers,like defendant tpc,who then combined the sound recordings with synchronized lyrics to produce private label karaoke products such as compact disc plus graphics,digital video discs dvd,video compact discs vcd and cassette tapes.these products were then sold to consumers in the retail market.
in,palladium decided to launch its first retail product line by offering its sound recordings directly to consumers through digital downloads on the internet.it also began the process of filing for copyrights for all of the recordings it had previously produced since,along with copyrights for all of its new recordings.palladium filed bulk registrations as unpublished collections to offset some of the expense of filing for several thousand works.it has continuously filed such registrations since receiving its first approved copyright certificate in.
after launching its first retail line on the internet in june,palladium asked all of its manufacturing customers like tpc to sign licensing contracts in an attempt to better define approved products and sales channels with regard to online digital markets.the proposed license would permit the continued incorporation of palladium sound recordings into traditional karaoke products,but would restrict the sale and use of its sound recordings over the internet.it would also prohibit any to third parties.although tpc refused to sign the proposed licensing agreement,palladium continued to sell its recordings to tpc.
in november,palladium discovered that defendant esm was delivering palladium sound recordings through esm online digital delivery services.employing embedded digital watermarks,palladium was able to determine that the files esm was distributing online were originally sold to tpc for its line of products.following this discovery,palladium brought this action against defendants esm and tpc alleging copyright infringement for marketing palladium sound recordings online without a license defendants moved for summary judgment claiming that palladium copyrights were invalid and unenforceable because palladium produced the sound recordings at issue without the authority of the copyright owners of the underlying musical compositions.following the district court grant of defendants motion for summary judgment and denial of their motion for attorney fees,palladium appeals and defendants cross appeal.only two issues are presented on appeal whether palladium owned valid copyrights for its sound recordings,enabling it to establish copyright infringement and whether the district court abused its discretion in denying an award of attorney fees to the defendants,pursuant to.

to prove ownership of a valid copyright,palladium presented evidence of twenty certificates of registration obtained for the musical sound recordings it has produced each certificate identifies palladium as the author and lists no preexisting works or materials.nonetheless,defendants argued that palladium did not own valid and enforceable copyrights in the sound recordings.to overcome the presumption of validity created by the certificates,defendants presented evidence that the sound recordings palladium had registered are based upon preexisting musical compositions and that palladium had failed to obtain either compulsory or consensual licenses from the copyright owners of those preexisting musical compositions.
the district court agreed with defendants that palladium sound recordings are derivative works of the underlying musical compositions and that such derivative works are only protected by the copyright act if there is lawful use of the preexisting material.the district court found that palladium had failed to obtain a license from the copyright owners of the underlying musical compositions as provided in,and thus was not lawfully using the preexisting material.as a result,the district court concluded palladium copyrights were therefore invalid and unenforceable.
palladium contends that the district court erred by concluding its sound recordings are derivative works of the underlying musical compositions.palladium argues it was not required to obtain the compulsory or consensual licenses for derivative works described in the copyright act because its sound recordings are original recordings,and not derivative of the underlying musical compositions.
