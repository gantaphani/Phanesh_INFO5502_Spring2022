respondent marvel entertainment corporate predecessor agreed to purchase petitioner stephen kimble patent for a toy in exchange for a lump sum plus a royalty on future sales.the agreement set no end date for royalties.as the patent neared the end of its statutory term,marvel discovered brulotte thys,in which this court held that a patentee can not continue to receive royalties for sales made after his patent expires.marvel then sought a declaratory judgment in federal district court confirming that it could stop paying kimble royalties.the district court granted relief,and the ninth circuit affirmed.kimble now asks this court to overrule brulotte.
held stare decisis requires this court to adhere to brulotte.
a a patent typically expires years from its application date.a.at that point,the unrestricted right to make or use the article passes to the public.see sears,roebuck stiffel.this court has carefully guarded the significance of that expiration date,declining to enforce laws and contracts that restrict free public access to formerly patented,as well as unpatentable,inventions.see,at scott paper marcalus.
brulotte applied that principle to a patent licensing agreement that provided for the payment of royalties accruing after the patent expiration,at.the court held that the royalty provision was unlawful per se,at,because it continued the patent monopoly beyond the patent period,at,and,in so doing,conflicted with patent law policy of establishing a public domain,ibid.
the brulotte rule may prevent some parties from entering into deals they desire,but parties can often find ways to achieve similar outcomes.for example,brulotte leaves parties free to defer payments for use of a patent,tie royalties to rights,or make business arrangements.contending that such alternatives are not enough,kimble asks this court to abandon brulotte rule in favor of a approach based on antitrust law rule of reason.
b the doctrine of stare decisis provides that today court should stand by yesterday decisions.application of that doctrine,though not an inexorable command,is the preferred course.payne tennessee.overruling a case always requires special justification over and above the belief that the precedent was wrongly decided.halliburton erica john fund.where,as here,the precedent interprets a statute,stare decisis carries enhanced force,since critics are free to take their objections to congress.see,patterson mclean credit union.congress,moreover,has spurned multiple opportunities to reverse brulotte,see watson united states,and has even rebuffed bills that would have replaced brulotte per se rule with the standard kimble urges.in addition,brulotte implicates property and contract law,two contexts in which considerations favoring stare decisis are at their acme,payne,at,because parties are especially likely to rely on such precedents when ordering their affairs.
given those good reasons for adhering to stare decisis in this case,this court would need a very strong justification for overruling brulotte.but traditional justifications for abandoning stare decisis do not help kimble here.first,brulotte doctrinal underpinnings have not eroded over time.the patent statute at issue in brulotte is essentially unchanged.and the precedent on which the brulotte court primarily relied,like other decisions enforcing a patent date,remains good law.indeed,brulotte close relation to a whole web of precedents means that overruling it could threaten others.second,nothing about brulotte has proved unworkable.see patterson,at.to the contrary,the decision itself is simple to apply particularly as compared to kimble proposed alternative,which can produce high litigation costs and unpredictable results.
c neither of the justifications kimble offers gives cause to overrule brulotte.
kimble first argues the brulotte hinged on an economic error,an assumption that royalties are always anticompetitive.this court sees no error in kimble economic analysis.but even assuming kimble is right that brulotte relied on an economic misjudgment,congress is the right entity to fix it.the patent laws are not like the sherman act,which gives courts exceptional authority to shape the law and reconsider precedent based on better economic analysis.moreover,kimble argument is based not on evolving economic theory but rather on a claim that the brulotte court simply made the wrong call.that claim fails to clear stare decisis high bar.in any event,brulotte did not even turn on the notion that royalties harm competition.instead,the brulotte court simply applied the categorical principle that all benefits must end when the patent term expires.kimble real complaint may go to the merits of that principle as a policy matter.but congress,not this court,gets to make patent policy.
kimble also argues that brulotte suppresses technological innovation and harms the national economy by preventing parties from reaching agreements to commercialize patents.this court can not tell whether that is true.brulotte leaves parties free to enter alternative arrangements that may suffice to accomplish parties payment deferral and goals.and neither kimble nor his amici offer any empirical evidence connecting brulotte to decreased innovation.in any event,claims about a statutory precedent consequences for innovation are more appropriately addressed to congress.halliburton,at.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
in brulotte thys,this court held that a patent holder can not charge royalties for the use of his invention after its patent term has expired.the sole question presented here is whether we should overrule brulotte.adhering to principles of stare decisis,we decline to do so.critics of the brulotte rule must seek relief not from this court but from congress.
in,petitioner stephen kimble obtained a patent on a toy that allows children and adults to as a spider person by shooting webs really,pressurized foam string from the palm of the hand.patent,abstract filed may,respondent marvel entertainment,llc marvel makes and markets products featuring,among other characters.seeking to sell or license his patent,kimble met with the president of marvel corporate predecessor to discuss his idea for fun.soon afterward,but without remunerating kimble,that company began marketing the web blaster a toy that,like kimble patented invention,enables action heroes to mimic through the use of a polyester glove and a canister of foam.
kimble sued marvel in alleging,among other things,patent infringement.the parties ultimately settled that litigation.their agreement provided that marvel would purchase kimble patent in exchange for a lump sum of about a dollars and a royalty on marvel future sales of the web blaster and similar products.the parties set no end date for royalties,apparently contemplating that they would continue for as long as kids want to imitate by doing whatever a spider can.
and then marvel stumbled across brulotte,the case at the heart of this dispute.in negotiating the settlement,neither side was aware of brulotte.but marvel must have been pleased to learn of it.brulotte had read the patent laws to prevent a patentee from receiving royalties for sales made after his patent expiration.see,at.so the decision effect was to sunset the settlement royalty clause on making that discovery,marvel sought a declaratory judgment in federal district court confirming that the company could cease paying royalties come the end of kimble patent term.the court approved that relief,holding that brulotte made the royalty provision unenforceable after the expiration of the kimble patent.supp.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed,though making clear that it was none too happy about doing so.t he brulotte rule,the court complained,is counterintuitive and its rationale is arguably unconvincing.
we granted certiorari,to decide whether,as some courts and commentators have suggested,we should overrule brulotte for reasons of stare decisis,we demur.
patents endow their holders with certain superpowers,but only for a limited time.in crafting the patent laws,congress struck a balance between fostering innovation and ensuring public access to discoveries.while a patent lasts,the patentee possesses exclusive rights to the patented article rights he may sell or license for royalty payments if he so chooses.see a.but a patent typically expires years from the day the application for it was filed.see a.and when the patent expires,the patentee prerogatives expire too,and the right to make or use the article,free from all restriction,passes to the public.see sears,roebuck stiffel.
this court has carefully guarded that date,just as it has the patent laws limits in case after case,the court has construed those laws to preclude measures that restrict free access to formerly patented,as well as unpatentable,inventions.in one line of cases,we have struck down state statutes with that consequence.see,at bonito boats,thunder craft boats,compco lighting.by virtue of federal law,we reasoned,an article on which the patent has expired,like an unpatentable article,is in the public domain and may be made and sold by whoever chooses to do so.sears,at.in a related line of decisions,we have deemed unenforceable private contract provisions limiting free use of such inventions.in scott paper marcalus,for example,we determined that a manufacturer could not agree to refrain from challenging a patent validity.allowing even a single company to restrict its use of an expired or invalid patent,we explained,would deprive the consuming public of the advantage to be derived from free exploitation of the discovery,at.and to permit such a result,whether or not authorized by express contract,would impermissibly undermine the patent laws,at see also,edward katzinger chicago metallic,ruling that scott paper applies to licensees lear,adkins,refusing to enforce a contract requiring a licensee to pay royalties while contesting a patent validity.
brulotte was brewed in the same barrel.there,an inventor licensed his patented machine to farmers in exchange for royalties from hop crops harvested both before and after his patents expiration dates.the court by an vote held the agreement unenforceable unlawful per se to the extent it provided for the payment of royalties accru ing after the last of the patents incorporated into the machines had expired.at.to arrive at that conclusion,the court began with the statutory provision setting the length of a patent term.see,at quoting the version of.emphasizing that a patented invention become s public property once that term expires,the court then quoted from scott paper any attempt to limit a licensee use of the invention,whatever the legal device employed,runs counter to the policy and purpose of the patent laws.at quoting,at.in the brulotte court view,contracts to pay royalties for such use continue the patent monopoly beyond the patent period,even though only as to the licensee affected,at.and in so doing,those agreements conflict with patent law policy of establishing a public domain in which every person can make free use of a formerly patented product.ibid.
the brulotte rule,like others making contract provisions unenforceable,prevents some parties from entering into deals they desire.as compared to fees,royalty plans both draw out payments over time and tie those payments,in each month or year covered,to a product commercial success.and sometimes,for some parties,the longer the arrangement lasts,the better not just up to but beyond a patent term end.a more extended payment period,coupled as it presumably would be with a lower rate,may bring the price the patent holder seeks within the range of a licensee.anyone who has bought a product on installment can relate.see brief for memorial sloan kettering cancer center et as amici curiae.or such an extended term may better allocate the risks and rewards associated with commercializing inventions most notably,when years of development work stand between licensing a patent and bringing a product to market.see,milgrim bensen,milgrim on licensing.as to either goal,brulotte may pose an obstacle.
yet parties can often find ways around brulotte,enabling them to achieve those same ends.to start,brulotte allows a licensee to defer payments for use of a patent into the period all the decision bars are royalties for using an invention after it has moved into the public domain.see,at zenith radio hazeltine research.a licensee could agree,for example,to pay the licensor a sum equal to of sales during the patent term,but to amortize that amount over years.that arrangement would at least bring down early outlays,even if it would not do everything the parties might want to allocate risk over a long timeframe.and parties have still more options when a licensing agreement covers either multiple patents or additional rights.under brulotte,royalties may run until the patent covered in the parties agreement expires.see,at.too,royalties are allowable so long as tied to a right even when closely related to a patent.see,milgrim on licensing,at to.that means,for example,that a license involving both a patent and a trade secret can set a royalty during the patent period as compensation for the two combined and a royalty afterward as payment for the trade secret alone.finally and most broadly,brulotte poses no bar to business arrangements other than royalties all kinds of joint ventures,for example that enable parties to share the risks and rewards of commercializing an invention.
contending that such alternatives are not enough,kimble asks us to abandon brulotte in favor of flexible,analysis of royalty clauses under the rule of reason.brief for petitioners.used in antitrust law,the rule of reason requires courts to evaluate a practice effect on competition by taking into account a variety of factors,including specific information about the relevant business,its condition before and after the practice was imposed,and the practice history,nature,and effect.state oil khan.of primary importance in this context,kimble posits,is whether a patent holder has power in the relevant market and so might be able to curtail competition.see brief for petitioners illinois tool works independent ink,a patent does not necessarily confer market power resolving that issue,kimble notes,entails a economic inquiry into the definition of the market,barriers to entry,and the like.brief for petitioners quoting hovenkamp,janis,lemley,leslie,ip and antitrust e,supp.hovenkamp.
overruling precedent is never a small matter.stare decisis in english,the idea that today court should stand by yesterday decisions is a foundation stone of the rule of law.michigan bay mills indian commu nity,slip,at.application of that doctrine,although not an inexorable command,is the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded,predictable,and consistent development of legal principles,fosters reliance on judicial decisions,and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.payne tennessee.it also reduces incentives for challenging settled precedents,saving parties and courts the expense of endless relitigation.
respecting stare decisis means sticking to some wrong decisions.the doctrine rests on the idea,as justice brandeis famously wrote,that it is usually more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.burnet coronado oil gas,dissenting opinion.indeed,stare decisis has consequence only to the extent it sustains incorrect decisions correct judgments have no need for that principle to prop them up.accordingly,an argument that we got something wrong even a good argument to that effect can not by itself justify scrapping settled precedent.or otherwise said,it is not alone sufficient that we would decide a case differently now than we did then.to reverse course,we require as well what we have termed a special justification over and above the belief that the precedent was wrongly decided.halliburton erica john fund,slip,at.
what is more,stare decisis carries enhanced force when a decision,like brulotte,interprets a statute.then,unlike in a constitutional case,critics of our ruling can take their objections across the street,and congress can correct any mistake it sees.see,patterson mclean credit union.that is true,contrary to the dissent view,see post,at opinion of alito,regardless whether our decision focused only on statutory text or also relied,as brulotte did,on the policies and purposes animating the law.see,bilski kappos.indeed,we apply statutory stare decisis even when a decision has announced a judicially created doctrine designed to implement a federal statute.halliburton,at slip,at.all our interpretive decisions,in whatever way reasoned,effectively become part of the statutory scheme,subject just like the rest to congressional change.absent special justification,they are balls tossed into congress court,for acceptance or not as that branch elects.
and congress has spurned multiple opportunities to reverse brulotte openings as frequent and clear as this court ever sees.brulotte has governed licensing agreements for more than half a century.see watson united states,stating that long congressional acquiescence,there totaling just years,enhance s even the usual precedential force we accord to our interpretations of statutes internal quotation marks omitted.during that time,congress has repeatedly amended the patent laws,including the specific provision on which brulotte rested.see,uruguay round agreements act,a,stat.increasing the length of the patent term act of,stat.limiting claims.brulotte survived every such change.indeed,congress has rebuffed bills that would have replaced brulotte per se rule with the same analysis kimble now urges.see,tit.ii providing that no patent owner would be guilty of illegal extension of the patent right by reason of his or her licensing practices unless such practices violate the antitrust laws same.congress continual reworking of the patent laws but never of the brulotte rule further supports leaving the decision in place.
nor yet are we done,for the subject matter of brulotte adds to the case for adhering to precedent.brulotte lies at the intersection of two areas of law property patents and contracts licensing agreements.and we have often recognized that in just those contexts cases involving property and contract rights considerations favoring stare decisis are at their acme.payne,at khan,at.that is because parties are especially likely to rely on such precedents when ordering their affairs.to be sure,marvel and kimble disagree about whether brulotte has actually generated reliance.marvel says yes some parties,it claims,do not specify an end date for royalties in their licensing agreements,instead relying on brulotte as a default rule.brief for respondent see epstein,eckstrom licensing in foreign and domestic operations,and noting that it is not necessary to specify the term of the license when a decision like brulotte limits it by law overturning brulotte would thus upset expectations,most so when licenses for patents spring back to life.not true,says kimble unfair surprise is unlikely,because no meaningful number of such license agreements actually exist.reply brief.to be honest,we do not know nor,we suspect,do marvel and kimble.but even uncertainty on this score cuts in marvel direction.so long as we see a reasonable possibility that parties have structured their business transactions in light of brulotte,we have one more reason to let it stand.
as against this superpowered form of stare decisis,we would need a superspecial justification to warrant reversing brulotte.but the kinds of reasons we have most often held sufficient in the past do not help kimble here.if anything,they reinforce our unwillingness to do what he asks.
first,brulotte statutory and doctrinal underpinnings have not eroded over time.when we reverse our statutory interpretations,we most often point to subsequent legal developments either the growth of judicial doctrine or further action taken by congress that have removed the basis for a decision.patterson,at calling this the primary reason for overruling statutory precedent.but the core feature of the patent laws on which brulotte relied remains just the same section now,as then,draws a sharp line cutting off patent rights after a set number of years.and this court has continued to draw from that legislative choice a broad policy favoring unrestricted use of an invention after its patent expiration.see supra,at.scott paper the decision on which brulotte primarily relied remains good law.so too do this court other decisions refusing to enforce either state laws or private contracts constraining individuals free use of formerly patented or unpatentable discoveries.see supra,at.brulotte,then,is not the kind of doctrinal dinosaur or legal for which we sometimes depart from stare decisis.compare,alleyne united states,sotomayor,concurring slip,at.to the contrary,the decision close relation to a whole web of precedents means that reversing it could threaten others.if brulotte is outdated,then for example is scott paper too we would prefer not to unsettle stable law 
and second,nothing about brulotte has proved unworkable.see,patterson,at identifying unworkability as another traditional justification for overruling precedent.the decision is simplicity itself to apply.a court need only ask whether a licensing agreement provides royalties for use of a patent.if not,no problem if so,no dice.brulotte ease of use appears in still sharper relief when compared to kimble proposed alternative.recall that he wants courts to employ antitrust law rule of reason to identify and invalidate those royalty clauses with consequences.see supra,at.but whatever its merits may be for deciding antitrust claims,that elaborate inquiry produces notoriously high litigation costs and unpredictable results.arizona maricopa county medical.for that reason,trading in brulotte for the rule of reason would make the law less,not more,workable than it is now.once again,then,the case for sticking with precedent grows stronger even the most usual reasons for abandoning stare decisis cut the other way here.
lacking recourse to those traditional justifications for overruling a prior decision,kimble offers two different ones.he claims first that brulotte rests on a mistaken view of the competitive effects of royalties.he contends next that brulotte suppresses technological innovation and so harms the nation economy.the dissent offers versions of those same arguments.see post,at.we consider the two claims in turn,but our answers to both are much the same kimble reasoning may give congress cause to upset brulotte,but does not warrant this court doing so.
according to kimble,we should overrule brulotte because it hinged on an error about economics it assumed that royalty arrangements are invariably anticompetitive.brief for petitioners.that is not true,kimble notes indeed,such agreements more often increase than inhibit competition,both before and after the patent expires.see,at.as noted earlier,a longer payment period will typically go with a lower royalty rate.see supra,at.during the patent term,those reduced rates may lead to lower consumer prices,making the patented technology more competitive with alternatives too,the lesser rates may enable more companies to afford a license,fostering competition among the patent own users.see brief for petitioners.and after the patent expiration,kimble continues,further benefits follow absent high barriers to entry a material caveat,as even he would agree,see tr.of oral arg,the licensee continuing obligation to pay royalties encourages new companies to begin making the product,figuring that they can quickly attract customers by undercutting the licensee on price.see brief for petitioners.in light of those realities,kimble concludes,the brulotte per se rule makes little sense.at.
we do not join issue with kimble economics only with what follows from it.a broad scholarly consensus supports kimble view of the competitive effects of royalties,and we see no error in that shared analysis.see,at citing numerous treatises and articles critiquing brulotte.still,we must decide what that means for brulotte.kimble,of course,says it means the decision must go.positing that brulotte turned on the belief that royalties are always anticompetitive,he invokes decisions in which this court abandoned antitrust precedents premised on similarly shaky economic reasoning.see brief for petitioners citing,leegin creative leather products,psks,illinois tool works.but to agree with kimble conclusion,we must resolve two questions in his favor.first,even assuming kimble accurately characterizes brulotte basis,does the decision economic mistake suffice to overcome stare decisis second and more fundamentally,was brulotte actually founded,as kimble contends,on an analysis of competitive effects 
if brulotte were an antitrust rather than a patent case,we might answer both questions as kimble would like.this court has viewed stare decisis as having force in cases involving the sherman act.see,khan,at.congress,we have explained,intended that law reference to restraint of trade to have changing content,and authorized courts to oversee the term dynamic potential.business electronics sharp electronics.we have therefore felt relatively free to revise our legal analysis as economic understanding evolves and just as kimble notes to reverse antitrust precedents that misperceived a practice competitive consequences.see leegin,at.moreover,because the question in those cases was whether the challenged activity restrained trade,the court rulings necessarily turned on its understanding of economics.see business electronics,at.accordingly,to overturn the decisions in light of sounder economic reasoning was to take them on their own terms.halliburton,at slip,at.
but brulotte is a patent rather than an antitrust case,and our answers to both questions instead go against kimble.to begin,even assuming that brulotte relied on an economic misjudgment,congress is the right entity to fix it.by contrast with the sherman act,the patent laws do not turn over exceptional authority to the courts.accordingly,statutory stare decisis in which this court interprets and congress decides whether to amend retains its usual strong force.see supra,at.and as we have shown,that doctrine does not ordinarily bend to wrong on the merits type arguments it instead assumes congress will correct whatever mistakes we commit.see supra,at.nor does kimble offer any reason to think his own the court erred claim is special.indeed,he does not even point to anything that has changed since brulotte no new empirical studies or advances in economic theory.compare,halliburton,at slip,at considering,though finding insufficient,recent economic research.on his argument,the brulotte court knew all it needed to know to determine that royalties are not usually anticompetitive it just made the wrong call.see brief for petitioners.that claim,even if itself,fails to clear stare decisis high bar.
and in any event,brulotte did not hinge on the mistake kimble identifies.although some of its language invoked economic concepts,see,supra,the court did not rely on the notion that royalties harm competition.nor is that surprising.the patent laws unlike the sherman act do not aim to maximize competition to a large extent,the opposite.and the patent term unlike the restraint of trade standard provides an rule,rather than calling for analysis.so in deciding whether royalties comport with patent law,brulotte did not undertake to assess that practice likely competitive effects.instead,it applied a categorical principle that all patents,and all benefits from them,must end when their terms expire.see brulotte,at supra,at.or more specifically put,the court held,as it had in scott paper,that congress had made a judgment that the day after a patent lapses,the formerly protected invention must be available to all for free.and further that restraints on even a single licensee access to the invention clash with that principle.see brulotte,at a licensee obligation to pay royalties conflicts with the free market visualized for the period and so runs counter to the policy and purpose of the patent laws quoting scott paper,at.that patent not antitrust policy gave rise to the court conclusion that royalty contracts are unenforceable utterly regardless of a demonstrable effect on competition.hovenkamp d,at.
kimble real complaint may go to the merits of such a patent policy what he terms its formalis m,its rigid ity and its detachment from economic reality.brief for petitioners.but that is just a different version of the argument that brulotte is wrong.and it is,if anything,a version less capable than the last of trumping statutory stare decisis.for the choice of what patent policy should be lies first and foremost with congress.so if kimble thinks patent law insistence on unrestricted access to formerly patented inventions leaves too little room for royalties,then congress,not this court,is his proper audience.
kimble also seeks support from the wellspring of all patent policy the goal of promoting innovation.brulotte,he contends,discourages technological innovation and does significant damage to the american economy.brief for petitioners.recall that licensors and licensees may benefit from royalty arrangements because they allow for a longer payment period and a more precise allocation of risk.see supra,at.if the parties ideal licensing agreement is barred,kimble reasons,they may reach no agreement at all.see brief for petitioners.and that possibility may discourage invention in the first instance.the bottom line,kimble concludes,is that some breakthrough technologies will never see the light of day.at.
maybe.or,then again,maybe not.while we recognize that royalties are sometimes not anticompetitive,we just can not say whether barring them imposes any meaningful drag on innovation.as we have explained,brulotte leaves open various ways involving both licensing and other business arrangements to accomplish payment deferral and alike.see supra,at.those alternatives may not offer the parties the precise set of benefits and obligations they would prefer.but they might still suffice to bring patent holders and product developers together and ensure that inventions get to the public.neither kimble nor his amici have offered any empirical evidence connecting brulotte to decreased innovation they essentially ask us to take their word for the problem.and the united states,which acts as both a licensor and a licensee of patented inventions while also implementing patent policy,vigorously disputes that brulotte has caused any significant economic harm.brief for united states as amicus curiae.truth be told,if forced to decide that issue,we would not know where or how to start.
which is one good reason why that is not our job.claims that a statutory precedent has serious and harmful consequences for innovation are to repeat this opinion refrain more appropriately addressed to congress.halliburton,at slip,at.that branch,far more than this one,has the capacity to assess kimble charge that brulotte suppresses technological progress.and if it concludes that brulotte works such harm,congress has the prerogative to determine the exact right response choosing the policy fix,among many conceivable ones,that will optimally serve the public interest.as we have noted,congress legislates actively with respect to patents,considering concerns of just the kind kimble raises.see supra,at.in adhering to our precedent as against such complaints,we promote the values to which courts must attend while leaving matters of public policy to congress.
what we can decide,we can undecide.but stare decisis teaches that we should exercise that authority sparingly.lee and ditko,amazing fantasy i n t
