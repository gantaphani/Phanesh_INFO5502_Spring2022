this case arises from the arbitration of a contract dispute between a film production company and a film distribution company.the district court vacated the arbitration award based on the neutral arbitrator failure to disclose that during the arbitration,he began work as a senior executive with a company that was negotiating with a production executive of one of the parties to the arbitration to finance and an important motion picture.
we hold that vacatur by the district court for evident partiality of the arbitrator was proper under the federal arbitration act.we conclude that the lack of evidence of the arbitrator actual knowledge of the ongoing negotiation does not prevent a finding of evident partiality because,under the circumstances of this case,the arbitrator had a duty to investigate possible conflicts resulting from his new employment and to disclose that employment to the parties.we therefore affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
in may,appellant new regency and appellee nippon herald entered into an agreement for nippon herald to distribute in japan five films produced by new regency.in june,nippon herald sued new regency in a japanese court,alleging that new regency had violated the distribution agreement by failing to deliver one of the five films,crowded room,and by refusing to pay nippon herald money it claimed it was owed under a provision.several months later,the parties agreed that nippon herald would withdraw its japanese suit and instead arbitrate its claims through the american film marketing association afma,now the international film and television alliance,a motion picture trade organization with its own arbitration rules and panel of arbitrators.
in november,nippon herald and new regency jointly selected william immerman,then a los angeles attorney and executive for crusader entertainment,from a list of three potential arbitrators provided by the afma.during the selection process,immerman disclosed that he had previously arbitrated a case where counsel for nippon herald,charles shephard,represented a party,and had also negotiated deals with various executives of new regency prior to their becoming executives at new regency.on february,after his selection,immerman further disclosed that an attorney at shephard firm had brought suit against crusader entertainment and that,although he was not representing crusader,he would likely be called as a percipient witness.
the arbitration hearing took place on april,and,and june,and.in an order dated july,immerman decided that nippon herald was entitled to return of the fee it had paid for the undelivered point not disputed by new interest.in addition,immerman adopted new regency interpretation of the provision and awarded to new regency a portion of the proceeds of a recoupment pool plus interest,subsequently determined to amount to.immerman july order was supplemented twice,on october,and november.immerman final order was served on the parties on december.
on december,new regency moved in federal district court to confirm the final arbitration award and enter judgment pursuant to.nippon herald to vacate the arbitration award on three grounds immerman had erroneously applied california rather than netherlands contract law,thus exceeding his authority as an arbitrator immerman had failed to disclose a prior work relationship with new regency general counsel and arbitration witness bill weiner and immerman had failed to disclose that in,before entry of the july order,he began his new employment as senior vice president and chief administrative officer of the yari film group.when immerman began work,yari film group was negotiating to finance and the night watchman,a motion picture developed by new regency and produced by alexandra milchan milchan.milchan is a production executive at new regency.she is the daughter of new regency principal owner and chief executive officer,arnon milchan.
the district court granted nippon herald motion to vacate the arbitration award on january.it concluded that vacatur was proper because immerman failure to disclose his dealings with yari film group created a reasonable impression of partiality.the district court concluded that immerman past relation with weiner did not support vacatur.it declined to reach the question of whether immerman had exceeded his authority.new regency timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and we affirm.
ii.choice of law 
before proceeding to the merits of the vacatur question,we must first decide whether to apply california law or the federal arbitration act faa.the district court applied california law without discussion,although it indicated that it would reach the same result under the faa.in their initial briefing to this court,both new regency and nippon herald argued that california law should apply,citing a single district of hawaii case,brown hyatt,d,for the proposition that the faa does not apply to postdispute arbitration agreements.however,in supplemental briefing we ordered on this issue the parties now agree that we should apply the faa.
for three reasons,we agree with the parties that the faa,not california law,governs this postdispute arbitration agreement.first,the plain language of the coverage provision of the faa,unambiguously encompasses both predispute and postdispute arbitration agreements.according to that provision,the faa covers 
a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof,or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract,transaction,or refusal 
emphasis added.second,we are aware of no appellate or supreme court authority holding that postdispute arbitration agreements fall outside the scope of the faa.numerous courts have applied the act to such agreements.see,asia pac.indus.rainforest cafe,cir citibank,sverdrup whc constructors,cir.third,we have previously recognized that there is a strong default presumption that the federal arbitration act,not state law,supplies the rules for arbitration.fidelity fed.bank,fsb durga ma,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted see also sovak chugai pharm,cir.no circumstance exists here that would overcome this presumption.
we therefore review the district court vacatur decision under the faa.
iii.merits 
the faa provides that a district court may make an order vacating an arbitration award upon the application of any party to the arbitration 
where the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them 
where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,upon sufficient cause shown,or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or 
where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
a emphasis added.
we review a district court decision to vacate or confirm an arbitration award de novo.poweragent data,cir.we review its findings of fact for clear error.coutee barington capital group,cir.
failure to disclose employment 
nippon herald contends that vacatur was proper because immerman failure to disclose the facts of his employment by yari film group and its negotiations with milchan to finance and the night watchman is sufficient to establish evident partiality in the arbitrator.a.new regency argues that vacatur was improper because these facts are insufficient to establish evident partiality,and there is no evidence that immerman had actual knowledge of yari film group dealings with milchan.
legal standard 
evident partiality is distinct from actual bias.in commonwealth coatings continental cas,d,the supreme court held that a party seeking to vacate an arbitration award for evident partiality need not show that the arbitrator was actually guilty of fraud or bias in deciding th e case.id.at.rather,the arbitrator failure to disclose to the parties any dealings that might create an impression of possible bias is sufficient to support vacatur.id.at.the court found this standard was satisfied where a neutral arbitrator in a dispute between a contractor and subcontractor failed to disclose that he had previously performed consulting work worth about for the contractor.although there had been no dealings between them for about a year immediately preceding the arbitration,the arbitrator past relationship with the contractor had included irregular contacts over a period of four of five years and had gone so far as to include the rendering of services on the very projects involved in th e lawsuit.id.at.while the court recognized that arbitrators can not sever all their ties with the business world,it emphasized that because arbitrators have completely free rein to decide the law as well as the facts and are not subject to appellate review,courts must scrupulous ly safeguard the ir impartiality.id.at.
in schmitz zilveti,cir,we vacated an arbitration award for evident partiality where the arbitrator law firm had represented the parent company of a party in at least nineteen cases during a period of years,the most recent representation end ing approximately months before the arbitration was submitted.id.at.we disagreed with the district court conclusion that evident partiality could not be shown because the arbitrator was unaware of his law firm conflict during the arbitration.id.based on commonwealth coatings,we concluded that the legal standard for evident partiality is whether there are facts showing a reasonable impression of partiality.id.at.we explained that this legal standard can be satisfied even where an arbitrator is unaware of the facts showing a reasonable impression of partiality because the arbitrator may have a duty to investigate independent of his duty to disclose.id.
for two reasons,we concluded in schmitz that there was a duty to investigate.first,parties can expect a lawyer arbitrator to investigate and disclose conflicts he has with actual parties to the arbitration.id.second,the code of the arbitral body,the national association of securities dealers nasd,require d arbitrators to make a reasonable effort to inform themselves of any existing or past financial,business,or professional relationships that they or their employer,partners,or business associates may have that are likely to affect impartiality or might reasonably create an appearance of partiality or bias.id.at alterations in original.
we concluded that the in schmitz failed to discharge his duty to investigate because,although he had run a conflict check on the actual parties to the arbitration,he had failed to run a conflict check on one party parent company.that check would have revealed the parent company engaged in substantial business with the arbitrator law firm.id.at.given the constructive knowledge and the presence of the conflict,we concluded that his failure to inform the parties to the arbitration resulted in a reasonable impression of partiality under commonwealth coatings.id.at.
facts supporting vacatur 
the key facts are largely undisputed.during the arbitrator selection process in november,the afma distributed immerman resume to the parties.it stated that he was employed as a private attorney specializing in representing sales agents,independent producers,financiers and distributors and negotiating complex financing deals and acting as production and distribution counsel for his clients and a s executive vice president of crusader entertainment,llc.during the selection process,immerman disclosed that he had previously negotiated deals in his capacity as an attorney with various executives of new regency prior to their becoming executives at new regency.after he was selected,immerman disclosed,on february,that an attorney at the law firm representing nippon herald had filed a lawsuit against crusader entertainment,a company he had represented as an attorney and where he also serve d as an officer of the company.immerman stated that he was not representing crusader entertainment in the action but in all probability,should the action proceed further,would be a percipient witness since he did represent crusader with respect to the negotiation of the agreement that is the basis of the action.
in october,after the conclusion of the arbitration,immerman testified under oath in an unrelated proceeding that he had been employed by yari film group s ince the middle of july.immerman described his position at the yari film group as senior executive vice president and chief administrative officer.he listed as among his responsibilities oversee ing the business affairs and legal department and assist ing the production department and also assist ing in the general administration of the company.the district court found that immerman was employ ed with yari during the pendency of the arbitration,shortly before the issuance of the first decision,and adverted to the possibility that immerman had entered into negotiations at a much earlier time.
yari film group is an independent film company that,during the relevant period,financed and distributed about to films per year,a number of these in partnership with other film companies.in late july,industry press reported that yari film group was in negotiations to finance a film,the night watchman,based on a screenplay by the popular crime novelist james ellroy,and that spike lee was in talks to be the director.the film had been developed by new regency and would be produced by alexandra milchan,a production executive at new regency.the press release stated that milchan would produce the film outside of her deal with regency enterprises.in september,the night watchman was one of sixteen films,in various stages of development,being financed by yari film group.in november,the actor keanu reeves was signed to star in the night watchman.immerman final arbitration order was served on the parties in early december.
discussion 
if the facts of yari film group negotiations for the night watchman had been known to immerman prior to the completion of the arbitration,we would have no trouble concluding that his failure to disclose them to the parties would support vacatur of the arbitration award on the ground of evident partiality.even if milchan was not directly representing new regency in negotiations with yari film group,she was an executive for new regency and the daughter of its principal owner and chief executive officer.indeed,immerman himself had considered past negotiations of deals with various executives of new regency prior to their becoming executives at new regency significant enough to disclose them in november,during the arbitrator selection process.emphasis added.the night watchman was a significant project.beginning in,immerman was a executive at yari film group,responsible,by his own account,for overseeing its business affairs and legal department and assisting its production department.these facts show that immerman ha d a substantial interest in a firm which was doing more than trivial business closely connected to a party to the arbitration.see commonwealth coatings,at.white,concurring.
new regency argues on appeal that evident partiality can not be established because the evidence does not establish that immerman had actual knowledge of the facts he failed to disclose.this argument is contrary to schmitz,where we held that an arbitrator lack of actual knowledge of the presence of a conflict does not excuse where the arbitrator had a duty to investigate,and thus had constructive knowledge of,the conflict.at.while we did not hold in schmitz that arbitrators have a duty to investigate potential conflicts in all cases,we concluded that such a duty did exist where an arbitrator firm represented the parent corporation of one of the parties and the procedures of the arbitral body required arbitrators to make a reasonable effort to inform themselves of potential conflicts.id.at,at finding no evident partiality based on fact that,unbeknowns
