steven and jonnie miller,adopted children of helen miller,wife of the bandleader glenn miller,and their exclusive licensing agent cmg worldwide collectively appellants appeal from the district court order granting defendant glenn miller productions,gmp summary judgment and dismissing their complaint on the basis of laches.see miller glenn miller,d.gmp the district court determination that it is engaged in unauthorized sublicensing.in his opinion,district judge howard matz ruled that a licensee of trademark and related publicity rights may not sublicense those rights to third parties without express permission from the original licensor.id.at.we agree with this extension of the sublicensing rule from copyright and patent law to the licensing of trademark and related publicity rights such as occurred here,and with the district court reasons for extending the rule.the district court also correctly ruled,however,that appellants are barred by the doctrine of laches from taking legal action now,based on undisputed evidence establishing that they should have known of gmp allegedly infringing activities well beyond the statutory period for bringing suit.id.at.accordingly,we affirm and adopt the district court thorough opinion with the exception of section id.at and the final three sentences of the opinion id.at,beginning with alternatively,the court rules.we also reprint the incorporated portions as an appendix to this opinion.
we nevertheless address gmp argument that the district court erred in concluding that it sublicensed the glenn miller mark rather than that it licensed its own separate and independently owned glenn miller orchestra mark.a party that prevails on summary judgment may any adverse finding that form s the basis for collateral estoppel in subsequent litigation.schwartzmiller gardner,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
we reject gmp contention that because it registered the glenn miller orchestra mark and the mark has become incontestable,it has rights to the mark independent of the rights to the glenn miller mark licensed by helen miller in the agreement.this argument misapprehends a fundamental principle of trademark law registration does not create a mark or confer ownership only use in the marketplace can establish a mark.see cal.cooler,loretto winery,cir a trademark is a common law property right that exists independently of statutory provisions for registration.internal quotation marks omitted mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,at to ed.neither the registration nor the incontestable status of the glenn miller orchestra mark affects appellants ownership of the glenn miller mark,which a jury could find was acquired through use in the marketplace see providing that a registered mark is not incontestable to the extent,if any,to which the use of the mark infringes a valid right acquired under the law of any state or territory by use of a mark or trade name continuing from a date prior to the date of registration under this chapter of such registered mark.gmp glenn miller orchestra mark does not foreclose appellants from establishing that gmp breached the agreement and infringed upon their rights to the glenn miller mark.
gmp misplaces reliance on holiday inns,trump,for the proposition that a licensee,by developing a trademark based on a name it has been licensed to use,may acquire rights in the licensed name adverse to the original licensor.in trump,two hotel companies entered into a partnership with donald trump to develop and operate a casino hotel in atlantic city,new jersey.id.at.trump granted the partnership a license to use his name,and the partnership named its property the trump casino hotel.id.at.when trump subsequently opened a casino hotel named trump castle casino hotel in atlantic city,the hotel companies sued to enjoin trump from using his name in association with the new property.id.at.the district court rejected the hotel companies contract law claims,finding that trump had not bargained away his right to use his name for competing facilities.id.at.it also held that the hotel companies had acquired some rights in trump name through the development of goodwill associated with the trump casino hotel,id.at,but it ultimately denied injunctive relief based on equitable considerations,id.at.because gmp is not seeking to enjoin appellants from competing with its glenn miller orchestra business,but rather contends that its glenn miller orchestra mark is independent of appellants glenn miller mark and may be freely licensed to third parties,trump is inapposite.
we also reject appellants challenge to the district court laches ruling.it is that we examine when a plaintiff knew or should have known of the infringing activity to determine whether the plaintiff unreasonably delayed in bringing suit,jarrow formulas,nutrition now,cir kling hallmark cards,cir.thus in,monitek,we held that laches barred a trademark infringement action even though the plaintiff did not acquire actual knowledge of the defendant activities until the year of suit,where the p laintiff ought to have discovered defendant use sooner had it been diligently seeking to enforce its mark,cir,as amended see also research,auto.club de de la france,holding that a petition for cancellation of a registered trademark was barred by the doctrine of laches based on the petitioner constructive knowledge mccarthy on trademarks,at laches requires determining when the plaintiff was actually or constructively on notice of defendant activities.
undeterred,appellants cite several cases supposedly holding that laches is applicable only where the trademark holder knowingly allowed the infringing mark to be used without objection for a lengthy period of time.see brother records,jardine,cir,walt disney,cir brookfield commc ns,coast entm t,cir.in the asserted cases,however,constructive knowledge was not at issue rather,we declined to apply laches because there was no undue delay between the inception of infringing activity and the filing of a lawsuit.see brother records,at plaintiff filed suit within one year of the inception of defendant infringing activity,at plaintiff filed suit within two months of the inception of defendant infringing activity brookfield commc ns,at brookfield filed suit the very day that west coast publicly announced its intention to launch the allegedly infringing website.the phrase knowingly allowed in these opinions is dictum and can not bear the weight appellants seek to place on it.
appellants also assert that the district court made a finding that steven miller had actual knowledge of gmp unauthorized activities several years before filing suit.while gmp is not entitled to summary judgment on the issue of laches based on steven actual knowledge in light of steven sworn declaration that he lacked such knowledge until or,the district court did not make a finding of actual knowledge.leslie grupo ica,cir holding that a sworn statement by a must be accepted as true on summary judgment unless the statement contradicts other sworn statements by the.the district court finding of unreasonable delay rests on appellants constructive knowledge 
the district court correctly held that appellants may have had constructive knowledge of gmp activities as early as,more than twenty years before the current suit was filed,and certainly no later than,when steven miller attorney began receiving gmp financial statements,and thus that they unreasonably delayed in bringing suit.see,at holding that a delay of six to eight years was unreasonable.because we affirm the district court on the basis of laches,we do not review its alternative holding that appellants failure to supervise gmp use of the glenn miller mark estops them from bringing this suit.wanlass,because we affirm summary judgment on the basis of laches,we do not reach equitable estoppel.

factual background 
the principal facts of this case are either undisputed or not genuinely disputed.glenn miller was a popular musician and band leader who formed the glenn miller orchestra in.during the and,glenn miller recorded and released sound recordings using his name and the name glenn miller orchestra.on december,glenn miller was aboard an armed services airplane that crashed in the english channel.one year later,he was pronounced dead.glenn miller last will and testament did not contain an express provision bequeathing his publicity rights,trademarks or other intellectual property rights.his widow,helen miller,inherited the residue of his will,which would include whatever intellectual property rights he had.
plaintiffs lamely dispute some of the facts cited in this order on the ground that plaintiffs have no independent knowledge of the alleged fact.see.however,pursuant to local rule and the court standing scheduling and case management order,in order to genuinely dispute a material fact,plaintiffs must submit a declaration or other written evidence.
on either april,or april,david mackay,glenn miller close friend and lawyer during his lifetime incorporated glenn miller productions,gmp.gmp certificate of incorporation specifies that among gmp many purposes were 
the parties dispute the exact date.
c to manufacture,purchase,sell and generally to trade and deal in and with goods,wares,products and merchandise of every kind,nature and description 
e to organize,own,operate,manage,direct,and control,directly or through others,one or more orchestras or musical organizations and to acquire by loan,hiring,purchase,agreement,or other lawful means,the right to use and deal in or with and to authorize others to use and deal in or with the name,likeness,music,scores,arrangements and musical style of others heretofore or hereafter engaged in the field of music.i to acquire copyrights,licenses or other rights to or in plays,films,dramas,dramatizations,musical compositions and intellectual properties of all kinds.
see mackay,exh.a.despite the broad grant of authority conferred by gmp certificate of incorporation,at gmp first board of director meeting on april,david mackay,stated that the main business of the corporation would be to own and operate a traveling orchestra.see mackay,exh.b.
at the first board of director meeting,david mackay,was elected president of gmp and he remained president until his death in.helen miller was elected of gmp and she served in that role until her death in.gmp also employed helen miller as a technical advisor.david mackay,and helen miller each owned of the shares of gmp until the times of their respective deaths.
sometime between april,and june,in any case,shortly after gmp was incorporated,helen miller executed a written license agreement the license agreement in favor of gmp.the agreement consisted of one paragraph which read,in its entirety 
the parties dispute the exact date.
for and in consideration of the sum of one and no dollar and other good and valuable consideration,the undersigned,individually and as executrix of the estate of glenn miller deceased,hereby grants to glenn miller productions,the right and license to use the name and likeness of glenn miller and the library of music belonging to the estate of glenn miller the undersigned in connection with the business activities of glenn miller productions.
see wolf,exh.notwithstanding the amount of consideration,specified in the license agreement,the minutes of a june,gmp board meeting state that the board agreed to pay helen miller per year in return for permission to use glenn miller name,likeness and library of music the same rights conveyed by the license agreement.see mackay,exh.c.
sometime after the license agreement was executed,gmp began operating an orchestra called the glenn miller orchestra and engaging in a variety of promotional activities.gmp entered into a written contract for the glenn miller orchestra to perform at washington lee university on june,exh.h.in addition,the minutes of a june,gmp board meeting indicate that in,gmp authorized a loan to a production company to produce a television show on cbs titled glenn miller time featuring the glenn miller orchestra,exh.i.the minutes also reflect that the production company received the rights to use the glenn miller name,picture,likeness,music and arrangements in connection with the television show,and usual accompanying promotion and publicity.id.there is no evidence in the record that helen miller objected to this licensing of glenn miller name,likeness and publicity rights.finally,minutes from an august,gmp board meeting indicate that in,gmp board of directors ratified gmp agreement to purchase copies of a book entitled glenn miller discography in order to support its publication,exh.
in,gmp obtained a federal trademark registration for the glenn miller orchestra mark,which it renewed in,exhs.helen miller died on june.helen miller will established a testamentary trust containing her gmp shares.the will named david mackay,as the trustee.in his capacity as trustee,david mackay,later sold helen miller gmp shares to gmp for.see req.for judicial notice,exh.upon helen miller death,david mackay,the son of david mackay,was appointed vice president of gmp helen miller former position.
like her deceased husband will,helen miller will did not contain an express provision which bequeathed any of glenn miller publicity rights,trademarks or other intellectual property rights that she may have inherited.her two adopted children,steven miller and jonnie soper miller,would have inherited any such rights only through the residue of helen miller will.
in the late,steven and jonnie miller filed three separate lawsuits against david mackay,in los angeles,new york and new jersey based in part on a dispute over the ownership of gmp.on april,the parties entered into an oral stipulation the settlement agreement,which is reflected on the record of the supreme court of the state of new york,settling the new york and los angeles lawsuits.as part of the settlement agreement,the parties agreed as follows 
according to a brief filed by jonnie miller in the new jersey supreme court,the complaint in the new jersey action alleged that david mackay,had breached his fiduciary duties and exerted undue influence over the millers in order to gain personal financial advantage.see bonfiglio,exh.a.steven miller testified at his deposition that the california litigation concerned steven and jonnie miller accusation that david mackay,had cheated them out of a ownership interest in gmp.see eisenberg,miller depo.
petitioners jonnie and steven miller ratify and confirm the agreement dated april,made by helen miller granting inter alia glenn miller productions,the right and license to use the name and likeness of glenn miller helen miller and petitioners agree not to directly or indirectly organize operate or cause to be organized operate a band or orchestra using the name of glenn miller or any facsimile thereof.respondent presumably,david mackay,or gmp agrees to pay the petitioners the sum of to each petitioner in consideration of glenn miller productions,past and continued use in perpetuity of the name,likeness and library of music of glenn miller.
see wolf,exh.d.the new jersey lawsuit did not settle,and it ended in a ruling by the new jersey supreme court in favor of the millers.
in,steven miller retired from his job as a police officer for the monrovia police department.a draft pleading prepared by an attorney for steven miller,dated april,and entitled amended petition for removing personal representative,david mackay,suggests that in,steven miller attempted to remove david mackay,as the personal representative of helen miller estate.paragraph of the draft pleading reads prior to the death of helen miller,mackay acquired of the issued and outstanding stock of two corporations which own and operate the glenn miller bands which have continued to play throughout the world since the death of glenn miller.see eisenberg,exh.the record does not indicate whether such a pleading was actually filed in the los angeles superior court.
since his retirement,steven miller has described himself has having participated in the administration of gmp matters.see eisenberg,miller depo.since,jonnie miller has assisted him in doing so.id.
on may,david mackay,died.upon his death,david mackay,became the president of gmp.
since at least the,an ensemble calling itself the glenn miller orchestra has performed at many events and festivals,including at the yearly glenn miller birthplace society festival in iowa and the yearly dancing on the plains festival in colorado.see mackay decl.since,gmp has operated one regular glenn miller orchestra band,as well as special units of the glenn miller orchestra which supplement the regular glenn miller orchestra band during times of high demand.id.these special units are comprised of different band leaders and musicians hired and supervised by gmp,and they work on a basis.id.since,the regular glenn miller orchestra has been led by larry.id.between the and the present,steven miller has attended approximately glenn miller orchestra performances,all of which he believes were led by larry.see eisenberg,miller depo.
also since,gmp has to third parties the right to operate orchestras called the glenn miller orchestra.id.these have operated glenn miller orchestras in the united states,canada,germany and the united kingdom.currently,gmp has two schmidt salden gmbh,which operates in germany,and ray mcvay,who operates in the united kingdom.see mackay,exhs.l,both agreements set forth detailed performance standards which provide,for example,that the orchestra shall consist of at least musicians plus a leader and one male and one female vocalist,that the bandstands must be similar to that used by the glenn miller orchestra operated by gmp,that the orchestra shall consist of a particular number of various types of instruments,and that the orchestra shall at all times behave and be groomed in accordance with the highest standards of the glenn miller orchestra.id.the agreements also provide that a failure to conform to those standards constitutes a default.id.finally,the agreements provide that they are not assignable or transferable.id.counsel for gmp represented at the hearing on these motions that david mackay,assures that the are complying with the terms of the agreements by observing their performances and monitoring their bookings.
beginning in,gmp also has been selling merchandise,including cassette tapes,videotapes,cds,dvds,and polo shirts bearing the glenn miller orchestra mark or the gmo logo.see mackay decl.this merchandise is sold primarily at gmo performances.id.during each performance,an announcement is made regarding the sale of merchandise,and a table displaying merchandise is set up in a prominent location.id.since september of,merchandise has also been available on gmp website.id.counsel for gmp represented at the hearing that gmp annual worldwide revenue is approximately million dollars.
during the and,counsel for steven and jonnie miller sent at least eight cease and desist letters to third parties who were not authorized to use or otherwise exploit glenn miller name or likeness,but who were,nevertheless,apparently doing so.see eisenberg,exhs.miller,exh.although most of these letters were sent to alleged infringers in the united states,one letter was sent to a man in the republic of south africa who had allegedly formed an unauthorized glenn miller society in south africa.see eisenberg,exh.however,the millers never sent any cease and desist letters to gmp.indeed,before they filed this lawsuit,the millers had never communicated with gmp regarding any qualitative aspect of gmp business activities,such as its operation of the glenn miller orchestra,its sublicensing to third parties of the right to operate a glenn miller orchestra,or its sale of merchandise bearing the glenn miller orchestra mark.see mackay decl.
there are currently approximately gmp shares outstanding,most of which are owned by david mackay.in and,jonnie miller and steven miller respectively became gmp shareholders by purchasing shares from david mackay,stepbrother,samuel clark.see eisenberg,miller depo.steven miller currently owns eleven shares in gmp and jonnie miller owns one share.id.gmp sends its shareholders,including jonnie and steven miller,yearly financial information about gmp operations,including gmp financial statements.see,exhs.the record indicates that some of these financial statements were sent directly to steven miller,and others were sent to his counsel,laura of gibson,dunn crutcher.id.included in gmp financials were its income statements,each of which contained line items for licensing,licensing,and licensing europe.id.
in,the millers hired the roger richman agency,for a period of two years,to be their exclusive licensing agent for use of the glenn miller name in connection with all video recording and tapes advertising commercials theater and other dramatic uses animation newspaper book and magazine syndication endorsements promotions premiums sale of merchandise use in all services.see eisenberg,exh.however,excluded from the grant of rights to the roger richman agency were rights previously granted by gmp to certain third parties,including orchestras of glenn miller productions,a new york corporation.id.in,the millers hired plaintiff cmg worldwide,cmg to be their exclusive licensing agent,subject to the same exclusion for the rights of orchestras of glenn miller productions,a new york corporation,exh.
in,steven miller filed trademark applications with the pto for the mark glenn miller in connection with various classes of goods and services,including clothing,paper goods,housewares,glass and entertainment activities.see bonfiglio,exhs.however,the pto rejected steven miller applications due to the likelihood of confusion with gmp already registered glenn miller orchestra mark,exhs.on june,the pto deemed steven miller applications abandoned,exhs.sometime later in,steven miller filed new applications for the glenn miller mark.gmp has opposed those applications,and all proceedings by the pto have been stayed pending the outcome of this litigation,exh.
steven miller claims that he first learned in or that there was more than one functioning glenn miller orchestra,although he does not specify how he learned.see miller decl.steven miller also claims that he did not learn until april after filing this lawsuit that gmp has entered into agreements with third parties to use glenn miller name and likeness in the united states and in foreign counties.id.the record does not indicate when steven miller learned that gmp has been selling merchandise bearing the glenn miller orchestra mark.
on june,steven miller,jonnie miller,and cmg worldwide,collectively plaintiffs filed this action against gmp,asserting eleven claims for relief breach of written contract termination of written contract infringement of statutory right of publicity violation of a intentional interference with economic advantage federal statutory dilution state statutory dilution violation of cal.business professions code conversion accounting and declaratory relief,all based on gmp sale of merchandise bearing glenn miller name,likeness and identity,and gmp to third parties of the right to operate orchestras named the glenn miller orchestra.
plaintiffs currently move for summary adjudication of one narrow issue in this case.they seek a ruling from the court that gmp may not any intellectual property rights conveyed to it pursuant to the license agreement without express permission from the licensors now the millers,and therefore that gmp admitted constitutes a material breach of the license agreement.defendant has filed a for summary judgment,contending that the license agreement and settlement agreement give gmp the right to sell merchandise and to operate and multiple bands,and in any case,that all of plaintiffs claims are barred by the doctrine of laches.although the court ultimately finds that plaintiffs claims are barred by the doctrines of estoppel and laches,the court will proceed to examine the other issues raised by the parties because the court anticipates an appeal from the laches ruling and believes that if the court is found to be in error,on remand it would be in the parties best interest to have their respective rights and obligations previously clarified.indeed,such clarification may assist the parties in settling their surprisingly bitter and very costly dispute.
a.the legal standard for a motion for summary judgment.
federal rule of civil procedure c provides for summary judgment when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.the moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact for trial.anderson liberty lobby,d.a fact is material if it could affect the outcome of the suit under the governing substantive law.id.at,d.the burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to establish,beyond the pleadings,that there is a genuine issue for trial.celotex catrett,d.
when the party moving for summary judgment would bear the burden of proof at trial,it must come forward with evidence which would entitle it to a directed verdict if the evidence went uncontroverted at trial.in such a case,the moving party has the initial burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of fact on each issue material to its case.transportation brokerage,darden restaurants,cir citations omitted.in contrast,when the party bears the burden of proving the claim or defense,the moving party can meet its burden by pointing out the absence of evidence from the party.the moving party need not disprove the other party case.see celotex,at,d.thus,s ummary judgment for a defendant is appropriate when the plaintiff fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to his case,and on which he will bear the burden of proof at trial.cleveland policy management,d citing celotex,at,d.
when the moving party meets its burden,the adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party pleadings,but the adverse party response,by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule,must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.fed.e.summary judgment will be entered against the party if that party does not present such specific facts.id.only admissible evidence may be considered in deciding a motion for summary judgment.beyene coleman sec,cir.
i n ruling on a motion for summary judgment,the nonmoving party evidence is to be believed,and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in that party favor.hunt cromartie,d quoting anderson,at,d.but the party must come forward with more than the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence.anderson,at,d.thus,w here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party,there is no genuine issue for trial.matsushita indus,zenith radio,d citation omitted.
simply because the facts are undisputed does not make summary judgment appropriate.instead,where divergent ultimate inferences may reasonably be drawn from the undisputed facts,summary judgment is improper.see robins,cir.
plaintiffs motion for summary adjudication may gmp intellectual property rights without plaintiffs permission 
it is well established in patent and copyright law that a patent or copyright licensee may not his licensed intellectual property rights without express permission from the licensor.see gardner nike,cir everex systems cadtrak,cir.the court will henceforth refer to this rule as the rule.although the ninth circuit has not addressed whether the rule applies to trademark licenses,the courts that have addressed the issue have uniformly held it does,and thus that a trademark licensee may not a mark without express permission from the licensor.see tap publications,chinese yellow pages new york,in re travelot,raufast kicker pizzazz,wl,dist.lexis thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition,ed.hereinafter mccarthy.the reasoning behind the courts extension of the rule to the trademark context is that,s ince the owner has the duty to control the quality of goods sold under its mark,it must have the right to pass upon the abilities of new potential licensees.mccarthy,supra.
in plaintiffs motion for summary adjudication,plaintiffs ask the court to apply the rule previously recognized by courts in tap,travelot and raufast to trademark licenses.plaintiffs also ask the court to extend the sublicensing rule to licenses of publicity rights.finally,plaintiffs seek a ruling that because the license agreement did not grant gmp express permission to,gmp does not have the right to any intellectual property rights it obtained under the license agreement.
fundamentally,the right of publicity is the inherent right of every human being to control the commercial use of his or her identity.see mccarthy,supra.california law recognizes both a statutory and common law right of publicity.the statutory right of publicity is codified in cal.civil code,which provides in relevant part any person who knowingly uses another name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness,in any manner,for purposes of advertising or selling,without such person prior consent shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result thereof.california right of publicity protects an individual name and likeness from appropriation for either commercial or purposes.see wendt host int l,cir.the right to publicity extends years beyond an individual death.see mccarthy,supra,cal.
defendant threshold arguments that the agreement did not convey a license.
defendant argues,first,that as a matter of contract law,the agreement between helen miller and gmp did not convey a license.defendant also argues that even if the parties did intend the agreement to convey a license,at the time,there were no existing trademark rights that could be licensed.
a.the only reasonable interpretation of the agreement is that it conveys to gmp both a trademark license and a license of glenn miller publicity rights.
the threshold question is what rights did the licensing agreement convey to gmp plaintiffs argue that the license agreement conveyed a trademark license to gmp.gmp first argues in opposition that the agreement did not convey a trademark license,but instead a license of glenn miller right to publicity.in plaintiffs reply brief,plaintiffs contend somewhat inconsistently with their opening brief that the agreement transfers a bundle of rights,including trademark rights and publicity rights.see reply at.in any case,plaintiffs contend in their reply brief that the exact categorization of the rights conveyed by the licensing agreement is not relevant because the rule should apply to all areas of intellectual property.id.however,if plaintiffs are wrong about the scope of the rights conveyed to gmp by the agreement,the court would not have to address whether the rule should be extended to licenses of trademarks and publicity rights.
courts apply general principles of contract interpretation when interpreting the terms and scope of a licensing agreement.see mendler winterland production,cir.t he fundamental goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting.see united states cellular invest.of los angeles gte mobilnet,cir.under california law,t he test of admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument is not whether it appears to the court to be plain and unambiguous on its face,but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.see pacific gas and electric thomas drayage rigging,cal d,in bank united states king features entertainment,cir.because california law recognizes that the words of a written instrument often lack a clear meaning apart from the context in which the words were written,courts may preliminarily consider any extrinsic evidence offered by the parties.if the court decides,after consideration of this evidence,that the language of a contract,in the light of all the circumstances,is fairly susceptible of either one of the two interpretations contended for,extrinsic evidence relevant to prove either of such meanings is admissible.pacific gas,cal d at,united states cellular invest,at.extrinsic evidence includes testimony regarding the circumstances in which a contract was written,the subsequent conduct of the parties,and the common usage of particular terms in a given industry.see pacific gas,cal d at,united states cellular invest,at united cal.bank thc financial,cir.
the agreement lacks a choice of law clause.given the absence of any argument by the parties that california law does not govern the agreement,the court will apply california law in construing it.
if,after considering the language of the contract and any admissible extrinsic evidence,the meaning of the contract is unambiguous,a court may properly interpret it on a motion for summary judgment.see southern california gas city of santa ana,cir.however,if the interpretation turns upon the credibility of conflicting extrinsic evidence,or if construing the evidence in the nonmovant favor,the ambiguity can be resolved consistent with the nonmovant position,summary judgment is inappropriate.parsons bristol devel,cal d.
the license agreement conveyed to gmp the right and license to use the name and likeness of glenn miller in connection with the business activities of gmp.see wolf,exh.c.the license agreement does not explicitly convey to gmp either the right to license any existing glenn miller trademark or glenn miller publicity rights,or both.however,the terms name likeness are found in both the lanham act definition of a trademark and in the definitions of california statutory and common law rights to publicity.because the agreement is ambiguous on its face and is reasonably susceptible to multiple interpretations,extrinsic evidence is admissible to prove the parties intent when they executed the agreement.see pacific gas,cal d at.
the lanham act defines a trademark as including any word,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof used by a person to identify and distinguish his or her goods from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods,even if that source is unknown.similarly,under both california statutory and common law,the right of publicity protects against the appropriation by others of one name,voice,signature,photograph,or likeness.see cal.wendt host int l,cir.
it is undisputed that helen miller executed the license agreement shortly after incorporating gmp.the proximity of the two events,the undisputed fact that after its formation and until the execution of the license agreement,gmp did not conduct any business beyond electing officers and drafting bylaws,and gmp use of the name glenn miller in its own name,strongly suggest that gmp was incorporated for the specific purpose of conducting business related to glenn miller,notwithstanding that the certificate of incorporation speaks more generally about its purposes.see pages,supra.in addition,as described above,gmp certificate of incorporation provided that gmp was authorized to manufacture,purchase,sell and generally to trade and deal in and with goods,wares,products and merchandise of every kind,nature and description as well as to organize,own,operate,manage,direct and control,directly or through others,one or more orchestras or musical organizations.see mackay,exh.a.it is hard to imagine that gmp would be able to sell and trade merchandise and operate orchestras bearing the glenn miller mark without exploiting glenn miller identity or likeness for promotional purposes.likewise,it is hard to imagine that gmp could exploit glenn miller publicity rights without using a trademark containing the glenn miller name.therefore,the court finds that agreement is susceptible to only one reasonable it conveys both a trademark license and a license of glenn miller publicity rights.
b.the court rejects gmp arguments that,as a matter of law,the agreement could not have conveyed a trademark license.
gmp next argues that regardless of how the terms are construed,as a matter of law,the agreement could not have conveyed a trademark license to gmp because neither plaintiffs nor their predecessors owned a glenn miller trademark in.therefore,gmp argues,the agreement must have conveyed only a license of glenn miller publicity rights.this argument is unpersuasive.
an individual may acquire trademark protection in a personal name in one of two ways.first,an individual may obtain a federal trademark registration from the patent and trademark office.see mccarthy,supra.it is undisputed that neither plaintiffs nor their predecessors have,at any time,obtained a federal registration for the mark glenn miller.second,an individual may prove that through usage,a personal name has acquired a secondary meaning.see mccarthy,supra.secondary meaning is the consumer association of the mark with a particular source or sponsor.see gallo winery gallo cattle,cir.in determining whether a mark has obtained secondary meaning,courts consider whether actual purchasers of the product bearing the mark associate the mark with the producer the degree and manner of advertising under the mark the length and manner of use of the mark and whether use of the mark has been exclusive.see comm.for idaho high desert yost,cir.whether a claimed mark has obtained a secondary meaning is a question of fact to be determined by a jury.see igloo products brantex,cir.
plaintiffs present evidence of advertising and use of the glenn miller name in connection with the sale of goods and services,such as radio shows,advertisements for agents,record labels,cigarettes,transcription services,concerts,record compilations,musical instruments,commemorative clothing,photographs and specialty items.see steven miller,exh.a.this evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that by,consumers associated the name glenn miller with a particular source or quality of product,and thus that the glenn miller name had acquired a secondary meaning.therefore,the court rejects gmp argument that the agreement could not have conveyed a trademark license because in helen miller had no trademark to convey.
gmp also argues that the agreement could not have conveyed a trademark license because the agreement did not contain a provision for the supervision and control over the goods and services gmp produced under the license.it is well established that when the owner of a trademark licenses the mark to others,he retains a duty to exercise control and supervision over the licensee use of the mark.see sheila shine products,sheila shine,cir siegel chicken delight,cir.however,a provision recognizing the licensor supervision and control is not an essential element of a trademark license.see dawn donut hart food stores,cir the absence of an express contract right to inspect and supervise a licensee operations does not mean that the plaintiff method of licensing failed to comply with the requirements of the lanham act.plaintiff may have in fact exercised control in spite of the absence of any express grant by licensees of the right to inspect and supervise bunn coffee service,d holding that an agreement conveyed a trademark license despite the agreement lack of an explicit quality control provision.a license agreement need not contain an express quality control provision because trademark law,rather than the contract itself,confers on the licensor the right and obligation to exercise quality control.see mccarthy,supra.therefore,the lack of a quality control provision in the agreement does not mean that helen miller could not have conveyed a valid trademark license to gmp.
having found,first,that the only reasonable interpretation of the language of the agreement is that it conveyed both a trademark license and a license of glenn miller publicity rights,and second,that a jury could reasonably find that helen miller owned a trademark that she could license,the court now will turn to the merits of plaintiffs summary adjudication motion.
the policy reasons for the rule in the patent and copyright contexts support extending the rule to the trademark context.
acting on its own,gmp has to third parties the rights it acquired in the agreement.could it do so,lawfully in harris emus records,cir,the ninth circuit addressed for the first time whether under the copyright act,a copyright licensee could transfer his license to a third party without permission from the original licensor.the ninth circuit held that a copyright licensee could not do so.id.at.in support of its ruling,the ninth circuit discussed several policy issues,including that a copyright licensor retained rights in the copyright would be jeopardized if the licensee could without notifying or receiving permission from him.id.the ninth circuit reasoned by licensing rather than assigning his interest in the copyright,the owner reserves certain rights,including that of collecting royalties.his ability to monitor use would be jeopardized by allowing sublicensing without notice.id.eighteen years later,in gardner nike,cir,the ninth circuit held that the same rule applied to the copyright act,for the same reason.in addition to agreeing with the harris court concern about the ability of a copyright licensor to monitor use,the ninth circuit also recognized that in the absence of such a requirement,disputes between a licensor and a licensee regarding whether a was acting within the scope of the original license would trigger litigation an undesirable result.id.
the policy rationales cited by the ninth circuit in harris and gardner apply with equal force to the of trademarks.as discussed above,a trademark owner has an affirmative duty to supervise and control the licensee use of its mark,in order to protect the public expectation that all products sold under a particular mark derive from a common source and are of like quality.see mccarthy,supra.licensors who fail to meet this obligation may lose their right to enforce the trademark license.id.common sense suggests that if a trademark licensee could unilaterally a mark without notifying or obtaining consent from the licensor,then a trademark licensor would lose his ability to police his mark,thereby becoming estopped from enforcing his ownership rights the licensee.such a result is illogical,undesirable,and at odds with the nature of intellectual property rights.moreover,if a trademark licensor could not control the capacity of a licensee to its mark,then disputes about the suitability of a potential or about whether a is acting within the scope of the original license would trigger litigation.as the ninth circuit recognized in gardner,this result is also undesirable.
the court acknowledges that,as gmp points out in its opposition and the supreme court has recognized,there are fundamental differences between patent and copyright law on the one hand,and trademark law on the other hand.see sony of america universal city studios,d.for example,while the basic policies underlying copyright and patent protection are to encourage creative authorship and invention,the purposes of trademark protection are to protect the public expectation regarding the source and quality of goods.id.at,d mccarthy,supra.however,despite these differences,copyright and trademark licensors share a common retained interest in the ownership of their intellectual interest that would be severely diminished if a licensee were allowed to without the licensor express permission.for these reasons,the court finds that the policies underlying the rule in patent and copyright law apply with equal force to trademark law.accordingly,a trademark licensee such as gmp may not without express permission from the original licensor.
the same policies also support an extension of the rule to licenses of publicity rights.
plaintiffs also argue that the rule should apply to licenses of an individual publicity rights.plaintiffs cite no authority for this proposition,but merely rely on the same policy arguments and rationales discussed above.
although trademarks and publicity rights share many common features,they are also dissimilar in several ways.for example,while trademark laws protect the trademark owner by fortifying the public expectation regarding the source and quality of goods and services,the right of publicity protects an individual persona from commercial exploitation by others.see mccarthy,supra.however,the distinction most relevant for the purposes of this motion is that a licensor of an individual publicity rights,unlike a trademark licensor,lacks an affirmative statutory or common law duty to police its license and to ensure that the licensee is maintaining sufficient quality controls.see mccarthy,supra.therefore,one of the two policy rationales supporting the extension of the rule to trademark unfettered will prevent the licensor from satisfying his obligation to supervise the not apply to licenses of publicity rights.
nevertheless,a licensor of publicity rights may,in many,in probably all instances and a powerful incentive to supervise the licensee use of those rights.the facts of this case are instructive.if gmp were permitted to glenn miller publicity rights without notifying or obtaining permission from the owner of those,as this court has could glenn miller publicity rights to a third party who used his name or photograph or likeness to promote fascism or pornography.such use presumably would horrify glenn miller if he were alive it also would adversely affect the image of glenn miller that plaintiffs successors to their mother,the original licensor may wish to preserve.however,absent a rule,plaintiffs would have no ability to prevent gmp from sullying their father name and,in fact,would have no right to even know that gmp was doing so.in addition,any disputes about whether gmp could glenn miller right of publicity to a particular third party,or whether a third party was acting beyond the scope of the original license,would trigger litigation.these are undesirable results.
moreover,in practice,many licenses convey both trademark rights and publicity rights.in such cases,the special rules of trademark licensing must be followed in order to preserve the trademark significance of the licensed identity or persona.mccarthy,supra.again,the facts of this case help illustrate this principle.if,without plaintiffs knowledge or permission,gmp could the glenn miller mark to third parties who use the mark to sell products or causes at odds with what glenn miller stood for,the public image of glenn miller persona surely would become tainted in a manner that plaintiffs did not intend.conversely,if gmp could glenn miller publicity rights to third parties who use his name or photograph or likeness to sell a wide variety of products whose quality is not controlled,then the glenn miller mark may become diluted.for these reasons,at least in cases such as this one in which a license conveys both trademark and publicity rights,the rule should be extended to cover publicity rights.
for these reasons,if a jury were to find that at the time helen miller executed the license agreement,she actually had a trademark in glenn miller name to convey,then because the license agreement does not expressly grant gmp unilateral authority to the mark,gmp may not do so.in addition,because the license agreement does not grant gmp express permission to unilaterally glenn miller publicity rights,gmp may not do so.
finally,gmp argues that plaintiffs are estopped from enforcing the terms of any trademark license helen miller conveyed to gmp in the agreement because plaintiffs have failed to affirmatively supervise and control the quality of the goods and services provided under the license.although gmp properly asserts this defense in opposition to plaintiffs motion for summary adjudication,the court chooses to deal with it in the next section regarding gmp motion for summary judgment.
defendant motion for summary judgment.
gmp has filed a for summary judgment,contending that the license agreement and settlement agreement grant gmp the right to sell merchandise bearing the glenn miller orchestra mark the same two agreements grant gmp the right to operate and multiple bands because gmp has the right to sell merchandise and to operate and multiple bands,all of plaintiffs eleven claims for relief necessarily fail and all of plaintiffs claims are barred by the doctrine of laches.although the court rejects gmp first three contentions,it agrees that plaintiffs claims are barred by laches.the court also finds that plaintiffs are estopped from enforcing the terms of any trademark license helen miller conveyed to gmp in the agreement.
gmp lacks the unilateral right to multiple ensembles using the name the glenn miller orchestra.
gmp argues that the only reasonable interpretation of the license agreement and the settlement agreement is that they permit gmp to to an unlimited number of third parties the right to operate orchestras named the glenn miller orchestra.however,because the court has already ruled that a trademark and publicity rights licensee such as gmp may not those rights without the express permission of the licensor,and because it is undisputed that the two agreements do not expressly authorize gmp to,as a matter of law,gmp lacks the unilateral authority to its right to operate a band named the glenn miller orchestra.
there are fact issues concerning any right of gmp to directly operate special units of the glenn miller orchestra and to sell merchandise.
gmp also argues that the only reasonable interpretation of the license agreement and the settlement agreement shows that helen miller and plaintiffs actually granted to gmp the right to itself operate more than one ensemble named the glenn miller orchestra,such as ensembles referred to as special units,and to sell merchandise bearing the glenn miller orchestra mark,including cassette tapes,videotapes,cds,dvds,and polo shirts.gmp relies on the following undisputed evidence in support of its interpretation 
since the operation of special units does not constitute,the rule does not bar gmp from itself operating more than one glenn miller orchestra absent express permission from the millers.
at the hearing on these motions,counsel for plaintiffs represented that plaintiffs object to the sale of this merchandise only to the extent that it bears the glenn miller name,as compared to the glenn miller orchestra mark.plaintiffs have failed to proffer any evidence whatsoever of such merchandise being sold,which itself is a basis to grant gmp motion,in addition to the reasons discussed,infra,concerning laches.
gmp certificate of incorporation provides that gmp is authorized to organize,operate,manage,direct,and control,directly or through others,one or more orchestras or musical organizations,and to manufacture,purchase,sell and generally to trade and deal in and with goods,wares,products and merchandise of every kind,nature and description mackay,exh.a.
at the time helen miller executed the license agreement,she was a shareholder in gmp.see mackay.
the license agreement grants gmp the right to use glenn miller name and likeness in connection with the business activities of glenn miller productions,wolf,exh.
at gmp first board of directors meeting on april,david mackay,the stated the main business of the corporation would be to own and operate a traveling orchestra.see mackay,exh.
during helen miller lifetime,gmp sought and successfully obtained trademark protection for the glenn miller orchestra name,and there is no evidence that helen miller objected.see mackay,exhs.
the settlement agreement contains a clause which provides that steven and jonnie miller agree not to directly or indirectly organize operate or cause to be organized operate a band or orchestra using the name of glenn miller or any facsimile thereof.wolf,exh.d.
gmp has operated special units of the glenn miller orchestra since and plaintiffs never objected.mackay decl,eisenberg,miller depo.gmp has openly sold merchandise bearing the glenn miller orchestra mark at concerts since six of which steven miller attended,and has sold merchandise on its website since september.however,plaintiffs never objected.mackay decl,eisenberg,miller depo.
in contrast to the foregoing facts,which definitely do constitute powerful evidence favoring gmp,the record also shows that for at least years after the execution of the license agreement and during the entirety of helen miller and david mackay,respective lifetimes,gmp did not operate more than one glenn miller orchestra or sell merchandise bearing the glenn miller orchestra mark.see mackay.this lengthy history,which is consistent with the language of item,above a traveling orchestra,would at least permit a jury to infer that helen miller intent in executing the license agreement,and the intent of gmp and the millers when they entered into the settlement agreement,was to have only one orchestra.accordingly,the court denies summary adjudication of this issue.
the relationship between gmp contractual rights and the eleven causes of action asserted in the complaint.
gmp contends that it has the contractual rights to sell glenn miller orchestra merchandise and to operate and multiple glenn miller orchestras,and that because all of plaintiffs claims for relief are based on gmp alleged lack of these rights,all of plaintiffs claims fail as a matter of law.however,because as shown above there are genuine disputes of material fact that preclude the court from determining the scope of gmp contractual rights,the court can not find that all of plaintiffs claims are defeated.
plaintiffs claims are barred by laches.
next,gmp argues that plaintiffs claims which are all based on gmp operation or of ensembles named the glenn miller orchestra and its sale of merchandise are barred by the doctrine of laches,regardless of whether the merchandise contained merely the name glenn miller instead of glenn miller orchestra.see footnote.laches is an equitable time limitation on a party right to bring suit,which is derived from the maxim that those who sleep on their rights,lose them.see kling hallmark cards,cir hot wax,turtle wax,cir.it is well established that laches is a valid defense to lanham act claims for both monetary damages and injunctive relief.see jarrow formulas,nutrition now,cir,cert.denied,d hot wax,at.
in order to succeed on a defense of laches,a defendant must prove both an unreasonable delay by plaintiff in bringing suit,and prejudice to himself.see couveau american airlines,cir per curiam.in considering whether a plaintiff delay was unreasonable,courts consider the length of the delay,measured from the time the plaintiff knew or should have known about his potential cause of action,and whether the plaintiff delay was reasonable,including whether the plaintiff has proffered a legitimate excuse for his delay.see jarrow formulas,at.
if a plaintiff files suit within the applicable period of limitations for his claim,there is a strong presumption that laches does not bar the claims.see jarrow formulas,at.conversely,if any part of the alleged wrongful conduct occurred outside of the limitations period,courts presume that the plaintiff claims are barred by laches.id.at.the parties agree that a four year statute of limitations applies to all of plaintiffs claims.accordingly,the complaint having been filed on january,claims that accrued and were known or in the exercise of reasonable care would have been known as of january,would be barred.
the california statute of limitations for breach of contract claims,statutory right of publicity claims,state trademark infringement dilution claims,and state unfair competition claims is four years.see civ.proc.the lanham act does not contain a statute of limitations,and therefore lanham act claims are governed by the analogous state statute of limitations,which in this case are state trademark infringement and dilution claims under cal.bus.and.see jarrow formulas,at.therefore,the statute of limitations for all of plaintiffs eleven causes of action is four years.
plaintiffs delay in bringing suit.
because all of plaintiffs claims are governed by a four year statute of limitations,the first issue is whether plaintiffs actually knew or should have known that gmp was operating or multiple glenn miller orchestras selling glenn miller orchestra merchandise before january.the court finds that plaintiffs had constructive notice of gmp
