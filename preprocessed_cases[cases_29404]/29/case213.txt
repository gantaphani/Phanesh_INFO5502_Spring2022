stephanie lenz filed suit under f part of the digital millennium copyright act dmca against universal music,universal music publishing,and universal music publishing group collectively universal.she alleges universal misrepresented in a takedown notification that her second home video the video constituted an infringing use of a portion of a composition by the artist known as prince,which universal insists was unauthorized by the law.her claim boils down to a question of whether copyright holders have been abusing the extrajudicial takedown procedures provided for in the dmca by declining to first evaluate whether the content qualifies as fair use.we hold that the statute requires copyright holders to consider fair use before sending a takedown notification,and that failure to do so raises a triable issue as to whether the copyright holder formed a subjective good faith belief that the use was not authorized by law.we affirm the denial of the parties for summary judgment.
founded in may,youtube now owned by google operates a website that hosts content.about youtube,https last visited september.users upload videos directly to the website.id.on february,lenz uploaded to youtube a second home video of her two young children in the family kitchen dancing to the song let go crazy by prince available at https last visited september.she titled the video let go crazy.about four seconds into the video,lenz asks her thirteen son what do you think of the music after which he bobs up and down while holding a push toy.
at the time lenz posted the video,universal was prince publishing administrator responsible for enforcing his copyrights.to accomplish this objective with respect to youtube,robert allen,universal head of business affairs,assigned sean johnson,an assistant in the legal department,to monitor youtube on a daily basis.johnson searched youtube for prince songs and reviewed the video postings returned by his online search query.when reviewing such videos,he evaluated whether they embodied a prince composition by making significant use of the composition,specifically if the song was recognizable,was in a significant portion of the video or was the focus of the video.according to allen,t he general guidelines are that we review the video to ensure that the composition was the focus and if it was we then notify youtube that the video should be removed.
johnson contrasted videos that met this criteria to those that may have had a second or less of a prince song,literally a one line,half line of prince song or were shot in incredibly noisy environments,such as bars,where there could be a prince song playing deep in the background to the point where if there was any prince composition embodied in those videos that it was distorted beyond reasonable recognition.none of the video evaluation guidelines explicitly include consideration of the fair use doctrine.
when johnson reviewed lenz video,he recognized let go crazy immediately.he noted that it played loudly in the background throughout the entire video.based on these details,the video title,and lenz query during the video asking if her son liked the song,he concluded that prince song was very much the focus of the video.as a result,johnson decided the video should be included in a takedown notification sent to youtube that listed more than youtube videos universal believed to be making unauthorized use of prince songs the notice included a good faith belief statement as required by c a v we have a good faith belief that the activity is not authorized by the copyright owner,its agent,or the law.
after receiving the takedown notification,youtube removed the video and sent lenz an email on june,notifying her of the removal.on june,lenz attempted to restore the video by sending a to youtube pursuant to g.after youtube provided this to universal per g b,universal protested the video reinstatement because lenz failed to properly acknowledge that her statement was made under penalty of perjury,as required by g c.universal protest reiterated that the video constituted infringement because there was no record that either she or youtube were ever granted licenses to reproduce,distribute,publicly perform or otherwise exploit the composition.the protest made no mention of fair use.after obtaining pro bono counsel,lenz sent a second on june,which resulted in youtube reinstatement of the video in.
lenz filed the instant action on july,and her amended complaint on august.after the district court dismissed her tortious interference claim and request for declaratory relief,lenz filed her second amended complaint on april,alleging only a claim for misrepresentation under f.the district court denied universal motion to dismiss the action.
on february,the district court granted lenz partial motion for summary judgment on universal six affirmative defenses,including the third affirmative defense that lenz suffered no damages.both parties subsequently moved for summary judgment on lenz f misrepresentation claim.on january,the district court denied both motions in an order that is now before us.
the district court certified its summary judgment order for interlocutory appeal under b,and stayed proceedings in district court pending resolution of the appeal.we granted the parties permission to bring an interlocutory appeal.
we review de novo the district court denial of summary judgment.when doing so,we must determine whether the evidence,viewed in a light most favorable to the party,presents any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the law.warren city of carlsbad,cir.on for summary judgment,we evaluate each motion independently,giving the nonmoving party in each instance the benefit of all reasonable inferences.aclu city of las vegas,cir.

effective on october,the dmca added new sections to existing copyright law by enacting five titles,only one of which is relevant here title ii online copyright infringement liability limitation act now codified in.sections c,f,and g are at the heart of the parties dispute.
section c permits service providers,youtube or google,to avoid copyright infringement liability for storing users content if among other requirements the service provider expeditiously removes or disables access to the content after receiving notification from a copyright holder that the content is infringing.c.section c a sets forth the elements that such a takedown notification must contain.these elements include identification of the copyrighted work,identification of the allegedly infringing material,and,critically,a statement that the copyright holder believes in good faith the infringing material is not authorized by the copyright owner,its agent,or the law.id.c a.the procedures outlined in c are referred to as the dmca takedown procedures.
to avoid liability for disabling or removing content,the service provider must notify the user of the takedown.id.g.the user then has the option of restoring the content by sending a,which must include a statement of good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification id.g c.upon receipt of a valid,the service provider must inform the copyright holder of the and restore the content within not less than,nor more than,business days,unless the service provider receives notice that the copyright holder has filed a lawsuit against the user seeking to restrain the user infringing behavior.id.g b c.the procedures outlined in g are referred to as the dmca procedures.
if an entity abuses the dmca,it may be subject to liability under f.that section provides any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under this section that material or activity is infringing,or that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification,shall be liable for any damages id.f.subsection generally applies to copyright holders and subsection generally applies to users.only subsection is at issue here.
we must first determine whether c a v requires copyright holders to consider whether the potentially infringing material is a fair use of a copyright under before issuing a takedown notification.section c a v requires a takedown notification to include a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner,its agent,or the law.the parties dispute whether fair use is an authorization under the law as contemplated by the statute which is so far as we know an issue of first impression in any circuit across the nation.canons of statutory construction dictate that if the language of a statute is clear,we look no further than that language in determining the statute meaning a court looks to legislative history only if the statute is unclear.united states lewis,cir citations omitted.we agree with the district court and hold that the statute unambiguously contemplates fair use as a use authorized by the law.
fair use is not just excused by the law,it is wholly authorized by the law.in,congress codified the application of a test for determining the fair use of copyrighted works 
notwithstanding the provisions of sections and,the fair use of a copyrighted work,for purposes such as criticism,comment,news reporting,teaching including multiple copies for classroom use,scholarship,or research,is not an infringement of copyright.in determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include 
the purpose and character of the use,including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes 
the nature of the copyrighted work 
the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole and 
the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
the fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.
emphasis added.the statute explains that the fair use of a copyrighted work is permissible because it is a use.
while title of the united states code copyrights does not define the term authorize or authorized,w hen there is no indication that congress intended a specific legal meaning for the term,the court may look to sources such as dictionaries for a definition.united states mohrbacher,cir.black law dictionary defines authorize as.to give legal authority to empower and.to formally approve to sanction.authorize,black law dictionary ed.because both empowers and formally approves the use of copyrighted material if the use constitutes fair use,fair use is authorized by the law within the meaning of c.see also f nothing in this section in any way affects the right of fair use as provided by section emphasis added.
universal sole textual argument is that fair use is not authorized by the law because it is an affirmative defense that excuses otherwise infringing conduct.universal interpretation is incorrect as it conflates two different concepts an affirmative defense that is labeled as such due to the procedural posture of the case,and an affirmative defense that excuses impermissible conduct.supreme court precedent squarely supports the conclusion that fair use does not fall into the latter camp a nyone who makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer of the copyright with respect to such use.sony of am.universal city studios.
given that expressly authorizes fair use,labeling it as an affirmative defense that excuses conduct is a misnomer 
although the traditional approach is to view fair use as an affirmative defense,it is better viewed as a right granted by the copyright act of.originally,as a judicial doctrine without any statutory basis,fair use was an infringement that was excused this is presumably why it was treated as a defense.as a statutory doctrine,however,fair use is not an infringement.thus,since the passage of the act,fair use should no longer be considered an infringement to be excused instead,it is logical to view fair use as a right.regardless of how fair use is viewed,it is clear that the burden of proving fair use is always on the putative infringer.
bateman mnemonics,cir lydia pallas loren,fair use an affirmative defense,congress did not intend fair use to be an affirmative defense a defense,yes,but not an affirmative defense.fair use is therefore distinct from affirmative defenses where a use infringes a copyright,but there is no liability due to a valid excuse,misuse of a copyright,practice management information american medical ass n,cir,and laches,danjaq llc sony,cir.
universal concedes it must give due consideration to other uses authorized by law such as compulsory licenses.the introductory language in for compulsory licenses closely mirrors that in the fair use statute.compare a notwithstanding the provisions of section,it is not an infringement of copyright for a transmitting organization entitled to transmit to the public a performance or display of a work to make no more than one copy or phonorecord of a particular transmission program embodying the performance or display,with id.notwithstanding the provisions of sections and,the fair use of a copyrighted work is not an infringement of copyright.that fair use may be labeled as an affirmative defense due to the procedural posture of the case is no different than labeling a license an affirmative defense for the same reason.compare campbell acuff rose music,stating that fair use is an affirmative defense where the district court converted a motion to dismiss based on fair use into a motion for summary judgment,with a m records,napster,cir napster contends that the district court improperly rejected valid affirmative defenses of implied license.thus,universal argument that it need not consider fair use in addition to compulsory licenses rings hollow.
even if,as universal urges,fair use is classified as an affirmative defense,we hold for the purposes of the dmca fair use is uniquely situated in copyright law so as to be treated differently than traditional affirmative defenses.we conclude that because created a type of use,fair use is authorized by the law and a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under c.
we must next determine if a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether universal knowingly misrepresented that it had formed a good faith belief the video did not constitute fair use.this inquiry lies not in whether a court would adjudge the video as a fair use,but whether universal formed a good faith belief that it was not.contrary to the district court holding,lenz may proceed under an actual knowledge theory,but not under a willful blindness theory.
though lenz argues universal should have known the video qualifies for fair use as a matter of law,our court has already decided a copyright holder need only form a subjective good faith belief that a use is not authorized.rossi motion picture ass of am,cir.in rossi,we explicitly held that the good faith belief requirement in c a v encompasses a subjective,rather than objective standard.id.at.we further held 
in f,congress included an expressly limited cause of action for improper infringement notifications,imposing liability only if the copyright owner notification is a knowing misrepresentation.a copyright owner can not be liable simply because an unknowing mistake is made,even if the copyright owner acted unreasonably in making the mistake.rather,there must be a demonstration of some actual knowledge of misrepresentation on the part of the copyright owner.
id.at citations omitted.neither of these holdings are dictum.see united states johnson,cir en banc w here a panel confronts an issue germane to the eventual resolution of the case,and resolves it after reasoned consideration in a published opinion,that ruling becomes the law of the circuit,regardless of whether doing so is necessary in some strict logical sense.
as a result,lenz request to impose a subjective standard only with respect to factual beliefs and an objective standard with respect to legal determinations is untenable.such a request grafts an objective standard onto c a v directly in contravention to rossi.see rossi,at when enacting the dmca,congress could have easily incorporated an objective standard of reasonableness.the fact that it did not do so indicates an intent to adhere to the subjective standard traditionally associated with a good faith requirement.we therefore judge universal actions by the subjective beliefs it formed about the video.
universal faces liability if it knowingly misrepresented in the takedown notification that it had formed a good faith belief the video was not authorized by the law,did not constitute fair use.here,lenz presented evidence that universal did not form any subjective belief about the video fair use one way or another because it failed to consider fair use at all,and knew that it failed to do so.universal nevertheless contends that its procedures,while not formally labeled consideration of fair use,were tantamount to such consideration.because the dmca requires consideration of fair use prior to sending a takedown notification,a jury must determine whether universal actions were sufficient to form a subjective good faith belief about the video fair use or lack thereof.
to be clear,if a copyright holder ignores or neglects our unequivocal holding that it must consider fair use before sending a takedown notification,it is liable for damages under f.if,however,a copyright holder forms a subjective good faith belief the allegedly infringing material does not constitute fair use,we are in no position to dispute the copyright holder belief even if we would have reached the opposite conclusion.a copyright holder who pays lip service to the consideration of fair use by claiming it formed a good faith belief when there is evidence to the contrary is still subject to f liability.disney,hotfile,cv,wl,at,denying summary judgment of f counterclaim due to sufficient evidence in the record to suggest that plaintiff warner intentionally targeted files it knew it had no right to remove rosen hosting,d,denying summary judgment of f counterclaim where the takedown notification listed four url links that did not contain content matching the description of the purportedly infringed material online policy grp.diebold,d,t here is no genuine issue of fact that diebold knew and indeed that it specifically intended that its letters to opg and swarthmore would result in prevention of publication of that content the fact that diebold never actually brought suit against any alleged infringer suggests strongly that diebold sought to use the dmca safe harbor provisions which were designed to protect isps,not copyright holders as a sword to suppress publication of embarrassing content rather than as a shield to protect its intellectual property.
in order to comply with the strictures of c a v,a copyright holder consideration of fair use need not be searching or intensive.we follow rossi guidance that formation of a subjective good faith belief does not require investigation of the allegedly infringing content.see at.we are mindful of the pressing crush of voluminous infringing content that copyright holders face in a digital age.but that does not excuse a failure to comply with the procedures outlined by congress.lenz,d at i n the majority of cases,a consideration of fair use prior to issuing a takedown notice will not be so complicated as to jeopardize a copyright owner ability to respond rapidly to potential infringements.the dmca already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing material prior to sending a takedown notice indeed,it would be impossible to meet any of the requirements of section c without doing so.a consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review.
we note,without passing judgment,that the implementation of computer algorithms appears to be a valid and good faith middle ground for processing a plethora of content while still meeting the dmca requirements to somehow consider fair use.hotfile,wl,at the court is unaware of any decision to date that actually addressed the need for human review,and the statute does not specify how belief of infringement may be formed or what knowledge may be chargeable to the notifying entity.for example,consideration of fair use may be sufficient if copyright holders utilize computer programs that automatically identify for takedown notifications content where the video track matches the video track of a copyrighted work submitted by a content owner the audio track matches the audio track of that same copyrighted work and nearly the entirety is comprised of a single copyrighted work.brief for the org.for transformative works,public knowledge int l documentary ass as amici curiae supporting appellee at citing the electronic frontier foundation website link unavailable.
copyright holders could then employ individuals like johnson to review the minimal remaining content a computer program does not cull.see brief for the recording indus.ass of am.as amici curiae supporting appellants at t he riaa has an entire department dedicated to identifying infringement and issuing takedown requests.see also hotfile,wl,at.during oral argument universal explained that service providers now use screening algorithms.however,we need not definitively decide the issue here because universal did not proffer any evidence that at the time it sent the takedown notification to lenz it used a computer program to identify potentially infringing content.
we hold the willful blindness doctrine may be used to determine whether a copyright holder knowingly materially misrepresent ed that it held a good faith belief the offending activity was not a fair use.see c a v,f.t he willful blindness doctrine may be applied,in appropriate circumstances,to demonstrate knowledge or awareness of specific instances of infringement under the dmca.viacom int l,youtube,cir interpreting how a party can establish the actual knowledge a subjective belief required by c a i see also umg recordings,shelter capital partners llc,cir of course,a service provider can not willfully bury its head in the sand to avoid obtaining such specific knowledge.citing viacom,at.but,based on the specific facts presented during summary judgment,we reject the district court conclusion that lenz may proceed to trial under a willful blindness theory.
to demonstrate willful blindness a plaintiff must establish two factors the defendant must subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists and the defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.global tech appliances,seb.under this formulation,a willfully blind defendant is one who takes deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of wrongdoing and who can almost be said to have actually known the critical facts.id.at.to meet the global tech test,lenz must demonstrate a genuine issue as to whether before sending the takedown notification universal subjectively believed there was a high probability that the video constituted fair use,and took deliberate actions to avoid learning of this fair use.
on summary judgment lenz failed to meet a threshold showing of the first factor.to make such a showing,lenz must provide evidence from which a juror could infer that universal was aware of a high probability the video constituted fair use.see united states yi,cir.but she failed to provide any such evidence.the district court therefore correctly found that lenz does not present evidence suggesting universal subjectively believed either that there was a high probability any given video might make fair use of a prince composition or her video in particular made fair use of prince song let go crazy.yet the district court improperly denied universal motion for summary judgment on the willful blindness theory because universal has not shown that it lacked a subjective belief.by finding blame with universal inability to show that it lacked a subjective belief,the district court improperly required universal to meet its burden of persuasion,even though lenz had failed to counter the initial burden of production that universal successfully carried.see celotex catrett,nissan fire marine ins.fritz,cir.lenz may not therefore proceed to trial on a willful blindness theory.
section f provides for the recovery of any damages,including costs and attorneys fees,incurred by the alleged infringer who is injured by such misrepresentation,as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing f.we hold a plaintiff may seek recovery of nominal damages for an injury incurred as a result of a f misrepresentation.
universal incorrectly asserts that lenz must demonstrate she incurred actual monetary loss.section k provides a definition for monetary relief as damages,costs,attorneys fees,and any other form of monetary payment.the term monetary relief appears in a,b,c,and d,but is notably absent from f.as a result,the damages an alleged infringer may recover under f from any person are broader than monetary relief united states james,congress choice of the language any damage undercuts a narrow construction,abrogated on other grounds by cent.green united states.because congress specified the recovery of any damages,we reject universal contention that congress did not indicate its intent to depart from the common law presumption that a misrepresentation plaintiff must have suffered a monetary loss.see keene united states,where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.quotation omitted.
lenz may seek recovery of nominal damages due to an unquantifiable harm suffered as a result of universal actions the dmca is akin to a statutorily created intentional tort whereby an individual may recover nominal damages for a knowingly material misrepresent ation under this section.f memphis cmty.sch.dist.stachura,we have repeatedly noted that creates a species of tort liability in favor of persons who are deprived of rights,privileges,or immunities secured to them by the constitution.accordingly,when plaintiffs seek damages for violations of constitutional rights,the level of damages is ordinarily determined according to principles derived from the common law of torts.quotation and citations omitted.
in a number of common law actions associated with intentional torts,the violation of the plaintiff right has generally been regarded as a kind of legal damage in itself.the plaintiff who proves an intentional physical tort to the person or to property can always recover nominal damages.dan dobbs et,the law of torts ed.the tort need not be physical in order to recover nominal damages.defamation,for example,permits the recovery of nominal damages 
a nominal damage award can be justified in a tort action only if there is some reason for awarding a judgment in favor of a claimant who has not proved or does not claim a compensable loss with sufficient certainty to justify a recovery of compensatory or actual damages.there may be such a reason in an action for defamation,since a nominal damage award serves the purpose of vindicating the plaintiff character by a verdict of the jury that establishes the falsity of the defamatory matter.
page keeton et,prosser and keeton on torts,at ed.also,individuals may recover nominal damages for trespass to land,even though the trespasser presence on the land causes no harm to the land or its possessor restatement second of torts cmts.d,e.
the district court therefore properly concluded in its order 
the use of any damages suggests strongly congressional intent that recovery be available for damages even if they do not amount to substantial economic damages requiring a plaintiff who can show that the copyright holder knowingly misrepresented its subjective good faith to demonstrate in addition not only that she suffered damages but also that those damages were economic and substantial would vitiate the deterrent effect of the statute.
lenz universal music,no.c jf,wl,at.relying on this opinion,the southern district of florida held the same.hotfile,wl,at t he court observes that the quantity of economic damages to hotfile system is necessarily difficult to measure with precision and has led to much disagreement between the parties and their experts.notwithstanding this difficulty,the fact of injury has been shown,and hotfile expert can provide the jury with a basis to assess damages.
we agree that lenz may vindicate her statutorily created rights by seeking nominal damages.because a jury has not yet determined whether lenz will prevail at trial,we need not decide the scope of recoverable damages,whether she may recover expenses following the initiation of her f suit or pro bono costs and attorneys fees,both of which arose as a result of the injury incurred.
copyright holders can not shirk their duty to consider in good faith and prior to sending a takedown notification whether allegedly infringing material constitutes fair use,a use which the dmca plainly contemplates as authorized by the law.that this step imposes responsibility on copyright holders is not a reason for us to reject it.consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania,a ny increased burdens imposed on the commission as a result of its compliance with the consumer product safety act were intended by congress in striking an appropriate balance between the interests of consumers and the need for fairness and accuracy with respect to information disclosed by the commission.thus,petitioners claim that the commission compliance with the requirements of the act will impose undue burdens on the commission is properly addressed to congress,not to this court.we affirm the district court order denying the parties for summary judgment.
affirmed.each party shall bear its own costs.
i concur in all but part of the majority opinion,and concur in the judgment.because i disagree with the majority approach to three issues,i respectfully dissent from part.
first,i question whether f directly prohibits a party from misrepresenting that it has formed a good faith belief that a work is subject to the fair use doctrine.i construe the plain text of the statute to prohibit misrepresentations that a work is infringing,not misrepresentations about the party diligence in forming its belief that the work is infringing.second,i disagree that there is any material dispute about whether universal considered fair use.because universal did not consider fair use,it may be held liable for knowingly misrepresenting that the video was infringing,if it should be determined that the video is a fair use.universal misrepresentation,if any,was knowing because universal knew it had not considered fair use,and therefore knew it lacked a basis to conclude that the video was infringing.third,i do not believe that the willful blindness doctrine applies where,as here,a party has failed to consider fair use and affirmatively misrepresents that a work is infringing.
i fully agree with the majority conclusion that c a v requires copyright holders to consider whether potentially infringing material is a fair use before issuing a takedown notice.as the majority opinion explains,a takedown notice must contain a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner,its agent,or the law.c a v.because fair use of copyrighted material is not an infringement of copyright,such use is authorized by the law.see id.therefore,in order to form a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the law,id.c a v,a party must consider the doc
