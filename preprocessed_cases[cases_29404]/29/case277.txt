california governor schwarzenegger and california attorney general brown the state appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of video software dealers association and entertainment software association plaintiffs,and the denial of the state for summary judgment plaintiffs filed suit for declaratory relief seeking to invalidate california civil code sections the act,which impose restrictions and a labeling requirement on the sale or rental of violent video games to minors,on the grounds that the act violates rights guaranteed by the first and fourteenth amendments 
we hold that the act,as a presumptively invalid restriction on speech,is subject to strict scrutiny and not the variable obscenity standard from ginsberg new york,d.applying strict scrutiny,we hold that the act violates rights protected by the first amendment because the state has not demonstrated a compelling interest,has not tailored the restriction to its alleged compelling interest,and there exist means that would further the state expressed interests.additionally,we hold that the act labeling requirement is unconstitutionally compelled speech under the first amendment because it does not require the disclosure of purely factual information but compels the carrying of the state controversial opinion.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to plaintiffs and its denial of the state.because we affirm the district court on these grounds,we do not reach two of plaintiffs challenges to the act first,that the language of the act is unconstitutionally vague,and,second,that the act violates plaintiffs rights under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.
on october,governor schwarzenegger signed into law assembly bill ab,codified at civil code the act states that a person may not sell or rent a video game that has been labeled as a violent video game to a minor.cal.a violators are subject to a civil penalty of up to.id.at.
central to this appeal,the act defines a violent video game as follows 
d violent video game means a video game in which the range of options available to a player includes killing,maiming,dismembering,or sexually assaulting an image of a human being,if those acts are depicted in the game in a manner that does either of the following 
a comes within all of the following descriptions 
i a reasonable person,considering the game as a whole,would find appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors.
ii it is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the community as to what is suitable for minors.
iii it causes the game,as a whole,to lack serious literary,artistic,political,or scientific value for minors.
b enables the player to virtually inflict serious injury upon images of human beings or characters with substantially human characteristics in a manner which is especially heinous,cruel,or depraved in that it involves torture or serious physical abuse to the victim.
id.at d borrowing language from federal death penalty jury instructions,the act also defines the terms cruel,depraved,heinous,and serious physical abuse,and states that p ertinent factors in determining whether a killing depicted in a video game is especially heinous,cruel,or depraved include infliction of gratuitous violence upon the victim beyond that necessary to commit the killing,needless mutilation of the victim body,and helplessness of the victim.id.at d.
the act also imposes a labeling requirement.it requires that each violent video game imported into or distributed in california must be labeled with a solid white outlined in black,which shall appear on the front face of the game package and be no less than inches by inches in size.id.at.
states that the state of california has two compelling interests that support the act preventing violent,aggressive,and antisocial behavior and preventing psychological or neurological harm to minors who play violent video games.also finds and declares that 
a exposing minors to depictions of violence in video games,including sexual and heinous violence,makes those minors more likely to experience feelings of aggression,to experience a reduction of activity in the frontal lobes of the brain,and to exhibit violent antisocial or aggressive behavior.
b even minors who do not commit acts of violence suffer psychological harm from prolonged exposure to violent video games.
the state included in the excerpts of record several hundred pages of material on which the legislature purportedly relied in passing the act.while many of the materials are social science studies on the asserted impact of violent video games on children,other documents are varied and include legal analyses,general background papers,position papers.craig anderson,whose work is central to the state arguments in this case,is listed as an author of roughly half of the works included in the bibliography.
the content of the video games potentially affected by the act is diverse.some of the games to which the act might apply are unquestionably violent by everyday standards,digitally depicting what most people would agree amounts to murder,torture,or mutilation.for example,the state submitted a videotape that contains several vignettes from the games grand theft auto vice city,postal,and duke nukem,which demonstrate the myriad ways in which characters can kill or injure victims or adversaries the record also contains descriptions of several games,some of which are based on popular novels or motion pictures,which are potentially covered by the act.many of these games have extensive plot lines that involve or parallel historical events,mirror common fictional plots,or place the player in a position to evaluate and make moral choices.
the video game industry has in place a voluntary rating system to provide consumers and retailers information about video game content.the entertainment software rating board esrb,an independent,body established by the entertainment software association,rates the content of video games that are voluntarily submitted.esrb assigns each game one of six ratings,ranging from early childhood to adults only.it also assigns to each game one of roughly thirty content descriptors,which include animated blood,blood and gore,cartoon violence,crude humor,fantasy violence,intense violence,language,suggestive themes,and sexual violence.
on october,before the act took effect,plaintiffs filed suit against the governor,the attorney general,and three city and county defendants,all in their official capacities,for declaratory relief against the act on the grounds that it violated and the first and fourteenth amendments.plaintiffs argued that the act unconstitutionally restricted freedom of expression on its face based on content regulation and the labeling requirement,was unconstitutionally vague,and violated equal protection.
the district court granted plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction.video software dealers ass schwarzenegger,d.subsequently,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted plaintiffs motion and denied the state.see video software dealers ass schwarzenegger,no,wl.the district court summary judgment order invalidated the act under strict scrutiny,and did not reach plaintiffs claims regarding vagueness,equal protection,or the act labeling requirement.the district court permanently enjoined enforcement of the act.the state timely appealed.

we first address plaintiffs argument that the entire act should be invalidated based on the state concession on appeal that the alternate definition of violent video game found in section d b is unconstitutionally broad.the state counters that the act is saved by the severability clause in civil code,which states the provisions of this title are severable.if any provision of this title or its application is held to be invalid,that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.we hold that the act is not wholly invalid as a result of the state concession.
we look to state law to determine the effect of the severability clause.qwest commc ns city of berkeley,cir,overruled on other grounds,sprint telephony pcs,county of san diego,cir en banc.under california law,there is a general presumption in favor a statute constitutionality.ex parte blaney,cal d,cal t he general presumption of constitutionality,fortified by the express statement of a severability clause,normally calls for sustaining any valid portion of statute unconstitutional in part.an invalid portion of a statute

section d b is grammatically and functionally separable because,as an alternate definition of violent video game,it can be removed from the act without affecting the wording or function of the act other provisions.plaintiffs contend,however,that such a deletion does not account for the phrase does either of the following in section d,which is the language to the alternate definitions of violent video game,and that retaining this phrase results in a conundrum and grammatical error.plaintiffs concerns are accounted for by the simultaneous deletion of the phrase does either of the following.although some california cases speak in general terms of separability as a whole,see,jevne,d,at,the california supreme court has also evaluated grammatical and functional separability with respect to whether the valid and invalid portions of a statute or initiative can be separated by paragraph,sentence,clause,phrase,or even single words.santa barbara sch.dist.superior court of santa barbara county,cal d,see also ex parte blaney,at accord schweitzer westminster,th,d.here,the phrase does either of the following can be cleanly stricken without doing violence to the rest of the act or impermissibly reading into the statute any exceptions or qualifications.see fort civ.serv.comm of alameda county,cal d,
sections d b,d,and d are also volitionally separable.we must ask whether the inclusion of these sections was of critical importance to passage of the act and whether the act would have been adopted by the legislative body had it foreseen the partial invalidation of the statute.sonoma county org.of pub.employees county of sonoma,cal d,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.evidence in the record indicates that the legislature included sections d b,d and d in the act with the express goal of avoiding the constitutional pitfalls identified in video software dealers association maleng,d.an assembly judiciary committee mandatory information worksheet to and a research summary to both indicate that these detailed definition sections were included in the act for the purpose of avoiding the result in maleng,where a washington district court struck down a state statute,in part,because it was not narrowly tailored.further,the assembly third reading to also discusses the tailoring issues in maleng,and notes that the act regulates the sale of only those games that contain the most heinous,cruel or depraved acts of violence.nonetheless,the record does not persuade us that sections d b,d and d were critical to the passage of the act.the fact that the legislature included an alternate definition for violent video game designed to help the act withstand a constitutional challenge does not necessarily indicate that it would not have passed the act but for the inclusion of these sections.accordingly,in light of california presumption in favor of retaining constitutional parts of statutes,we conclude that the act is not wholly invalid as a result of the state concession.
our next task is to determine what level of scrutiny to apply in reviewing the act prohibitions.existing case law indicates that minors are entitled to a significant measure of first amendment protections,that regulations are presumptively invalid and subject to strict scrutiny,and that if less restrictive means for achieving a state compelling interest are available,they must be used.the state argument on appeal,that we should not apply strict scrutiny and instead should apply a variable obscenity standard from ginsberg new york,d,raises a question of first impression in this circuit.
the supreme court has stated that minors are entitled to a significant measure of first amendment protection,and only in relatively narrow and circumstances may government bar public dissemination of protected materials to them.erznoznik city of jacksonville,d citations omitted.the state does not contest that video games are a form of expression protected by the first amendment see interactive digital software ass louis,cir holding that violent video games are a protected form of speech maleng,d at same.it is also undisputed that the act seeks to restrict expression in video games based on its content.see ctr.for reform,los angeles county sheriff dep t,cir a law is if either the main purpose in enacting it was to suppress or exalt speech of a certain content,or it differentiates based on the content of speech on its face.citation and internal quotation marks omitted interactive digital software ass n,at holding that an ordinance that applied to graphically violent video games was a restriction.
regulations are presumptively invalid.city of paul,d.we ordinarily review restrictions on protected expression under strict scrutiny,and thus,to survive,the act must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interest.united states playboy entm t group,d.if a less restrictive alternative would serve the government purpose,the legislature must use that alternative.see also sable commc ns of,fcc,d the government may regulate the content of constitutionally protected speech in order to promote a compelling interest if it chooses the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest.reno aclu,d finding relevant the fact that a reasonably effective method by which parents could prevent children from accessing internet material which parents believed to be inappropriate will soon be widely available.
the state,however,urges us to depart from this framework because the act concerns minors.it argues that we should analyze the act restrictions under what has been called the variable obscenity or obscenity as to minors standard first mentioned in ginsberg,d.in essence,the state argues that the court reasoning in ginsberg that a state could prohibit the sale of material to minors that it could not ban from distribution to adults should be extended to materials containing violence.this presents an invitation to the boundaries of the legal concept of obscenity under the first amendment.
in ginsberg,the court held that new york state could prohibit the sale of material to minors that was defined by statute as obscene because of its appeal to minors.id.at.therefore,the state could prohibit the sale of girlie magazines to minors regardless of the fact that the material was not considered obscene for adults.id.at.the court stated that t o sustain the power to exclude material defined as obscenity by the statute requires only that we be able to say that it was not irrational for the legislature to find that exposure to material condemned by the statute is harmful to minors.id.at.the court offered two justifications for applying this rational basis standard that constitutional interpretation has consistently recognized that the parents claim to authority in their own household to direct the rearing of their children is basic in the structure of our society and the state independent interest in the of its youth.id.at.
the state suggests that the justifications underlying ginsberg should apply to the regulation of violent content as well as sexually explicit material.the assertion,however,fails when we consider the category of material to which the ginsberg decision applies and the first amendment principles in which that decision was rooted.
ginsberg is specifically rooted in the court first amendment obscenity jurisprudence,which relates to violent content,which is presumably protected by the first amendment.see at.ginsberg explicitly states that the new york statute under review simply adjusts the definition of obscenity to social realities by permitting the appeal of this type of material to be assessed in term of the sexual interests of such minors.id.at.citation,internal quotation marks,and alterations omitted.the definition of obscenity that ginsberg adjusted was the court obscenity test announced in roth united states,which dealt with obscene materials defined with reference to sex,d discussing the nature of obscenity at length and stating,among other things,that o bscene material is material which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest.the ginsberg court applied a rational basis test to the statute at issue because it placed the magazines at issue within a of as to had been determined to be not protected by the first amendment,and it did not create an entirely new category of expression excepted from first amendment protection.the state,in essence,asks us to create a new category of material based on its depiction of violence.
the supreme court has carefully limited obscenity to sexual content.although the court has wrestled with the precise formulation of the legal test by which it classifies obscene material,it has consistently addressed obscenity with reference to material.such was the case in roth and memoirs massachusetts,d,which modified roth.and though it ginsberg,the court in miller california expressly cabined the first amendment concept of obscenity in terms of sexual material,d w e now confine the permissible scope of such regulation to works which depict or describe sexual conduct.
circuit courts have resisted attempts to broaden obscenity to cover violent material as well as material.in american amusement machine association kendrick,which involved a video game restriction that mixed the regulation of sexual and violent material,the seventh circuit discussed why v iolence and obscenity are distinct categories of objectionable depiction,explaining that obscenity is concerned with offensiveness,whereas ordinances like the one at issue in kendrick and here are concerned with conduct or harm,cir,cert.denied,d in video software dealers association webster,the eighth circuit held that videos that contain violence but not depictions or descriptions of sexual conduct can not be obscene,cir obscenity encompasses only expression that depict s or describe s sexual conduct citing miller,at.likewise,in eclipse enterprises,gulotta,the second circuit declined to place trading cards which depicted heinous crime that was allegedly harmful to minors in the category of unprotected obscenity,cir.further,in james meow media,the sixth circuit,in discussing excessively violent movies and video game material,decline d to extend its obscenity jurisprudence to violent,instead of sexually explicit,material,cir.
finally,we note that the ginsberg court suggested its intent to place a substantive limit on its holding.it stated 
we have no occasion in this case to consider the impact of the guarantees of freedom of expression upon the totality of the relationship of the minor and the state.it is enough for the purposes of this case that we inquire whether it was constitutionally impermissible for new york to accord minors under a more restricted right than that assured to adults to judge and determine for themselves what sex material they may read or see.
ginsberg,at.citation omitted.though not the clearest of disclaimers,this language telegraphs that the court concern in ginsberg was with the relationship between the state and minors with respect to a certain subject matter sex material as it relates to the interests of minors.
in light of our reading of ginsberg and the cases from our sister circuits,we decline the state invitation to apply the ginsberg rationale to materials depicting violence,and hold that strict scrutiny remains the applicable review standard our decision is consistent with the decisions of several other courts that have addressed and rejected the argument that the ginsberg standard be extended from the field of content to violence in video games.see interactive digital software ass n,at kendrick,at entm t software ass granholm,d,maleng,d at.at oral argument,the state confirmed that it is asking us to boldly go where no court has gone before.we decline the state entreaty to extend the reach of ginsberg and thereby redefine the concept of obscenity under the first amendment.
accordingly,we review the act prohibitions under strict scrutiny.as noted above,c regulations are presumptively invalid,at,and to survive the act must be narrowly tailored to promote a compelling government interest.playboy entm t group,at.further,i f a less restrictive alternative would serve the government purpose,the legislature must use that alternative.id.
the legislature stated that it had two compelling interests in passing the act preventing violent,aggressive,and antisocial behavior and preventing psychological or neurological harm to minors who play violent video games.although there was some early confusion over whether the state was relying on both of these interests,the state subsequently clarified that t he physical and psychological of children is the concern of the act,as distinguished from the interest of protecting third parties from violent behavior.the state focus is on the actual harm to the brain of the child playing the video game.therefore,we will not assess the legislature purported interest in the prevention of violent,aggressive,and antisocial behavior.
the supreme court has recognized that there is a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological of minors.sable commc ns of,at.see also entm t software ass swanson,cir interactive digital software ass n,at nunez by nunez city of san diego,cir maleng,d at.notwithstanding this abstract compelling interest,when the government seeks to restrict speech i t must demonstrate that the recited harms are real,not merely conjectural,and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.turner broad,fcc,d plurality op.swanson,at interactive digital software ass n,at.although we must accord deference to the predictive judgments of the legislature,our obligation is to assure that,in formulating its judgments,the legislature has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence.turner broad,fcc,d citations and quotation marks omitted see also playboy entm t group,at.this is not to suggest that a record must be compiled in every case or that the government must delay in acting to address a real problem but the government must present more than anecdote and supposition.the question is whether an actual problem has been proved.
in evaluating the state asserted interests,we must distinguish the state interest in protecting minors from actual psychological or neurological harm from the state interest in controlling minors thoughts.the latter is not legitimate.the supreme court has warned that the 
government can not constitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of controlling a person private thoughts.first amendment freedoms are most in danger when the government seeks to control thought or to justify its laws for that impermissible end.the right to think is the beginning of freedom,and speech must be protected from the government because speech is the beginning of thought.
ashcroft,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in kendrick,the seventh circuit commented on a psychological harm rationale in the violent video game context 
violence has always been and remains a central interest of humankind and a recurrent,even obsessive theme of culture both high and low.it engages the interest of children from an early age,as anyone familiar with the classic fairy tales collected by grimm,andersen,and perrault is aware.to shield children right up to the age of from exposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be quixotic,but deforming it would leave them unequipped to cope with the world as we know it.
at see also interactive digital software ass n,at speech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription can not be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.citation and quotation marks omitted.because the government may not restrict speech in order to control a minor thoughts,we focus on the state psychological harm rationale in terms of some actual effect on minors psychological health.
whether the state interest in preventing psychological or neurological harm to minors is legally compelling depends on the evidence the state proffers of the effect of video games on minors.although the legislature is entitled to some deference,the courts are required to review whether the legislature has drawn reasonable inferences from the evidence presented.see turner broad,at.here,the state relies on a number of studies in support of its argument that there is substantial evidence of a causal effect between minors playing violent video games and actual psychological harm.
the state relies heavily on the work of craig anderson,pointing to anderson updated called an update on the effects of playing violent video games craig anderson,an update on the effects of playing violent video games,adolescence.this article states that it reveals that exposure to violent video games is significantly linked to increases in aggressive behaviour,aggressive cognition,aggressive affect,and cardiovascular arousal,and to decreases in helping behaviour.even upon lay review,however,the disclaimers in this article,alone,significantly undermine the inferences drawn by the state in support of its psychological harm rationale first,anderson remarks on the relative paucity of the video game literature and concedes that the violent video game literature is not sufficiently large to conduct a detailed of the specific methodological features of other studies,many of which were themselves flawed.second,he further states that t here is not a large enough body of samples for truly sensitive tests of potential age difference in susceptibility to violent video game effects,and jettisons his exploration of the effect of age differences,versus.it appears that he abandoned the age aspect of the study,in part,because there was a hint that the aggressive behaviour results might be slightly larger for the and over group.he concludes the with the admission that there is a glaring empirical gap in video game violence research due to the lack of longitudinal studies.
thus,anderson research has readily admitted flaws that undermine its support of the state interest in regulating video games sales and rentals to minors,perhaps most importantly its retreat from the study of the psychological effects of video games as related to the age of the person studied although not dispositive of this case,we note that other courts have either rejected anderson research or found it insufficient to establish a causal link between violence in video games and psychological harm.see kendrick,at granholm,d at entm t software ass hatch,d,blagojevich,d at.
the state also relies on a study of the effects of video game violence on adolescents,conducted by douglas gentile,which studied eighth and ninth graders and concluded that a dolescents who expose themselves to greater amounts of video game violence were more hostile and reported getting into more arguments and fights and performing poorly in school.douglas gentile et,the effects of violent video game habits on adolescent hostility,aggressive behaviors,and school performance,adolescence.the extent to which this study supports the state position is suspect for similar reasons as anderson work.first,this study states that due to its correlational nature it could not directly answer the following question are young adolescents more hostile and aggressive because they expose themselves to media violence,or do previously hostile adolescents prefer violent media second,this study largely relates to the player violent or aggressive behavior toward,as noted above,is not the interest relied on by the state than the psychological or neurological harm to the player.moreover,the study glaringly states that i t is important to note that this study is limited by its correlational nature.inferences about causal direction should be viewed with caution emphasis added.finally,gentile study suggests that a dditional experimental and longitudinal research is needed.
additionally,the state relies on a study by jeanne funk for the proposition that video games can lead to desensitization to violence in minors.jeanne funk et,violence exposure in,video games,television,movies,and the internet is there desensitization,adolescence.like the others,this study presents only an attenuated path between video game violence and desensitization.it specifically disclaims that it is based on correlation principles and that causality was not studied.
finally,the state relies on a press release from indiana university regarding the purported connection between violent video games and altered brain activity in the frontal lobe.press release,indiana university school of medicine,aggressive youths,violent video games trigger unusual brain activity.the research described,conducted in part by kronenberger,has been criticized by courts that have reviewed it in depth.see blagojevich,d at kronenberger conceded that his studies only demonstrate a correlative,not a causal,relationship between high media violence exposure and children who experience behavioral disorders or decreased brain activity granholm,d at kronenberger research not only fails to provide concrete evidence that there is a connection between violent media and aggressive behavior,it also fails to distinguish between video games and other forms of media.
in sum,the evidence presented by the state does not support the legislature purported interest in preventing psychological or neurological harm.nearly all of the research is based on correlation,not evidence of causation,and most of the studies suffer from significant,admitted flaws in methodology as they relate to the state claimed interest.none of the research establishes or suggests a causal link between minors playing violent video games and actual psychological or neurological harm,and inferences to that effect would not be reasonable.in fact,some of the studies caution against inferring causation.although we do not require the state to demonstrate a scientific certainty,the state must come forward with more than it has.as a result,the state has not met its burden to demonstrate a compelling interest.
even if we assume that the state demonstrated a compelling interest in preventing psychological or neurological harm,the state still has the burden of demonstrating that the act is narrowly tailored to further that interest,and that there are no less restrictive alternatives that would further the act.playboy entm t group,at.we hold that the state has not demonstrated that less restrictive alternative means are not available.
instead of focusing its argument on the possibility of less restrictive means,the state obscures the analysis by focusing on the most effective means,which it asserts is the one thousand dollar penalty imposed for each violation.specifically,the state argues that the esrb rating system,a voluntary system without the force of law or civil penalty,is not a alternative means of furthering the legislature purported compelling interest.acknowle
