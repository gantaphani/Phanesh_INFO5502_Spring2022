in this appeal,we must decide whether the district court properly ordered the disclosure of privileged communications under the exception.we hold that in a civil case the district court must allow both the party seeking discovery of the communications and the party asserting the privilege to present evidence relevant to the privilege and the exception,and must weigh that evidence before ordering outright disclosure.we further hold that in a civil case,when the district court is asked to order outright disclosure,the burden of proof on the party seeking to vitiate the privilege is preponderance of the evidence.we conclude the appellees in this case have failed to make the requisite evidentiary showing to support a finding that the exception applies.we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
this appeal arises out of litigation over alleged copyright infringement by various parties who funded napster,the online service.in december and january,plaintiffs jerry leiber et and capitol records et,as well as other music industry players,sued napster for copyright infringement.leiber et and capitol records et collectively appellees are now appellees in this court.
appellees alleged that napster service enabled the unauthorized reproduction and distribution of copyrighted digital music files.see a m records,napster,d,aff in part,rev in part,cir as amended.in july,the district court entered a preliminary injunction requiring napster to search for,and remove from its service,files that rights holders had identified as infringing.a m records,at.we stayed the preliminary injunction two days later,but substantially affirmed in february.id.at.napster service was shut down in july after napster failed to comply with the terms of a modified preliminary injunction.see a m records,napster,no.c,wl,aff,cir.napster filed for bankruptcy in june,and its ultimate liability for copyright infringement was never adjudicated.
appellant bertelsmann ag is a german media conglomerate.between october and october,bertelsmann loaned napster a total of about million to fund its anticipated transition to a licensed digital music distribution system.however,napster failed fully to launch the new licensed system before declaring bankruptcy.bertelsmann did not obtain napster assets in the bankruptcy proceedings.
in april,appellees and others separately filed suit against bertelsmann in federal court in the southern district of new york,claiming that bertelsmann was vicariously and contributorily liable for copyright infringement by napster napster users.appellees charged that by lending napster millions of dollars bertelsmann assumed control over napster service,or prolonged its allegedly infringing operations,in order to avoid dispersion of napster estimated million users before the anticipated new licensed digital music distribution system was functional.the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation subsequently transferred appellees suits against bertelsmann to the northern district of california,where the in re napster.copyright litigation was pending.
in july,bertelsmann moved to dismiss appellees suits for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.umg recordings,bertelsmann ag.bertelsmann argued as a matter of law that merely lending money to an alleged copyright infringer can not give rise to liability under either a vicarious or contributory copyright infringement theory.id.at.bertelsmann further argued that its loan did not give it the ability to control napster.
the district court denied bertelsmann motion to dismiss,holding that appellees had stated a claim by alleging bertelsmann control of napster operations.it explained that 
bertelsmann and motions to dismiss are premised on the theory that plaintiffs have accused them only of what might be considered aiding and abetting napster copyright violations,providing napster with additional funding that allowed it to continue operating.according to defendants,plaintiffs thus state claims for what this court has termed tertiary infringement vicarious or contributory assistance to a vicarious or contributory infringer,here towards which this court has previously expressed disfavor defendants have not properly characterized plaintiffs complaints.rather than alleging that defendants merely supplied napster with necessary funding serving as a but for cause of napster subsequent activities plaintiffs have specifically accused defendants of assuming control over napster operations and directing the infringing activities that gave rise to the original napster litigation capitol records complaint alleges essentially identical facts as other plaintiffs at least as early as september,bertelsmann began preparing to operate the napster system,and by at least as early as october,the napster system was firmly under the control of bertelsmann.bertelsmann continued to operate the napster system and to allow its users to copy millions of protected recordings 
id.at internal citations omitted.the district court declined to pass upon the question of whether mere financial support of a contributing and vicarious infringer without more direct involvement could give rise to liability.id.at.
pretrial discovery continued after the district court denied bertelsmann motion to dismiss.on november,appellees moved to compel bertelsmann to produce all communications related to a million loan,convertible to equity,that bertelsmann made to napster on october,while napster was appealing the initial preliminary injunction.appellees contended that beginning in september,when drafting of the loan documents began,bertelsmann had engaged in a continuing scheme to defraud the courts.they argued that the exception to the privilege applied to these communications,relying on two theories of fraud under california civil code fraudulent deceit.
first,appellees contended that bertelsmann loan to napster was not in fact a loan,but was,rather,cash tendered in exchange for an equity stake in the company.according to appellees,bertelsmann used its lawyers to create sham loan documents that were designed to disguise what was,in fact,a purchase of control of napster.appellees alleged that bertelsmann,anticipating future copyright infringement litigation,intended to use the sham loan documents to deceive the courts into concluding that it was not an equity owner and therefore was not liable for the actions of napster.
in support of this sham loan theory of fraud,appellees pointed to several pieces of circumstantial evidence.they cited internal bertelsmann documents showing that the company executives and outside counsel sought to structure the transaction in such a way as to avoid copyright liability.in one email,counsel for bertelsmann stated that the loan has to look like a loan,otherwise it will be characterized as equity and bertelsmann may have liability for copyright infringement in the minds of some lawyers.appellees also pointed to the fact that,by its express terms,the million loan was convertible to equity in napster in lieu of repayment once the licensed digital music distribution system was ultimately launched.finally,appellees showed that bertelsmann used the loan documents in litigation on three occasions to prove it did not control napster.first,bertelsmann relied on the loan documents to claim secured creditor status in the napster bankruptcy proceeding.second,bertelsmann cited the loan documents in its july motion to dismiss to demonstrate that it merely invested in the development of the new licensed digital music distribution system,and did not control napster existing operations.third,bertelsmann used the loan documents in a discovery dispute to show that its interests were not adverse to those of its subsidiary bmg,which was suing napster at the time the loan was made.
under their second fraud theory,appellees contended that bertelsmann,through its lawyers,attempted to defraud the courts by omitting from the loan documents a side agreement that allowed napster to channel some of the million into napster litigation expenses.appellees argued that bertelsmann would benefit if continuing litigation allowed napster existing service to stay operational until the anticipated new system was in place,thereby avoiding dispersion of the customer base.appellees contended that bertelsmann believed that lending funds to napster for use as litigation expenses might expose bertelsmann to vicarious and contributory copyright infringement liability.thus,according to appellees,bertelsmann doctored the loan documents to hide the side agreement from the courts.
appellees pointed to three pieces of direct evidence supporting this second theory of fraud.first,they pointed to an october,email sent by napster ceo hank barry to napster counsel at the law firms of boies,schiller flexner llp and wilson sonsini goodrich rosati wilson sonsini.in the email,barry described an october meeting at which he and napster director john hummer discussed the terms of the million loan with four bertelsmann representatives thomas middelhoff,bertelsmann ceo andreas schmidt,head of bertelsmann ecommerce group oliver schusser,schmidt assistant and aydin caginalp,bertelsmann outside counsel.barry email stated that two s ide deals will not be in the papers.these are the subjects of handshakes between thomas and me,witnessed yesterday by hummer,andreas,aydin caginalp and andreas assistant oliver.according to barry email,one of the side deals allowed napster to use loan proceeds for litigation expenses t he papers will say that the is to be used for development and overhead and g and a general and administrative expenses related to that.we have an agreement that up to may be used for litigation expenses.
second,appellees pointed to a memorandum written on october,by carol timm,a wilson sonsini associate,in which timm described a phone conversation in which she and barry had discussed the terms of the use of the loan proceeds.according to the memorandum,barry told timm the memorandum of terms of the loan would provide that t he loan proceeds will be used to fund the development of the business model outlined above as well as general,administrative and overhead expenses associated with such development.further,barry informed timm that a lthough not expressed in the memorandum of terms or the transaction documents,the parties had verbally agreed that napster could use up to of the proceeds,million toward litigation expenses.according to barry,t his agreement and the handshake was between andreas schmidt and him,and was witnessed by john hummer,aydin caginalp,and oliver schusser.
third,appellees pointed to barry september,deposition testimony in which he described the october,meeting 
t he discussion at the morgan hotel went on for a long time.there came a time in the discussion when i said that i consider overhead and gna general and administrative expenses to include litigation expenses.
schmidt said,it my recollection,schmidt said,well,let have it in a side letter.
aydin caginalp said,no,we not having any side letters.the agreement is what it is.
and i said,okay.i just want everyone to understand that,that i believe that gna and overhead includes litigation expenses.and literally,that was the,that was the entire conversation.it went on for two minutes.
at the end of the meeting,i said to middelhoff,i will endeavor to keep the litigation expenses under million.i just want you to know that.and that was maybe,that was a period of time after we had had the discussion about whether gna and overhead included litigations sic expenses.
q.did anyone at that meeting express the view to you that your understanding regarding litigation expenses was inconsistent with their understanding 
in addition to these three pieces of direct evidence,appellees relied on the circumstantial evidence that bertelsmann changed the loan terms between september,when an initial memorandum of terms was drafted,and october,when the final loan documents were signed.the september memorandum stated that t he loan proceeds will be used for general working capital purposes,primarily to fund the development of the subscription service as outlined above up to of the proceeds may be used for litigation expenses,but none for settlement purposes.an amended october version provided that t he loan proceeds will be used to fund the development of the service as outlined above as well as general,administrative and overhead associated with such development.the final secured promissory note,dated october that t he proceeds of this note shall be used solely to fund the development of a new model for company service as outlined in the umbrella agreement and overhead costs associated with such development.
appellees also pointed to what they contended were lax auditing procedures required by the loan documents.they showed through deposition testimony that napster had in fact used a portion of the million loan proceeds for litigation expenses,and that,when it learned of this use,bertelsmann failed to take any action to prevent it.finally,appellees again pointed to bertelsmann use of the loan documents in the bankruptcy proceeding and in the present litigation.
in its opposition,bertelsmann argued that evidence that it structured a corporate transaction to limit its liability did not prove either that the loan documents were a sham or that they were intended to defraud the courts.bertelsmann further contended that no secret side agreement about litigation expenses existed.it pointed to depositions of meeting attendees aydin caginalp,thomas middelhoff,oliver schusser,and john hummer.all four attendees stated that they did not recall participating in a handshake agreement,though hummer testified that barry told him several days after the meeting that he understood napster could use some of the loan proceeds for litigation expenses.bertelsmann also pointed to a file memorandum prepared on october,by caginalp that referred to one side deal referenced in barry october,email but that did not mention litigation expenses.caginalp wrote that barry did not want this side deal spelled out in the agreement because h e wanted to avoid adverse publicity at the time the new service is announced.
bertelsmann also pointed to statements of bertelsmann executives siegfried luther,erik peper,and michael dornemann,who did not attend the meeting,but testified in their depositions that they did not learn of any side agreement about litigation expenses afterward.in addition,bertelsmann cited the deposition testimony of steven bochner,a partner at wilson sonsini who was napster lead counsel on the deal and timm supervisor,in which bochner denied any awareness of a side agreement.bertelsmann argued,further,that in his deposition barry backed away from his earlier email account of a handshake agreement about litigation expenses.
bertelsmann contended that changes in the language of the loan documents resulted from the course of negotiations,as each party tried to obtain terms favorable to its respective interests.bertelsmann pointed to timm deposition,in which she testified that napster was trying to find language that would give it some flexibility or wiggle room,in terms of its ultimate use of the loan proceeds.bertelsmann argued that its own executives were attempting to negotiate the loan to accommodate the concerns of its subsidiary bmg,which was suing napster,and to stay true to bertelsmann core purpose in making the loan,that is,development of a licensed music distribution system.any discrepancy between the parties interpretation of general loan terms like overhead costs,bertelsmann argued,amounted at most to evidence of a contract dispute,not of a intended to defraud the courts.finally,bertelsmann maintained that even if it had agreed to fund napster litigation expenses,this was not grounds for copyright infringement liability,and that bertelsmann executives and lawyers would not have viewed it as such in,when the loan was made.therefore,bertelsmann argued,appellees failed to prove either the materiality or intent elements of fraud on the court.
on april,the district court issued an order compelling bertelsmann to disclose all communications related to the creation of the loan document and to the submission of that loan document in the bankruptcy proceedings and to this court.the district court held that appellees had made the prima facie case showing of the exception that is required in this circuit,characterizing this requirement as quite lenient.the district court further concluded that,in determining whether the exception applied,it need only consider the evidence offered by the moving party,and that it need not consider conflicting evidence offered by the party seeking to uphold the privilege.
the district court specifically credited three pieces of direct evidence barry october,email timm october,memorandum and barry september,deposition testimony.it also noted appellees circumstantial evidence of bertelsmann interest in keeping napster afloat,and of bertelsmann knowledge of napster use of loan proceeds for litigation expenses.according to the district court,this evidence established that bertelsmann executives and bertelsmann outside counsel cooperated in documenting the investment in napster in a manner contrary to the parties actual understanding,and then submitted the loan document,through its lawyers,both in the bankruptcy litigation and in the litigation before this court.
the district court stated that it would reach the same result even if it considered bertelsmann countervailing evidence.first,it noted that although napster activities had not yet been held illegal on appeal when it was structuring the alleged loan,bertelsmann did not have no reason to be concerned about its liability.because bertelsmann submitted the loan note as evidence in the district court proceedings,and because the district court might have somehow concluded based on the loan document that,as a matter of law,bertelsmann had no financial stake in napster,the district court concluded the secret agreement was material to the litigation.finally,the district court accorded some weight to the deposition testimony of the two wilson sonsini attorneys,of napster director hummer,and of the bertelsmann executives.but it found that the executives corroboration of bertelsmann position was unsurprising,and it held that the whole of bertelsmann countervailing evidence was insufficient to rebut appellees showing.
bertelsmann timely appeals from the district court order,and,in the alternative,petitions for a writ of mandamus.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
under,courts of appeals have jurisdiction over all final district court decisions.however,we also have jurisdiction under over a narrow class of decisions that do not terminate the litigation,but must,in the interest of achieving a healthy legal system,nonetheless be treated as final.digital equip.desktop direct,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in order to be reviewable under the collateral order doctrine,a decision must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d bracketed numbers added.
the first and third prongs of the collateral order test,as articulated in coopers lybrand,are easily satisfied in this case.we have repeatedly held that where,as here,a district court holds,following full development of the issues by the parties,that a privilege has been vitiated,its order constitutes a conclusive determination.see united states griffin,cir holding order vitiating marital privilege is conclusive agster maricopa county,cir same,peer review privilege united states austin,cir same,joint defense privilege see also bittaker woodford,cir en banc reviewing scope of protective order concerning communications in ineffective assistance of counsel habeas petition.we have also recognized that once privileged materials are ordered disclosed,the practical effect of the order is often irreparable by any subsequent appeal.griffin,at internal quotation marks omitted.this case is one of those in which o nce t he cat is already out of the bag,it may not be possible to get back in.agster,at quoting bittaker,at first brackets added.therefore,we hold that the district court order requiring bertelsmann to produce communications represents a conclusive determination that is effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment.
the only debatable issue is whether the second prong has been satisfied.the capitol records appellees concede that it has been.the leiber appellees,however,disagree.they contend that the privilege issue now on appeal is not sufficiently separate from the issues to be resolved in the underlying lawsuit against bertelsmann.in support of this contention,the leiber appellees point out that the application of the exception to the privilege depends upon the characterization of bertelsmann loan to napster,that the outcome of the underlying suit may depend on this characterization,and that the content of the communications may be relevant to the characterization question.despite the concession of the capitol records appellees that the second prong has been satisfied,we regard it as a somewhat close question.
the coopers lybrand articulation of the collateral order doctrine is a gloss on the doctrine as originally articulated in cohen beneficial industrial loan.the court wrote in cohen,this decision appears to fall in that small class which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.id.at.emphasis added.where an interlocutory appeal concerns the protection of the privilege,we have held that the second prong of the coopers lybrand test is satisfied even where there is some potential overlap between questions in the interlocutory appeal and those involved in the underlying suit.that is,we have held in such cases that the second prong is satisfied because,in the words of cohen,the claim of right is too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that we wait until the underlying dispute is fully resolved.
for example,in bittaker woodford the underlying suit was a federal habeas petition brought by a prisoner under sentence of death.the prisoner sought to use communications to show ineffective assistance of trial counsel,but he was afraid that if his habeas petition was successful the state would use these same communications against him on retrial.bittaker,at.the federal district court entered a protective order prohibiting the state from using the communications for any purpose other than the pending habeas litigation.id.at.the state brought an interlocutory appeal,contending that by introducing his communications in the district court the federal habeas petitioner had waived the privilege for all purposes,including his possible criminal retrial.id.we held that the second prong of coopers lybrand had been satisfied even though the content of the communications was directly relevant to the underlying habeas proceeding and might well be relevant if admissible on retrial.id.at see also osband woodford,cir allowing interlocutory appeal of district court protective order the many federal habeas petitioners who each year raise claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and the concomitant issue of waiver of privilege need to know the implications of making such claims,as does the petitioner in this case.
the issue in this interlocutory appeal is whether bertelsmann privilege may be vitiated because bertelsmann used,or intended to use,its counsel to commit a fraud on the courts.the issue in the underlying case is whether bertelsmann is liable for copyright infringement by napster napster users.see griffin,at.we conclude that the privilege issue presented in this interlocutory appeal is completely separate from the merits of the action in the sense intended in coopers lybrand,at.that is,the issue is too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.cohen,at.
because all three prongs of the collateral order test are satisfied,we hold that we have jurisdiction over bertelsmann interlocutory appeal from the district court final production order.because we have jurisdiction over bertelsmann appeal,we need not reach the questions presented by its petition for a writ of mandamus.
iii.standard of review 
several of our sister circuits review district court orders vitiating privilege under the exception for abuse of discretion rather than de novo.see united states laurins,cir see also in re grand jury proceedings,cir.however,we have held that rulings on the scope of the privilege,including the exception,involve mixed questions of law and fact and are reviewable de novo,unless the scope of the privilege is clear and the decision made by the district court is essentially factual in that case only clear error justifies reversal.laurins,at citing united states zolin,cir,vacated in part on other grounds,cir see also in re grand jury subpoena sj,cir stating that in the context w e review de novo whether an evidentiary showing is sufficient quoting in re grand jury investigation,cir.
iv.the exception 
the privilege is the oldest and arguably most fundamental of the common law privileges recognized under federal rule of evidence.see united states zolin,d.the assurance of confidentiality promotes open communications,which are central to the legal system and the adversary process.united states hodge zweig,cir see also zolin,at.the privilege protects fundamental liberty interests by allowing individuals to seek the legal advice they need to guide them through the thickets of complex laws.united states chen,cir.
notwithstanding its importance,the privilege is not absolute.the exception to the privilege protects against abuse of the relationship.hodge zweig,at.as the supreme court wrote in clark united states,the privilege takes flight if the relation is abused.a client who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the commission of a fraud will have no help from the law.he must let the truth be told.id.at.
a party seeking to vitiate the privilege under the exception must satisfy a test.first,the party must show that the client was engaged in or planning a criminal or fraudulent scheme when it sought the advice of counsel to further the scheme.in re grand jury proceedings,at internal quotation marks omitted.second,it must demonstrate that the communications for which production is sought are sufficiently related to and were made in furtherance of the intended,or present,continuing illegality.id.at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added see also in re richard roe,cir.
the attorney need not have been aware that the client harbored an improper purpose.because both the legal advice and the privilege are for the benefit of the client,it is the client knowledge and intent that are relevant.in re grand jury proceedings,at see also chen,at.the planned crime or fraud need not have succeeded for the exception to apply.the client abuse of the relationship,not his or her successful criminal or fraudulent act,vitiates the privilege.in re grand jury proceedings,at.
in determining the proper procedures for deciding whether the exception applies,we bear in mind the importance of the privilege and the potentially irreparable consequences of disclosure.see bittaker,at stating that invalid disclosure may create serious prejudice even at retrial.at the same time,however,we bear in mind that the party challenging the privilege may lack sufficient evidence to prove crime or fraud to a liability standard,particularly given the fact that the best evidence is likely to be in the hands of the party invoking the privilege.see zolin,at.discussing challenges of proving the exception.
despite the fundamental importance and long history of the privilege and the exception,the procedures for preserving the privilege against a challenge are surprisingly unclear.in united states zolin,decided eighteen years ago,the court explained the proper course for a district court addressing a challenge in deciding whether to review communications in camera and whether,after in camera review,to order that the communications be disclosed.the court in zolin recognized that even after its explanation,important questions were left unanswered.
among them were,first,what procedures are to be followed when an order to compel outright disclosure rather than in camera review is at stake second,what is the burden of proof on the party seeking to compel outright disclosure under the exception as to the second question,the court wrote in zolin,with some understatement 
we note that this court use in clark united states,of the phrase prima facie case to describe the showing needed to defeat the privilege has caused some confusion.in using the phrase in clark,the court was aware of scholarly controversy concerning the role of the judge in the decision of such preliminary questions of fact.the quantum of proof needed to establish admissibility was then,and remains,subject to question.in light of the narrow question presented here for review,this case is not the proper occasion to visit these questions.
at.internal citations omitted.despite continuing confusion in the lower courts,the court has not revisited the exception to the privilege since zolin.
the district court tried conscientiously to follow applicable precedent,both of the supreme court and of this court.given the lack of clarity of that precedent,we intend no criticism of the district court when we say that we disagree with its understanding of the applicable law.the two questions relevant to this appeal are subsets of the questions,noted above,that were left unanswered by zolin.first,in a civil case,should the district court consider not only the evidence adduced by the party seeking to vitiate the privilege by invoking the exception,but also the evidence adduced by the party seeking to preserve the privilege second,in a civil case,what is the burden of proof for the party seeking to establish the exception we address these questions in turn.
consideration of evidence 
we begin our analysis with zolin,in which the internal revenue service sought to vitiate the privilege under the exception.the question in zolin was whether a party seeking to establish that the exception applies must rely entirely on sources independent of the disputed communications,or whether a district court may ever honor a request that it conduct in camera review of some of the communications to assist in the determination that the privilege has been vitiated.at.emphasis in original.the court first looked to federal rule of evidence a,which provides that p reliminary questions concerning the existence of a privilege shall be determined by the court in making its determination it is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges.zolin,at.emphasis in zolin.
the court held that rule a did not bar in camera inspection of the communications by the district court.id.at.it further held that because in camera review does not have the legal effect of terminating the privilege,and is thus a smaller intrusion on the privilege than outright disclosure,a lesser evidentiary showing is needed to trigger in camera review than would be necessary ultimately to overcome the privilege.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the court concluded that the district court needs only to require a showing of a factual basis adequate to support a good faith belief by a reasonable person that in camera review of the materials may reveal evidence to establish the claim that the exception applies.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.once that showing is made,the decision whether to engage in in camera review rests in the sound discretion of the district court.id.
there is nothing in zolin specifically indicating whether the party seeking to preserve the privilege has the right to present countervailing evidence before the district court decides whether to conduct an in camera review of the communications.it has been assumed by a number of courts of appeal,including our own,that while nothing forbids the district court from asking for or receiving such countervailing evidence,there is also nothing requiring the district court to do so.see,in re grand jury subpoena sj,at following haines liggett group,cir in re motors,cir.but the procedural posture and consequences of an in camera inspection of the disputed communications are fundamentally different from those of an order requiring their outright disclosure.as the third circuit wrote in haines liggett group,i n camera examination of documents by the court is a comparatively procedural way station.at.by contrast,an order requiring outright disclosure to the adverse party break s the seal of a highly protected privilege.id.accordingly,we explained in in re grand jury investigation that the threshold for in camera review is considerably lower than that for fully disclosing documents.at.neither the appellees nor the appellant in this case requested that the district court conduct in camera review of the disputed communications.
we have never squarely ruled on the question whether a party in a civil case,seeking to preserve the privilege against a challenge,has the right to present countervailing evidence when the district court is deciding whether to order outright disclosure.the case most closely on point is united states laurins,where a criminal defendant argued that the district court had improperly held that the exception applied,and had therefore improperly admitted privileged communications into evidence.at.we wrote that t he evidence presented by the government met the standard for a prima facie case sufficient to justify vitiating the privilege.id.at.while we noted that the district court had made its ruling f ollowing a hearing,we did not discuss whether the district court had considered,or was required to consider,countervailing evidence produced by the party.id.at see also chen,at noting that the district court vitiated privilege a fter considering all the evidence,including that produced by the party.it appears to be an open question in this circuit whether in a civil case a party seeking to preserve the privilege against a challenge has the right to introduce countervailing evidence when the question is not whether to order in camera review but rather whether to order outright disclosure.
we hold that in civil cases where outright disclosure is requested the party seeking to preserve the privilege has the right to introduce countervailing evidence.in so holding,we agree with the decision of judge aldisert for the third circuit in haines.that court wrote 
deciding whether the exception applies is another matter from deciding whether to conduct in camera review.if the party seeking to apply the exception has made its initial showing,then a more formal procedure is required than that entitling plaintiff to in camera review.the importance of the privilege,as we have discussed,as well as fundamental concepts of due process require that the party defending the privilege be given the opportunity to be heard,by evidence and argument,at the hearing seeking an exception to the privilege.
haines,at see also in re motors,at in re feldberg,cir.we are not convinced that in all cases it is necessary for the district court to conduct a live hearing with oral argument in appropriate cases,the court may decide the matter on the papers.but we are convinced,as was the court in haines,that in a civil case the party resisting an order to disclose materials allegedly protected by the privilege must be given the opportunity to present evidence and argument in support of its claim of privilege.see also laser,reliant,discussing and relying on haines.
burden of proof 
the court in zolin adhered to the cryptic statement made more than fifty years earlier in clark that the burden of proof on the party seeking to vitiate a privilege was to make a showing of a prima facie case sufficient to satisfy the judge that the light should be let in.clark,at.although the court specified the burden of proof for cases in which in camera review is at issue,and although it stated that a lesser evidentiary showing is needed to trigger in camera review than is required ultimately to overcome the privilege,zolin,at,the court specifically declined to clarify the meaning of a prima facie case where outright disclosure is sought and to specify the burden of proof applicable to such cases.id.at.
both before and after zolin,the lower courts have struggled with the meaning of prima facie case in cases in which outright disclosure of communications has been sought.in cases in which disclosure of communications to a grand jury has been at issue,the courts of appeals have devised various standards,including probable cause to believe,in re john doe,cir internal quotation marks omitted some foundation in fact,in re grand jury subpoenas,cir reasonable basis,in re grand jury proceedings,cir evidence such as will suffice until contradicted and overcome by other evidence,in re grand jury subpoena,cir internal quotation marks omitted and evidence which,if believed by the,would be sufficient to support a finding that the elements of the exception were met,in re grand jury investigation,cir internal quotation marks omitted.these standards,and the differences between them,are not entirely free from confusion.see,in re sealed case.
the standard in our circuit for grand jury cases is reasonable cause to believe that the attorney services were utilized in furtherance of the ongoing unlawful scheme.in re grand jury proceedings,at quoting in re grand jury proceedings john doe,cir ellipsis in original.we have explained our reasonable cause to believe standard as follows reasonable cause is more than suspicion but less than a preponderance of evidence.chen,at explicating in re grand jury proceedings,at,which stated the standard as less than beyond a reasonable doubt but more than a sneaking suspicion.
in laser industries,reliant technologies,judge brazil concluded,after a thorough and thoughtful discussion,that not only the procedures involving presentation of evidence,but also the standard,may appropriately be different in civil and grand jury cases.at.other courts of appeal have noted that the need for speed and simplicity at the grand jury stage weighs against a standard that requires courts to hear testimony or to determine facts from conflicting evidence before making a determination.in re sealed case,see also in re grand jury investigation,cir if courts always had to hear testimony and conflicting evidence,the rationale behind the prima facie promotion of speed and simplicity at the grand jury be lost.in re antitrust grand jury,cir.the third circuit,which requires that both parties be heard in civil but not in grand jury cases,has explained that the rules of the game are different in grand jury proceedings because of the particular importance of secrecy and of speedy resolution,which might be impeded by adversarial hearings on privilege.in re grand jury subpoena,cir.we express no opinion about whether a district court may consider only the evidence of the moving party in deciding whether to allow presentation of communications to a grand jury.see haines,at laser,at.but we agree with the statement in laser industries that,with respect to burden of proof,different standards may well be appropriate.id.at.
we have never squarely addressed the question whether our reasonable cause to believe standard,applicable in grand jury cases,is also applicable in civil cases.in laurins,a criminal appeal rather than a grand jury case,we wrote without elaboration all the government needed to show was evidence that if believed by the jury would establish the elements of an ongoing violation.at.in united states chen,a grand jury case,we cited this language from laurins,but only after quoting and discussing our established reasonable cause to believe standard applicable in grand jury cases.at.the evidence that if believed language of laurins can be read to mean evidence giving reasonable cause to believe,but the two phrases are not necessarily synonymous.moreover,even if the phrases are synonymous which we tend to think they are not,neither laurins nor chen was a civil case.
for several reasons,we conclude that in a civil case the burden
