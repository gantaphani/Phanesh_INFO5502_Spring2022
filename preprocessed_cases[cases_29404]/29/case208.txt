reversing the district court partial summary judgment in favor of defendants,the panel held that a service that captures copyrighted works broadcast over the air,and then retransmits them to paying subscribers over the internet without the consent of the copyright holders,is not a cable system eligible for a compulsory license under the copyright act.
under of the act,a cable system is eligible for a compulsory license that allows it to retransmit a performance or display of a work that had originally been broadcast by someone else even if such material is copyrighted without having to secure the consent of the copyright holder.so long as the cable system pays a statutory fee to the copyright office and complies with other regulations,it is protected from infringement liability.
the panel concluded that was ambiguous on the question presented.deferring to the copyright office interpretation,the panel held that retransmission services are not eligible for the compulsory license that makes available to cable systems.

we must decide whether a service that captures copyrighted works broadcast over the air,and then retransmits them to paying subscribers over the internet without the consent of the copyright holders,is a cable system eligible for a compulsory license under the copyright act.

this lawsuit pits a group of broadcast stations and copyright holders collectively,fox against an entity now known as filmon x filmon.filmon operates a service that uses antennas to capture broadcast programming,much of it copyrighted,and then uses the internet to retransmit such programming to paying subscribers,all without the consent or authorization of the copyright holders.the supreme court recently held that such a service does perform the retransmitted works publicly,and hence infringes the copyright holders exclusive performance rights.american broad.aereo.fox sued filmon for copyright infringement in in its most recent defense,filmon claims that it is a cable system eligible for a compulsory license under.
the relevant provision of the copyright act defines cable system as follows 
a cable system is a facility,located in any state,territory,trust territory,or possession of the united states,that in whole or in part receives signals transmitted or programs broadcast by one or more television broadcast stations licensed by the federal communications commission,and makes secondary transmissions of such signals or programs by wires,cables,microwave,or other communications channels to subscribing members of the public who pay for such service.for purposes of determining the royalty fee under subsection d,two or more cable systems in contiguous communities under common ownership or control or operating from one headend shall be considered as one system.
f.the parties offer dueling interpretations,each grounded in various aspects of its text,its perceived purposes,and slices of its legislative history.
the district court granted partial summary judgment to filmon,agreeing with it that it qualified as a cable system and was therefore potentially entitled to a compulsory license.the district court based its conclusion on what it took to be the plain meaning of,as well as the supreme court aereo decision,which had analogized retransmission services to cable companies in the course of deciding that internet retransmissions count as performances under the act transmit clause.
recognizing that its ruling involve s a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion,however,the district court authorized an immediate appeal from its decision.we granted fox petition for permission to appeal 
we review de novo both the district court grant of summary judgment and its holdings on questions of statutory interpretation.phoenix mem l hosp.sebelius,cir.but before turning to the parties interpretations of,it is crucial to point out that we do not confront compulsory licensing scheme on a blank slate,because there is an agency interpretation in the background.the copyright office the agency charged with implementing the copyright act has for many years maintained that retransmission services are not cable systems and hence are not eligible for compulsory licenses under.thus,when filmon attempted to pay the fee for retransmitting copyrighted broadcast programming,the office refused to accept filmon filings,citing its position that retransmission services are not covered by.
fox and filmon each claim that the plain meaning of resolves this case in its favor.we will first discuss fox interpretation,then filmon,and only then if we conclude that the meaning of is ambiguous on the question presented will we consider the views of the copyright office.
fox maintains that plain text makes clear that the relevant facility comprises the entire retransmission service both the service means of receiving broadcast signals and its means of making secondary transmissions to the paying subscribers.the copyright office has not endorsed this interpretation.nevertheless,under fox reading,filmon would necessarily be excluded from definition of cable system because filmon retransmits broadcast signals over the internet,and yet the internet is in no sense under its ownership or control.indeed,filmon concedes that it uses a communications channel beyond its facility to make secondary transmissions.that concession,says fox,should decide this case.
fox theory is not implausible.as fox points out,and as filmon does not dispute,a traditional cable system is a facility in this sense it retransmits broadcast signals directly to its subscribers over a transmission path fully within its control.nevertheless,we can not conclude that the statute compels the conclusion that to qualify as a cable system,a retransmission service must encompass or have control over the means it uses to transmit material to paying subscribers.
the most important difficulty with fox interpretation is that it finds insufficient support in the text of the statute.recall the relevant language to be a cable system,a facility must make secondary transmissions of broadcast signals or programs by wires,cables,microwave,or other communications channels.f emphasis added.nothing in that language on its face compels the conclusion that the facility must control the retransmission medium the wires,cables,microwaves,or other communications channels that it relies on to deliver its retransmissions.fox does not cite any specialized or technical meaning,and as a matter of ordinary interpretation,the text could certainly be read the other way.black law dictionary ed.defining by as t hrough the means,act,agency,or instrumentality of.for instance,someone who deposits a letter in a mailbox could certainly be said to transmit his letter by mail,even though he does not control the mail system that actually delivers his letter to its recipient.likewise,it would be reasonable to say that someone makes a transmission of money by wire when he initiates an electronic funds transfer through western union,even though he does not have any possession or control over the wires that transport his money to its destination.indeed,the british soldiers paul revere warned of were certainly making their advance by sea,even though they in no sense controlled the charles river.henry wadsworth longfellow,the landlord tale paul revere ride,reprinted in henry wadsworth longfellow poems and other writings,mcclatchy.
in addition,a specifically discusses a scenario in which one entity selects the content or recipients of a secondary transmission,while a different entity supplies the communications channel.according to that provision,a carrier who provid es wires,cables,or other communications channels for the use of others is not liable for copyright infringement,while the upstream entity who exercises control over the content or selection of the primary transmission or over the particular recipients of the secondary transmission may be liable.a.section a,therefore,suggests that a facility may be said to make secondary transmissions even if it does not exercise ownership or control over the communications channel it uses.if that is true,then filmon lack of ownership or control over the internet does not necessarily exclude it from the class of facilities that make secondary transmissions by wires,cables,microwave,or other communications channels.id.f.
although fox construction has not convinced us,fox can prevail if we defer to the views of the copyright office.filmon urges us not to do so because,filmon insists,the plain meaning of supports its position.filmon strives mightily to demonstrate that the plain meaning of unambiguously entitles it to a compulsory license.
filmon first argues that should be interpreted in a technology agnostic manner.filmon would have us read as making compulsory licenses available to any facility that retransmits broadcast signals or programming,no matter its technological features or characteristics.that position is a poor fit with text and structure.first of all,if congress had intended to service the entire secondary transmission community,doling out statutory licenses without regard to the technological makeup of its members,it would have been easy enough for congress to say so and in fact,congress came very close to doing just that in the transmit clause,as we discuss in the next paragraph.instead,congress specified that applies only to cable systems,and it defined cable system in a detailed,if arguably ambiguous,way.second,and relatedly,if congress meant to sweep in secondary transmission services with indifference to their technological profile,then it was strange for congress to have provided separate compulsory license provisions and for broadcast retransmissions by satellite carriers.the way to prevent discrimination on the basis of technology,one might say,is to stop discriminating on the basis of technology.congress chose a different course.
undeterred,filmon relies on the supreme court recent decision in aereo,which,filmon insists,recognized section technology agnosticism.but aereo did nothing of the sort.aereo dealt with an altogether different provision of the copyright act,the transmit clause,which defines the scope of a copyright holder exclusive right by delineating the class of activities that count as public performances and hence infringe such right.see.significantly,the transmit clause refers in sweeping terms to transmissions or communications made by means of any device or process,and broadly defined device and process to mean one now known or later developed.emphasis added.the glaring textual differences between and render the aereo decision of very little help to filmon argument.moreover,it would be perfectly coherent to pair a broad reading of the transmit clause with a narrow reading of the compulsory license provision,insofar as both such readings would work in tandem to bolster the property interests of copyright holders.nothing in or aereo makes such a reading unreasonable.
we also can not accept filmon assertion that it clearly satisfies requirement that a cable system make secondary transmissions by wires,cables,microwave,or other communications channels.f emphasis added.it is far from clear whether the internet counts as one of the other communications channels envisioned by.for instance,fox expert explained that a communications channel in electrical engineering terms has the characteristics set forth by claude shannon in his seminal paper,communication in the presence of noise.the defining characteristics of a communications channel are bandwidth,noise and throughput.the internet is not a communications channel.
moreover,it would be perfectly reasonable to interpret other communications channels according to the ejusdem generis canon,which instructs that when a statute sets out a series of specific items ending with a general term,that general term is confined to covering subjects comparable to the specifics it follows.hall associates,mattel.invoking such canon,one could reasonably conclude that the other communications channels must share characteristics such as bandwidth,throughput,and noise alternatively,one could conclude,as the copyright office does,that such channels must be inherently localized transmission media of limited availability.either interpretation would imply that the internet is not an other communications channel under.we can not conclude that unambiguously requires otherwise.
nor can we conclude that the copyright act broad purposes compel the conclusion that retransmission services are eligible for compulsory licenses under.rather,we see powerful arguments that such a reading could very well undermine the balance of interests congress attempted to strike when it designed.that is especially so when is viewed in the context of its enactment.
in brief,when congress passed the copyright act of,it overturned two earlier supreme court decisions which had held that cable systems were not liable for copyright infringement on the theory that they did not actually perform the works they retransmitted at all.teleprompter columbia broad,fortnightly united artists television.congress therefore acted to restore a measure of protection to copyright owners.at the same time,however,congress recognized that cable systems served an important public good,by enabling geographically distant and isolated communities to receive broadcasts that would otherwise not reach them.but in the cable industry was a fledgling one cable systems had little market power and little ability to overcome the considerable transaction costs they would incur if they had to negotiate individual licenses directly with copyright owners.congress responded to these economic conditions by enacting,which relieved cable systems of the need to sit down with every copyright holder before retransmitting their copyrighted broadcast works.section also helped protect the infrastructure investments cable systems have undertaken in the years prior to the act.and the broadcast companies and copyright owners benefitted to some extent as well,insofar as they could now reach viewers they would not otherwise have been able to access.fundamentally,however,was congress attempt to balance the socially useful role cable systems had come to play,on the one hand,against the property interests and creative incentives of copyright holders,on the other.
one could reasonably conclude that extending to retransmission services would not further,and might in fact jeopardize,the values just described.for one,cable systems serve limited geographic communities,but an service has no geographic boundary it can retransmit works across the globe instantaneously meaning that retransmission poses a more serious threat to the value and integrity of copyrighted works.such threat is exacerbated insofar as internet retransmissions are more vulnerable than traditional cable to unauthorized copying and other acts of piracy.for another,many copyright owners are capable of transmitting their works over the internet on their own they do not need to rely on third pa
