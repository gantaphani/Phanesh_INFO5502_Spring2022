ticked off that agents of the puerto rico treasury department had seized their adult entertainment machines aems,to save keystrokes,today plaintiffs sued the supposedly responsible parties for damages under,alleging as relevant here violations of the first,fourth,and fourteenth amendments as well as several commonwealth laws.the district court granted defendants summary judgment on the federal claims and dismissed the commonwealth claims without prejudice.and plaintiffs are now here asking us to undo the court ruling.agreeing with some of what they say,we vacate in part,affirm in part,and remand for further proceedings.we will explain our thinking shortly.first,the facts,which we present in the light most favorable to plaintiffs the losers,drawing all supportable inferences in their favor.see,soto padró pub.bldgs,cir.
background 
games people play 
plaintiffs hold licenses from the puerto rico treasury department treasury,for short authorizing them to own and operate aems.plaintiffs are also members of emprecom,a business association of aem owners aems are nothing more than machines found in small businesses liquor stores,gas stations,that are not supposed to award cash prizes winners get bonus games which makes aem games different from gambling machine games more on this later but unscrupulous owners we are told occasionally convert aems into illegal gambling machines say,for instance,slot machines,which is a major worry for treasury.
according to plaintiffs whose account we accept for purposes of review,here is how the suit arose 
sometime in early possibly in february or march the record is not exactly clear plaintiff pablo javier rivera corraliza emprecom president met with treasury secretary and defendant juan carlos puig morales,a big backer of a movement to install terminals islandwide as we understand it,these terminals are noncasino gaming machines that would connect to a system designed to collect tax revenue.anyway,the two had a friendly conversation about issues affecting aems.they,for example,touched on a bill pending in the puerto rico legislature that would require that all aems connect to a central system at treasury for monitoring purposes.and they talked about puig morales desire to go after aem operators holding forged licenses something emprecom applauded.
but puig morales was anything but friendly at a meeting the next month,telling rivera corraliza point blank that every aem was illegal and had to be confiscated.hold on,said rivera corraliza,treasury had issued aem permits yet there are roughly aems out on the streets just go after the holders,he implored puig morales.we see about that was puig morales reply.
treasury started seizing aems around this time.but none belonged to plaintiffs treasury did not start seizing theirs until february,as we will soon see.
around the spring of the record does not reveal when puig morales told plaintiff jaime rodríguez vega emprecom treasurer that aem owners should exchange their machines for the machines of caribbean cage,a company that specializes in gaming systems.puig morales promised to stop the seizures if they made the switch to caribbean cage machines.and puig morales said essentially the same thing to rivera corraliza,telling him that aem owners would not have to worry about seizures if they signed up with caribbean cage.
so rivera corraliza inked a deal with caribbean cage on behalf of emprecom when,we do not know.under the agreement,emprecom members were to provide the venues for the terminals.and caribbean cage promised to pay any fees emprecom members might owe treasury.
in august puig morales issued a letter of intent to negotiate with caribbean cage about installing terminals islandwide.for this to work,though,emprecom and its members had to be on board,as puig morales well knew.but emprecom members became distinctly unhappy when puig morales told emprecom representatives during that same month that they had to pay a license fee for each machine.and when emprecom members balked,puig morales slammed his hand on a desk and screamed that they had until the end of the day to resolve the problem and if they did not,then all their aems would disappear.ultimately for reasons this record does not illuminate the deal between emprecom and caribbean cage fell through and treasury installed no terminals anywhere.
shortly after the meeting,puig morales went on a media campaign to trash aem owners the record does not indicate precisely when the offensive started,though.he told one interviewer,for example,that he hated aems and favored installing terminals throughout puerto rico plaintiffs have not told us when he said this.he told another interviewer that all aems were illegal plaintiffs have not told us when he said that.and he told a third interviewer in february finally,a date that he was going to eliminate the aem industry because neither the governor nor the public supported aems.not willing to take puig morales attacks lying down,rivera corraliza also gave interviews to the media in which he defended aem owners though the record evidence plaintiffs point us to does not say how many interviews he gave and when.
in late or early puig morales appointed defendant abimael rodríguez lópez head of a special treasury task force charged with dealing with aems.when rodríguez lópez was absent,then defendant alfredo pérez rivera was in charge.agents on the task force like defendant victor pérez pillot,for example took an course in how to inspect aems for illegalities.and they went about inspecting aems this way treasury had no manuals or guidelines covering how to inspect aems 
agents identified businesses with aems.and once they got the from rodríguez lópez,they would inspect the aems,examining the licenses and then the machines themselves even if the licenses checked out.in fact,even if the aems exterior looked okay,agents would ask the businesses owners to unlock the machines,and if the owners refused,agents would break the locks open simply on rodríguez lópez,even without probable cause or a search warrant.
defendants milton vescovacci nazario and marisol flores cortés two outside lawyers puig morales had hired to remind agents about the dos and do of aem inspections signed off on the protocol around february.and puig morales signed off on the entire procedure.another treasury official defendant héctor gadea rivera let agents conduct inspections as they had been doing before he came on board on july.and still another defendant rafael diez de andino also signed off on the inspection procedure when he became a deputy director at treasury on september,or so plaintiffs claim but before that,diez de andino who was at treasury,though we not sure what his title was had a hand at least as early as february in telling agents which businesses to inspect.
rivera corraliza is not only emprecom president he is also president of pj entertainment,a corporation that owned aems.early in the morning of february,he got a call from the owner of a liquor store which was then closed saying that agents were seizing some of pj entertainment aems without a warrant.the store was not on the list of businesses to be inspected that day.but diez de andino had ordered pérez pillot to go there.
rivera corraliza got to the scene.just then,puig morales reached him on his cell phone.how are the guys behaving puig morales asked.pérez pillot wants to take the machines rivera corraliza explained,to which puig morales replied,good fellow,good fellow referring to pérez pillot.agents claimed the seized aems had switches,devices that make it possible for players to redeem winnings and for the operators to reset the machines.see part of the games of chance act.a switch is a telltale sign of illegal gambling machines.see id.but rivera corraliza insists that none of his company aems had a device like that.and when he got to inspect the aems months later he allegedly saw that the games had been changed and that some were broken.
over the next few months agents including some of the defendants named here seized more aems belonging to pj entertainment as well as aems belonging to the remaining plaintiffs here is how plaintiffs paint the picture agents inspected aems without warrants,sometimes when the stores were closed.agents checked out an aem interior even if the license seemed in order,breaking the aem lock if the owner refused to open the machine.agents then confiscated aems,contending that the machines had been altered to run like illegal gaming machines one plaintiff claims that an agent,defendant aileen de león garcía,told him that she found nothing illegal after looking inside his aems,but defendant rodríguez lópez had ordered her to take the aems anyway for further investigation.and when plaintiffs later inspected the aems,they saw that the machines had been broken or damaged puig morales told agents to fine only aem owners for any illegalities,not the owners of the businesses housing the aems we will call these establishment owners the rest of the way he also told agents to fine the aem owners per machine.
in plaintiffs or their companies filed suits in a local court the puerto rico court of first instance challenging the forfeiture of aems.plaintiffs,however,point us to nothing in the record indicating how the suits turned out.
going for broke 
following these events plaintiffs sued defendants in puerto rico federal district court for money damages under section the statute that at the risk of oversimplification provides a civil remedy for state action that deprives persons of federal statutory or constitutional rights.see klunder brown,cir.essentially plaintiffs accused defendants of violating the fourth amendment provisions by doing baseless inspections and confiscations,infracting the fourteenth amendment clause by not offering predeprivation hearings,and defying the fourteenth amendment clause by treating them differently from the establishment owners rivera corraliza and rivera corraliza only also accused defendants of retaliating against him for exercising his first amendment right to free speech.and plaintiffs all asserted supplemental claims,which mirrored their claims.
after some discovery defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing among other grounds that a they never violated any of plaintiffs constitutional rights but if they had offended plaintiffs and rights,they were entitled to qualified immunity and that b they should get judgment as a matter of law on the state claims.plaintiffs opposed.taking up the motion,the district court ruled,relevantly,as follows on the claim,the court found defendants actions constitutional under the exception to the warrant requirement and even if not,defendants were qualifiedly immune because they violated no rule.and,the court added,given the commonwealth need to act quickly to protect the public from apparently illegal aems,the postdeprivation remedies offered satisfied the minimal requirements of due process.plaintiffs claim misfired,the court said,because aem owners and establishment owners are not similarly situated.as for rivera corraliza claim,the court found he had failed to show how his talking to the press substantially motivated defendants to act as they did.so the court granted defendants summary judgment on the claims and then relinquished jurisdiction over the claims.
which brings us to today,with plaintiffs asking us to vacate the district court judgment and remand for a trial on all claims.
important concepts to keep in mind 
before tackling plaintiffs arguments,we make a few preliminary comments 
summary judgment basics 
as always,we give fresh review to the district court ruling,affirming if there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact even after giving plaintiffs the benefit of all reasonable inferences in the record and defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.a see also morelli webster,cir.and we may affirm a summary judgment on any ground supported by the record,even one not relied on by the court below.see,geshke crocs,cir boveri town of saugus,cir.
qualified immunity basics 
the defense is in play on two claims,do forget the claim and the claim.and to overcome that defense plaintiffs must make a showing that a defendants violated a statutory or constitutional right and that b the right was clearly established at the time.see,city cnty.of sheehan,d,mcgrath tavares,cir.the step requires plaintiffs to identify controlling authority or a robust consensus of persuasive authority such that any reasonable official in the defendant position would have known that the challenged conduct is illegal in the particular circumstances that he or she faced precedent,in other words,must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.plumhoff rickard,d quoting ashcroft,d accord rocket learning,rivera sánchez,cir.courts penalize officers for violating bright lines,not for making bad guesses in gray areas.see maciariello sumner,cir see also.at kennedy,concurring emphasizing that qualified immunity applies if defendants have no fair and clear warning of what the constitution requires quoting united states lanier,d.
if plaintiffs stumble at either step taken in any order we like,see pearson callahan,d their and claims go kaput,see quintero de quintero aponte roque,cir noting that when a defendant invokes qualified immunity,the burden is on the plaintiff to show the inapplicability of the defense.also and importantly,judges are free to jump directly to and decide the case exclusively on the step in certain situations.see camreta greene,d.examples of when judges should follow that course include if dealing with the step requires uncertain assumptions about state law or creates a risk of bad decisionmaking because the briefs are bad if discussing both steps risks bad decisionmaking because the court may believe the law is not clearly established and so give little thought to whether the constitutional right exists and if the canon of constitutional avoidance counsels against focusing on the step because it is plain that a constitutional right is not clearly established but far from obvious whether in fact there is such a right.pearson,d accord kerns bader,cir discussing pearson and camreta.reduced to simplest terms,courts should think hard,and then think hard again,before turning small cases into larger ones,see camreta.at sage words,indeed.
now on to plaintiffs claims.
our take on the case 
search and seizure claim 
first up is plaintiffs claim that defendants warrantless searches and seizures violated the fourth amendment applied to puerto rico by the fourteenth.for their part defendants insist that they are shielded from this claim by qualified immunity,arguing that they acted pursuant to the exception to the warrant requirement,meaning they violated no fourth amendment right let alone any fourth amendment right.
administrative searches 
for anyone unfamiliar with administrative searches,here a quick primer 
the fourth amendment protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures.see const.amend.iv.it also says that no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause.id.reasonableness is the amendment central command,however,see kentucky king,d,with reasonableness determined by weighing the government need for the search against the degree of intrusion into a citizen privacy interests,see,camara mun.court of city cnty.of,d ruskai pistole,cir.
this amendment covers searches of homes and commercial premises,our judicial superiors tell us.see,city of los angeles patel,wl,at june,new york burger,d.and staying with commercial premises,we know that because the government has a heightened interest in regulating commerce,persons running commercial premises have a lessened expectation of privacy.united states maldonado,cir citing burger,at.yet even when a search is done to enforce a regulatory scheme,a warrant is often required though in that situation,the probable cause of which the fourth amendment speaks can be something less than probable cause to believe the law is being violated.see,marshall barlow,d explaining that for purposes,probable cause justifying the issuance of a warrant may be based on a showing that reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an inspection are satisfied with respect to a particular establishment second and third alterations in original quoting camara,at.
but because reasonableness is the standard,the supreme court has approved certain exceptions to the fourth amendment warrant and requirements in compelling situations.see,brigham city stuart,d burger,at.one is for searches of businesses.the idea is that when an entrepreneur embarks upon such a business,he has voluntarily chosen to subject himself to a full arsenal of governmental regulation,and thus a warrantless search to enforce that regulatory regime is not unreasonable.marshall,at searches of this sort can affect an infinite number of people and places,obviously.so to stop inspectors from running amok,several things are critical.the first is that the government have a substantial interest in regulating the business.the next is that warrantless inspections further this interest.and the third is that the regulations offer a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant by giving notice to those regulated and limiting the inspectors discretion in time,place,and scope.burger,at internal quotation marks omitted.collectively,these factors a business,a substantial government interest in regulating the business,administrative searches that advance this interest,and a regulatory scheme that prescribes alternative safeguards make up what we call the burger test 
judges must never forget that while the constitution okays warrantless searches in some situations,it never okays unreasonable ones also,the burger test is a screen that we and all courts must jealously protect lest this particular exception destroy the fourth amendment 
reader alert 
shifting from the general to the specific,we next talk about the burger test in the context of this case,eventually noting how the district court never explicitly addressed whether the relevant regulatory regime provides an acceptable warrant substitute.the absence of an express analysis here leaves a critical gap in the ruling,because the presence or not of an adequate warrant affects whether defendants violated plaintiffs fourth amendment rights and whether any such rights were clearly established when they acted.believing it better to have the benefit of the district court judgment on this issue in the first instance,we for reasons shortly stated ultimately remand the matter.
pervasive regulations 
our parties spar quite a bit over whether aems are part of a undertaking.the test for whether an industry fits that bill is whether the state regulatory presence is so pervasive that business owners can not help but know that their commercial properties may be periodically inspected for specific purposes.see burger,at.burger upheld the warrantless inspection of a junkyard records,permits,and autos.id.at.in doing so the court found that auto junkyards fit within the definition of closely regulated for these reasons the regulatory scheme required junkyard owners to get licenses and registration numbers from the state display the registration numbers prominently at the businesses keep books recording purchases and sales of autos and auto parts and make the books and autos available for inspection.id.at.junkyard owners could also get hit with criminal penalties,license revocation,and civil fines if they failed to comply.id.at.
with this in mind,now consider the following 
the games of chance act,also called the gambling act.this act singles out as unlawful all games of chance.a familiar example of a game of chance is a slot machine id.as for aems,they are legal.id.and the act defines aems as those machines that do not have mechanisms or apparatus that are characteristic of gambling machines a.the act says that when aems are located and operated in a business authorized therefor,the permit for their use shall establish that they must be located at a distance of over two hundred meters from a public or a private school or from a church or congregation that seeks spiritual serenity,a serious operating restriction,for sure.the act also tells the treasury secretary to establish the necessary procedure to ensure that every machine to be authorized as an aem machine is personally evaluated and certified to be an aem by the appropriate treasury agents.id.the act lets the treasury secretary hit aem owners with administrative fines ranging from to for each violation of the act.a.and the act makes it a felony for anyone either to prevent agents from inspecting the places for the purpose of conducting investigations under the act or to admit or encourage persons under age to operate aems.id.b.
treasury regulation.that regulation designed to among other things implement the provisions of the games of chance act covers a lot of ground too.to get a flavor of what this provision is about,we note that the regulation deals with things like what documents are needed to get aem licenses criminal background and debt certificates,and sworn statements from establishment owners promising not to let persons under use aems.it says where to file the papers at a district office near the applicant place of business,for example.it lists the yearly license fee for each aem.it mentions how the license must be available for inspection by treasury agents and where aems must have identifying tag s on their upper right side.and it discusses when the treasury secretary may deny,suspend or revoke a license if,for instance,a license holder or its representative prevents the secretary from inspecting the place of business or examining the relevant documents,books,records or reports.see reg,certified english translation,at.
the internal revenue code.the code empowers the treasury secretary to examine documents,assets,and inventories tied to activities subject to the taxes and fees under the commonwealth internal revenue code and to also s eize and sell at public auction or destroy any device whose operation is illegal under the games of chance act.see a,g 
the uniform administrative procedure act.this statute declares that agencies like treasury can conduct inspections without a prior order to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations within the agencies domain.see.
and federación operadores de máquinas de entretenimiento,puerto rico.after canvassing the relevant statutory and regulatory mosaic,this decision from puerto rico intermediate appellate court issued when defendants were still in the throes of investigating plaintiffs aems says that the aem business is closely regulated.see wl,civ.no.tca,certified english translation,slip op.at,
fairly viewed,this regime is at least as if not more pervasive than the one governing junkyards in burger so we agree with the district court that reasonable officials in defendants shoes could believe that the aem industry qualifies as closely regulated,at least at the time they acted.
faced with this concatenation of circumstances,plaintiffs offer a creative argument.stripped to its bare essence,they contend that businesses are only those businesses that deal with devices that could endanger lives,guns or that can serve as a fence for stolen goods,auto junkyards.and,they add,aems fit neither category.but they cite no authority for this limiting proposition probably because businesses identified as closely regulated when defendants acted include those that are not inherently dangerous to persons like,for example,auto junkyards and that do not function as fences for thieves like,for instance,daycares.that is a very big deal,because plaintiffs had the burden of showing that clearly established law when defendants searched the aems in put reasonable officials on notice that aems were not closely regulated,see mcgrath,at a burden plaintiffs obviously have not come close to satisfying,as we just noted 
state interest 
plaintiffs cite zero cases showing that reasonable officials in defendants position would have believed that the regulatory scheme serves no substantial government interest.this is hardly a surprise given how caselaw,caselaw as of stressed that the commonwealth interest in the health,safety,and welfare of its citizens constitutes a substantial governmental interest and that regulating gambling lies at the heart of the state police power to further important goals like protecting the health,welfare,safety,and morals of its citizens.together these cases suggest as the district court implicitly found that reasonable persons in defendants boots could have concluded the commonwealth has a significant interest in stopping persons from converting legal aems into illegal gambling machines,thereby keeping citizens from becoming gambling addicts 
interest advancement 
plaintiffs also do not say how reasonable officials in the circumstances confronted by each defendant and given the law as of would have reasonably thought that warrantless inspections do not advance the state interest.maybe this is because the law books are of cases stressing how surprise is an important component of an efficacious inspection regime.maldonado,at accord gonsalves,at.just look at biswell,a case the district court relied on.the statute there required all licensed gun dealers to keep certain records.it also let officials enter the dealers premises without a warrant to examine not only the records but also any firearms kept on the premises.see at.and when all was said and done,the court held that inspections could not assure that weapons are distributed through regular channels and in a traceable manner and make possible the prevention of sales to undesirable customers and the detection of the origin of particular firearms if inspectors had to schedule inspections in advance or conduct them only with warrants.id.at see also dewey,at highlighting congress conclusion that given the notorious ease with which many safety or health hazards may be concealed if advance warning of inspection is obtained,a warrant requirement would seriously undercut this act objectives.but again,plaintiffs put up no serious fight on whether the state interest justifies warrantless inspections.
warrant substitute 
instead plaintiffs spend much energy emphasizing how in their opinion the last burger requirement that the scheme serve as a warrant equivalent is not satisfied because neither the statutes nor the regulations limit the timing and scope of the agents activities.at holding that to be an adequate substitute for a warrant,the scheme must perform the two basic functions of a warrant let owners know that the inspections are made pursuant to law,and be carefully limited in time,place,and scope internal quotation marks omitted.as a result,they add,agents can barge into establishments,break aems locks,and inspect the machines whenever and however they please.not so,defendants insist.the scheme,they say,cabins the agents discretion because to quote their brief it tells aem owners that the business is subject to inspection and who will conduct the same.
dealing with timing issues can be tricky business.courts have okayed schemes limiting inspections to regular and usual business hours,see burger,at,all reasonable times,see biswell,at,and all reasonable hours,see gonsalves,at.our litigants direct us to no statutory or regulatory language like that here.and we see none.
still,a regime may pass the burger test even if there are no time limits context is key,with precedent out there in okaying schemes with no timing limits if such limits would make inspections unworkable.see,united states ponce aldona,cir upholding a regulatory regime authorizing inspections of commercial trucks with no time restrictions finding t ime restrictions are not feasible because trucks operate hours a day,noting i f inspections were limited to daylight hours,for instance,trucks trying to avoid inspection could simply travel at night,and collecting loads of additional cases.what matters then is whether the problems that triggered the aem regulations are limited to certain hours,like business hours.see,united states dominguez prieto,cir noting limitation on searches of commercial carriers would render the entire inspection scheme unworkable and meaningless.
the difficulty here,however,is that the district court was silent on the timing issue.ditto for defendants.as for plaintiffs,they insist the regime has no time limits.but like defendants,they say nothing about whether timing restrictions would or would not make the inspection regime unworkable.and the district court said nothing about this issue as well.these omissions are significant because an answer on the timing question is critical for resolving either step in the qualified immunity analysis,whether defendants violated plaintiffs constitutional rights,and,if so,whether those rights were clearly established at the time of the incident again,if plaintiffs satisfy both steps of the inquiry,then they can defeat that defense.
similar problems plague the important scope issue.important,because a valid inspection regime requires certainty and regularity of application.burger,at.and if the regime offers no rules governing the procedure that agents must follow,the fourth amendment and its various restrictive rules apply,colonnade catering,at.examples of inspection schemes deemed sufficiently narrow in scope when our defendants acted include 
colonnade catering,where the statute let agents enter the premises of liquor dealers for the purpose of examining articles or objects subject to tax though the high court stressed that the statute did not empower agents to forcibly go into areas without a warrant but rather made it a criminal offense not to let inspectors in.see at,quoting a.
biswell,where the statute let officials enter the premises of gun dealers for the purpose of inspecting or examining any records or documents required to be kept,and any firearms or ammunition kept or stored.see at quoting g.
burger,where the statute let agents examine the records of junkyard operators and any vehicles or parts of vehicles on the premises that are subject to the statute record keeping requirements.see at quoting veh.traf.law.
and gonsalves,where the statute let agents enter facilities to determine whether any of the provisions of this chapter are being violated,and to secure samples or specimens.see at quoting laws.
the problem in our case is that the district court did not focus serious attention on the scope issue,even though it is like timing an essential consideration in deciding either step in the analysis.yes,as defendants note,the regime tells aem owners that agents can inspect licenses and other records.see reg,certified english translation,at.and yes,as defendants also note,the regime tells persons that agents can inspect assets tied to activities subject to taxation under a provision of the commonwealth internal revenue code.see a.but defendants point to nothing no statute,regulation,or rule that explains either how agents can open aems or how they can and should go about inspecting them once opened and if no such provision exists,the commonwealth scheme fails to furnish even the minimal specificity needed to let an aem owner know that the inspections to which he is subject do not constitute discretionary acts by a government official.burger,at.
our solution 
given these serious gaps in the record and the parties briefs,it makes perfect sense to remand the case so the district court can with counsel help work on these timing and scope matters in the context a tack taken by other circuits in similar circumstances,by the way.see,kerns,at citing and quoting distiso town of wolcott,fed.app x,cir unpublished.this approach will let the adversarial process work through the problem,resulting in a considered lower court decision a decision that will,importantly,reduce the risk of an improvident governing appellate decision from us.id and not willing to make uncertain assumptions about the law we are doubly persuaded that this is the right course,given how complex the issues are and how the parties briefs missed some of the legal nuances presented by this case see kerns,at.
in remanding to get the district court thoughts on the crucial timing and scope issues,we offer this reminder to defeat a defense here,plaintiffs must show that defendants violated their fourth amendment rights and that those rights were clearly established at the time.see,sheehan.at.repeating what we said earlier,courts may and sometimes should decide claims based solely on the second step holding that the contours of the right were not clearly established,without deciding whether there was a constitutional violation.see,pearson,at.if the district court goes that route,both the court and the parties should be ever mindful that the inquiry is highly,turning on whether it would be clear to reasonable officers in defendants positions that their actions violated the fourth amendment,see,rocket learning,at,and that defendants positions run the gamut from policymakers to advisors to supervisors to implementers.we also leave it to the court on remand to resolve codefendants gadea rivera,diez de andino,vescovacci nazario,and flores cortés argument that they had no personal involvement in any alleged constitutional violation,as required by section.
so a vacate and remand on this claim it is but before we shift our focus to plaintiffs next claim,we wish to make one thing crystal clear although patel does not apply in this case because of the overlay,we note that the law governing administrative searches continues to develop and that the bench and bar must be on the look for situations where patel does hold sway.
due process claim 
plaintiffs believe defendants violated their federal rights by not giving them hearings before seizing the aems.again asserting qualified immunity,defendants counter that they had to act quickly because the aems appeared to be operating illegally and that meaningful postdeprivation remedies are all the process that is due.
we begin with the basics.normally due process requires notice and a hearing of some sort before the government takes away property the state,in other words,usually must say what it intends to do and then give affected persons the chance to speak out against it.see,zinermon burch,d commons condo.ass charlie arment trucking,cir.normally and usually are words that suggest exceptions.and that is the case in this corner of the law,because due process is a flexible concept not governed by any r igid taxonomy.see respectively morrissey brewer,d gonzález droz gonzález colón,cir see also cafeteria rest.workers union mcelroy,d san gerónimo caribe project,acevedo vilá,cir en banc elena municipality of san juan,cir.as a,one exception the one defendants rely on is that the state need not give preseizure process if a doing so would defeat the point of the seizure like when the property could be moved,concealed,or destroyed if advance notice is given and b there is adequate postseizure process.see calero toledo pearson yacht leasing,d see also zinermon,at mathews eldridge,d commons condo.ass n,at.
plaintiffs right to preseizure process an issue on which they bear the burden,see,aponte torres of,cir turns on whether the process is a reasonable requirement to impose.and that requires comparing the benefit of the procedural protection sought which involves the value of the property interest at issue and the probability of mistaken deprivations if the protection is not provided with the cost of the protection this is known in legal circles as the mathews test.see,united states james daniel good real,d discussing mathews clukey town of camden,cir ditto.dooming plaintiffs claim is their failure to say anything on this test,giving us zero case analysis to help us see how this comparison would shake out.what they have done is not the type of serious effort needed on a complex issue especially when their briefs present a slew of other legally intricate claims.and we will not do their work for them.see,e,united states zannino,cir.so their complaint about not getting preseizure process is waived.see,rodríguez municipality of san juan,cir.
ever persistent,plaintiffs have a fallback position even if the postseizure remedy they invoked challenging the seizures in commonwealth court is all the process due them,the aems poor condition missing games,torn cables,has left them unable to prove the aems legality meaning the theory goes that defendants robbed them of their rights.plaintiffs argument goes nowhere,and fast,because they point us to no competent evidence like an affidavit showing that the aems condition has kept or will keep them from having meaningful postseizure hearings a foundation less allegation in their brief certainly is not evidence.see,tropigas de,certain underwriters at lloyd of london,cir making clear that we afford no evidentiary weight to conclusory allegations,empty rhetoric,or unsupported speculation,or evidence quoting rogan city of boston,cir see also generally kelly united states,cir pointing out that r hetoric,unsupported by facts,remains only rhetoric,even if stridently proclaimed.to move beyond summary judgment on this fallback theory,plaintiffs had to back up their allegation with evidence that creates a material dispute requiring trial.but all they have given us is an allegation,which again does not cut it.see,tropigas de,at.
please take note,though we are deeply repeat,deeply troubled by the damage done to the confiscated machines.and the parties should know that we might have reached a different conclusion on the question if plaintiffs had not waived the argument by failing to develop it.
equal protection claim 
we turn then to plaintiffs claim,which in essence is this puig morales fined them but not the establishment owners over the illegal aems,the intention being to punish plaintiffs for opposing the installation of terminals,his pet project a violation,plaintiffs conclude.defendants fight tooth and nail against this argument,spending a good deal of time trying to persuade us that the aem owners and the establishment owners are sufficiently similar to require equal treatment.
all agree that principles require government actors to treat like persons alike.see,aponte ramos álvarez rubio,cir.all agree that given the theory they have picked to get past summary judgment,plaintiffs must show selective treatment compared with others similarly situated based on impermissible considerations,like intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights,or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.rubinovitz rogato,cir quoting yerardi moody rest.lounge bd.of selectman,cir see also aponte ramos,at barrington cove.hous.mortg.fin,cir.and all agree that to carry their burden on the front,plaintiffs must show an extremely high degree of similarity between themselves and the persons to whom they compare themselves.cordi allen conlon,cir quoting clubside,valentin,cir.a precise correlation is not necessary,though plaintiffs must muster sufficient proof on the relevant aspects of the comparison to warrant a reasonable inference of substantial similarity.id.adding that while normally the similarly situated determination is grist for the jury mill,a judge can dispose of an claim via summary judgment if plaintiffs fail to shoulder their burden on this critical issue.
plaintiffs stumble on the requirement i,that they show a satisfactory comparator who was similarly situated and yet treated differently.the of their argument is the idea that puig morales acted maliciously by fining them as punishment for not backing his pet project given their theory,and keeping in mind that a comparator must be similarly situated in all relevant respects,id.at,the appropriate pool must be composed of people who should have been fined for the supposedly illegal aems with the different treatment being leniency for those who did oppose the project,plaintiffs argue at least implicitly.as for their suggestion that the establishment owners populate the pool,we see a serious problem 
plaintiffs never develop the legal basis for concluding that puig morales could have fined the establishment owners.as we mentioned many pages ago,a puerto rico statute provides that t he secretary shall impose an administrative fine on the owner of not less than five thousand dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars for each violation of the games of chance act a.secretary means the treasury secretary.c.and o wner means the person who owns the adult entertainment machine.f.not a word in section a says that the secretary can fine establishment owners and plaintiffs never stop to confront this provision they never explain,for example,how the secretary can fine establishment owners in the face of that section litigants should know by now that it is not for us to create arguments for someone who has not made them or even to assemble them from assorted hints and references scattered throughout the brief.yeomalakis fdic,cir.clearly then,any argument tied to puig morales fining powers is waived.see,rodríguez,at.
the upshot is that plaintiffs have not carried their burden of proving substantial similarity.so their claim is a.
speech retaliation claim 
that takes us to rivera corraliza claim that defendants seized pj entertainment aems as payback for his speaking out about puig morales vendetta against aem owners.to get anywhere he of course must show that his exercise of speech was a substantial or motivating factor behind defendants actions.see gonzález droz,at.c lose temporal proximity between a plaintiff protected activity and the state retaliatory conduct can raise an inference of causation.see id.at.the key word in that last sentence at least so far as this case is concerned is close.see id.at discussing caselaw holding a several month gap between protected speech and supposedly retaliatory conduct insufficient to prove causation.
rivera corraliza thinks close proximity exists here,saying in his opening brief that he continued calling puig morales out in the press through the beginning of and,remember,defendants started grabbing pj entertainment aems in february.but rivera corraliza does not identify any record facts to support his completely conclusory proximity assertion.basically he invites us either to treat what he says as true or to comb the record without his help to confirm his story.we decline the invitation.see rodríguez machado shinseki,cir per curiam reminding everyone that we appellate j udges are not like pigs,hunting for truffles buried in the record alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.his claim is therefore waived.see,metro.prop.cas.ins.shan trac,cir citing zannino,at.
local law claims 
one last issue.because we vacate the entry of summary judgment on the claim and remand for proceedings in line with this opinion,the district court should reinstate the claims.see rodríguez,at cir.if the court again jettisons the claim before trial,it of course can reassess whether to keep jurisdiction over the claims.see id.at.

plaintiffs also alleged that defendants actions violated the eighth amendment clause yet another claim the district court dismissed on summary judgment.plaintiffs have not argued that the court got that ruling wrong.so we say no more about it.
